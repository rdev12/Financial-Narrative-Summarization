mutual benefit of both milk suppliers and
the Group. This partnership approach will
enable us and our milk suppliers to deal
more effectively with the dairy reforms of
the Common Agricultural Policy (‘CAP’)
currently being implemented.
In August 2006, the Group will reach
its tenth anniversary as a quoted company
on the London Stock Exchange. The
Group has grown significantly since 1996
and delivered good long-term returns to
shareholders, significantly ahead of the
FTSE250 Index, both through share price
appreciation and dividend growth. This
successful performance reflects both the
robustness of our long-term strategy to
develop the branded and added value
side of the business and the dedication
and hard work of our employees.
Simon Oliver, Chairman
23 May 2006
Dairy Crest has performed well in the
second half of the year ended March
2006, despite the difficult overall trading
environment, and reported full year
adjusted profit before taxation of £67.7
million, in line with expectations, on
revenue of £1,424.2 million (including
share of joint ventures) and adjusted
earnings per share of 40.3 pence.
Reported profit before taxation was
£41.3 million.
The Board is recommending an
increase in the final dividend of 6.3% to
15.2 pence per share. This, together with
the interim dividend of 6.3 pence, makes
a total dividend for the year of 21.5
pence per share, an increase of 6.4%.
The Board remains committed to a
progressive dividend policy.
The focus of the Group’s strategy
continues to be on growing the added
value and branded side of the business,
which we have supported by increased
levels of marketing expenditure and new
product launches. The success of this
strategy has been evident in our Foods
division, which has had another good
year with a strong performance from a
number of the key brands including
Cathedral City, Clover, Country Life and
the Yoplait brands. In the Dairies division
the performance reflects the adverse
impact on the retail milk business from
last year’s supply changes in the fresh
milk sector. The household side of the
Dairies division has continued to perform
well, generating good profits and cash for
the Group. Our Dairies division has been
strengthened by strategic acquisitions
and volume realignment across our
operations. We are also investing to
develop a branded position with the
launch of St. Ivel advance. Taken as a
whole, these management actions and a
better balance of industry supply and
demand should lead to an improved
performance by the Dairies division in
2006/07.
We continue to value the strong
relationship that we have built up with our
milk suppliers and in particular, Dairy
Crest Direct, our direct milk supply
association. During the year, the number
of direct suppliers has risen to over
1,600 representing over 70% of our
milk requirements. Our close working
relationship is built on trust, transparency,

Overview
The Group has delivered results in line
with expectations despite the challenging
trading environment and high oil-related
costs. In particular, after a difficult first
half, we performed well in the second
half of the year with profits up on the
second half of last year as well as
significantly up on the first half of this
year. The focus of the Group’s strategy
continues to be on growing the added
value and branded side of the business,
which we have supported with increased
levels of marketing expenditure partly
funded through increases in operational
efficiencies. We have also been active in
new product development, with an
emphasis on the functional food area
including the launch of St. Ivel advance
and St. Ivel Gold with Omega 3.
Financial results
Group revenue (including our share of
joint ventures’ revenue) was £1,424.2
million (2005: £1,348.8 million). Adjusted
profit before tax (including share of joint
ventures and before exceptional items
and amortisation of acquired intangibles)
was £67.7 million (2005: £75.7 million),
mainly reflecting reduced profits in our
Dairies division. After deducting £22.4
million of exceptional items, £1.0 million of
acquired intangible amortisation and £3.0
million of tax on joint ventures, profit
before tax was down 41% at £41.3
million (2005: £70.2 million). Exceptional
items include a £9.3 million non-cash
impairment charge on the assets and
goodwill of our Stilton and speciality
cheese business. Adjusted earnings per
share decreased to 40.3 pence per share
(2005: 43.9 pence). 
Group net debt as at 31 March 2006
was £52.7 million higher at £280.2 million
(2005: £227.5 million) reflecting, in
particular, the acquisitions in the Dairies
division during the year.
Continued development of brands
Over the last few years the Group has
significantly increased the level of
marketing support for its portfolio of
brands and is now one of the leading
advertisers in the UK food sector. Future
marketing investment is expected to
grow at a reduced rate with additional
investment primarily being targeted at
supporting our active programme of new
product development. During the year,
we invested in new television advertising 
for Cathedral City, Country Life, St. Ivel
advance and St. Ivel Gold. Both
Cathedral City and Country Life have
performed particularly strongly, benefiting
from this support, and both continue to
provide good growth opportunities for
the Group within their respective
markets. Cathedral City is now worth
£106 million at retail value, strengthening
its position as the UK’s biggest cheddar
brand. This strong brand presence in
cheese will help to offset any downward
pressure on market pricing in 2006/07
that may arise from higher industry
cheese stocks. 
During the year, there has been
continued focus on our new product
development activity. Much of this effort
has been on moving into the high-value
functional foods area within the dairy
category, with particular emphasis on
Omega 3. In May 2005 we launched St.
Ivel advance, a branded fresh milk
enriched with Omega 3. While it is still at
an early stage of development, volumes
and sales are encouraging and the brand
has now achieved high levels of trade
distribution in the major retailers. In
January 2006, we launched St. Ivel Gold
spread with Omega 3 together with new
packaging and new television advertising.
Chief Executive’s review
Drummond Hall
Chief Executive
“We expect our brand
portfolio, supported
by marketing
investment and
further new product
development, to
continue to make
good progress”
4609_DC_p2-5_AW.qxd  7/6/06  11:37 am  Page 4 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 5
St. Ivel Gold, despite having a more
difficult year, will continue to be our
platform for further new product
development in the Health sector of the
Butter and Spreads market. 
Other products launched during the
year included Country Life Lightly Salted
and ‘Over the Moon’, a speciality
blended cheese brand. More recently, in
May 2006, we have launched Cathedral
City Mild to capitalise further on the
exceptional performance from the
Cathedral City brand and help grow this
brand across the wider cheddar
category. Yoplait Dairy Crest has again
launched new products within its brand
portfolio including Petits Filous Plus, a
probiotic drinking yogurt for children. 
Since the Group floated ten years
ago, we have consistently focused on a
strategy of building profitable brands
both organically and through acquisition.
As a result, our brands now represent a
significant proportion of Group
profitability. In 2005/06 the percentage of
Group contribution (profit on operations
before indirect overhead allocation)
derived from brands (including joint
ventures) was 56%.
Dairies position strengthened
This year’s performance of the Dairies
division reflects the impact of industry
supply changes in 2004 and 2005. In
particular, the major retail fresh milk
business was impacted by the loss of
the Tesco fresh milk supply position from
April 2005. During the year, the Group
has been focusing on improving
profitability and developing a robust and
sustainable future for this division.
Notably, we were pleased to win
additional fresh milk volumes for
Morrisons, which we began to supply at
the end of October 2005. In May 2005
the Group made the strategic
acquisitions of Midlands Co-op Dairies
and the Foston dairy (Starcross Foods)
to strengthen the Dairies business and
extend its distribution capabilities
northwards. These acquisitions have
now been fully integrated into our
business on time and to plan. The
Midlands Co-op Birmingham dairy was
closed at the end of February 2006 with
volume transferred to Foston as well as
other Dairy Crest sites. All our dairies are
now operating at good levels of capacity
utilisation.
The Dairies division has again
benefited from the strong performance
of the household business, which
continues to be profitable and cash
generative. The acquisitions of both
Midlands Co-op Dairies and Arla’s
London Foodservice business have
strengthened the business in both the
doorstep operations and in the middle
ground. There are still good opportunities
for rationalisation within the household
sector and we are expecting another
good performance in 2006/07 following
last year’s acquisitions.
There is now a better balance of
supply and demand in retail fresh milk
after several site closures across the
industry, although some uncertainty
has been created by the reduction
in supermarket retail milk prices in
March 2006.
Whilst margins in our liquid products
business have been unsatisfactory, they
are starting to improve. In January 2006
the Group achieved price increases on
fresh milk with the major retailers to
offset higher oil-related input costs. More
recently, we have reduced the raw milk
price going into our liquid dairies to reflect
lower commodity cream prices. At the
same time, the Group has been pursuing
a continuous programme of cost
reduction with particular projects focused
on distribution and energy saving.
People
We continue to be supported by a
talented, dedicated and loyal workforce
whose skills and efforts have been
instrumental in achieving our results
during another challenging year.
Through our acquisitions of the
Midlands Co-op Dairies, Starcross Foods
and Arla’s London Foodservice business,
we welcomed several hundred new
employees into the business. Their 
co-operation and enthusiasm have
enabled us to integrate the businesses
smoothly and to schedule.
Our training and development
programmes were further enhanced this
year with the introduction of our Leading
4 Change programme aimed at first-line
managers across the business. This
programme complements our existing
management and employee training
schemes.
Pensions
In July 2005 the Group announced that
it would be closing its final salary pension
scheme to new employees joining after
1 April 2006. Following discussions with
employees representatives, this date has
been delayed to 1 July 2006. The gross
pension deficit under International
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) at
31 March 2006 has reduced to £62.0m
compared to £102.7m at 31 March 2005.
This reduced deficit reflects the strong
performance from the fund’s investments
and the additional cash contribution of
£6 million made in the year, offset by the
impact of a reduction in the AA corporate
bond yield. This position will result in an
increase in the net financial income on
the pension fund in 2006/07. The pension
deficit is extremely sensitive to changes
in the underlying assumptions and
movements in the financial markets and
is likely to be volatile from year to year.
Outlook
Whilst markets for own label and
commodity products continue to be
challenging, trading at the start of the
new financial year is on track. We expect
our brand portfolio, supported by
marketing investment and further new
product development, to continue to
make good progress. The Group should
also benefit from the actions we have
taken to strengthen the Dairies division.

Spreads
The butter and spreads market (excluding
cooking fats) grew in the year to March
2006 by 2% in value to approximately
£860 million and by 1% in volume. The
greater growth in value reflects the
continued general trend towards higher
value products such as spreadable butter
and functional health brands. The highest
growth sector was spreadable butter,
which grew by 13% in value and 14% in
volume. Dairy spreads declined by 1% by
value and 2% by volume.
Against this market background, our
butter and spreads brands have made
progress with overall sales up 1% by
value and 2% by volume. This
performance is due to a successful
portfolio approach towards managing
the brands and continued marketing
support. The strength of our brand
portfolio also enabled us to achieve price
increases during the year.
Our leading dairy spreads brands,
Clover and Utterly Butterly, have
continued to grow market share. Clover
had a particularly good year with sales
growth of 5% year on year reflecting the
benefit of price increases achieved
during the year. Utterly Butterly, whilst
showing a 2% decline in sales value,
increased volume by 7% and performed
well against its principal competitor. 
Country Life has performed strongly
following a major new marketing
campaign launched in August 2005 with
good volume and value growth. Country
Life packet butter had sales growth of
9% despite a decline in the packet butter
market of 3%. Country Life Spreadable
grew by 23% in value, reflecting the
impact of the marketing campaign in the
second half of the year and the strong
growth in the spreadable sector. We
launched a Lightly Salted version in
January 2006.
St. Ivel Gold, our health spread, had
a more difficult year with a decline in
sales of 17%. This reflected the strong
performance and increased marketing
investment by competitors in the health
sector. The brand was relaunched early
in 2006 with new packaging, television
advertising and a new variant, St. Ivel
Gold with Omega 3. This product has
achieved good levels of trade 
distribution and is performing in line 
with our expectations. 
In 2006/07, the strategy of the
spreads business will be both to
maintain the strong market position in
dairy spreads and to gain greater share
in the high-value and growing 
spreadable and functional health sectors.
This will again be driven by a
combination of marketing investment
and new product development.

Director of the Foods division
The Foods division comprises the spreads and cheese businesses
together with our share of the Yoplait Dairy Crest joint venture. Revenue
increased slightly to £608.5 million (2005: £605.5 million). Profit on
operations, before exceptional items, increased by 13% to £64.2 million
(2005: £56.7 million) with operating margin, on this basis, up from 9.4%
to 10.6%. Reported profit on operations for Foods,after exceptional items
and excluding joint ventures’ profit on operations, was £45.6 million
(2005: £48.1 million). The spreads business maintained a good level
of performance and there were improvements from both the cheese
business and Yoplait Dairy Crest, where margins benefited from the
closure of the own label operations.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 9
Cheese
The UK cheese market grew by 2% in
volume and 4% in value during the year
and is now worth almost £1.9 billion.
Value growth is ahead of volume growth
due to price increases during the year
and the continuing move towards more
mature, branded and added-value
cheddar. Everyday family (mostly
cheddar cheese) remains the biggest
segment and accounts for half of the
total cheese market. Against this market
background the overall performance of
the cheese business has been good,
benefiting from price rises achieved in
Summer 2005, another very strong
performance from Cathedral City and
increased own label volumes.
Cathedral City sales were up 17% by
value and 11% by volume, strengthening
its market leading position. The higher
value growth reflects the reducing level
of price promotions. The brand is now
worth approximately £106 million at 
retail prices, making it the UK’s biggest
natural cheese brand. We have again
increased the level of marketing support
behind the brand with a successful new
television advertising campaign during
the year. We continue to extend the
range with new product development
and have just launched Cathedral City
Mild in May 2006. This has been
specially developed to cater for those
consumers who prefer a milder flavour
and will deliver the usual Cathedral City
premium quality and consistency. 
The Davidstow sub-brand also
performed strongly with sales growth of
19% by value and 18% by volume. The
final stages of the Davidstow creamery
development have now been completed
with sufficient capacity to support the
continued growth of both the Cathedral
City and Davidstow brands. 
The Stilton market, despite a good
Christmas, has continued to be
challenging and we have taken an
impairment charge of £9.3 million on the
book value of the assets of our speciality
cheese business reflecting the expected
future cash flows of this business.
Notwithstanding this charge, there are
opportunities to improve the
performance and profitability of Stilton
and the speciality cheese business and
in January 2006 we launched a new
cheese brand ‘Over the Moon’, which is
a range of blended speciality cheeses. 
During the year, we have
strengthened our own label cheese
business and successfully implemented
new own label cheese supply
arrangements with both ASDA and
Morrisons. This has significantly
increased our volumes with both retailers
and reinforced Dairy Crest’s market-
leading position in cheddar where we
have significant supply positions with
most of the major retailers. 
As a result of higher industry cheese
stocks, which have grown over the last
six months, combined with further
impact from CAP reform, we expect
some downward pressure on pricing
during 2006/07.

Fresh dairy products
The chilled yogurts and desserts market
has again shown good growth with sales
up 4% by value and 5% by volume. The
market is now worth over £1.7 billion per
annum. Within this market, the highest
growth categories have been functional
health and organic. The children’s
category, where Yoplait Dairy Crest has a
market-leading share of over 50%, has
grown well with sales up 4% by value
and volume. The Children’s category is
now worth over £240 million per annum. 
The Yoplait Dairy Crest joint venture
has continued to make good progress
with the brands overall delivering double-
digit sales growth. Of these, Petits Filous
and Frubes have performed particularly
strongly with sales up 25% and 34% by
value respectively. Of the other key
brands, Wildlife were up 6% by value
and YOP up 13% by value during the
year. Weight Watchers was down 4% 
by value but held market share in the
Light sector.
This good performance has again
resulted from a significant investment in
marketing support and an active
programme of new product development.
During the year, Yoplait Dairy Crest
launched both a Petits Filous fruity
smooth yogurt and Petits Filous Plus, a
probiotic drinking yogurt for children. 
In June 2005, Yoplait Dairy Crest
closed its remaining own-label
operations at Enfield and Yeovil as
planned. This has benefited the financial
performance of the business and
enabled it to invest more in marketing to
support the brands.

this, the organic milk market has
continued to grow very strongly with sales
up by over 50% by value.
Our fresh milk volumes to major
retailers were down 17% year on year,
primarily due to our supply to Tesco
ceasing in April 2005.  However, volumes
benefited in the second half from the
additional Morrisons business, which
commenced at the end of October and is
performing well.  The profitability of the
liquid products business has been in line
with our expectations and the Group is
continuing to focus on improving margins
going forward. 
We took action in May 2005 to
strengthen the Dairies division through the
acquisition of Midlands Co-op Dairies and
Foston (Starcross Foods). The integration
of these businesses has progressed to
plan with the Midlands Dairy in
Birmingham closing, on schedule, at the
end of February 2006 and Foston now
operational. The financial benefits of the
acquisitions are now being delivered and
following the closure of Birmingham, the
Group’s dairies, including Foston, are now
running at a good level of capacity
utilisation. 
The Group achieved fresh milk price
increases from our major retail customers
in January 2006 to offset higher oil-related
costs. From the beginning of April 2006
the raw milk price on our main liquids
contract reduced by 0.5 pence per litre
reflecting lower commodity cream prices.
These factors, together with a continuous
programme of cost reduction, should lead
to better margin performance by this
business in 2006/07. 
We continue to work towards adding
value to fresh milk. In May 2005 we
launched St. Ivel advance, a new branded
fresh milk enriched with Omega 3. While
it is still at a relatively early stage of brand
development, distribution and sales
growth is encouraging with annualised
sales currently running at approximately
£13 million at retail value. 
The organic milk business continues
to grow, benefiting from an exceptionally
strong market. Retailer own label organic
milk sales value grew by 49% and sales
of the Rachel’s organic milk brand (under
licence from Horizon Organic Dairies)
grew by 47%.
Frijj, our flavoured fresh milk drink, has
maintained its position as the leading
brand in the flavoured fresh milk sector
although sales were down 5% by value.
We are addressing the capacity
constraints on Frijj production at
Severnside which will enable more
promotional activity in 2006/07 to move
the brand back into growth. We have
seen good growth in potted cream with
sales up 15% by value and 13% by
volume. We were delighted to be
appointed as sole supplier of potted
cream for Marks & Spencer from August
2006.
The Dairies division comprises Dairy Crest’s liquid products, household
and ingredients operations. Revenue increased by 10% to £815.7
million (2005: £743.3 million), reflecting the impact of the Midlands Co-
op Dairies acquisition partially offset by a reduction in major retail milk
volumes. Profit on operations, before exceptional items, decreased by
52% to £16.8 million (2005: £35.2 million), with operating margin, on
this basis, down from 4.7% to 2.1%. This performance reflects the
adverse impact of the changes in the fresh milk sector in 2004/05, as
highlighted in the Chief Executive’s review. Profit on operations after
exceptional items was £2.9 million (2005: £35.9 million).

Household
The household business has performed
well with a significant increase in
volumes and turnover following the
acquisition of Midlands Co-op Dairies in
May 2005 and Arla’s London Foodservice
business in October 2005. Overall,
Household volumes were up 31% year
on year.
Our continued canvassing activity
and “first class service” initiatives have
helped maintain the underlying annual
decline rate in doorstep at approximately
8%. Operationally the business
continues to deliver industry leading
productivity ratios. In September 2005
we implemented a cost related price
increase for doorstep customers of 2
pence per pint.
The middle ground market, which
includes smaller retailers, schools, hotels
and hospitals, remains competitive.
During the year, the Group had a number
of new business wins, including a sole
supply contract to supply Starbucks
coffee shops nationwide. In October 2005
we acquired the London Foodservice
business of Arla. This has now been fully
integrated into our existing operations
and is delivering significant benefits.
The business continues to focus on
sales of non-milk products such as juice
and other groceries. Non-milk product
sales grew by 30% year on year and we
again had a successful Christmas, which
is a key trading period for non-milk
products.
The Midlands Co-op doorstep
operations, which included 16 depots,
have been fully integrated with four
depots now closed. We have been very
successful in applying the Dairy Crest
operational model to this business and
seen a significant uplift in a number of
Operational review continued
key performance indicators. This
includes average milk delivered per
round per week which has risen from
332 gallons to 450 gallons and average
value of non-milk products delivered per
round per week which has risen nearly
fourfold from £55 to £206.
There continue to be further
opportunities for consolidation in the
market, which will enable us to continue
our successful acquisition strategy for
this business.
Ingredients
European ingredients markets for protein
remained relatively strong for most of the
year despite the fall in intervention prices.
However, cream markets have been
oversupplied and prices have fallen.
Further reductions in intervention prices
will take place in July 2006. The Group
principally uses its ingredients business to
balance a seasonal milk supply with flat
demand and is planning to reduce the
amount of milk processed by its
ingredients business in 2006/07.

As the UK’s leading chilled dairy foods
company, a positive working relationship
with our supplying dairy farmers is
integral to our success. Dairy Crest
places great importance on ensuring that
our milk suppliers feel a valued part of
our business and we recognise that
transparency and openness is crucial if
we are to achieve our aim of creating an
environment where each of our farmers
takes pride in supplying their milk to
Dairy Crest.
Dairy Crest Direct (DCD), the
organisation which represents the
company’s 1,600 direct supplying
farmers, continues to play an important
role in helping us to achieve the
partnership we seek. Now established
for two years, this independent farmer
group representing the views of over
16% of all English and Welsh milk
suppliers, has not only become a valued
partner to the company but is also well
respected throughout the dairy industry.
DCD continues to have a voice
through a Forum of 33 representatives
elected by DCD members and a Board
of eight elected by the Forum. We hold
regular monthly meetings with the DCD
Board and quarterly meetings with the
wider DCD Forum to ensure that the
needs of both our farmers and Dairy
Crest are reflected in our decisions.
The partnership between Dairy Crest,
Dairy Crest Direct and our milk suppliers
is vital if we are all to enjoy a sustainable
future in an industry which continues to
face a number of challenges, including
the ongoing reform of CAP . This year,
industry bodies, led by the NFU, have
tried to set out how the challenges the
industry faces can be met. One of the
key issues identified has been a review
of milk contracts between producers and
processors. During the year, we have
made several improvements in line with
the NFU’s recommendations and are
confident that our contracts are now
industry leading.
We are also working with our
suppliers towards common goals, many
of which were confirmed as a result of
independent research we recently
commissioned to measure all aspects of
our relationship with our farmers. These
include developing supplier associations
to improve communications and deliver
efficiencies for mutual benefit, as well as
using independent advisors to help our
suppliers achieve the quality standards
demanded by our customers.
At Dairy Crest we believe that by
working together, both as part of the
industry and in partnership with our milk
suppliers, customers and consumers,
we are more likely to come through CAP
reform with a sustainable industry able to
positively face the future.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 15
In the year 2005/06, Dairy Crest became the UK’s largest purchaser
of milk, buying 2.4 billion litres per annum, principally due to the
acquisition of Midlands Co-op Dairies in May 2005. Dairy Crest 
now buys over 70% of its milk directly from 1,600 UK farmers.
The balance is supplied by First Milk, one of the country’s leading
milk co-operatives.

Dairy Crest’s Chief Executive has overall
responsibility for Corporate Social
Responsibility (‘CSR’). The company
manages its CSR programme by means
of a steering group which brings
together senior managers with specific
CSR responsibilities who review the
company’s activities and assess the
needs of our stakeholders. Dairy Crest is
a member of Business in the
Community.
Environment
We have long recognised that a
commitment to protecting the
environment is an integral part of
managing our business and that
environmental performance contributes
to overall business performance.
Our manufacturing sites and the
national distribution centre continue to
be independently accredited to the
environmental management system
ISO 14001. Our newly acquired site 
at Foston has passed the first stage 
of the accreditation process with full
accreditation expected in August 2006.
Dairy Crest’s established
environmental management system
approach has enabled us to obtain
permits under the regulations relating to
Integrated Pollution Prevention and
Control (‘IPPC’). As part of this process
each affected site has documented
targets for reductions in energy and
water usage, as well as for food
wastage.
Milk and product wastage has
reduced by 21% over the past two
years, primarily driven by reduced
wastage following our major investment
in Davidstow. Future savings are likely to
be at a lower level.
Dairy Crest recognises that our actions and decisions have an
impact on the staff we employ, the local communities where we
operate, our suppliers, our customers and the environment.
We take our responsibilities to our stakeholders seriously.

Energy usage, in terms of carbon

since 2004/05, following an adverse
trend between 2003/04 and 2004/05.
This was caused by an increase in
drying activity. Excluding this effect,
the underlying trend is steadily
downwards since 2002/03.

We continue to drive standards of
good hygienic practice at our sites with a
target of all sites being accredited to the
Quality Management System ISO 9001.
Our dairies at Chadwell Heath and
Fenstanton attained accreditation during
the year, leaving only our newly acquired
site at Foston to reach this level. We aim
to achieve this by December 2006.
In March 2006, we were prosecuted for
a breach of hygiene regulations at our
household depot in Fenstanton. Robust
action has been taken to ensure that a
similar situation cannot recur.

the Food Standards Agency regarding
their targets for nutritional dietary
improvement. In particular, we have
agreed certain salt reductions in our

cheese portfolio which are achievable
without adverse impact on product
quality. During the course of the year
we have also completed the removal
programme of trans-fatty acids from our
range of spreads containing vegetable
fats.
We are supporting both the IGD and
Dairy UK proposals for declaring
Guideline Daily Amounts (‘GDAs’) on
packs as the most sensible means of
providing consumers with meaningful
information on nutritional content.
We have a short supply chain,
enabling close relationships with the
1,600 British dairy farmers who supply
us directly, as well as supplying dairy
co-operatives. The Dairy Crest
Assurance Scheme ensures the delivery
of top quality milk, produced to high
standards of food safety, animal welfare
and protection of the environment.
Dairy Crest provides a subsidised
support package, through the
independent White Gold Service, to
enable direct supplying farmers to
maintain Farm Assurance standards with
the minimum of disruption and cost.
Workplace
The success of our business is
underpinned by the 7,500 people who
work for Dairy Crest and our joint
venture, Yoplait Dairy Crest, across 20
manufacturing and administration sites
and 112 household depots. We focus on
creating an environment where our
people are safe, valued and motivated to
improve performance continuously.
We increasingly rely on our workforce
to develop their skills, knowledge and
experience to maximise returns on our
investment in new technology and to
drive our environmental and marketplace
performance. We are working with our
employees and Trade Unions to develop
structures, which more effectively
recognise the changing skill requirements
and reward performance. Retention of
our skilled workforce is key to the
continuous improvement we achieve and
labour turnover is a key performance
indicator of the health and success of
our business. 
We are now two years into our
manufacturing improvement and
operational excellence programmes. Our
operational excellence programme is run
in conjunction with the University of
Birmingham, and participants in the
programme work towards an MSc in
Food Production Management. Our
manufacturing improvement practitioners
programme has now been completed by
over 60 managers around the Group.
This programme focuses on the
principles of lean manufacture and
continuous improvement in the context
of a safe working environment.
Maintaining a consistently safe and
healthy workplace for our people
continues to be a key corporate
objective. Health and safety (‘H&S’)
training represents a major tool in the
achievement of this and during the year
we have run training courses in safety
management, manual handling and
accident investigation at most of our
major sites.
The safety of company drivers has
also been targeted and a driver
awareness programme introduced for all
company car drivers when they change
vehicles.
During the year, we have established
a Group H&S steering committee made
up of key Group and divisional directors.
The aim of this is to increase active
involvement of senior executives in
promoting safety and drive improvement
in H&S performance. It is also a
proactive step to improve
communication on H&S throughout the
Group, and to share information and
best practice between company sites.
The committee meets eight times a year
and reports to the Board quarterly.
Community
The majority of our sites are in rural
settings or small towns, where Dairy
Crest is often one of the largest local
employers. We recognise that the
company has a valuable role to play
in the life of the local community.
The majority of our sites are involved
with schools in their local areas. Their
involvement ranges from donations to
support fundraising activities to giving
talks on subjects such as food and dairy
technology, as well as offering some
students the opportunity to participate
in work experience or visit our sites.
All our sites regularly give hampers of
dairy products or donations in kind to
local causes.
Our household business plays an
important role at the heart of the local
community. We deliver over 350 million
bottles of milk from 112 depots in
southern England and Wales to one
million customers every year, as well as a
range of other products including staples
such as bread, eggs, fruit and
vegetables and juices.
Our thanks once again go to our
sites and depots which have continued
to support Dairy Crest’s corporate
charity, Leukaemia Research. Our staff
and customers have now raised a total
of £730,000 over the last three years
through a variety of fundraising activities.
We are also pleased to announce that
we have agreed to continue to support
the UK’s leading blood cancer charity for
a fourth year.

This year, for the first time, the Annual
Report and Accounts of Dairy Crest have
been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRS’). The financial
information for the financial year ended
31 March 2005, reconciled to that
previously reported under UK GAAP , was
issued on 7 November 2005 and is
available on the Group’s website. There
was no cash impact arising from the
conversion to IFRS.
Revenue
Group revenue increased by 8% to
£1,355.2 million principally reflecting the
inclusion of revenue from Midlands Co-
operative Dairies following its acquisition
in May 2005 partially offset, as expected,
by lower revenue from major retail fresh
milk. Group revenue, including our share
of joint ventures’, increased by 6% to
£1,424.2 million, reflecting lower Yoplait
Dairy Crest revenue following the closure
of its own label operations in June 2005.
Profit on operations
In this review, except where otherwise
indicated, profit on operations is stated
before exceptional items and includes
our share of joint ventures’ pre-
exceptional operating profit. On this
basis, Group profit on operations
reduced by 12% to £81.0 million,
generating an operating margin of 5.7%,
a reduction of 1.1%. Reported profit on
operations after exceptional items was
£48.5 million (2005: £84.0 million). 
As expected, the Dairies division
started the year from a lower base level
of profitability following changes in retail
supply arrangements across the industry
in 2004/05. This, combined with the
ongoing decline in our household
business, resulted in operating profit of
£16.8 million, a reduction of 52% with
operating margins declining from 4.7%
to 2.1%. The Foods division’s operating
profit of £64.2 million, an increase of
13%, reflects a strong performance from
our branded cheese business and
enhanced Yoplait Dairy Crest margins
following the closure of its own label
operations. Operating margins in the
Foods division increased from 9.4% to
10.6%.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items reported within profit
on operations of £23.2 million represent
acquisition restructuring costs of 
£15.3 million and an impairment of the
assets and goodwill of our speciality
cheese business of £9.3 million offset by
a profit of £1.4 million on the disposal of
closed dairy sites. Of these items, £10.3
million were non-cash.
Restructuring costs of £12.7 million
were incurred in relation to the
acquisitions of Midlands Co-operative
Dairies and Starcross Foods in May
2005. This charge includes £3.5 million
of redundancy costs, £4.5 million of
duplicate running costs (as volume was
transferred from the Birmingham dairy to
other parts of the Group up to its
closure at the end of February 2006),
£3.7 million of other rationalisation costs
and £1.0 million of asset write-downs.
Further restructuring costs of £2.6
million were incurred integrating the
London Foodservice business of Arla
Foods UK plc into our Dairies division.
This charge includes £1.6 million of
redundancy costs.
Following the annual review of cash
generating units’ value in use, an
impairment of £9.3 million has been
recorded against the carrying value of
goodwill and property, plant and
equipment of our speciality cheese
business. We continue to take actions to
improve the efficiency and profitability of
our speciality cheese business but,
despite a good Christmas, the Stilton
market in particular continues to be
challenging. These market pressures
inevitably impact the cash generating

Financial review continued
capacity of this business and
management considers it necessary to
recognise an impairment to reflect this.
The total £9.3 million impairment charge 
comprises a write-down of the carrying
value of goodwill of £2.3 million to nil and
a £7.0 million write-down of the carrying
value of plant and equipment. The value
of these assets will continue to be
reviewed annually.
A profit of £1.4 million has been
recognised on the disposal of a closed
dairy site in Newport on the Isle of Wight.
Interest
Finance costs have increased by 2% to
£16.7 million as a result of increased
levels of net debt during the year 
predominantly due to the cost of
acquisitions. The impact of higher net
debt has been mitigated by the full year
impact of reduced margins and fees
following the refinancing of our facilities
in June 2004 and the replacement of
certain interest rate swaps at lower
effective rates of interest.
Other finance income comprises
the net expected return on pension
scheme assets after deducting the
interest cost of the defined benefit
obligation. This resulted in a credit of
£2.2 million in the year ended 31 March
2006, an increase of £1.9 million
compared to the previous year.
Interest cover, calculated before
exceptional items and including our
share of joint ventures’ profit on
operations, is 4.9 times (2005:
5.6 times).
Adjusted profit before tax
The Group’s adjusted profit before tax
(calculated before exceptional items,
amortisation of acquired intangibles and
tax attributable to joint ventures) was
£67.7 million (2005: £75.7 million).
Profit before tax after exceptional items,
reported under IFRS, was £41.3 million
(2005: £70.2 million).
Taxation 
The Group’s effective tax rate on profits
excluding exceptional items and
including joint ventures’ tax was 24.1%
(2005: 27.7%). The reduction in effective
tax rate is largely due to the release of
tax provisions that were previously held
pending the finalisation of a number of
prior year assessments.
In addition, the Group had increased
property profits in 2005/06, which are
sheltered by brought forward capital
losses and rollover relief. The tax credit
on exceptional costs of £23.2 million
was £6.6 million. 
The effective tax rate on reported
profit before tax was 15.7% (2005: 26.5%).
Earnings per share
The Group’s basic adjusted earnings per
share reduced by 8% to 40.3 pence per
share. Basic earnings per share, which
includes the impact of exceptional items
and the amortisation of acquired
intangibles, decreased by 35% to 27.1
pence per share.
The weighted average number of
shares increased by approximately 1.4
million to 124.8 million, primarily due to
the exercise of Sharesave scheme
options from March to September 2005.
A diluted earnings per share calculation,
which reflects the impact of potential
ordinary shares from unvested share
option schemes, is presented for both
the basic and adjusted earnings per
share amounts.
Dividends
The proposed final dividend of 15.2
pence per share, together with the interim
dividend of 6.3 pence per share, gives
a total dividend of 21.5 pence per
share for the full year. This represents
an increase of 6.4% on the total dividend
declared for 2004/05. The final dividend
will be paid on 9 August 2006 to
shareholders on the register on
7 July 2006.
Under IFRS, proposed final dividends are
no longer provided for at the year end
and as such, have been included as a
memorandum item only below the
consolidated income statement.
Pensions
The total gross pension deficit, reported
on the Group balance sheet under IFRS,
at 31 March 2006 was £62.0 million
compared to £102.7 million at 31 March
2005. The reduced deficit reflects strong
performance from the fund’s
investments, which, due to the 70%+
equity weighting, increased by £126.4
million during the year. This increase was
partially offset by an increase of £85.7
million in the present value of liabilities
caused, principally, by a reduction of
0.4% in the AA corporate bond yield
to 5.1%. Furthermore, the Group made
additional contributions of £6 million
to the pension scheme during the
year ended 31 March 2006 and has
committed to make £12 million additional
contributions in each of the next
two years.
The pension deficit is extremely
sensitive to changes in underlying
assumptions and movements in the
financial markets and is likely to be
volatile from year to year. Increasing
bond yields, along with the continued
strong UK equity performance to March
2006, have reduced the pension deficit
significantly during the last quarter.
The actuarial gain, before deferred tax,
reported in equity for the year is
£37.2 million (2005: £2.3 million loss).
In July 2005 the Group announced
that it would be closing its final salary
pension scheme to new employees
joining after 1 April 2006. Following
discussions with employees’
representatives, this date has been
amended to 1 July 2006.
Cash flow
The cash inflow from operating activities
4609_DC_p19-22_AW.qxd  8/6/06  5:57 pm  Page 20 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 21
was £73.4 million (2005: £143.0 million).
This included a working capital outflow
of £16.3 million (2005: £22.4 million
inflow). The working capital increase was
primarily due to inventory increases of
£17.9 million underpinning strong growth
in our branded cheddar business.
Increases in receivables reflect the higher
proportion of foodservice business in our
household division, as a result of the
acquisition of the London Foodservice
business of Arla Foods UK plc. Increased
year end payables largely offset these
increases in receivables.
Cash interest and tax payments
amounted to £16.4 million and £15.5
million respectively. Interest payments are
£1.3 million lower than last year because
of the fees incurred in 2004/05 as part of
the refinancing of facilities in June 2004.
The Group currently borrows at a margin
of 52.5 to 85 basis points over the
relevant interbank rate. Tax payments are
£2.9 million higher than last year due,
partly, to a one-off payment of £1.8
million made as a result of an election to
receive a statutory tax deduction of 4%
on certain goodwill acquired after April
2002 rather than deductions based on
goodwill amortisation.
Capital expenditure, net of grants of
£0.3 million, was £44.0 million (2005:
£37.7 million) with significant investment
undertaken at Chard, Somerset on
improved cream processing facilities, at
Foston in Derbyshire on post-acquisition
investment and on the implementation
of Oracle financial systems across the
Group. Cash receipts from the disposal
of fixed assets amounted to £9.4 million
(2005: £8.2 million) of which £1.7 million
related to the exceptional property
disposal of the site in Newport,
Isle of Wight.
The cash outflow from purchase of
businesses amounted to £43.7 million
in the year (2005: £9.9 million). In May
2005, the Group acquired Starcross
Foods Limited and the dairy business
and assets of the Midland Co-operative
Society for a net consideration of
£37.3 million. In October 2005, the
Group acquired the London Foodservice
business of Arla Foods UK plc for a net
consideration of £4.2 million. In addition,
the Group acquired the goodwill of a
number of bottled milk buyers during the
year for cash consideration of 
£2.2 million.
The Group received £9.0 million in
dividend receipts from Yoplait Dairy Crest
in the year (2005: Nil) and paid dividends
to shareholders of £25.6 million (2005:
£23.9 million).
Net borrowings
Net debt increased by £52.7 million to
£280.2 million at the end of the year as
cash flows from operations were more
than offset by acquisitions of businesses
and increased capital expenditure. At 31
March 2006, gearing was 109% (2005:
103%).
Borrowing facilities
Group borrowing facilities at 31 March
2006 amounted to £423 million and
comprised term loans of £135 million, a
multi-currency revolving credit facility of
£270 million and finance lease debt of
£18 million. During the year, £65 million
was repaid and cancelled on our
September 2002 term loan. 
On 4 April 2006, the Group
completed a private debt placement in
the US and raised £133 million (US$ 233
million) in US$ loan notes and £10 million
in Sterling loan notes. The loan notes
mature in two tranches of seven and ten
years. Currency swaps have been put in
place to convert the US$ debt into
Sterling at fixed rates. The effective
interest rate on the combined issue is
5.3%. On completion of this transaction
and subsequent repayment of certain
term loans of £90 million and
cancellation of £20 million of the
revolving credit facility, Group long-term
borrowing facilities, including finance
leases, total £456 million with a
significantly longer maturity profile.
Treasury policies
The Group operates a centralised
treasury function, which controls cash
management and borrowings and the
Group’s financial risks. The main treasury
risks faced by the Group are liquidity,
interest rates and foreign currency. The
Group uses derivatives only to manage
its foreign currency and interest rate
risks arising from underlying business
activities. Transactions of a speculative
nature are prohibited. The Group’s
treasury activities are governed by
policies approved and monitored by
the Board.
Net assets
The Group’s balance sheet remains
strong with net assets of £258.0 million
(2005: £220.6 million). Goodwill,
intangibles and property, plant and
equipment total £465.8 million (2005:
£427.4 million) despite the impairment of
£9.3 million in relation to our speciality
cheese business.
Going concern
The financial statements have been
prepared on a going concern basis as
the directors are satisfied that the Group
has adequate financial resources to
continue its operations for the
foreseeable future. In making this
statement, the Group’s directors have
reviewed the Group budget and available
facilities and have made such other
enquiries as they considered
appropriate.

Corporate governance statement
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards of
corporate governance. This report sets out how the Company
complies with the principles contained in Section 1 of the
Combined Code on corporate governance published by the
Financial Reporting Council in July 2003. The Board considers
that, throughout the financial year under review, the Company
has complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the
Combined Code with one exception. No meetings were
requested or held between shareholders and the Chairman and
senior independent non-executive director during the year.
However, the Board considers that arrangements are in place 
to ensure a balanced understanding of the issues and concerns
of major shareholders. These arrangements include
communication with the shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting (‘AGM’), regular feedback from the Chief Executive 
and the Group Finance Director on their meetings with major
shareholders and periodic reports to the Board on the views 
of major shareholders from the Company’s broker.
We describe below the way in which the Company complies
with the detailed provisions of the Combined Code. 
The Board 
Currently the Board consists of the Chairman, Mr S M D Oliver,
four executive directors and four non-executive directors. 
The table below identifies the number of Board and Committee
meetings held during the past year and the attendance of
each director. 
The Board has responsibility for the overall management and
performance of the Group with the key objective of delivering
shareholder value. The Board reserves a formal schedule of
matters for its approval which includes strategy and
management, financial structure and capital, reporting and
controls, Board appointments and committees, executive
remuneration, dividend policy and corporate governance
compliance. The schedule of matters reserved for the Board,
the Board objectives, the terms of reference of the Board
committees, a summary of the service agreements of the
executive directors and of the terms of appointment of the 
non-executive directors together with the respective
responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive are
available on the Company’s website, www.dairycrest.co.uk. 
The biographies of the directors are set out on page 22.
Senior executives below Board level attend certain Board
meetings and make presentations to the Board on strategic,
financial, operational and compliance matters. Directors are
given Board papers in advance of each meeting. Where
directors have concerns about the running of the Company, 
or a proposed action that cannot be resolved, their concerns
are recorded in the Board minutes.
Below the Board level there are limits of authority allowing the
Executive Committee, comprising four executive directors and
senior management to make financial commitments. In addition
there are clear policies and procedures over the key risk areas
over which management has been given delegated
responsibility, including financial reporting, treasury, purchasing,
milk procurement, food safety and environmental matters.
All directors have access to advice from the Company Secretary
or to independent professional advice at the expense of the
Company. During the year actions have been taken to ensure
that directors are regularly updated and refresh their knowledge
and awareness of corporate responsibilities, including a
presentation from the pension fund actuary on scheme funding.
The Company maintains appropriate insurance cover for the
directors and officers. The Company’s insurance cover also
includes insurance of employers’ liability and public and product
liability risks. New appointments to the Board participate in
induction programmes including briefings by members of the
senior management team and visits to Group facilities.
The Board has three Board Committees and the non-executive
directors are members of all Committees. Details of directors’
attendance at Board and Board Committee meetings are set
out below:

time unless prevented from doing so by prior commitments. 
Arrangements were made for all directors to attend the Annual
General Meeting on 14 July 2005 (‘AGM 2005’). All directors
attended the AGM 2005 with the exception of Mr H Mann due
to circumstances beyond his control.
The Audit Committee: At 1 April 2005 the Committee
comprised four non-executive directors, Mr D J Dugdale,
Mr G E Grimstone, Mr P S Lewis (chairman) and Mr D H
Richardson. Mr H Mann joined the Committee on 19 May 2005
and Mr P S Lewis retired from the Committee following the
AGM 2005 and was replaced as chairman by Mr D H Richardson.
The Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director,
the head of internal audit, senior finance management and
representatives of the external auditors are in attendance at
meetings of the Committee. The Committee holds private
meetings without management present with both the external
and internal auditors.
0346_DC_AR_2006_p23-37  8/6/06  6:10 pm  Page 23 24 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006
Corporate governance statement continued
The Committee is responsible for exercising the full powers and
authority of the Board in reviewing a wide range of accounting
and financial reporting matters. Since the 2005 Annual Report
the Committee has met to consider, amongst other matters: 
• The Company’s interim and annual financial statements and
formal announcements on financial performance before
submission to the Board for approval; 
• The impact on the interim and annual financial statements 
of the adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRS’);
• The Group’s risk register and the adequacy of the Group’s
accounting systems and internal controls; 
• Review of the Group internal audit process and the 2006/07
internal audit plan together with the principal procedures
performed by the external auditors in relation to the Fraud
and Proceeds of Crime Act;
• The provision of audit and non audit services provided by
the external auditors, their audit fees for 2005/06 and a
report from the external auditors confirming their
independence and objectivity; 
• An evaluation of the effectiveness of the external auditors; 
• Recommendation for re-appointment of the external auditors;
• Review of the Group’s treasury operations including net debt
levels, facility headroom, compliance with banking covenants
and level and appropriateness of hedging arrangements;
• Developments in accounting systems including an evaluation
of migration risks and the effectiveness of controls; 
• Review of the effectiveness of the Group’s whistle-blowing
procedures; and 
• The Group’s compliance with the Combined Code. 
Where the external auditors have provided non-audit services,
the Group Finance Director has obtained prior authorisation
from the chairman of the Committee to instruct Ernst & Young
LLP to carry out this work. In the year ended 31 March 2006,
non-audit work undertaken by Ernst & Young principally
comprised advice on tax.
The Committee members bring considerable financial and
accounting experience to the achievement of the Committee’s
objectives. Collectively members have significant past business
experience in industry and finance. Mr D H Richardson was
Finance Director of Whitbread plc until April 2005. 
The Nomination Committee: At 1 April 2005 the Committee
comprised the Chairman and two non-executive directors,
Mr D J Dugdale (chairman) and Mr P S Lewis.
Mr G E Grimstone, Mr H Mann and Mr D H Richardson joined
the Committee on 19 May 2005 and Mr P S Lewis retired from
the Committee following the AGM 2005. The Chairman
succeeded Mr D J Dugdale as chairman of the Committee with
effect from 13 April 2006. It is responsible for succession
planning at Board level, overseeing the selection of directors
and making recommendations to the Board on subsequent
appointments. The Committee discussed board succession
arrangements in December 2005 and external consultants
were appointed to assist in executive directors’ development
and succession arrangements. The Committee has also
recommended to the Board that Mr H Mann be proposed for
re-election as a non-executive director at the Annual General
Meeting to be held on 20 July 2006 (‘AGM 2006’). Mr H Mann 
has completed one term of three years and his business
background and experience are considered to be of
considerable on-going benefit to the Company. The Committee
approves any non-executive directorships taken by executive
directors. The Board believes that directors can gain valuable
experience and knowledge from becoming a non-executive
director of another listed company that will ultimately benefit
the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee: The membership of the
Committee during the year is set out on page 27. The Committee
is responsible for determining, within remuneration principles
agreed with the Board, the salaries, bonuses and pension rights
of the executive directors. Remuneration is designed to be set
at a level appropriate to the Company’s circumstances having
regard to market information provided by external consultants.
The Board itself determines the remuneration of non-executive
directors also having regard to market information provided by
external consultants. An explanation of how the Company has
applied the principles of the Combined Code with respect to
remuneration is outlined in the Directors’ remuneration report
on pages 27 to 34.
Chairman and Chief Executive
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the
Chairman, the senior independent non-executive director, 
Mr G E Grimstone and the Chief Executive, MrJWD Hall. 
The respective responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief
Executive have been agreed by the Board and, as previously
advised, are available on the Company’s website.
Board balance and independence
The Board considers all of the non-executive directors to be
independent under the guidelines set out in the Combined
Code. The non-executive directors are free from any material
business relationship with the Company and have not held
executive positions within the Group. None of the current
non-executive directors have served as a director of the
Company for more than nine years. Mr P S Lewis, who joined
the Board in 1996, retired by rotation at the AGM 2005 and 
did not seek re-election. Currently, there are four non-executive
directors, and the Chairman, out of a total Board of nine. 
The directors are of the opinion that an appropriate balance
between executive and independent non-executive directors
exists. Mr P S Lewis was succeeded by Mr G E Grimstone 
as the senior independent non-executive director following
Mr P S Lewis’s retirement. Any shareholder who has a concern
about the affairs of the Company should contact, in the first
0346_DC_AR_2006_p23-37  9/6/06  1:28 pm  Page 24 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 25
instance, the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the senior
independent non-executive director.
Performance evaluation
The Board conducts an annual evaluation of individual directors,
its own performance and of Board Committees. The evaluation
process is designed to improve the effectiveness of the Board.
Individual director performance is reviewed as follows:
• Each director completes a self-assessment questionnaire
and the Chairman then meets separately with each director
in order to appraise their individual performance and
effectiveness and to identify any training requirements.
• The Chairman’s performance is appraised by the senior
independent non-executive director with input from other
Board members in the form of completed assessment
questionnaires.
• The Chief Executive appraises the performance of the other
executive directors with regard to their management and
operational responsibilities, in accordance with the Company’s
normal performance and development review procedures.
Appraisals were performed for all the directors during the year
for their performance in 2005/06. The Chairman reported to the
Board on the outcome of the appraisals, in relation to the
Board’s overall effectiveness, at its meeting on 16 March 2006.
A summary of the completed self-assessment questionnaires
indicated that Board processes and frequency of meetings were
satisfactory, that the level of information provided was good and
that Board relationships were strong with open debate on all
subjects. The Board also reviewed the performance of its Board
Committees and it was agreed that the practice of all non-
executive directors being members of all Board Committees
was effective in ensuring good communication and awareness
of all relevant issues. It was considered appropriate in future for
the Chairman to chair the Nomination Committee in view of his
central role in ensuring planned and progressive refreshing of
the Board. Mr D J Dugdale fully concurred with this assessment
and agreed to stand down as chairman of the Nomination
Committee in favour of Mr S M D Oliver with effect from
13 April 2006.
The Board met without the Chairman present on 16 March 2006
in order to receive a report from the senior independent
non-executive director on the Chairman’s appraisal together
with a summary of the assessment questionnaires completed 
by the other Board members. It was agreed that the Chairman
continued to perform his role effectively.
Re-election
The Company’s articles require that one third of Board members
retire by rotation at each AGM and that each director must retire
not later than the third AGM following their last election or
re-election. At the AGM 2006 Mr M Allen, Mr H Mann and
Mr P Thornton, who were elected at the AGM 2003, will retire
by rotation. The Nomination Committee has recommended that
Mr H Mann is proposed for re-election as a non-executive
director. The Board supports this recommendation and is
satisfied that Mr H Mann’s performance continues to be
effective and that he demonstrates appropriate commitment to
the role, including devoting adequate time for Board and
Committee meetings and any other duties. 
The Board also supports the proposed re-election to the Board
of Mr M Allen, Executive Managing Director (Dairies) and
Mr P Thornton, Executive Managing Director (Foods). 
Accountability and audit
The directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. It is therefore appropriate to continue to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. 
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of
internal controls to safeguard the shareholders’ investment and
the Company’s assets and for reviewing the effectiveness of
those controls. As required by the Combined Code, the Board
has established an ongoing process, in accordance with the
guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control, to
identify, evaluate and manage significant risks faced by the
Group. This process includes the consideration of a schedule
identifying and evaluating the Group’s significant risks and
related financial, operational and compliance controls. This
process has been in place for the year under review and up to
the date of approval of the Annual Report. The Board has
reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal
control (including that of its joint venture Yoplait Dairy Crest
Limited) which is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk
of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives and to
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
The main elements of the process applied in reviewing the
effectiveness of the systems of internal control include:
• Board – the Board exercises its responsibilities through an
organisational structure with clearly defined levels of
responsibility and rules relating to delegated authorities. The
Board meets regularly throughout the year and receives oral
and written presentations to maintain control over strategic,
financial, operational and compliance matters. The Executive
Committee is responsible for embedding risk management
and controls in the Group. The Executive Managing Director
of each division, in conjunction with senior management,
operates and maintains controls appropriate to its own
activities and conforms to Group policies and procedures. 
• Financial reporting – there is an annual budget presented
and approved by the Board which includes consideration 
0346_DC_AR_2006_p23-37  8/6/06  7:42 pm  Page 25 26 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006
Corporate governance statement continued
of the major business risks, an assessment of the likelihood
of crystallisation and actions in place to mitigate these risks.
Each business is required to report monthly to the Board 
on financial performance. The monthly financial information
includes trading results, balance sheet and cash flow
information by business division with comparison against
prior year and budget. Each business periodically reassesses
its forecast for the financial year. Annually, a strategic plan 
is also presented to the Board, which reviews financial
projections for the following three years and includes
consideration of current and likely future strategic, operational
and market environment matters. 
• Business division reviews – On a quarterly basis, each
business division is required to complete a self-assessment
controls questionnaire that requires the approval of divisional
management. In addition, the Audit Committee and the
Executive Committee receive copies of all Group internal audit
reports which detail audit issues noted and corrective action
plans. They also receive reports from the external auditors
on the conclusions of their interim review and final audit.
Relationships with shareholders
The Company places considerable importance on its
communication and relationship with its institutional and private
shareholders. The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director
hold meetings with key institutional shareholders to discuss
strategy, financial performance and investment activities
immediately after the full year and interim results announcement.
Slide presentations made to institutional shareholders are also
available on the Company’s website. Feedback from meetings
with shareholders was provided to the Board to ensure that 
the non-executive directors have a balanced understanding 
of the issues and concerns of major shareholders. In addition,
the Board received periodic reports from the Company’s broker
on investor relations and the views of shareholders. Board
members are regularly circulated with copies of brokers’ and
analysts’ reports on the Company.
The principal method of communication with private
shareholders is through the Annual and Interim reports, the
AGM and through the Company’s website. A business review is
presented by the Chairman at the AGM to facilitate shareholder
understanding of the Group’s activities. All executive directors,
the Chairman and the chairmen of Board Committees attend
the AGM and are available to answer shareholders’ questions.
The Notice of the AGM is posted to shareholders with the
annual accounts at least 20 working days before the date of the
AGM. Resolutions are proposed for each substantial separate
issue and details of the proxy votes for each resolution passed
are announced immediately after the results of the show of
hands is known and are posted on the Company’s website
following the conclusion of the meeting.
0346_DC_AR_2006_p23-37  8/6/06  6:16 pm  Page 26 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 27
Directors’ remuneration report
The Board has appointed a Remuneration Committee comprising
non-executive directors of the Company. During the year the
Committee consisted of Mr G E Grimstone (chairman),
Mr D J Dugdale, Mr D H Richardson, Mr H Mann, Mr P S Lewis
and Mr S M D Oliver. Mr S M D Oliver ceased to be a member
of the Committee on 19 May 2005 but has been invited to
attend future meetings. Mr P S Lewis ceased to be a member
of the Committee following his retirement at the AGM 2005.
Mr D J Dugdale and Mr D H Richardson were appointed to the
Committee on 19 May 2005. Members of the Remuneration
Committee have no potential conflicts of interest arising from
cross-directorships and they are not involved in the day-to-day
running of the Company. The Remuneration Committee
determines, within remuneration principles agreed with the
Board, the total remuneration package of each executive
director. It has appointed PwC LLP to provide advice on levels
of remuneration. PwC LLP have also provided advice on
valuations of share based payments under International
Financial Reporting Standards and to the Yoplait Dairy Crest
joint venture. With the exception of this advice PwC LLP
provided no other consulting services. The Chief Executive
attends all meetings and provides advice on matters other
than those concerning himself.
Total remuneration
The total remuneration package, which is reviewed annually, 
is structured to attract, retain and motivate executive directors.
The total remuneration of executive directors consists of base
salary, bonus, pension benefits, selected benefits in kind and
share incentive and option arrangements. The Board intends to
introduce a guideline to require executive directors to build up a
personal shareholding in the Company’s shares. This forms part
of a wider review of executive incentives which are described in
detail on page 28.
• Base salary
Salary levels for executive directors are reviewed annually based
on an independent assessment of market practice. They are set
to reflect the pay levels of executives with similar responsibilities
in companies of comparable size and complexity.
• Bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for all executive
directors was increased from 80% to 100% of annual salary
from 2005/06. In 2004/05 the maximum bonus opportunity was
capped at 80% of annual salary. There are no current plans to
change the maximum bonus percentage. Payment of the bonus
is subject to the achievement of demanding short-term financial
targets agreed by the Remuneration Committee. To ensure that
an appropriate balance is maintained between long-term and
short-term reward, from 2005/06, any bonus earned over 50%
of annual salary will be paid in the Company’s shares and
deferred for a three year period. 
• Long Term Incentive Share Plan 
A Long Term Incentive Share Plan (‘LTISP 1996’) was
introduced for directors and other senior management on 28
June 1996 which is designed to encourage continuing
improvement in the Group’s performance over the longer term.
An LTISP 1996 award is payable in shares, rather than cash, to
emphasise the alignment of interest between the participants
and the Company’s shareholders. The LTISP 1996 has a three
year performance cycle and pre-determined performance
conditions which must be met before awards under the LTISP
1996 can be exercised. Awards under the LTISP 1996 are
granted annually. For awards from 2002 onwards, 50% of the
total award is measured on the growth in the Company’s
adjusted earnings per share (excluding exceptional items)
compared with the increase in the retail prices index (‘RPI’) over
the three year performance period and 50% is measured on
total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance.
The TSR of Dairy Crest Group plc is measured against that of
14 comparator companies in the foods sector, the FTSE 250
index (excluding investment companies) and the FTSE Food
Producers and Processors Index.
The targets are as follows:
LTISP award TSR element EPS element
Proportion Proportion
of total Growth in of total

Remuneration Committee from time to time. The current annual
limit for awards is 100% of base salary and the maximum
awards during the year were in line with this limit.
At 31 March 2006 the list of comparators was: 
Arla Foods Premier Foods
Associated British Foods Richmond Foods
Cadbury Schweppes Robert Wiseman Dairies
Devro Tate & Lyle
Glanbia Unilever
Greencore Uniq
Kerry FTSE 250 (excluding Investment Companies)
Northern Foods FTSE Food Producers & Processors Index
The constituents of the comparator group remained the same
for the years ended 31 March 2005 and 2006 except that in
February 2005 Premier Foods replaced Big Food Group and
from 1 April 2005 Richmond Foods replaced Geest following
the delisting of these companies.

• Executive Share Option Scheme
The Dairy Crest Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’) was
established on 30 July 1996 for directors and certain senior
management. Part A is approved by HM Revenue and Customs
(‘HMRC’) and Part B is an unapproved scheme. Options are
granted to participants at prices determined by the
Remuneration Committee which may not be less than the
market price of the shares as derived from the London Stock
Exchange Daily Official List at the time of grant.
Up until 21 July 2002 the options could not be exercised unless
the Company’s adjusted earnings per share had increased over
a three year period by RPI plus 6%. After that date the EPS
performance condition was made more demanding and ESOS
options granted after 21 July 2002 will now only vest:
(a) if after three years EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by 9%,
(b) if condition (a) is not achieved, if after four years EPS growth
exceeds RPI growth by 12%,
(c) if condition (b) is not achieved, if after five years EPS growth
exceeds RPI growth by 15%.
Directors of the Company who are granted awards under the
LTISP are not granted additional share options under the ESOS
except in the case of promotion. Currently Mr P Thornton is the
only participant in ESOS subject to the original performance
criteria and Mr J W D Hall is the only participant in ESOS
subject to the new performance criteria. Neither exercised
nor were granted any ESOS awards during the year ended
31 March 2006. 
• New executive share plans
Shareholder approval will be sought at the AGM 2006 for the
introduction of two new executive share plans, the Dairy Crest
2006 Executive Share Option Scheme (‘Executive Scheme’) and
the Dairy Crest 2006 Long Term Incentive Share Plan (‘LTISP’).
These plans are needed to replace ESOS and LTISP 1996, 
both of which expire in 2006. The Remuneration Committee
considers that the basic structure of the Company’s executive
share plans remains appropriate within its overall executive
remuneration policy and, therefore, seeks approval for the
adoption of the Executive Scheme and the LTISP . 
Although the Executive Scheme and the LTISP broadly follow
the rules of the existing plans (updated to reflect the current
best practice), there are two particular changes which should
be highlighted. These are set out below.
Firstly, in order to provide flexibility to respond to potential future
changes in market levels of total compensation, the maximum
grant level under the LTISP is being increased to 150% of salary
(although it is not the Remuneration Committee’s current
intention immediately to increase awards to this maximum level).
Secondly, there will also be changes to the performance
conditions in both the Executive Scheme and the LTISP . 
In particular, although awards granted under the LTISP will
continue to have performance conditions based 50% on TSR
and 50% on a financial measure (but with the Remuneration
Committee having the flexibility to alter the relative weights of
the TSR and financial elements as appropriate for executives
below the Executive Committee), the precise performance
measures will be amended as follows:
• As regards the TSR condition, the maximum level of vesting
under the TSR condition will be achieved if the Company’s
TSR outperforms the median of the selected comparator
group by a percentage set by the Remuneration Committee
at the beginning of each three year performance period
designed to be stretching to management. For awards
made in the first year (2006/07), that percentage has been
set at an average of at least nine percentage points per
annum over the three years of the performance period. With
a relatively small comparator group consisting of only 11
food sector companies, it is felt that this ‘outperformance’
approach is much more appropriate than an ‘upper quartile’
basis for maximum vesting, where that level would equate to
a very small number of companies;
• The EPS financial measure will be replaced by a measure
based on Economic Profit (‘EP’), which is calculated as the
difference between (1) net operating profit and (2) an annual
capital charge, which is in turn calculated as the trading
capital employed, multiplied by a weighted average cost of
capital. The Remuneration Committee considers that the
replacement of EPS by EP will improve alignment with the
creation of shareholder value.
The EPS performance measure in the Executive Scheme will
be replaced by an EP measure, with the same threshold level 
as that set for the LTISP .
Resolutions 8 and 9 in the Notice of AGM on page 80 seek
approval for, respectively, the Executive Scheme and the LTISP .
Summaries of the Executive Scheme and the LTISP are set out in
the Explanatory Notes to the Notice of AGM on pages 82 to 85.
• Shareholding guidelines 
In order to align further the interests of executives with those
of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee believes that it is
important for Executive Directors to hold a certain level of Dairy
Crest shares. Consequently, from 2006 Executive Directors will
be required to hold 50% of shares acquired from the Dairy Crest
share and bonus plans until they have built up a shareholding of
one times annual salary. 
28 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006
0346_DC_AR_2006_p23-37  9/6/06  1:40 pm  Page 28 • Sharesave Scheme 
The Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme was established on
30 July 1996 and there have been six grant phases since that
date. It is open to all eligible employees and full time directors.
Employees enter into an approved savings contract over a three
year term to make contributions up to an overall maximum of
£250 per month. At the end of the term employees have the
right to buy ordinary shares in the Company at a price fixed at
the time of the option grant. The price at which the options may
be offered may not be less than 80% of the market price at the
time of option grant.
Under the rules of the Sharesave Scheme no further options
may be granted following the tenth anniversary of the
Company’s flotation, which will occur in August 2006. The
Remuneration Committee considers that the terms of the
Sharesave Scheme remain appropriate and therefore, rather
than adopt a new scheme, seeks approval to extend the life of
the existing Sharesave Scheme to allow options to be granted
until the twentieth anniversary of flotation.
• Pension benefits
All executive directors are members of the Dairy Crest Group
Pension Fund which provides for a pension based upon an
executive’s final pensionable salary. No bonuses are pensionable.
Benefits are restricted by the Inland Revenue earnings cap and
the following supplementary arrangements are in effect.
MrJWDHall is party to a funded unapproved retirement benefit
scheme (‘FURB’). Under this defined contribution scheme an
amount of 42.7% of his salary is contributed by the Group to his
FURB. He is responsible for paying income tax and national
insurance contributions on the amounts paid to the FURB.
Mr M Allen, Mr A S N Murray and Mr P Thornton receive a salary
supplement of 20% of salary above the earnings cap which is
included in basic salary in the emoluments table on page 30. 
Changes in pension legislation came into force on 6 April 2006.
The Company and the trustee of the Dairy Crest Group Pension
Fund have agreed to incorporate a notional earnings cap from
this date. This will prevent any up-rating of the accrued and
future benefits of executive directors. However, in all other
respects it is intended to allow pension fund members, including
the executive directors, the flexibilities afforded under the new
tax regime applicable from April 2006 by making appropriate
amendments to the Fund rules.
Mr JWD Hall’s FURB ceased with effect from 6 April 2006. This
arrangment will be replaced by either an equivalent Company
contribution to an AVC plan or by a cash supplement.
• Beneﬁts in kind 
These include the taxable value of company car benefits, 
life assurance cover and company contributions to medical
insurance plans.
• Service contracts 
In accordance with best practice as set out in the Combined
Code, all executive directors have a notice period not exceeding
one year. All such directors’ service contracts provide explicitly for
termination payments in the event of termination by the Company
other than on grounds of incapacity or in circumstances
justifying summary termination. Payments on termination are
calculated, depending on the age of the director, at 70–90%
of the value of annual salary, benefits, pension and bonus
(not exceeding 25% of annual salary) for the notice period.
A summary of the service agreements of the executive directors
is available on the Company’s website.
Details of the directors offering themselves for election and
re-election at the forthcoming AGM are set out in the Directors’
report on page 35.
Remuneration of the Chairman and 
of non-executive directors
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Board
following a recommendation by the Chief Executive and the
Remuneration Committee in consultation with PwC LLP . Other
non-executive directors receive a basic fee of £30,000 for their
services plus a sum of between £2,500 and £5,000 for the
chairmanship of a Board Committee. Their remuneration is
determined by the Board, also in consultation with PwC LLP .
The total fees for non-executive directors remain within the limit
of £400,000 set out in the Articles of Association. There are no
pre-determined special provisions for non-executive directors
with regard to compensation in the event of loss of office.

Charitable donations amounted to £0.1 million (2005:
£0.1 million) in the year. Small contributions, mainly of product,
were also made to local charities. No contributions were made
to any political party.
Supplier payment policy
Payment dates are established according to the agreed date 
of delivery of goods or provision of services and the receipt of 
a correct invoice. The Group agrees the length of payment
terms with each of its suppliers as part of the overall purchasing
agreement. It is the Group’s policy to abide by these agreed
terms of payment. The number of days’ purchases in the
Group’s payables at 31 March 2006 was 31 days (2005:
24 days). The Company has no trade payables and therefore
the number of days purchases in payables is not relevant.

Directors’ report continued
Auditors
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. 
The directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have
taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s
auditors are aware of that information.
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue
as auditors of the Company. A resolution to reappoint Ernst &
Young LLP as the Company’s auditors will be put to the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the Chartered
Accountants’ Hall, Moorgate Place, London EC2P 2BJ on
Thursday 20 July 2006 at 11.00 am. Details of the resolutions 
to be proposed, including items of special business, are given 
in the Notice of Annual General Meeting and Explanatory Notes
which appear on pages 80 to 85.
The directors believe that the resolutions are in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and
unanimously recommend that shareholders should vote in
favour of all resolutions.
Post balance sheet event
On 4 April 2006, the Group completed a private debt placement
in the US and raised £133 million (US$233 million) in US$ loan
notes and £10 million in Sterling loan notes. The loan notes
mature in two tranches of 7 and 10 years. Currency swaps have
been put in place to convert the US$ debt into Sterling at fixed
rates. The effective interest rate on the combined issue is 5.3%.
On completion of this transaction and subsequent repayment of
certain term loans of £90 million and cancellation of £20 million
of the revolving credit facility, Group long-term borrowing
facilities, including finance leases, total £456 million with a
significantly longer maturity profile.
Going concern
It should be recognised that any consideration of the
foreseeable future involves making a judgement, at a particular
point in time, about future events which are inherently uncertain.
Nevertheless, at the time of preparation of these accounts and
after making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources
to continue operating for the foreseeable future. For this reason
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the accounts.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
for the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union.
The directors are required to prepare financial statements for
each financial year which present fairly the financial position of
the Company and of the Group and the financial performance
and cash flows of the Company and the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are
required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information;
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and
performance; and
• State that the Company has complied with IFRSs, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and of the Group and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with
the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and, therefore, for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud or other irregularities.

Basis of preparation
Dairy Crest Group plc has been required to adopt International
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) with effect from 1 April
2005. The results for the year ended 31 March 2006 represent
the Group’s first Annual Report and Accounts prepared in
accordance with IFRS. Previously the Group reported under 
UK generally accepted accounting principles (‘UK GAAP’).
Detailed UK GAAP to IFRS reconciliations of equity for the date
of transition, 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 and of the profit
for the year ended 31 March 2005 are shown in Note 35 to the
accounts on page 70.
Under the exemption available in IFRS 1, ‘First-time Adoption of
IFRS’ the Group has not restated its financial information for the
year ended 31 March 2005 for the effect of IAS 32, ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ or IAS 39, ‘Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. This comparative
financial information has been prepared in accordance with UK
GAAP. Additional financial instruments of £0.3 million (net of
deferred tax) have been recognised on the balance sheet from 
1 April 2005 as reported in the Group’s IFRS reconciliations as
published on 7 November 2005 and available on the Group’s
website. Had IAS 32 and IAS 39 been applied from 1 April
2004, all derivative instruments would have been brought onto
the balance sheet at fair value. 
The consolidated and Company financial statements are
presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest
0.1 million (£ million) except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements of Dairy Crest Group plc
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union (‘EU’).The Company financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 1985. The Company has taken advantage of
the exemption provided under section 230 of the Companies
Act 1985 not to publish its individual income statement and
related notes.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant
risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the
measurement of the impairment of goodwill and measurement
of defined benefit obligations. The Group determines whether
goodwill is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an
estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to
which goodwill is allocated. This requires estimation of future
cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
Measurement of defined benefit obligations requires estimation
of future changes in salaries and inflation, as well as mortality
rates, the expected return on plan assets and the choice of a
suitable discount rate.
The Group has implemented the following standards earlier 
than required and restated the prior year comparatives in line
with them:
IAS 19: Amendment (EU adopted) – Actuarial Gains and
Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued
Operations.
There was no impact on the Group on the adoption of IFRS 5.
The impact on the Group on the adoption of IAS 19 is to
recognise any liability in respect of defined benefit pension
schemes in the consolidated balance sheet and any actuarial
gain or loss in the consolidated statement of recognised income
and expense. Further details are given below in the accounting
policy dealing with retirement benefit obligations.
During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following
standards and interpretations with an effective date after the
date of these accounts:
International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS)
IFRS 4: Insurance Contracts (Amendment to IAS 39 and 
IFRS 4) 1 January 2006.
IFRS 6: Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Assets
IFRS 6: Amendment relating to IFRS 6.
IFRS 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007.
IAS 1: Amendment – Presentation of Financial Statements:
Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007.
IAS 39: Fair Value Option 1 January 2006.
IAS 39: Cash Flow Hedge Accounting 1 January 2006.
IAS 39: Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 – Financial
Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006.
International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee (IFRIC)
IFRIC 4: Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
(effective 1 January 2006).
IFRIC 5: Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning,
Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds 
(effective 1 January 2006).
IFRIC 6: Liabilities arising from Participating in a Specific Market
– Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 
(effective 1 December 2005).
IFRIC 7: Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29 –
Financial Reporting in Hyper Inflationary Economies 
(effective 1 March 2006).
IFRIC 8: Scope of IFRS 2 (effective 1 May 2006).
IFRIC 9: Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 
(effective 1 June 2006).
Upon adoption of IFRS 7 the Group will need to disclose the 
fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in
greater detail although there will be no effect on reported income
or net assets. Upon adoption of IFRS 4: Insurance Contracts
(Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4) the Company will be

0346_DC_AR_2006_p38-67  7/6/06  8:32 am  Page 42 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 43
required to record the fair value of certain financial guarantees
issued. Apart from these the directors do not anticipate that
the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have
a material impact on the Group’s or Company’s accounts in the
period of initial application.
Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of
Dairy Crest Group plc and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 March
each year using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany
balances and transactions, including unrealised profits and
losses arising from intra-group transactions, have been
eliminated in full. 
Subsidiaries acquired during the year are consolidated from 
the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Minority
interests represent the 20% interests in Wexford Creamery
Limited and Haverfordwest Cheese Limited not held by
the Group.
Interest in joint ventures
The Group’s investment in joint ventures are accounted for under
the equity method of accounting. Joint ventures are entities of
which the Group has joint control under contractual agreement
and are not subsidiaries. The reporting date of the major joint
venture, Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited, is not identical to the Group
although financial statements are prepared to 31 March each
year. The Company and joint ventures both use consistent
accounting policies. The investment in joint ventures is carried 
in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in
the Group’s share of net assets of the joint ventures, less any
impairment in value and any distributions received. The income
statement reflects the share of the results of the joint ventures.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the joint
ventures’ equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes
and discloses this, when applicable, in the consolidated
statement of recognised income and expense.
Foreign currency translation 
The functional and presentational currency of Dairy Crest Group
plc and its United Kingdom subsidiaries is Pound Sterling (£).
The functional currency of Wexford Creamery Limited, a
subsidiary company incorporated in Ireland, is the Euro. 
Transactions in foreign currency are initially recorded in the
functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into Sterling at the balance sheet date. Exchange
differences on monetary items are taken to the income
statement, except where deferred in equity as qualifying cash
flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. 
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are
translated into sterling at year end exchange rates. The results
of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at average
rates of exchange for the year (being an approximation of actual
exchange rates). Exchange differences arising from the
retranslation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries at year
end exchange rates, less exchange differences on borrowings,
which finance or provide a hedge against those undertakings
are taken to a separate component of equity as long as IFRS
hedge accounting conditions are met. Exchange differences
relating to foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge
against a net investment in a foreign entity remain in equity until
the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are
recognised in the consolidated income statement. Tax charges
and credits attributable to exchange differences on those
borrowings are also dealt with in equity.
In accordance with transitional provisions of IFRS 1 ‘First-time
Adoption of IFRS’, the cumulative translation reserve by entity
has been set to nil at the date of transition to IFRS.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any impairment losses. Cost comprises the
purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the
asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be
capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost (less residual
value) of property, plant and equipment, excluding freehold land,
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets as follows:
Freehold buildings: 25 years
Leasehold land and buildings: 25 years or, if shorter,
the period of the lease
Office equipment: 4 to 6 years
Factory plant and equipment: 6 to 20 years
Vehicles: 4 to 10 years
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying
value exceeds the estimated recoverable value, the asset is
written down to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount
of plant and equipment is the greater of the fair value less costs
to sell or value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash
flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses
are charged to the consolidated income statement.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon
disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to
arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising
on derecognition of the asset is included in the consolidated
income statement in the year that it is derecognised.

44 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred
in accordance with IAS 23: Borrowing Costs.
Investments
The Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at
cost being the fair value of consideration paid. Income is
recognised from these investments only in relation to distributions
received from post-acquisition profits. Distributions received in
excess of post-acquisition profits are deducted from the cost
of investment.
Goodwill
Goodwill recognised under UK GAAP prior to the date of
transition to IFRS is stated at the net book value as at this date
and is not subsequently amortised. Goodwill on acquisition is
initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the
business combination over the Group’s (acquirer’s) interest in
the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value may be impaired. All goodwill was tested for impairment at
the time of transition to IFRS and no impairment was identified.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to
the cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units
expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount
of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Where
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than
the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Where
goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the
operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount
of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal
of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is
measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation
disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
The Group’s cash-generating units, for the purpose of
considering goodwill, are ‘Dairies’, ‘Spreads’, ‘Speciality Cheese’
and ‘Cheese excluding Speciality Cheese’. These represent the
lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for management
purposes and are no larger than the segments being ‘Dairies’
and ‘Foods’.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 April 1998 has been
charged against the merger reserve and will remain set off
against reserves even if the related investment becomes
impaired or the business sold.
The Group has not restated business combinations prior to the
transition date of 1 April 2004. Acquisitions prior to this date are
recorded under previous accounting rules. IFRS 1 requires that
an impairment review of goodwill should be conducted in
accordance with IAS 36 at the date of transition and at the
balance sheet date. Dairy Crest has performed this review and
no adjustment was required.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business
are capitalised at fair value separately from goodwill if the fair
value can be measured reliably on initial recognition and the
future expected economic benefits flow to the Group. Following
initial recognition, the carrying amount of an intangible asset is its
cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated
impairment losses. The useful lives of intangible assets are
assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Currently, all the Group’s
intangible assets have finite useful lives and are amortised over
three to five years. Intangibles with a finite life are amortised to
the consolidated income statement using a methodology that
matches management’s estimate of how the benefit of the
assets will be recovered. Useful lives are also examined on an
annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a
prospective basis. 
Intangible assets acquired separately from business
combinations include software development expenditure.
Software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Software is amortised over five years. Intangible assets that are
not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually either
individually or at the cash-generating unit level or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may be impaired. 
Research and development
Expenditure on research is written off as incurred. Development
expenditure is also written off as incurred unless the future
recoverability of this expenditure can reasonably be assured 
as required by IAS 38: Intangible Assets.
Recoverable amount of non-current assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there 
is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an
indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal
estimate of recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount 
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is
considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or
cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value 
in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset
does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of
those from other assets or groups of assets.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost includes the purchase price of raw materials
(on a first-in first-out basis), direct labour and a proportion of
manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity
incurred in bringing each product to its present location and
0346_DC_AR_2006_p38-67  7/6/06  8:32 am  Page 44 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 45
condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price 
in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of
completion and selling costs.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at
original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable
amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when
collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts
are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand
and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three
months or less. For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow
statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash
equivalents as defined above, net of bank overdrafts.
Interest bearing loans
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value
of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with
the borrowing. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by
taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or
premium on settlement. Gains and losses are recognised in net
profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised.
Net debt
The Group defines net debt as cash and cash equivalents plus
interest bearing loans and finance leases. The calculation of net
debt excludes the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Retirement benefit obligations
The liability in respect of defined benefit schemes is the present
value of the relevant defined benefit obligation at the balance
sheet date less the fair value of plan assets and an adjustment
for past service costs not yet recognised. The independent
actuaries complete a full actuarial valuation of the Dairy Crest
Group pension fund and the Wexford Creamery plan triennially.
The obligation is updated annually for financial reporting
purposes by the actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the obligation is determined by the
estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high
quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity
approximating the terms of the related liability. 
The current service costs are recognised in operating costs in
the consolidated income statement. Past service costs are
included in operating costs where the benefits have vested,
otherwise they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period. The expected return on assets of funded defined
benefit schemes and the interest on pension scheme liabilities
comprise the finance element of the pension cost and the
difference between these amounts are included in other finance
income or costs. Actuarial gains and losses arising from
experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are recognised in full and are charged or credited to the
consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in
the period in which they arise.
Share based payments
Equity-based performance payments
The Group has issued equity-settled share based payments 
for which the Group receives services from employees in
consideration for the equity instrument. Equity-settled share
based payments are measured at fair value at the grant date 
by an external valuer using a Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
The costs of equity-settled transactions are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. The cumulative
expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each
reporting date until vesting reflects the expired vesting period
and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors,
will eventually vest (after adjusting for the expected achievement
of non-market performance conditions). The amount charged to
the consolidated income statement is credited to reserves.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately 
vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional on market
conditions, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether
the market conditions are satisfied.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase
the Group’s ordinary shares at 80% of the fair value at the grant
date (Sharesave Scheme). The Group records an expense,
based on the estimate of the 20% discount related to the
shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period using a Black Scholes option pricing model.
Employees’ Share Ownership Plan (‘ESOP’)
The shares in the Company held by the Dairy Crest Employees’
Share Ownership Plan Trust to satisfy Long Term Incentive
Share Plan awards are presented as a deduction from equity in
arriving at shareholders’ equity. Consideration received from the
sale of such shares is also recognised in equity with no gain or
loss recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The Group and Company have not adopted the exemption to
apply IFRS 2 share based payments only to awards made after
7 November 2002.
Leased assets
Assets acquired under finance leases, which transfer to the
Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to
ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception
of the lease at fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the
present value of the minimum lease payments. The net present
value of future lease rentals is included as a liability on the
balance sheet. The interest element of lease rentals is charged
to the consolidated income statement in the year. Leases
where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits
of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
0346_DC_AR_2006_p38-67  7/6/06  8:32 am  Page 45 Accounting policies continued
46 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006
Operating lease rentals are charged to the consolidated income
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Revenue
Revenue on sale of food and dairy products is recognised on
delivery. Revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of
goods net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after
eliminating sales within the Group. 
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to
receive payment is established.
Other income
Other income comprises the profit on disposal of closed sites
and household depots. 
Exceptional items
Certain items are recorded separately in the consolidated
income statement as exceptional. Only items of a material,
one-off nature, which result from a restructuring of the business
or some other event are disclosed in this manner in order to
give a better understanding of the underlying operational
performance of the Group. The profits arising on disposal of
closed sites, other than as a result of depot rationalisation, are
reported within operating exceptional items. Exceptional items
are not excluded from the basic earnings per share calculation.
Government and other grants
Government grants are initially recognised at their fair value
where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be
received and all attaching conditions will be complied with.
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as
income over the periods necessary to match the grant on a
systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate.
Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to
a deferred income account and is released to the consolidated
income statement over the expected useful life of the relevant
asset in equal annual instalments.
Income tax
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation
authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at
the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting
purposes, except as indicated below.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable
temporary differences except:
• where the deferred income tax liability arises from initial
recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination
and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests 
in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable
that the temporary differences will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible
temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable
profit will be available against which the deductible temporary
differences, the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused
tax losses can be utilised except:
• where the deferred income tax asset relating to the
deductible temporary difference arises from the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination and, at the time of the
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor 
taxable profit or loss; and 
• in respect of deductible temporary differences associated
with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests 
in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to
the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences
will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will 
be available against which the temporary differences can 
be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available
to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be
utilised. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates 
(and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted
at the balance sheet date. Income tax relating to items
recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and 
not in the income statement.
Derivative instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward
currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks
associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at
fair value and subsequently re-measured to fair value for the
reported balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by
reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with
similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap
contracts is determined by reference to market values for 
similar instruments. 
0346_DC_AR_2006_p38-67  7/6/06  8:32 am  Page 46 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 47
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified 
as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to
changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or cash
flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash
flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast
transaction, or a firm commitment in relation to foreign exchange
exposure. The Group has not entered into any fair value hedges
during the year.
Cash flow hedges
In relation to cash flow hedges which meet the conditions 
for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the
hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge
is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is
recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
When the hedged firm commitment (in relation to foreign
exchange exposure) or the highly probable forecast transactions
results in the recognition of a non-monetary asset or a liability,
then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the
associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised
in equity are included in the initial measurement of the
acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are
recognised in equity are transferred to the consolidated income
statement in the same year in which the hedged item affects the
net profit and loss, for example when the future sale actually
occurs. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting,
any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken
directly to the consolidated income statement for the year.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies
for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain
or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity under a
cash flow hedge is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction
occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur,
the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is
transferred to the consolidated income statement for the year. 
Previously, under UK GAAP , the accounting policy for financial
instruments was as follows:
Interest rate swaps were not revalued to fair value or shown in
the Group’s balance sheet at year end. Interest rate differentials
were recognised by accruing the net interest payable.
Gains and losses on forward currency contracts were offset
against the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related
financial assets and liabilities, or where the instrument is used to
hedge a committed or probable future transaction, were deferred
until the transaction occurred.

1 Segmental information
The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the Group’s risks and rates of return are affected predominantly 
by differences in the products produced. The Group is organised and managed in two divisions, Foods and Dairies according to the nature of the
products sold and markets serviced. The Household business is included within the Dairies segment as its operations are considered to be mutually
interdependent with the Liquid Products business. In the year ended 31 March 2005, the business segments were defined as Consumer Foods and
Foods Services. The change in composition of these segments to Foods and Dairies better reflects the split of risks and returns of the Group’s
operations. Prior year comparative numbers have been restated. The impact of this restatement was to reallocate certain elements of the Liquid
Products business, that had previously been reported under Consumer Foods, into the new Dairies segment. The impact on revenue, the
comparatives for which have not been affected by the conversion to IFRS, was to reduce Consumer Foods by £281.8 million to £517.3 million now
reported as Foods. Inter-segment sales are not material. All revenue is derived from the sale of goods.
The Group’s geographical segments are based on the location of the Group’s assets. Turnover originates principally in the United Kingdom and
assets and liabilities are located principally in the United Kingdom and therefore no geographical segment disclosures have been made for these
items. Sales to external customers disclosed in geographical segments are based on the geographical location of its customers.
The following tables present revenue, profit and certain assets and liabilities by segment for the years ended 31 March 2006 and 2005.

The Group continues to rationalise its household operations as a result of the ongoing decline in doorstep volumes. This rationalisation includes the
closure of certain depots (the profit on which is shown above), acquisition of small infill dairy businesses and rationalisation of the ongoing household
operations. These activities represent a fundamental part of the ongoing ordinary activities of the household operations. The net profit on rationalisation
of the household business, after deducting related rationalisation costs, amounted to £3.9 million in the year ended 31 March 2006 (2005: £3.1 million).

Restructuring costs in the year ended 31 March 2006 relate to the Dairies segment and represent costs of:
(i) integrating the acquisition of the dairy business of the Midlands Co-operative Society into the Group. The integration resulted in an exceptional
cost of £12.7 million, being £3.5 million of redundancy costs, £1.0 million of asset write-downs, £4.5 million of duplicate running costs 
(as volume was transferred from the Birmingham dairy to other parts of the Group up to its closure in February 2006) and £3.7 million of other
rationalisation costs.
(ii) integrating the Arla London Foodservice business into the Group which amounted to £2.6 million, of which £1.6 million related to redundancy
costs and £1.0 million related to other rationalisation costs.
The cash cost of the exceptional items described above amounted to £14.3 million in the year ended 31 March 2006. These were all incurred in the
Dairies segment.
Further to a review of the value in use of the goodwill and assets of the speciality cheese business (part of the Foods segment), an impairment to the
carrying value of goodwill (£2.3 million) and property, plant and equipment (£7.0 million) has been recognised. Further details describing the
impairment test and resulting write-down are set out in Note 11.
The profit on disposal of closed sites related to a surplus dairy in Newport which was sold in March 2006 for a consideration of £1.7 million resulting
in a profit on disposal of £1.4 million.
Restructuring costs of £1.1 million in the year ended 31 March 2005 principally related to the final commissioning of the creamery at Davidstow. 
In addition, there was a £0.7 million profit on the disposal of closed dairy sites.
The Group’s share of joint ventures’ exceptional items, after tax, amounted to £0.8 million in the year ended 31 March 2006 and related to a profit on
disposal of a closed factory in Enfield (see Note 14). The share of joint ventures’ exceptional items, after tax, in the year ended 31 March 2005 was
£2.8 million representing restructuring costs related to factory closures.

The Group has trading tax losses which arose in the UK of £7.0 million (2005: £7.0 million) that are available indefinitely for offset against future
taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not
be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and they have arisen in subsidiaries that have been loss-making for some time.
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of £66.5 million (2005: £66.5 million) that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable
gains. Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is no foreseeable prospect of their being utilised. The Group has
realised capital gains amounting to £39.6 million (2005: £33.6 million) for which rollover relief claims have or are intended to be made. No deferred
tax liability has been recognised in relation to these gains because there is no prospect of a chargeable gain arising on the disposal of the
replacement assets.
At 31 March 2006, there was no recognised deferred tax liability (2005: nil) for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the
Group’s subsidiaries in Ireland as the Group has determined that retained profits will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. The deferred tax
liability arising from the investments in these subsidiaries, which has not been recognised, is £2.4 million (2005: £2.1 million).

8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) amounts are calculated by dividing profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the
conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees’ Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOP’) are excluded from the weighted average number of shares 
in issue used in the calculation of earnings per share.
To show earnings per share on a consistent basis, which in the directors’ opinion reflects the ongoing performance of the business more appropriately,
adjusted earnings per share have been calculated. The computation for basic and diluted earnings per share (including adjusted earnings per share)
are as follows:

Impairment testing of goodwill
Acquired goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to four groups of cash generating units (‘CGUs’): Dairies, Spreads, Speciality
Cheese and Cheese excluding Speciality Cheese. All CGUs are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with
its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial
budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period. The discount rate applied to the projections is 8% (2005:
8%). The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for Spreads and Cheese excluding Speciality Cheese is 2.5% pa
(being the UK long-term growth rate). The growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three-year period for the Speciality Cheese and
Dairies CGUs is 0%. The extrapolated growth rate for Dairies reflects the underlying decline in the doorstep business within the wider Dairies CGU.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to CGUs at 31 March 2006 is:
Dairies £61.5 million (2005: £38.5 million)
Spreads £65.5 million (2005: £65.5 million)
Speciality Cheese Nil (2005: £2.3 million)
Cheese excluding Speciality Cheese £4.1 million (2005: £4.1 million)

11 Goodwill (continued)
The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations:
Gross margin – budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input
and output price changes, volume changes, new initiatives and anticipated efficiency improvements. The budgeted margins form the basis for
strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends. Gross margin percentages beyond three years are assumed to be constant.
Discount rates – reflect management’s estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Group. This is the benchmark
used internally by management to assess operating performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals.
Raw materials prices – budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available. The key resources are milk,
vegetable oils, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates – for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research
adjusted downwards to reflect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three-year time frame. For the household business within Dairies, long-term
rates of market decline as seen over recent years have been extrapolated forward.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each cash-generating unit and to be realistically
achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
With regard to the assessment of value in use of the Spreads and Cheese excluding Speciality Cheese CGUs, management believes that no
reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount. 
For the Dairies CGU, there are reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its
recoverable amount. These are discussed as follows:
Future growth rates: Management has assumed no growth after year three in the value in use calculation. Should the decline in the household
business more than offset growth in the liquid products business, resulting in an overall rate of decline beyond year three, value in use for the CGU
could be reduced to a value approximately equal to its carrying amount.
Gross margins: Management has assumed stable gross margins after year three in the value in use calculation. Should the margin percentage
deteriorate, value in use could be reduced towards a value approximately equal to its carrying amount.
Following an assessment of the value-in-use of the Speciality Cheese CGU, goodwill has been written down to nil (2005: £2.3 million). Management
continues to take actions to improve the efficiency and profitability of the Speciality Cheese CGU but, despite a good Christmas, the Stilton market 
in particular continues to be challenging. These market pressures inevitably impact the cash generating capacity of this CGU and management
considers it necessary to recognise an impairment to reflect this. The total impairment to the carrying value of assets is £9.3 million comprising a
£2.3 million write-down of goodwill and a £7.0 million write-down of property, plant and equipment (see Note 10).

Term loans are repayable in six-monthly instalments commencing 18 months before the date of maturity. The multi-currency revolving credit facility 
is repayable in June 2009. Details of the Group’s interest rate management strategy and interest rate swaps are included in Notes 29 and 30.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans becoming
immediately repayable. These covenants specify maximum net debt to EBITDA, and minimum EBITDA to interest ratios. No covenants were
contravened in the year ended 31 March 2006.
20 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group has two defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees, both of which require contributions to be made to
separately administered funds. These comprise the Dairy Crest Group pension fund and the Wexford Creamery Limited pension fund. The Dairy Crest
Group pension fund will be closed for new employees joining after 30 June 2006. Employees joining after this date will be invited to join a Dairy Crest
Group defined contribution plan. Yoplait Dairy Crest, a 49% owned joint venture also has a defined benefit pension plan. The most recent full actuarial
valuation of the Dairy Crest Group pension fund was carried out as at 31 March 2004 by the fund’s independent actuary using the projected unit
credit method. Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially.
The Group has charged £0.2 million (2005: £0.2 million) in respect of a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme (‘FURB’) for a director whose
benefits are restricted by Inland Revenue limits. Under this defined contribution scheme, 42.7% of salary was contributed by the Group to his FURB
in the year ended 31 March 2006 (2005: 42.7%).
The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement and amounts recognised
in the consolidated balance sheet for the defined benefit plans. These plans are all wholly funded.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense since 1 April 2004 are £34.9 million 
(2005: £2.3 million loss) and in the Company statement of recognised income and expense is nil (2005: nil). The directors are unable to determine
how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity of £93.2 million is attributable to actuarial 
gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes. Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains 
and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004.

Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates. The expected rate of return on equities of 8% reflects historic
UK equity returns and is within the range of assumptions typically used by companies of a similar size. The expected rate of return on bonds of 4.9%
is based upon the gross redemption yield available on a similar profile of gilts and corporate bonds.
Included in the above analysis is the Wexford Creamery pension fund. The net benefit expense in the year ended 31 March 2006 amounted to 
£0.3 million (2005: £0.3 million). The fair value of plan assets at 31 March 2006 was £7.1 million (2005: £5.5 million) and the defined benefit
obligation was £9.4 million (2005: £7.8 million) resulting in a scheme deficit of £2.3 million (2005: £2.3 million).

£27 million being 30% of pensionable salaries. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of plan assets and the plan deficit
were £549.3 million, £456.0 million and £93.3 million respectively at 1 April 2004.
The Company recognises no liabilities on its balance sheet, or charges or credits in its income statement or statement of recognised income 
and expense in relation to the Group pension plans. The legal sponsor of the Dairy Crest Group pension plan is Dairy Crest Limited.

Reconciliations of movements in equity are restated for the impact of transition to International Financial Reporting Standards.
The merger reserve includes the premium on shares issued to satisfy the purchase of Dairy Crest Limited in 1996. The cumulative amount of
goodwill charged against the merger reserve is £86.8 million (2005: £86.8 million). The reserve is not distributable.
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees’ Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOP’) are available to satisfy awards under LTISP and ESOS. 
The QUEST was terminated in April 2005 and held no shares at 31 March 2006. During the year ended 31 March 2005 850,389 shares were issued 
to the QUEST at a premium of £3.4 million for an aggregate consideration of £3.6 million.
At 31 March 2006 the ESOP held 489,075 shares (2005: 535,791 shares) in the Company at a cost of £1.5 million (2005: £1.6 million). The ESOP
was established in August 1996 to purchase shares in the Company in order to hedge certain future obligations of the Group including shares
awarded under the LTISP and the ESOS. During the year the Trustee of the ESOP issued 46,716 (2005: 725,331) shares following exercises of 
LTISP options. The market value of the shares held by the ESOP which are listed on the London Stock Exchange was £2.3 million at 31 March 2006 
(2005: £2.5 million).
The hedging reserve records the movements on designated hedging items, offset by any movements recognised directly in equity on underlying hedging items.
The translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries offset
by the movements on loans and derivatives used to hedge the net investment in foreign subsidiaries.

As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate profit and loss account is presented for the Company. The profit for the 
year dealt with in the accounts of the Company is £18.1 million (2005: £50.8 million) including dividends received from subsidiary companies 
of £20 million (2005: Nil). Dividends paid amounted to £25.6 million (2005: £23.7 million) which, along with a credit for share based payments 
of £0.2 million (2005: £0.3 million) resulted in a £7.3 million decrease in retained earnings (2005: £27.4 million increase).
In 1996 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Dairy Crest Limited. Consideration was in the form of cash and the issue 
of 109.8 million ordinary shares of 25 pence each. The fair value of the shares issued was estimated as £170.2 million. The capital reserve 
of £142.7 million represents the difference between the fair value of shares issued and their nominal value of £27.5 million.
25 Share based payment plans
Group
The Group has three share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan (‘LTISP’)
This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for 
a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on total shareholder return (‘TSR’) over a three year period versus comparator
companies and growth in earnings per share. The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is three years with an exercise period of seven
years. On 7 July 2005, 632,186 options were granted under the LTISP scheme (July 2004: 763,264). There are no cash settlement alternatives
available to the participants of the scheme.

Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme
All UK employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase shares.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares. No financial performance criteria are attached to these options
and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months. On 12 December 2005 1,611,689 options were granted
under the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme at a grant price of 388 pence. No options were granted in the year ended 31 March 2005. There are no
cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy Crest Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’)
Options granted under the Dairy Crest ESOS to subscribe for the Company’s shares can be exercised up to 2012. No options have been granted
under this scheme since 22 July 2002. There are no cash settlement alternatives available to the participants of the scheme.
The number of share options and weighted average exercise price for each of the schemes is set out as follows:

* The weighted average exercise price for LTISP options is nil.
Share options outstanding at 31 March 2006 are exercisable at varying dates up to July 2012 at prices of 189p, 341.5p and 415p (ESOS) and 
up to September 2009 at prices ranging from 368p to 388p (Sharesave Scheme). LTISP options are exercisable at varying dates up to July 2015. 
The remaining average weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2006 is 8.39 years for the LTISP , 5.18 years for the
ESOS and 2.67 years for the Sharesave Scheme (2005: 8.45 years, 5.79 years and 2.09 years respectively). The weighted average share price at
the time of exercise of LTISP options was £4.89 (2005: £3.91), on exercise of ESOS options was £4.75 (2005: none) and on exercise of Sharesave
options was £4.77 (2005: £4.33).
The fair value factor of the Sharesave Scheme options issued in December 2005 is 31% giving a fair value of £1.50 per option granted. This has
been computed using a Black Scholes option pricing model. The number of share options granted has been adjusted for leavers in the period to 
31 March 2006. The key assumptions used in the valuation model for the December 2005 grant were: Expected share price volatility 28%, risk free
rate of interest 4.1% and dividend yield 3.5%. The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price
over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of the option. There were no Sharesave Scheme options
granted during the year ended 31 March 2005.
The LTISP has market and non-market based performance conditions. The fair value of the market performance element of the LTISP awards is
calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model. The fair value factor for the award made in July 2005 is 65% (July 2004: 48%) giving a fair
value of £3.12 per option granted (2005: £1.91). The non-market performance element of the LTISP is based on earnings per share and the charge
for this is the value of shares expected to vest calculated by reference to the share price at the date of grant. The earnings per share condition is not
expected to be satisfied for any of the unvested LTISPs and therefore no charge has been assumed for this element. Volatility assumptions are made
for Dairy Crest Group plc and comparator companies based on historical volatility of share prices over a period commensurate with the option life. 
The input assumptions for the LTISP grant in the year ended 31 March 2006 were as follows:
Term 3 years (2005: 3 years)
Volatility 28% (2005: 26%)
Risk free rate 4.1% (2005: 5.0%)
Average volatility of comparator TSR 22% (2005: 32%)
TSR correlation (Dairy Crest vs comparators) 9% (2005: 11%)
The expected life of the LTISP options is assumed to be equal to the vesting period, being three years.
The Group expense arising from share option plans for the year ended 31 March 2006 is £1.1 million (2005: £1.7 million) (See Note 9).

wider business. As a result, disclosure of the profit for the year ended 31 March 2006 is impracticable. The revenue and profit of the Group for the
year ended 31 March 2006, assuming the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2005 would not be materially different from the actual revenue and profit

Notes to the financial statements continued
28 Business combinations (continued)
The businesses and assets of the Midlands Co-operative Society, Arla’s London Foodservice and the smaller bottled milk buyers have been fully
integrated and absorbed into the Group’s wider Dairy operations. As a result, disclosure of the profit for the year ended 31 March 2006 is
impracticable. The Midlands Co-operative Society acquisition completed on 16 May 2005 and the revenue and profit of the Group for the year
ended 31 March 2006, assuming the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2005 would not be materially different from the actual revenue and profit
reported in the consolidated income statement. 
Included in goodwill are certain intangible assets that cannot be separably identified and measured due to their nature. In the case of Household
acquisitions, this includes acquired milk round lists. Management believes that goodwill represents value to the Group for which the recognition 
of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted. The majority of the value was assessed to comprise of synergy benefits expected to be achieved 
by merging the business acquired into the Group’s existing operations.
During the year ended 31 March 2005 the Group acquired the remaining 44% interest in English Butter Marketing Company Limited for a cash
consideration of £4.6 million giving rise to goodwill on acquisition of £4.6 million. In addition, the Group acquired the goodwill of a number of bottled
milk buyers for a cash consideration of £6.3 million. The fair value of the net assets acquired was £0.3 million resulting in goodwill of £6.0 million.
29 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose
of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade
receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts. The purpose is to manage the
interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. It is, and has been throughout the year under review,
the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. The Group’s accounting policies in relation
to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to ensure that forecast net borrowings plus a reasonable operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which
mature at least 12 months after the year end. At 31 March 2006 the Group’s total credit facilities amounted to £405 million (2005: £470 million)
excluding finance leases of £18 million (2005: £18 million). The facility consists of a five year term loan of £80 million repayable in four semi-annual
instalments from December 2007 to June 2009 (2005: £80.0 million), a £270 million five year multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at
maturity in June 2009 (2005: £270 million) and a five year term loan of £55 million repayable in three semi-annual instalments from September 2006
to September 2007 (2005: £120.0 million). The Group has undrawn long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2006 of £128.3 million (2005:
£233.4 million). Short-term funding requirements are met through uncommitted overdraft and short-term facilities amounting to over £20 million. New
facilities were put in place in April 2006 and are described in Note 33 – Post balance sheet events. 
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with a floating interest rate.
The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts. The Group’s policy is to keep between one third and
three quarters of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest. To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, in
which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference
to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations. At 31 March 2006, after taking into
account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 40% of the Group’s borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest (2005: 75%).
Foreign currency risk
Transaction exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of our overseas subsidiary, Wexford Creamery Limited. Our policy is to hedge between
80% and 100% of the net asset exposure through borrowings in the relevant foreign currency. At present, our only translation exposure is in Euros.
The majority of the Group’s transactions are carried out in Sterling and so transaction exposures are limited. The Group trades skimmed milk
products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and Central and South America. The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products,
bulk butter, Stilton and other branded products. The Group’s policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases to be hedged by foreign exchange
contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be fixed. In addition, a substantial part of Yoplait Dairy Crest’s
purchases are denominated in Euros which are hedged up to one year in advance by foreign exchange contracts.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the
project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Commodity risk
The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Group’s businesses. The principal non-milk
commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity and crude oil by-products (used in packaging). The Group
monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability. In certain circumstances, forward contracts
have been put in place in order to fix future prices, principally for gas and electricity. These contracts are only entered into with the approval of the
executive directors.
Credit risk
It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The Group only offers these
terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s
exposure to bad debts is not significant.

29 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)
The household business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis. Cash and debt management is a crucial part of this
business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors
and certain derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty. The maximum exposure for the Group
is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of £157.5 million (2005: £151.2 million). There are no significant concentrations of credit risk. 
All borrowings are through banks with strong long-term credit ratings. Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested overnight
through deposit accounts with commercial banks with a credit rating of AA or better. The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for 
a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be low.

The above table excludes trade and other receivables and payables as their fair value approximates carrying value. The fair value of interest rate
swaps and forward currency contracts has been determined by the third party financial institution with whom the Group holds the instrument, in line
with the market value of similar instruments. The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at
prevailing interest rates.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by maturity, of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk.

*These have been classified as fixed rate after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.
Interest rate swaps
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2006 was £100 million (2005: £170 million). All interest
rate swaps are cash flow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting with the exception of two swaps which have a fair value of nil at
31 March 2006. At 31 March 2006 the fixed interest rates vary from 5.40% to 5.71% (2005: 5.06% to 6.54%). The loss deferred in equity will reverse
in the income statement during the next four years.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity
The Group has Euro denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net asset investment in Wexford Creamery Limited, 
its subsidiary in Ireland. The fair value of the Euro borrowings at 31 March 2006 was £15.3 million (2005: £15.3 million). The foreign exchange gain 
of nil (2005: loss of £0.5 million) on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in reserves.

Forward currency contracts
The Group has entered into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and receipts.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2006 of £128.3 million (2005: £233.4 million) in respect of
which all conditions precedent had been met at that date. These undrawn facilities expire in June 2009. On 21 April 2006, £90 million of term loans
were repaid and cancelled and a further £20 million was cancelled from the multi-currency revolving credit facility. These facilities were replaced by
loan notes of £143 million issued on 4 April 2006 maturing between seven and ten years. See Note 33.
2005 Disclosures
The following comparatives are disclosed to meet the remaining requirements in order to comply with FRS 13 ‘Derivatives and other financial

On 4 April 2006, the Group completed a private debt placement in the US, and raised £133 million (US$233 million) in US$ loan notes and
£10 million in Sterling loan notes. The loan notes mature in two tranches of seven and ten years. Currency swaps have been put in place to convert
the US$ debt into Sterling at fixed rates. The effective interest rate on the combined issue is 5.3%. On completion of this transaction and subsequent
repayment of certain term loans of £90 million and cancellation of £20 million of the revolving credit facility, Group long-term borrowing facilities,
including finance leases, total £456 million with a significantly longer maturity profile.

70 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006
34 Corporate information
The consolidated accounts of Dairy Crest Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2006 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution
of the directors on 23 May 2006 and the consolidated and Company balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by Mr A S N Murray and
Mr J W D Hall. Dairy Crest Group plc is a limited company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares
are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Chief Executive’s review, Operational review and Financial review on pages 4 to 21.
35 Transition to IFRS
Dairy Crest Group plc previously prepared its consolidated financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘UK GAAP’).
International Accounting Standards (‘IAS’) and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union apply for the
first full year in this Annual Report and Accounts for the year to 31 March 2006. This note explains how the Group’s previously reported financial
performance and position are reported under IFRS. 
First time adoption of IFRS
The rules for first time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’. The Group’s date 
of transition to IFRS is 1 April 2004 and the comparative information in the financial statements is restated to reflect the Group’s adoption of IFRS
except where otherwise required or permitted by IFRS 1. As a general rule IFRS 1 requires these standards to be applied retrospectively. However,
IFRS 1 allows for a number of exemptions to these general principles to assist companies in reporting under IFRS. The key exemptions the Group
has taken advantage of are as follows:
Business combinations – The Group has not restated business combinations prior to the transition date. Acquisitions prior to this date will be
recorded under previous accounting rules. IFRS 1 requires that an impairment review of goodwill should be conducted in accordance with IAS 36
at the date of transition and at the balance sheet date. Dairy Crest has performed this review and no adjustment is required.
Employee benefits – The Group has elected to take advantage of the exemption which allows cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to
the defined benefit pension schemes to be recognised in full immediately in equity at the transition date.
Cumulative translation differences – IAS 21 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’ requires the cumulative amount of exchange
differences previously recognised directly in equity in relation to a foreign operation to be transferred to the income statement as part of the profit or
loss on disposal. The Group has adopted the exemption allowing these cumulative translation differences to be set to zero at the transition date. 
Financial instruments – The Group has elected to apply the exemption which allows companies not to restate comparatives for IAS 32 ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. The general principle set out by IAS 39
is that financial assets and liabilities should be recognised at fair value or amortised cost. These standards will be applied from 1 April 2005 where
the fair value of derivatives will be included in the balance sheet. The net adjustment at 1 April 2005 is £0.3 million comprising the fair value
of interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts. (See Notes 18, 19 and 30).
The exemptions that Dairy Crest has elected not to adopt include the following:
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’
The Group has not adopted the exemption to apply IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’ only to awards made after 7 November 2002. 
Fair value or revaluation at deemed cost – The Group has not adopted the exemption to restate property, plant and equipment to fair value
at the transition date. Such items have been maintained at historical cost in order to maintain consistency with the Group accounting policy under
UK GAAP .
Summary of the major impacts of adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards
IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’
The Group previously accounted for the pensions schemes using SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’ and also complied with the transitional
rules of FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’. Under IFRS Dairy Crest is required to recognise the net deficits in the Dairy Crest Pension Fund of £64.1
million (after deferred tax of £27.4 million) and in the Wexford Creamery Limited pension schemes of £1.6 million (after deferred tax of £0.2 million)
and its share of the net deficit in the Yoplait Dairy Crest Final Salary Pension Scheme of £1.1 million (after deferred tax of £0.4 million) at the transition
date. In addition, the net SSAP 24 pension asset of £3.7 million has been written off. This has resulted in a net reduction to shareholders’ equity of
£70.2 million. Despite some minor differences in the method of determining the value of the assets of the pension fund between IAS 19 and FRS 17
there is no material net difference between the balance sheet deficit computed under FRS 17 at 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2005 and the amount
recognised under IAS 19. 
IFRS has increased the net pension costs by £7.2 million (net of interest income of £0.3 million) for the year ended 31 March 2005. The pension
liability recorded on the Group balance sheet at 1 April 2004 was £93.3 million and at 31 March 2005 was £102.7 million.
0346_DC_AR_2006_p68-85  8/6/06  7:49 pm  Page 70 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 71
35 Transition to IFRS (continued)
IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’
IFRS 3 prohibits goodwill amortisation. All goodwill has been frozen at UK GAAP carrying values on 1 April 2004. The standard requires goodwill to
be carried at cost with impairment reviews undertaken annually and also when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The full year operating profit impact for 2005 is to reduce the amortisation charge and increase net assets by £13.1 million. 
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’
Under IFRS share-based payments must be measured at fair value at grant date and should be recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
This expense is primarily in relation to the Group’s Save as You Earn schemes (‘SAYE’) and Long Term Incentive Share Plan (‘LTISP’). The Group has
sought advice from external valuation specialists to value its share-based payments. The fair value of the total shareholders return (‘TSR’) element of
the LTISP has been calculated using a Monte Carlo option-pricing model. The fair value for the Sharesave schemes have been calculated using a
Black Scholes model. 
The effect of adopting IFRS 2 for the year ended 31 March 2005 has reduced operating profit by £1.7 million. Additionally there is a cumulative
charge for the adoption of IFRS 2 at the transition date to retained earnings of £1.2 million (after deferred tax of £0.5 million).
IAS 23 ‘Borrowing costs’
IAS 23 allows the capitalisation of borrowing costs where they are directly attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset. However, where
borrowing costs are capitalised the treatment must be consistently applied to all borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of qualifying assets. Dairy Crest’s accounting policy was to only capitalise interest on major capital projects. Due to the
administration involved in applying capitalisation to all qualifying assets we have amended our accounting policy to expense all interest as incurred
and cease capitalisation of interest as part of the cost of qualifying assets.
This has resulted in a reduction in the net book value of property, plant and equipment of £6.1 million offset by the reversal of a deferred tax liability
of £1.8 million at the date of transition. Profit before tax has also increased by £0.4 million for the year ended 31 March 2005 as a result of
this adjustment.
IAS 10 ‘Events after balance sheet date’
Under this standard the liability for dividend payments is recognised when the dividend is approved. The normal practice under UK GAAP is for
dividends to be recognised in the period to which it relates.
At 31 March 2004 the final dividend for the year of £16.5 million had not been approved by the Board. In the opening IFRS balance sheet the
dividend creditor has been reversed. Similarly, shareholders’ equity at 31 March 2005 has been increased by £17.7 million.
IAS 17 ‘Leases’
Under IFRS lease incentives are required to be written off over the life of the lease. Under UK GAAP these have been written off over the period up
to the first rent review. The adoption of IFRS has resulted in the recognition of deferred income of £0.7 million and a deferred tax asset of £0.2 million.
The deferred income will be credited to income at £0.1 million pa until 2012.
IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’
IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ covers accounting for both current and deferred taxation. The adoption of IAS 12 does not in itself result in any restatement
of the Group’s tax charge. However, the basis of recognising deferred tax under IAS 12 compared to the UK standard FRS 19 ‘Deferred tax’ results
in deferred tax being recognised on all fair value adjustments recorded as a result of acquisitions. This has resulted in an increase in the deferred tax
asset of £1.5 million in the opening balance sheet.
A summary of the Group’s significant accounting policies under IFRS are included in the ‘Accounting Policies’ note.

Other items consist of adjustments for leases (lease incentives written off over the full life of the lease under IFRS) and income taxes (separate
recognition of deferred tax assets under IFRS). Short-term borrowings have been amended to better reflect the maturity of term loans at 31 March
2005. This has resulted in a reclassification of £20 million from long-term borrowings to short-term borrowings.

Under UK GAAP the assets and liabilities of the ESOP were included In the Parent Company balance sheet. Under IFRS, the ESOP is excluded from
the Parent Company balance sheet. The Parent Company has no loans to or from the ESOP .
In 1996 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Dairy Crest Limited. Consideration consisted of cash and the issue of 109.8 million
ordinary shares of 25 pence each. Under UK GAAP the Company took advantage of the merger relief provisions in the Companies Act 1985 and
included the nominal value of shares of £27.5 million in its cost of investment. Under IFRS, the cost of investment is recorded at fair value and an 
adjustment has been made to reflect the cost of investment assuming no merger relief was taken. The estimated fair value of shares issued at the 
date of acquisition was £170.2 million giving rise to an adjustment to the carrying value of the investment of £142.7 million and the creation of a 
capital reserve of the same amount.
0346_DC_AR_2006_p68-85  7/6/06  8:29 am  Page 75 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Dairy Crest Group plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial
statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Dairy Crest Group plc
for the year ended 31 March 2006 which comprise the
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated and Parent
Company balance sheets, the Consolidated and Parent
Company cash flows, the Consolidated and Parent Company
statement of recognised income and expense, the Accounting
policies and the related notes 1 to 35. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein. We have also audited the information in the
Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having
been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted
by the European Union as set out in the Statement of
directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view, the financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and whether that
the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with
the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’
report includes that specific information presented in the
Operational review that is cross referred from the Business
review section of the Directors’ report.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions are not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003
FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does
not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’
report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report,
the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the
Operational review, the Financial review and the Corporate
governance statement. We consider the implications for 
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made
by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited.

The amounts for the year ended 31 March 2004 and earlier periods are presented under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘UK GAAP’)
as it is not practicable to restate amounts for prior periods to the Group’s date of transition to IFRS on 1 April 2004. The principal differences
between UK GAAP and IFRS are explained in Note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
The segmental analysis of revenue, profit on operations and net assets has been restated for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 based on management’s
best estimates of the required re-allocation to reflect the Foods and Dairies segments.

Notes
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is also entitled
to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote instead 
of him/her. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
2. You may use the form of proxy enclosed with this Notice to appoint a
proxy to attend the meeting on your behalf. To be effective, the form of
proxy and any authority under which it is executed (or a certified copy of
such authority) must reach the offices of the Company’s registrar, Lloyds
TSB Registrars, The Causeway, Worthing, West Sussex BN99 6LA not
less than 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting. Completion
and return of the form of proxy will not preclude shareholders from
attending and voting in person at the meeting.
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the
CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting
and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the
CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored
members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting
service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST
service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy
Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with
CRESTCo’s specifications and must contain the information required 
for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message,
regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy
must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the
issuer’s agent (Lloyds TSB Registrars – ID 7RA01) by the time stated
above for the receipt of forms of proxy. For this purpose, the time of
receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp
applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which
the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST
in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or
voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make
available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages.
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation 
to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the
CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a
CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a
voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure
that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any
particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are
referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertified Securities
Regulations 2001.
3. In accordance with Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities
Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only those shareholders
appearing in the register of members as at 6.00pm on Tuesday 18 July
2006 (‘the specified time’) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the
meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at
that time. Changes to the register of members after the specified time
shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend 
or vote at the meeting.
4. Individuals will be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting only if
their own name appears on the share register or, where the shares are
held in a different trading or registration name, on production of written
evidence of their authority to act as that shareholder’s representative. 
A partnership the name of which is entered in the register of members
may, by any two persons purporting to be partners in the partnership,
authorise a person to act as its representative at the meeting. 
A company or other institution may by prior written authorisation confirm
the appointment of a corporate representative to attend the meeting on
its behalf. Such a representative shall be entitled to exercise the same
rights as an individual member in respect of the shares to which the
authorisation relates. Any company or partnership appointing a
representative to attend the meeting is requested to notify the
Company’s registrar of such appointment in writing not less than
48 hours before the time for holding the meeting. 
5. Only individual shareholders whose names appear on the register,
their proxies or representatives duly authorised in the above manner will
be permitted to attend and vote at the meeting.
6. Copies of the following documents will be available for inspection at
the Registered Office of the Company during normal business hours on
any weekday (Saturdays and public holidays excepted) from the date of
this Notice until 20 July 2006, and at the Chartered Accountants’ Hall,
Moorgate Place, London EC2P 2BJ from 10:45 am on 20 July 2006
until the conclusion of the Meeting:
(i) all directors’ service contracts (other than contracts expiring or
determinable within one year by the Company without payment 
of compensation); and
(ii) the register of interests of directors (and their families) in shares 
of the Company.
Resolution 1
The directors of the Company have a duty to present to shareholders in
general meeting the annual accounts, together with the directors’ report
and the report of the auditors. The auditors’ report can be found on
pages 76 to 77.
Resolution 2
As required by the Act, the Board has presented its Directors’
remuneration report to shareholders in the Annual Report, which may
be found on pages 27 to 34. This report gives details of the directors’
remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2006 and sets out the
Company’s overall policy on directors’ remuneration.
As also required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations
2002, the Company’s auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have audited the
relevant parts of the Directors’ remuneration report and their report may
be found on pages 76 to 77.
The Board considers that appropriate executive remuneration plays 
a vital part in helping to achieve the Company’s overall objectives. 
In compliance with the Act, shareholders are invited to approve the
Directors’ remuneration report.
Resolution 3
The directors recommend that a final dividend of 15.2 pence per share
be paid on 9 August 2006 to shareholders on the register on 7 July
2006. Payment of the final dividend will bring the total dividend for the
year ended 31 March 2006 to 21.5 pence per share.
Resolutions 4, 5 and 6
The articles of association specify that up to one third of the directors
must retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting and that each
82 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006
0346_DC_AR_2006_p68-85  8/6/06  4:48 pm  Page 82 director must retire not later than the third AGM following their last
election or re-election. This year Mr M Allen, Mr H Mann and Mr P
Thornton, who were elected at the AGM 2003, will retire by rotation and
seek re-election. Details of their biographies can be found on page 22.
Resolution 7
This is a standard resolution proposing the re-appointment of
Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s auditors.
Resolutions 8, 9 and 10
Set out below is a summary of the rules of the Dairy Crest 2006
Executive Share Option Scheme (the ‘Executive Scheme’) and a
summary of the rules of the Dairy Crest 2006 Long Term Incentive Share
Plan (the ‘LTISP’) proposed to be adopted by Dairy Crest. The rules of
the Executive Scheme and the LTISP are available for inspection during
normal business hours at the offices of Clifford Chance LLP at 10 Upper
Bank Street, London E14 5JJ from the date of this Notice up to and
including the close of the Annual General Meeting and will also be
available for inspection at the Chartered Accountants’ Hall, Moorgate
Place, London EC2P 2BJ at least 15 minutes prior to and during the
Meeting. 
The Executive Scheme
The Executive Scheme is divided into two parts: an approved part 
(‘Part A’) and an unapproved part (‘Part B’). Part A, for which the
Company is seeking HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) approval
under the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (‘ITEPA’), 
will be used to grant options which are eligible to benefit from favourable
UK tax treatment. Part B is not designed for HMRC approval and will be
used for the grant of options in excess of the HMRC limits. The
Remuneration Committee does not intend to grant any options under
the Executive Scheme for the time being, except in exceptional
circumstances (e.g. for recruitment purposes).
Approved part of the Executive Scheme – Part A
Part A of the Executive Scheme has been designed for approval by
HMRC under Schedule 4 to ITEPA.
Eligibility
Any full-time Director (working a minimum of 25 hours per week) or any
employee of a participating subsidiary of the Company other than
anyone who is ineligible to participate due to HMRC rules, may be
granted an option under Part A of the Executive Scheme.
Grant of options
Options may normally only be granted in the six weeks beginning with 
the date on which the Executive Scheme is approved and adopted 
by the Company, and thereafter in the six week period following the
announcement by the Company of its results for any period. Options
may be granted outside these periods in exceptional circumstances. 
No options may be granted more than ten years after the adoption of
the Executive Scheme. Options are personal to participants and may
not be transferred except on death. Options are not pensionable.
Price
The price payable for each share under an option will be determined by
the Remuneration Committee before the grant of the option, provided
that it shall not be less than the average of the middle market quotations
of the Company’s ordinary shares (‘Shares’) on the London Stock
Exchange over the five dealing days prior to the date of grant.
Limits
The Executive Scheme contains the following limits on the issue of Shares:
(i) the number of Shares that may be issued on the exercise of options
or awards granted in any period of ten years under all the
Company’s employee share schemes may not exceed 10% of the
Company’s issued Share capital from time to time;
(ii) the number of Shares that may be issued on the exercise of options
or awards granted in any period of ten years under all the
Company’s executive share schemes may not exceed 5% of the
Company’s issued Share capital from time to time; and
(iii) the total acquisition price for Shares on the exercise of options 
held by any participant under Part A of the Executive Scheme may
not exceed the amount permitted under Schedule 4 to ITEPA
(currently £30,000).
Shares may be transferred out of treasury to satisfy awards under 
the Executive Scheme, but any Shares so transferred will be treated 
as being issued for the purposes of the limits in (i) and (ii) above. 
The Executive Scheme may also operate in conjunction with Shares
purchased in the market.
Performance condition
An option granted under Part A of the Executive Scheme will normally
be exercisable between three years and ten years after the date of
grant, provided that a performance condition set by the Remuneration
Committee has been satisfied. Although there is no present intention to
grant options under the Executive Scheme, as and when any options
are granted it is intended that the relevant performance target will be
based on the Company’s cumulative economic profit over a three-year
period, beginning with the financial year in which options are granted,
i.e. on the same basis as the economic profit target applying in the
LTISP (see below). The intention is that there will, therefore, be full
vesting for economic profit at or above the threshold level.
Cessation of employment
A participant who leaves Dairy Crest’s service before exercising their
options will normally forfeit any option which they would otherwise have
been entitled to exercise. If the participant’s service with Dairy Crest
ceases through injury, disability, redundancy, retirement by agreement
with Dairy Crest, the employing company or business being sold out
of the group, or in exceptional circumstances determined by the
Remuneration Committee, the option may be exercised three years
after grant but only to the extent that the performance condition has
been met over the performance period. However, the number of
Shares in respect of which the option may be exercised will (unless
the Remuneration Committee decides otherwise) be reduced on a
pro rata time basis to reflect the period of service up to termination
of employment. Alternatively, the Remuneration Committee may allow
options to be exercised after termination of employment, but on the
basis of performance up to that time, with the number of Shares again
being reduced on a pro rata time basis, unless the Remuneration
Committee decides otherwise. This latter treatment of options will also
apply in the case of the death of a participant.
Change of control
In the event of a takeover, reconstruction or winding-up of the
Company, options may be exercised early to the extent that the
performance condition is met at that time, but with a pro rata 
reduction in Shares on a time basis, unless the Remuneration
Committee decides otherwise.
Variation of capital
In the event of a variation of share capital, the Remuneration 
Committee may take such adjustments to outstanding options 
as they consider appropriate.
Alteration
The Remuneration Committee has the right to alter the rules of the
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006 83
0346_DC_AR_2006_p68-85  8/6/06  7:14 pm  Page 83 Explanatory notes continued
Executive Scheme provided that no amendment to a feature of Part A 
of the Executive Scheme that is necessary for it to be approved under
Schedule 4 to ITEPA may be made without the prior approval of HMRC.
In addition, the prior approval of the Company in general meeting must
be obtained in the case of any amendment to the advantage of
participants which is made to the provisions relating to eligibility, limits,
variation of capital, the maximum entitlement for any one participant and
the basis for determining a participant’s entitlement to Shares. However,
any minor amendment to benefit the administration of the Executive
Scheme or to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or
maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for
participants or any member of the Dairy Crest Group plc may be made
without prior approval of the Company in general meeting. Any
amendment that is to the disadvantage of participants requires their
majority consent.
Unapproved part of the Executive Scheme – Part B
The description of Part A of the Executive Scheme also applies to
Part B of the Executive Scheme except where specified otherwise
below. Part B of the Executive Scheme has not been designed for
approval by HMRC and is intended for grants of options to executives 
in excess of the HMRC £30,000 limit set above.
Overall limits
The limits set out at paragraphs (i) and (ii) under the heading ‘Limits’
in Part A of the Executive Scheme shall also apply to Part B, but not 
the limit in paragraph (iii) under that heading.
Individual limits
The aggregate market value of Shares in respect of which options are
granted to a participant in any financial year may not exceed 200% of
annual base salary as at the date of grant, unless the Remuneration
Committee decides that exceptional circumstances exist in relation to
the retention or recruitment of an employee, in which case the limit will
be 300% of annual base salary.
Alteration
HMRC approval is not required for alterations to Part B of the
Executive Scheme.
Cash alternative
Following the exercise of any option granted under Part B of the
Executive Scheme, the Remuneration Committee may decide at their
discretion, to pay a cash sum to any participant equal to his option gain
at the time of exercise. Alternatively, options may be granted under Part
B on the basis that, on exercise, the participant will receive the option
gain in Shares.
The LTISP
Eligibility
Awards may be granted to executives of the Company (including
executive directors) and its subsidiary companies who are selected by
the Remuneration Committee.
Grant of awards
Awards may be made in several forms, as determined by the
Remuneration Committee at the date of grant in the light of (for example)
accounting and tax consequences. These include: (i) a contingent right 
to acquire Shares at no cost; (ii) a nil price option; (iii) a gift of Shares
forfeitable in the event that specified conditions are not met; and (iv) such
other form as has substantially the same economic effect.
Awards may normally only be granted in the six weeks beginning with 
the date on which the LTISP is approved and adopted by the Company,
and thereafter in the six week period following the announcement by the
Company of its results for any period. Awards may be granted outside
these periods in exceptional circumstances. Subject to shareholder
approval of the LTISP , it is proposed that the first grant of awards will
be made in July or August 2006. No awards may be granted more
than ten years after the adoption of the LTISP. Awards are personal to
participants and may not be transferred except on death. Awards are
not pensionable.
Individual limit
The initial value of an award granted in any year will be determined by
the Remuneration Committee. The rules of the LTISP permit annual
awards to be granted in relation to Shares up to a maximum of 150% 
of the participant’s basic salary. The number of Shares which are the
subject of the award will be calculated by dividing the value of the award
by the average of the middle market quotations of the Company’s
Shares on the London Stock Exchange over the five dealing days prior
to the date of the award.
Overall limits
The LTISP contains the following limits on the issue of Shares:
(i) the number of Shares that may be issued on the exercise of options
or awards granted in any period of ten years under all the
Company’s employee share schemes may not exceed 10% of the
Company’s issued Share capital from time to time; and
(ii) the number of Shares that may be issued on the exercise of options
or awards granted in any period of ten years under all the
Company’s executive share schemes may not exceed 5% of the
Company’s issued Share capital from time to time.
Shares may be transferred out of treasury to satisfy awards under the
LTISP, but any Shares so transferred will be treated as issued for the
purposes of the limits in (i) and (ii) above. The LTISP may also operate 
in conjunction with Shares purchased in the market.
Performance conditions
All LTISP awards will be subject to performance conditions. It is
intended that the first awards granted under the LTISP will be subject 
to two separate conditions, the first condition applying to 50% of the
Shares subject to each award and the second condition applying to 
the remaining 50%.
In respect of the first 50% of the 2006 awards, the number of Shares
that vest will be determined by Dairy Crest’s Total Shareholder Return
(‘TSR’) performance over a three year measurement period against the
TSR performance of a comparator group made up of: Arla Foods UK plc;
Associated British Foods plc; Glanbia plc; Greencore Group plc; Kerry
Limited; Northern Foods plc; Premier Foods plc; RHM plc; Robert
Wiseman Dairies plc; Tate & Lyle plc and Uniq plc. If Dairy Crest’s TSR
performance over the measurement period is at least median as against
the TSR performance of the comparator group, 40% of this part of the
award will vest. 100% of the Shares to which this part of the award
relates will vest if Dairy Crest’s TSR performance exceeds median by on
average at least nine percentage points per annum over the three years
of the performance period. Vesting will be on a straight-line basis
between these two points and none of this part of the award will vest if
Dairy Crest’s TSR performance is below median. The outperformance
percentage will be determined by the Remuneration Committee at the
beginning of each three year performance period.
In respect of the other 50% of the 2006 awards, the number of Shares
that vest will be determined by Dairy Crest’s cumulative economic profit
(‘EP’) for the three financial years ending in 2009. EP is calculated as
the difference between (1) net operating profit and (2) an annual capital
charge, which is in turn calculated as the trading capital employed,
multiplied by a weighted average cost of capital. For threshold EP,
84 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2006
0346_DC_AR_2006_p68-85  8/6/06  4:48 pm  Page 84 40% of this part of the award will vest, rising to 100% on a straight-line
basis for EP at or above the maximum target level. The threshold and
maximum target levels will be set by the Remuneration Committee,
taking into account both external and internal forecasts of future EP
performance. The targets will be designed to demonstrate demanding
and stretching financial performance over the performance period.
However, due to the market sensitivity of the chosen EP targets these
will not be disclosed until the end of the relevant period.
If any awards are granted in excess of 100% of a participant’s basic
salary the level of vesting for threshold performance will be reviewed
by the Remuneration Committee and shareholders will be consulted
regarding the appropriate vesting level prior to making such awards.
Timing of release
Shares will not normally be released until the third anniversary of the
award date.
Cash alternative
The Remuneration Committee may decide at their discretion that when
Shares are due to be released, a participant may be paid the cash
equivalent of the market value of the Shares, instead of the actual Shares.
Cessation of employment
A participant who leaves Dairy Crest’s service before the release date
will normally forfeit any award to which he would otherwise have been
entitled. If the participant’s service with Dairy Crest ceases through
injury, disability, redundancy, retirement by agreement with Dairy Crest,
the employing company or business being sold out of the Group, or in
exceptional circumstances determined by the Remuneration Committee,
some of the Shares may be released on the third anniversary of the
award date but only to the extent that the performance conditions have
been met over the performance period. The number of Shares to be
released will be reduced pro rata to take into account the length of time
that the participant was employed during the performance period,
unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise. Alternatively,
the Remuneration Committee may allow Shares to be released shortly
after termination of employment, based on performance up to that time,
but with again a pro rata time reduction unless the Remuneration
Committee decides otherwise. This latter treatment of awards will also
apply in the case of the death of a participant.
Change of control
In the event of a takeover, reconstruction or winding-up of the Company,
Shares may be released early to the extent that the performance
conditions are met at that time. The number of Shares to be released will
be reduced on a pro rata time basis unless the Remuneration Committee
decides otherwise.
Variation of capital
In the event of a variation of share capital, the Remuneration 
Committee may make such adjustments to outstanding awards as they
consider appropriate.
Alteration
The Remuneration Committee has the right to alter the rules of the
LTISP . The prior approval of the Company in general meeting must be
obtained in the case of any amendment to the advantage of participants
which is made to the provisions relating to eligibility, limits, variation of
capital, the maximum entitlement for any one participant and the basis
for determining a participant’s entitlement to Shares. However, any
minor amendment to benefit the administration of the LTISP or to take
account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable
tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants or any
member of the Dairy Crest Group plc, may be made without prior
approval of the Company in general meeting. Any amendment that 
is to the disadvantage of participants requires their majority consent.
Resolution 11
At the Annual General Meeting held on 14 July 2005 (‘AGM 2005’),
shareholders passed a resolution giving the directors authority, in
accordance with article 4(B) of the Company’s articles of association, to
allot relevant securities, within the meaning of section 80 of the
Companies Act 1985, in the amount of £10,415,000. The Company
proposes to renew this authority and the section 80 amount referred to
in Resolution 11 allows the directors to allot relevant securities up to a
nominal value of £10,433,000, representing approximately 33% of the
issued ordinary shares of the Company as at 23 May 2006. The
directors have no present intention of exercising this authority other than
to satisfy the exercise of options.
Resolution 12
The authority for the Company to make market purchases of its issued
share capital, granted last year, will expire at the close of the Annual
General Meeting. This resolution seeks renewal of that authority, again
limited to a maximum number of shares which amounts to
approximately 10% of the Company’s current issued share capital. 
The authority has not been used to date and would only be exercised 
if the directors believed that a repurchase of shares would result in an
increase in earnings per share and would be in the best interests of
shareholders as a whole. Any shares repurchased under this authority
will be held by the Company as treasury shares.
Resolution 13
At the AGM 2005 shareholders passed a resolution giving the directors
authority to disapply the pre-emption requirements for allotments of
equity securities (which, for the purposes of section 94(3A) of the Act,
includes the sale of treasury shares) up to £1,562,275. The Company
proposes to renew this authority up to a nominal value limit of
£1,564,885 (being approximately 5% of the issued share capital of the
Company as at 23 May 2006). The authority has not been used so far
and the Board has no present intention of allotting any shares in these
restricted circumstances.
The Directors believe that the resolutions are in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and
unanimously recommend that shareholders should vote in favour
of all resolutions.

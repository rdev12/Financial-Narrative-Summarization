5 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
The changes we made to the business a year ago 
underpinned the improvement we saw in 2014,  
as the business delivered strong operational and 
financial performance and returned to positive 
free cash flow for the first time in three years. 
Kelvin Dushnisky
Chairman of the Board
What makes us different?
• Leading asset portfolio
• Proven management team
• Operational delivery 
• Financial flexibility
• Cost discipline
Dear Shareholders,
2014 was an important and pleasing year for 
the Company as we reaped the benefits of 
strengthening the Board and Management 
team in 2013. Whilst the gold price ended the 
year at US$1,206 per ounce, only 1.6% down on 
the previous year, there was significant volatility 
throughout 2014, with a low of US$1,142 per 
ounce putting further pressure on the sector. 
In spite of continued challenges in the gold 
and wider mining market, Acacia achieved 
significant share price outperformance against 
both the UK market and the wider gold mining 
sector, ending the year up 37.5%. This reflected 
our continued operational delivery, with a second 
successive year of production increases and 
significant further reductions in the cost base 
that led to a return to free cash generation. 
Change of name to Acacia Mining
An important development in 2014 was the 
change of the Company’s name to Acacia Mining 
(LSE:ACA), which our shareholders voted in 
favour of in November. The decision to change 
the name was made in order to reflect the new 
culture and strategic direction of the business. 
The Acacia tree is hardy and resilient, and 
thrives in challenging environments. We believe 
that these characteristics reflect our enhanced 
operational capabilities and goals, and the 
adoption of the new name is already driving  
a change of perceptions of the business with  
our stakeholders both in Tanzania and beyond.

The Board believes that its current composition

Board composition
During the year, we saw two changes to the 
Board of Directors, with Rick McCreary stepping 
down as a Non-Executive Director in August and 
David Hodgson not standing for re-election at 
the Annual General Meeting. We would like to 
thank both Rick and David for their contributions 
to the Company and wish them well for the 
future. Following the changes, the Board has 
ten members, including seven independent 
Non-Executive Directors, two Non-Executive 
Directors and one Executive Director.
Final dividend for 2014
To ensure that our dividend policy is more closely 
aligned with the cash generation of the business, 
we have amended our existing dividend policy 
such that it is now based on operational cash 
flow after sustaining capital and capitalised 
development but before expansion capital and 
dividends, rather than on net earnings.
The Board believes this metric more 
appropriately reflects Acacia’s and the wider 
market’s focus on cash flow generation as  
well as our commitment to ongoing capital 
returns to shareholders. The dividend payout 
ratio of 15 to 30% and the timing of the 
payment, being one third of the dividend as  
an interim dividend and the balance as a final 
dividend, remain unchanged. 
In line with the above change, the Board  
of Directors is pleased to recommend the 
payment of a final dividend for 2014 of US2.8 
cents per share, representing two thirds of the 
total dividend payable in respect of 2014 of 
US4.2 cents per share, an increase of 40% 
when compared to 2013. 
Outlook
The team continued to make significant changes 
to both the operations and the way they are  
run over 2014 to great effect and we are now 
closer to getting each of the assets working to 
its full potential. This step change has meant 
that the business is now set up to be able to 
thrive, even in a lower gold price environment.
Looking forward to 2015, we expect to  
see further improvements in our business  
as we continue to implement our strategy  
and optimise our high-quality asset base.  
With the team now in place continuing to  
drive operational performance I believe we  
are well positioned to become a leader in the 
African mining industry in the coming years. 
On behalf of the Board, I sincerely thank all 
Acacia employees for their hard work and 
dedication over the past year. I would also like 
to thank our shareholders for their continued 
support and commitment to the Company. 
Kelvin Dushnisky 
Chairman of the Board
Effective governance
Our Directors have considerable  
knowledge and experience of the

 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 7 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
REVIEW 
2014 was a momentous year for Acacia  
as we started our journey to become  
a leading company in Africa.
Brad Gordon 
Chief Executive Officer
A track record of delivery
• Increasing production
• Reducing cost base
• Mines set up to perform
• Financial discipline
Introduction
I am delighted with the progress we have made 
across the business over the last 12 months. 
We continued to deliver operationally, with each 
quarter showing lower all-in sustaining costs 
(“AISC”). This discipline enabled us to return  
to free cash generation, for the first time since 
2011, which was one of our key objectives  
for the year. Our continued operational 
improvement was driven by a fresh strategic 
approach to running the Company focused  
on three key pillars: our business, our people 
and our relationships; whilst continuing to 
invest in our future. In order to further embed 
and reflect this approach, our shareholders 
voted to change the Company’s name to  
Acacia Mining from African Barrick Gold on  
26 November 2014. Our ambition is that, 
through the adoption of this new name,  
all of our people and external stakeholders 
become aligned with our new approach and 
goal of becoming a leading African mining 
company. We have already seen evidence  
that this is happening as the new approach  
is put into action. 
During 2014, we continued to enhance our  
mines and approved the development of an 
underground operation at North Mara which  
will significantly improve both the economics  
of the mine and the social situation in the area. 
We are continuing to turn Bulyanhulu into a 
world-class mine and during the year engaged 
contractors to accelerate underground 
development to provide future flexibility as  
well as pouring the first gold from the CIL Plant 
expansion at the mine. With a contrarian approach 
we are taking advantage of the dislocation in the 
market to expand our exploration footprint, and  
in November 2014 expanded into West Africa 
through an exciting and highly prospective 
exploration project in Burkina Faso.
Year in review
2014 was a successful year for Acacia,  
with production increasing again to 718,651 
ounces, 13% higher than 2013 and 4% above 
the upper end of our initial guidance range  
for the year. Production increased at all three 
mines with Bulyanhulu up 18% on 2013, 
Buzwagi up 15% on 2013 and delivering its 
highest ever year of gold production and  
North Mara remaining the standout performer, 
producing 273,803 ounces as the grade  
from the Gokona pit continued to be strong. 
On the cost side, we demonstrated consistent 
cost control and have now taken US$600 per 
ounce out of our quarterly AISC since Q3 2012. 
This translated into full year AISC of US$1,105 
per ounce sold, down 18% on 2013 and at the 
bottom of our guidance range. We delivered on 
our targeted cost savings of US$185 million set 
out in the Operational Review in 2013 and our 
continued focus is on removing further costs 
from the mining cycle. As a result of the cost 
savings, cash costs per ounce continued to 
come down and for 2014 we delivered cash cost 
per ounce sold of US$732, below our guidance 
range and 10% lower than 2013.

REVIEW 
CONTINUED
We returned to cash generation for the first  
time in three years during 2014, adding  
US$11 million to the balance sheet. Whilst  
this is positive, it does not reflect the scale of 
change that took place during the year, with 
positive cash flows of more than US$100 million 
before growth capital, dividends and Tulawaka 
sale costs. It should be noted that the average 
realised gold price of US$1,258 per ounce  
was over US$100 per ounce lower than 2013 
and over US$400 per ounce lower than 2012, 
years in which we did not generate positive  
free cash flow.
Total revenue for the year amounted to 
US$930.2 million, which was in line with  
2013 despite the lower average realised gold 
price as sale ounces for 2014 exceeded prior 
year sales by 9%. EBITDA increased by 5%  
to US$252.7 million in 2014 mainly due to a 
US$26.1 million reduction in gross direct mining 
costs, reflected in the 10% reduction of cash 
costs to US$732 per ounce sold. Earnings for  
the year were US$90 million, or US 22.1 cents 
per share. These were negatively impacted by 
significant revaluations of our indirect tax balance 
held in Tanzanian shillings and out of the money 
oil hedges, partially offset by deferred taxation 
changes at Buzwagi.
Our strategic approach
Our new approach to operating our assets  
has focused on three key pillars: our business, 
our people and our relationships; whilst continuing 
to invest in our future. 
Our business
We have made significant technical changes  
to our business, to ensure that each of our 
mines is correctly engineered and set up  
to deliver free cash flow. At Bulyanhulu we  
have changed to a mechanised mining method 
and are working to ensure that the mine 
delivers in line with its geological endowment. 
At North Mara we are moving forward with the 
development of an underground operation  
at one of the mine’s open pits which provides 
strong economic and social returns. At Buzwagi 
we have shortened the life of the mine so that 
we are mining only profitable ounces.
Our people
Our second pillar is our people, who are our 
core asset. We have significantly reduced  
the levels of management, restructured our 
corporate offices, commenced a new cultural 
transformation programme (Tufanikiwe 
Pamoja/Together we succeed) and introduced  
a behavioural safety programme (Tunajali/
WeCare). We are focused on creating a 
high-performance culture where our people  
are held accountable, but are given the tools  
to succeed. As part of this process we have 
already uncovered real talent within the 
workforce as well as seeing talented people 
returning to Acacia.
Our relationships
We have focused on improving our relationships 
with the communities around our mines and with 
the Government. We have engaged more actively 
with the community, the media and our broader 
stakeholders. We have also worked hard to 
strengthen our relationships with local and 
national authorities to ensure that we receive 
the appropriate support for our business in  
order for us to continue to be a key economic 
development driver for our host countries.
Our future
The fourth element of our strategy is to invest  
in our future. We believe that exploration is a 
significant driver of value for the business over 
the long term and now is the time to invest, 
which is a contrarian view to many in the  
market. As a result, we are focused on building  
a significant land package across Africa in the 
most geologically prospective belts to provide 
our exploration group the best opportunity  
to discover our next mines, as well as other 
opportunities to drive shareholder value over  
the long term.
Expanding our footprint
During 2014, we made our first entry into  
West Africa by entering into an earn-in 
agreement over the South Houndé Project in 
Burkina Faso. The earn-in allows us to earn  
an interest of up to 75% over a four year period 
in the highly prospective project which already 
includes a 1.5Moz Au Inferred resource. 
We also had a successful year within our existing 
exploration portfolio as the drilling programmes 
at Bulyanhulu led to the addition of 2.3Moz of 
gold into resources at existing reserve grades  
at very competitive costs. This is approximately 
half of our three year target to add 5Moz of gold 
resources at the mine as we look to ensure that 
production matches the geological endowment 
at Bulyanhulu. We also made good progress in 
Kenya with an extensive and successful aircore 
drilling programme across the land package which 
is now being followed up with deeper drilling.

Strategic risks
Our principal strategic risks relate  
to the fact that all of Acacia’s 
revenue is derived from production 
at our three operations in Tanzania 
and thus our business could be 
materially affected by significant 
in-country developments. This is 
why we assess opportunities to 
diversify geographically through 
exploration and acquisition targets.
OUR STRATEGY...
Further detail on all of the above is provided on page 22 and as part of our principal risks and uncertainties on page 82. 
Financial risks
Our financial condition and 
performance may be materially 
affected by significant changes  
in commodity pricing, given the 
level of business dependency on 
the price of gold and, to a lesser 
extent, the price of copper and 
silver. Fluctuations in the pricing  
of these commodities, which are 
largely attributable to factors 
beyond Acacia’s control, will likely 
have a corresponding impact  
on Acacia’s financial condition, 
particularly in the context of  
rapid pricing fluctuations.
External risks
Like many businesses, Acacia’s 
operations and financial 
conditions are exposed to a 
number of external risks, such  
as political, regulatory and legal 
developments within our 
operating environment and 
regions, and wider factors such 
as occupational health and 
life-threatening diseases in 
regions in which we have, or may 
in the future have, a presence. 
Operational risks
By its nature, mining is subject  
to a number of hazards and  
risks. From Acacia’s perspective, 
we pay a particular attention  
to risks relating to security, 
trespass and vandalism, safety 
risks relating to mining operations,  
risks relevant to the continued 
enhancement of operational 
systems and equipment 
effectiveness, and environmental 
hazards and rehabilitation.

STRATEGIC REPORT
12 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 T o help us achieve our plan, we are focused  
on maintaining and strengthening our position  
as a high-quality African gold producer in order  
to develop our business for the long term.
Safety
It is with sadness that I report that we 
experienced a fatality during the year,  
with Emmanuel Mrutu, an underground miner  
at Bulyanhulu, passing away after having  
been injured in a fall of ground incident at  
the mine in March. We fully investigated the 
incident and have implemented a number of 
recommendations to prevent re-occurrence. 
Safety is something I am passionate about  
and having been involved in underground mining 
for over 20 years, I am well aware of the risks. 
One of the key projects we started during the 
year was “Tunajali” or “WeCare”, a behavioural 
safety programme designed to embed the culture 
of safety, rather than just relying on checks and 
processes. This programme has now been rolled 
out across all of our operations and we expect  
this to have a positive impact on health and safety 
practices going forward. We continue to target  
zero injuries and have every person going home 
safely every day.
Indirect taxes
Further progress has been made with  
respect to the build-up of VAT, and the 
Company received total net refunds for 2014  
of approximately US$49 million. Total gross 
refunds received in 2014 amounted to 
US$132.8 million. We have also continued 
discussions with the Tanzanian Government  
on the establishment of an appropriate 
mechanism to safeguard the recoverability  
of VAT payments over the long term. These are 
centred around the establishment of an escrow 
account for VAT paid on domestic goods, 
similar to that currently used to provide for  
the refunding of VAT paid on imports, and our 
discussions are ongoing. As at 31 December 
2014, the outstanding amount relating to the 
total indirect tax receivable, not covered by the 
2011 Memorandum of Settlement, stood at 
US$46 million, roughly US$49 million lower 
than 31 December 2013.
Barrick Gold shareholding 
In March 2014, our majority shareholder 
Barrick Gold sold 10% of Acacia’s outstanding 
share capital to institutional shareholders.  
The placing was priced at 275 pence and 
reduced Barrick’s shareholding to 63.9%.  
This was a positive step by Barrick and 
increased our free float by around 40% which 
led to a subsequent increase in trading liquidity.
Outlook
The focus for 2015 is to continue to deliver  
free cash flow from our high-quality portfolio  
of mines as we work to enable them to deliver 
to their full geological potential. We have 
implemented changes across our business  
in order to continue to drive cost reductions 
and production growth. We are focused on 
continued delivery operationally in order to 
drive free cash flow, of which 15-30% is 
expected to be returned to shareholders via 
dividends, with the remainder appropriately 
allocated across further capital returns,  
organic growth or acquisition opportunities. 
We successfully overcame challenges to the 
business in 2014 and expect that 2015 will 
present similar challenges as we seek to 
successfully deliver on the turnaround at 
Bulyanhulu, move into commercial ore 
production from the Gokona Underground 
project at North Mara and ensure that we 
maintain our strengthened relationships  
with all stakeholders and the Government.
For 2015, we expect to see increased 
production of between 750,000-800,000 
ounces of gold. Production at each of the 
mines is expected to remain in line with  
Q4 2014 during the first quarter, with the  
bulk of the increase in production expected  
to be realised in the second half of the year. 
At the mine level, we expect a significant 
ramp up at Bulyanhulu as we move through 
the year, driven by an improvement in head 
grade, incremental production from the Upper 
East Zone and an increased contribution  
from the tailings re-treatment. At Buzwagi, 
production is expected to be broadly in line 
with 2014 as we continue to operate around 
the reserve grade of the asset. At North 
Mara, head grade is expected to decline 
marginally as the Gokona pit transitions from 
an open pit to underground operation, leading 
to an increased proportion of ore being 
sourced from the lower-grade Nyabirama pit 
during the year. This will be partially offset  
by the higher-grade ore from underground.  
As a result we expect to see a corresponding 
reduction in production at the mine. 
We are targeting further reductions to our unit 
costs in 2015, predominantly driven by the 
incremental production at Bulyanhulu, and 
estimate the cash cost per ounce for the year, 
including royalties, will be between US$695-725 
per ounce sold, a reduction of up to 5% on 2014. 
For 2015, we expect overall capital expenditure 
of between U$220 million – US$240 million,  
a further reduction on 2014 as we enforce 
stringent capital controls and move closer  
to industry average per ounce spend. We 
expect sustaining capital of US$90 million  
– US$100 million, inclusive of land purchases, 
as we scale up operations at Bulyanhulu and 
set up the long-term future at North Mara, with 
capitalised development, inclusive of deferred 
stripping, of US$125 million – US$135 million. 
This is driven by increased development 
activity at Bulyanhulu which commenced in 
2014 and is focused on opening additional 
mining areas, and at North Mara as work 
accelerates on the Gokona Underground 
project. The increase in spend is partially 
offset by a reduction in capital requirements  
at Buzwagi as it moves towards the end  
of mining activity. Expansionary capital of 
US$5 million relates to additional underground 
drilling at Bulyanhulu aimed at increasing the 
scale of the ore body as well as expansionary 
drilling at North Mara, predominantly under  
the Nyabirama pit.
As a result of the above, coupled with flat 
corporate administration costs, we estimate  
all-in sustaining cost per ounce sold for the  
year will be between US$1,050 – US$1,100, a 
reduction of up to 5% on 2014. The evolution of 
these costs during the year will be driven by our 
production profile and as a result we expect to 
see lower costs in the second half than the first.
Finally, I would like to thank all of my colleagues 
for their commitment, enthusiasm and hard 
work throughout what has been a transformative 
year for Acacia. I am delighted by our progress 
to date, and am driven by the opportunity to 
make this company a leader in Africa. I would 
also like to thank our Board for their support 
and guidance through the year and I am very 
much looking forward to 2015 and beyond.

OUR MINES
OUR BUSINESS
W e have a leading portfolio of assets and  
are focused on making our mines perform  
to their geological potential.
Making Bulyanhulu a world-class mine
Bulyanhulu has long been known as a 
world-class deposit, but it is only now that  
it is becoming a world-class mine through the 
changes we are making to bring production in 
line with the geological potential of the asset. 
We are moving to a mechanised mining method 
and investing in underground development to 
ensure that the mine is able to achieve annual 
production rates of in excess of 350,000 
ounces of gold from 2016 onwards.
Enhancing economic and social 
returns at North Mara 
North Mara has always been a high-grade open 
pit operation, with large communities in close 
proximity to the mine. In November 2014 the 
decision was made to convert one of the pits, 
Gokona, to an underground operation which 
allows for gold to be selectively mined at higher 
grades over the next five years, with potential 
for this to extend further as the underground 
goes deeper. This will both improve the economic 
returns and reduce the footprint of the mine 
which will benefit all of our stakeholders.

OUR PEOPLE
Driving cultural change across the workforce 
through a dedicated programme and the redesign  
of structures and roles. 
Accountability 
We have a very strong focus on our people, who 
are our core asset. We are focused on creating 
a high-performance culture where our people 
are held accountable, but are given the tools  
to succeed. As part of this process we have 
already uncovered real talent emerging from 
within the workforce as well as seeing talented 
people returning to Acacia. 
WeCare 
The safety of our workforce is paramount and 
during the second half of the year we launched 
“Tunajali” or “WeCare”, a behavioural safety 
programme designed to embed the culture  
of safety, with positive rewards for safe 
behaviours rather than just relying on checks 
and processes. The programme has now been 
rolled out across all of our operations. 
Tufanikiwe Pamoja 
We are undertaking a unique world-class 
cultural transformation programme, called 
Tufanikiwe Pamoja (Together we succeed).  
The programme embeds the Company’s 
expectations and the accountabilities of  
every leader and team member with respect  
to their behaviour and approach to work.
As part of this programme we have articulated 
six desired behaviours which all team members 
are expected to practise in order to drive a 
high-performance culture and create the best 
company in Africa:
• We plan the work and work to plan
• We hold people accountable and  
recognise performance
• We work as a team (collaborate)  
and communicate openly
• We do what we say we will do
• We act with a sense of urgency
• We develop our people to be their best

ENGAGEMENT
Benefits for host communities 
This year we have focused on improving  
our relationships with both the communities 
around our mines and with the Government.  
As part of this, we have engaged more actively 
with the community, the media and with our 
broader stakeholders with the aim of becoming 
a partner of choice and to ensure that our 
communities benefit from our operations.  
We invest in communities through both the 
Acacia Maendeleo Fund, which supports  
our broader company initiatives across  
Tanzania and Kenya, and our Village Benefit 
Implementation Agreements, which provide  
for specific investments at North Mara to fulfil  
legacy commitments.
Relationships with Government 
A key area of focus and progress during  
the year has been on strengthening 
relationships with the Government. We now 
believe the relationship is significantly stronger 
than in the past and this is demonstrated by 
the improvement in the three key business 
critical areas in which we have engaged the 
Government; these being law and order at  
North Mara, where the Government has  
stepped up its involvement; grid power reliability, 
where additional generating capacity has been 
brought on stream near the mines; and the 
outstanding VAT receivables, which have reduced 
by approximately US$50 million during the year.

KEY PERFORMANCE  
INDICATORS
We assess our performance against the following 
key performance indicators, each of which  
is linked to our long-term strategy.
Performance 
Gold production was 718,651 ounces,  
13% higher than 2013, as a result of  
the range of improvements made within  
our operations. 
Performance 
AISC for the year was US$1,105 per  
ounce sold, a decrease of 18% on 2013,  
as a result of achieving increased 
production, lower operating costs  
and lower capital expenditures.
Performance 
Total reserves and resources for the year 
amounted to 30.1 million ounces of gold,  
an increase on 2013 (29.0 million ounces)  
as a result of successful exploration 
programmes at Bulyanhulu. 
Performance 
Total reportable injury frequency rate (“TRIFR”) 
was 0.86 for the year, compared to 0.68 in 
2013. An enhanced safety programme has 
been rolled out (WeCare) to improve safety 
performance in 2015.
Performance 
Cash cost per ounce sold for the year was 
US$732 per ounce, a 10% reduction on 
2013, as a result of increased production 
and lower operating costs. 
Performance 
Cash cost per tonne milled for the year  
was US$61 per tonne, an 8% reduction  
on 2013, as a result of achieving improved 
process throughput and cost savings in  
our operating environment.
Relevance to strategy 
Gold production is the aggregate of the 
Group’s equity interest in gold ounces 
produced from our mines and one of the  
key measures used to track progress  
made in increasing our productivity levels.
Relevance to strategy 
AISC is used to provide additional 
information on the total sustaining cost  
for each ounce sold in order to provide 
additional clarity as to the full cost of 
production. It is one of the key indicators 
that we use to monitor and manage those 
factors that impact production costs on  
a monthly basis.
Relevance to strategy 
Calculated as the total of proven and 
probable reserves, plus measured, 
indicated and inferred resources expressed 
in contained ounces. It measures our  
ability to discover and develop new ore 
bodies and to replace and extend the  
life of our operating mines
Relevance to strategy 
TRIFR tracks all employee and contractor 
reported workplace injuries that require 
medical treatment, including lost time and 
restricted duty. We use it to measure progress 
towards our health and safety goal of zero 
harm. It is calculated as total reportable 
injuries multiplied by 200,000 then divided  
by total number of hours worked.
Relevance to strategy 
Cash cost per ounce sold is calculated by 
dividing the aggregate of cash costs by gold 
ounces sold. It is one of the key indicators 
that we use to monitor and manage those 
factors that impact production costs on a 
monthly basis.
Relevance to strategy 
Cash cost per tonne milled is calculated  
by dividing the aggregate of cash costs by 
ore tonnes milled. We use it to track cash 
costs against productivity.

Performance 
EBITDA for the year was US$252.7 million,  
a 5% increase on 2013, mainly as a result 
lower direct mining costs.
Performance 
Total shareholder return (“TSR”) in 2014 
was 38.6%, an increase from negative 
57.6% in 2013 due to the appreciation of 
the share price during the year following 
operational improvements. 
Performance 
Total community investment was US$10.8 
million for the year, a reduction on 2013 
(US$15.5 million), as a result of a reduction 
of required VBIA spend at North Mara.
Performance 
Total CO
2
 emissions for 2014 amounted  
to 371,508 tonnes, in line with 2013 
(369,319 tonnes of CO

). Further information 
as regards our GHG emissions reporting  
is provided on page 86.
Performance 
Operating cash flow per share was US70.6 
cents per share, 55% up from 2013, largely 
due improved operating performance.
Performance 
Net earnings per share was US22.1 cents, 
an increase from a loss of US190.4 cents  
in 2013, largely due to improved operating 
performance and no writedowns. 
Relevance to strategy 
EBITDA is a valuable indicator of our ability 
to generate operating cash flow to fund 
working capital and capital expenditures 
and to service debt obligations.
Relevance to strategy 
TSR is the return on investment a 
shareholder receives over a specified  
time frame based on our share price 
appreciation/depreciation and dividends 
received. It is used to compare our 
performance against industry peers.
Relevance to strategy 
This represents the amount of money that  
we invest across our corporate social 
responsibility programmes. It helps us  
to track progress made as regards our 
objective to support socio-economic 
development in our operating environment.
Relevance to strategy 
GHG emissions are measured on the  
basis of total tonnes of CO
2
 produced by  
our operations as a way of assessing our 
carbon footprint.
Relevance to strategy 
Operating cash flow per share is the cash 
generated from, or utilised in, operating 
activities, divided by the weighted average 
of the number of Ordinary Shares in issue.  
It helps to measure our ability to generate 
cash from our business.
Relevance to strategy 
Net earnings per share is calculated by 
dividing net earnings by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary Shares in issue. 
It serves as an indicator of our profitability 
and is often used to determine share price 
and value.

Principal risk rating matrix Risk management framework
22 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT
RISK MANAGEMENT 82
For our full principal risks and uncertainties 
Community relations
We have continued to enhance community relations practices this year, having seen noticeable benefits through the  
investments made by the Acacia Maendeleo Fund and other community relations initiatives, in addition to the continued 
successful implementation of our stakeholder engagement model and social management plans. In addition, we continue  
to work on enhancements to our corporate social responsibility strategy, particularly with a view to enhancing economic 
empowerment initiatives, and other measures that enhance relationships with our local stakeholders, such that we believe  
we have adequate initiatives in place to manage and mitigate material risks to such relationships. 
Employee, contractor  
and industrial relations
We have continued to strengthen employee relations and practices during the year, noticeably through the implementation of  
our new accountable management system and enhanced practices for industrial relations management. We also successfully 
implemented core elements of organisational restructuring at Bulyanhulu throughout the year and continue to advance our targets  
for workforce localisation across the Group, such that risks relating to employees and contractors are now viewed as having  
a medium impact to our business.
Reserves and resources 
estimates
Whilst it will never be possible to give assurances or certainty as regards reserves and resources estimates due to the varying 
nature and various factors which can impact such estimates, as a result of the improvements we have introduced, and will 
continue to implement as regards mine planning and cost controls this year, we believe that we have reduced certain exposures 
in this context, such that risks in this regard are now viewed as having a medium impact to our business. 
Taxation reviews
As noted in the financial review of the year, we have made significant progress in the management and recoverability of Acacia’s 
indirect tax receivables, particularly in the context of VAT, such that whilst any significant change to the taxation regime in 
Tanzania could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our 2014 risk rating reflects the positive progress  
made to achieve resolutions to existing disputes. 
In conjunction with the re-assessment of certain risks, we have also looked at the impact of emerging risks to our business, and believe it is 
appropriate to add the following as new principal risks this year, given their importance to ongoing operations:
Safety risks relating  
to mining operations
Despite the significant health, safety and risk management systems that Acacia has in place for its underground and surface 
mining operations, mining and in particular underground mining is subject to a number of hazards and risks in the workplace, 
such as fall of ground relating to underlying geotechnical risks, potential fires and mobile equipment incidents, such that safety 
incidents in the workplace may unfortunately occur and did occur in 2014. 
Implementation of enhanced  
operational systems
Throughout 2014 we have made a number of enhancements to mine planning and financial modelling practices as part of  
continuing reviews of existing operational systems and models, required to support increased productivity and ongoing reductions  
in operating cost profiles. Given the ongoing nature of systems reviews and the importance of this to the achievement of future 
business objectives, we believe it appropriate to monitor the implementation of enhanced operational systems as a principal  
risk going forward. 
Equipment effectiveness
Previously we have reviewed risks relating to equipment effectiveness in the context of availability of critical processes. However, 
as part of ongoing reviews we have decided to separate this into a standalone risk in order to chart equipment availability, 
utilisation and productivity as required to meet increasing output levels. 
Occupational health  
and life-threatening diseases
In prior years we have viewed occupational health and disease risks as medium, given the range of health and safety controls 
across our business. However, given the impact of certain epidemics this year across the African region, notably the impact of 
Ebola in West Africa, we have heightened monitoring of risks relating to occupational heath and life-threatening diseases 
this year.
The principal risk rating matrix opposite shows how we have allocated residual risk ratings across our principal risks following the 2014 Risk Review. 
In addition, the table entitled principal risks and uncertainties on page 82 sets out a description of each of our principal risks, along with commentary 
as regards management responsibility, mitigating action and key progress made in 2014 for further information purposes. In addition to those risks 
stated, there may be additional risks unknown to Acacia and other risks, currently believed to be immaterial or that relate to the gold mining industry 
more generally, that could turn out to be material to the Group. Additional discussions of certain trends and uncertainties that may affect our 
operations are provided as part of our Strategic report. 
The information relating to Acacia’s performance included on pages 24 to 45 (inclusive) of this Annual Report and the information relating to its 
principal risks and uncertainties on pages 82 to 85 (inclusive) of this Annual Report, is incorporated by reference into this Strategic report and is 
deemed to form part of this Strategic report.
2014 Risk Review 
During the year we have made significant changes to the way that we run our business, which has resulted in a number of changes to our principal 
risks profile. Whilst our principal risks continue to fall within four broad categories: strategic risks, financial risks, external risks and operational risks, 
as a result of a range of cost control and revised operating and planning initiatives implemented during the year, the following risks are no longer 
viewed as principal risks to the management and operation of our business: (i) costs and capital expenditure; (ii) utilities supply; (iii) land acquisitions; 
(iv) organisational restructuring; and (v) loss of critical processes. In addition to this and again due to enhancements made to business practices 
throughout the year, we have allocated a medium risk rating to the following risks, previously viewed as high-level risks in 2013:

OPERATING REVIEW 3
Progress in 2014
• Commencement of the conversion 
of the mine to a mechanised  
mining method in order to improve 
efficiencies and safety
• Completion of the commissioning  
of the CIL Plant expansion to 
re-treat historic tailings
• Delivery of a 12% increase in head 
grade from the underground as the 
mine moves towards reserve grade
Priorities for 2015
• Complete conversion of the mine  
to an efficient, modern mechanised 
mine using only long hole stoping
• Deliver a further increase in head 
grade from the underground mine
• Accelerate underground development 
in order to create mining flexibility  
across the ore body
Operating performance
Full year gold production of 234,786 ounces was 
18% higher than the prior year due to improved  
run of mine grade. This was driven by increased 
access to higher-grade stopes coupled with 
higher throughput as a result of the reprocessing 
of tailings. This was partially offset by lower 
recoveries as a result of underperformance of 
the elution circuit which led to increased tailings 
losses. Gold ounces sold of 215,740 ounces 
were 10% higher than 2013 primarily due to the 
higher production base, but were lower than 
production for the year due to strong production 
late in Q4 impacting on the timing of sales and  
a build-up in gold in circuit as the new CIL circuit 
was commissioned. 
Copper production of 5.3 million pounds for  
the year was 9% higher than in 2013 due to 
higher copper grades combined with higher  
run of mine throughput.
Cash costs for the year of US$812 per ounce 
sold were 9% lower than the prior year of 
US$890, driven by the higher production base, 
combined with savings in labour costs mainly 
due to a reduction in the international workforce, 
lower general administration costs primarily 
resulting from lower management fees and 
increased capitalised development costs  
driven by development acceleration projects.  
This was partially offset by higher contractor 
costs incurred for ore development and higher 
energy costs mainly as a result of the increased 
processing activity with the new CIL circuit now 
fully commissioned. 
AKO, a wholly owned Tanzanian catering 
company, commenced business in 2009 at 
Bulyanhulu. At the time this was a deliberate 
effort to support local companies in the 
service industry and AKO was well placed  
to provide catering services to the mine. 
This contract has provided the platform  
for AKO to grow and it now services two 
Acacia mines, our Dar es Salaam office  
and has a number of other major contracts  
in the country. Over the past five years the 
company’s turnover has grown by a multiple 
of ten and at December 2014 it stood at 
TZS45.4 Billion (US$23.6 million).
True local business development not only 
creates financial opportunities for local 
suppliers but also has extensive multiplier 
effects. Starting off with only 300 employees 
in 2008, AKO had 1,600 employees by  
the end of 2014, with over 25% of these 
linked to Acacia contracts, supporting over 
1,650 dependants.

www.acaciamining.com
AISC per ounce sold for the year of US$1,266 
was 6% lower than in 2013 (US$1,344),  
as lower cash costs and sustaining capital 
expenditure were partially offset by the 
investment in capitalised development. 
The new CIL plant was commissioned during  
the second half of 2014 with the first gold pour 
taking place in August 2014. Production for  
the year from reprocessed tailings amounted to 
12,405 ounces, lower than planned as a result 
of delays in construction completion, issues 
experienced in the elution circuit performance 
and the detoxification of the tailings. The project 
to accelerate the retreatment of the historic 
higher-grade tailings in preference to the rougher 
tailings was completed and commissioning trials 
have commenced.
In 2014 a key focus was on the accelerated 
development of the Upper East and Lower West 
zones to provide increased mining flexibility and to 
ensure the mine is able to deliver to its geological 
potential. In order to achieve this, a specialist 
development contractor was engaged in April. 
During the year total development costs incurred 
for the two initiatives (expensed and capitalised) 
were US$21.2 million, and this is included in the 
Bulyanhulu and Group AISC figures. During the 
fourth quarter initial development ore from both 
zones was delivered to the mill.
Our relationships
Supporting local enterprise 
Capital expenditure for the year before 
reclamation adjustments amounted to 
US$131.5 million, 29% lower than 2013 
expenditure of US$185.5 million, mainly driven 
by lower expansionary capital spend as the  
new CIL circuit was completed in 2014. Capital 
expenditure for 2014 consisted mainly of 
capitalised underground development costs 
(US$60.2 million including US$21.2 million 
related to development costs for the Bulyanhulu 
Upper East Lower West projects) and 
expansionary capital investment relating  
to the new CIL circuit (US$44.5 million).

Progress in 2014
• Highest ever year of annual 
production of 210koz
• Delivery of a 5% increase in

• Continue to reduce inventory  
stock levels at the mine 
• Continue to drive improvements  
in availabilities of the mining fleet
Operating performance
Gold production for the year of 210,063 ounces 
was 15% higher than 2013, driven by improved 
head grade as a result of mining in the main ore 
zone and increased recoveries due to business 
improvement projects. This was partially offset 
by a 7% decrease in throughput due to plant 
downtime for both planned and unplanned 
maintenance. Gold sold for the year amounted 
to 213,399 ounces, 14% above that of 2013 
due to the higher production and 2% above 
production due to the sale of ounces on hand  
at the start of the year.
Recoveries increased by 5% over 2013 as a result 
of business improvement initiatives in the second 
half of the year providing improved blending  
and management of the CIL plant’s performance, 
coupled with the increased head grade.
Total tonnes mined during the year amounted  
to 24.5 million, 24% lower than in 2013 due to 
changes in the mine plan as already reported. 
Copper production of 8.8 million pounds for  
the year was 23% higher than in 2013, driven by 
the higher concentrate production and higher 
copper grades.
Cash costs for the year of US$791 per ounce 
sold were 16% lower than in 2013 (US$945). 
Cash costs were positively impacted by a higher 
production base and savings driven by lower 
contracted services costs due to lower rates, 
lower energy costs which in turn were affected 
by lower self-generation as a result of improved 
TANESCO reliability, lower labour costs as a 
result of the reduction in the international 
workforce and lower corporate costs incurred 
and allocated to site. This was partially offset by 
lower capitalised development costs as a result 
of the change in the mine plans and increased 
maintenance costs driven by equipment 
breakdowns and plant maintenance. 
AISC per ounce sold for the year of US$1,055 
was 30% lower than in 2013 (US$1,506).  
This was driven by the lower cash cost base  
and lower capitalised development and 
sustaining capital expenditure.
Capital expenditure for the year of US$44.2 
million before reclamation adjustments, was 
52% lower than in 2013 (US$91.7 million).  
The significant change to the mine plan 
communicated in 2013 reduced required 
investment in waste movement and sustaining 
capital. Key capital expenditure for the year 
included capitalised stripping costs (US$31.4 
million), investment in tailings and infrastructure 
(US$7.0 million) and component change out 
costs (US$5.4 million). 
As part of Acacia’s focus on improving 
relationships with our communities, we 
undertook to screen, in conjunction with a 
local partner, every game of the 2014 FIFA 
World Cup on large scale temporary screens 
within the towns and villages surrounding our 
three mines in an initiative termed “Brazuka”. 
At Buzwagi, the screening took place in  
the Kahama Town football stadium where 
crowds of up to 2,000 regularly attended the 
screening of football matches. The matches 
were accompanied by live music, talent 
competitions and prize draws and in tandem 
with this we undertook seminars with the 
communities to review opportunities for 
future community economic development.
The Brazuka initiative was extremely 
successful, with positive national and local 
media coverage and a significantly enhanced 
profile and perception of the Company within 
the community.

Operating performance
Production for the year of 273,803 ounces  
was 7% higher than the prior year primarily  
as a result of higher throughput rates, which 
exceeded the prior year period by 6%. The  
higher milled tonnes were due to business 
improvement initiatives in both the mining and 
milling areas. Gold ounces sold for the year 
amounted to 274,540, in line with production, 
and 5% higher than the prior year due to the 
higher production base.
Cash costs for the year of US$623 per ounce 
sold were 5% lower than in 2013 (US$659). 
Cash costs were positively impacted by the 
higher production base, lower labour costs as  
a result of the reduction in the international 
workforce and lower management fees, partially 
offset by lower capitalised mining costs due to 
changes in the mine plan compared to 2013. 
AISC per ounce sold for the year of US$947  
was 23% lower than in 2013 (US$1,227) 
predominantly due to lower cash costs, 
capitalised development and sustaining  
capital expenditure in combination with the 
impact of increased sales volumes.
During Q4 2014, the Acacia Board approved the 
Gokona Underground project, which is expected 
to produce 450,000 ounces of gold over a five 
year life of mine, with an AISC of below US$750 
per ounce sold. This project is now moving into  
the execution phase. As at 31 December 2014, 
the underground exploration portal to develop a 
better understanding of the ore body was 301 
metres advanced and it is expected to encounter 
development ore in the first quarter of 2015. 
Following the Board approval, future capital 
expenditure will be classified as either sustaining 
capital or capitalised development and is 
expected to amount to US$30 million in 2015. 
The total expansionary capital spend on the 
project in 2014 amounted to US$13.1 million.
Capital expenditure for the year before 
reclamation adjustments of US$72.1 million  
was 31% lower than in 2013 (US$104.9 million), 
due to lower capitalised development and lower 
sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset  
by higher expansionary expenditure. Key capital 
expenditure included capitalised stripping costs 
(US$40.9 million), investments in component 
costs (US$10.2 million) and tailings and 
infrastructure ($7.1 million). 
North Mara has put in place internal training in 
order to up-skill their Heavy Mobile Equipment

The mine has now designed and introduced 
approximately 35 training packages, covering 
a whole range of HME equipment-related 
topics such as hydraulics, transmissions, 
steering, brakes, power-train fundamentals, 
auto-electrical, machine electronics, 
air-conditioning, fuel systems and diesel

Brownfield exploration
In 2014, near-mine brownfield exploration 
successfully identified extensions to known 
resources. The brownfield exploration 
programme was entirely focused on the 
Bulyanhulu ore body where surface and 
underground diamond core drilling returned 
excellent results from step-out resource  
drilling on both Reef 1 and Reef 2 mineralised 
systems. This work has led to the inclusion  
of a total of 2.3Moz to Indicated and Inferred 
resources and has extended the resource 
envelope by 1.5 kilometres to the west.
Bulyanhulu 
During 2014, Bulyanhulu undertook two 
diamond core exploration programmes, one 
from surface targeting western extensions of 
both the Reef 1 and Reef 2 veins series, and  
the second from underground, targeting depth 
extensions of Reef 2 in the east of the mine.
Lower West Programme – Surface 
The programme was designed to test the 
extensions of the Reef 1 structure from 400 
metres to 1,200 metres west of the current 
Bulyanhulu resource where historic drilling had 
shown indications of further gold mineralisation. 
Additionally, holes were also drilled to intersect 
the Reef 2 vein series, and provide support that 
the Reef 2 system is mineralised up to 1.5 
kilometres west of the currently delineated 
underground resources. 
A total of 9,721 metres of diamond core was 
drilled from surface holes during 2014, bringing 
the total for the programme to 14,373 metres  
in a total of 16 holes. Results from the drilling 
successfully showed the continuation of 
high-grade gold mineralisation in the narrow 
reef-style structures in the western areas  
of both the Reef 1 and Reef 2 series. 
The results from 2013/2014 surface drilling 
programme have been very positive and 
demonstrated that gold mineralisation, 
particularly on the Reef 2 vein system, continues 
west of the mine, which opens the potential for  
a significant resource expansion on the Reef 2 
series at relatively shallow levels (<1,000-
1,600m) compared to the Reef 1 system. 
East Deeps underground drilling 
The programme targeted extensions of the  
East Zone high-grade ore shoot on the 
Bulyanhulu Reef 2 system outside the  
current resource model. The programme was 
drilled from several underground drill platforms 
with a total of 3,058 metres of diamond core 
completed from three holes during 2014, 
bringing the total for the programme to five  
holes for 5,598 metres. 
These Reef 2 drill intersections prove the 
continuity, at depth, of the high-grade East Zone 
mineralisation, and show that the high-grade 
shoot remains open at depth. 
Progress in 2014
• Drilling programmes led to an 
addition of 2.3Moz of resources  
at Bulyanhulu
• Significantly advanced our West 
Kenya joint venture properties with a 
large number of targets identified and 
significant reconnaissance drill results
• Aircore drilling on the Liranda 
Corridor in West Kenya identified 
high-grade gold zones
• Entry into highly prospective land 
package in Burkina Faso through a 
joint venture with Sarama Resources
Priorities for 2015
• Test high priority targets within  
the West Kenya Joint Ventures  
with diamond core drilling
• Identify additional brownfield  
targets around Bulyanhulu
• Identify additional oxide resources 
and higher-grade resource 
extensions and satellite ore bodies 
around the Tankoro Resource  
on the South Houndé project
• Further enhance and diversify our 
exploration portfolio through low cost 
joint ventures or option agreements
Our relationships
Kenya has lost over 98% of its forest cover 
over the last century, and this problem is 
particularly acute in Vihiga County, which 
falls within the West Kenya JV licence  
areas, which has lost virtually all of its 
natural tree cover due to population density. 
The Kenyan Government has initiated a tree 
planting programme, to be carried out in primary 
schools in all 47 counties of the country, with 
the aim of conserving the environment, and 
to instill in youth the culture of tree growing 
and environmental conservation. 
Acacia has supported the tree planting 
initiative in collaboration with Vihiga’s County 
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, 
by purchasing 100,000 indigenous tree 
seedlings towards the effort. The seedlings 
were supplied by local women’s groups, 
and planted by the school children in the 
recipient schools.

Forward programme
Results from both of the drilling programmes 
were included in the year end resource and 
reserve calculations and increased Indicated 
Resources by 760koz and Inferred Resources  
by 1.6Moz for a total addition of 2.3Moz. 
Furthermore, the surface programme extended 
the extent of mineralisation by 1.5km to the  
west of the previous resource shell.
Future drilling programmes to both infill the area 
between the western extension areas and the

Greenfield exploration
Throughout 2014, we have continued our  
focus on identifying new greenfield exploration 
opportunities to complement our existing 
exploration portfolio. 
Kenya
West Kenya Joint Venture Projects
An extensive exploration programme was 
completed in 2014 across the entire area  
of Acacia’s West Kenya projects, including 
aircore drilling of 1,171 holes for 42,232 
metres, 10,759 soil samples, 1,060km
2
  
of mapping and 190 line kilometres of  
IP surveys, significantly advancing our 
understanding of the Busia-Kakamega 
greenstone belt and developing in excess  
of 40 new targets for follow-up work.
Kakamega Dome Camp
Aircore drilling tested several gold-in-soil 
anomalies along the “Liranda Corridor” on the 
south side of the Kakamega Dome. The aircore 
programme was completed in H1 2014 and was 
very successful, with 247 holes of the 992 holes 
completed since the programme commenced in 
2013 returning anomalous results (>0.1g/t Au),  
of which 87 holes intersected zones of >0.50g/t Au. 
The gold mineralisation has been intersected  
in a variety of rock types along the Liranda 
Corridor, which indicates opportunities to test  
for different types and styles of gold deposits  
in this area. The majority of gold mineralisation 
intersected to date has been within weathered 
(oxidised) bedrock, often associated with  
quartz veining.
The aircore results are very encouraging given 
the current line spacing of the aircore traverses 
varies between 200 metres and 400 metres 
and the average depth of drilling to date is 
relatively shallow at approximately 50 metres.  
In late 2014 we commenced a diamond core  
drill programme to investigate the orientation 
and continuity of gold mineralisation intersected 
in the aircore drilling to date. By year end a total 
of 20 holes had been completed for 3,709 
metres of diamond core. Delays in the transport 
and processing of drill core samples over the 
end-of-year period resulted in a limited number 
of results being received and processed through 
QA/QC procedures.
Initial interpretation of diamond core drill results 
and structural data indicates that in a number of 
areas drilling has not intersected the mineralised 
interval and subsequently follow-up drill holes  
have been re-oriented to assess the geology and 
mineralised structures at the appropriate drill 
angle. A number of scissor holes have now been 
drilled to complete this task. 
Lake Zone Camp
In tandem with the aircore drilling, we are 
undertaking gradient and pole-dipole IP and 
Resistivity across selected gold-in-soil anomalies 
throughout the Lake Zone Camp in the central 
and western areas of the project. 
A total of 190 line kilometres of surveys were 
completed in 2014. Ten targets showing distinct 
resistivity and/or chargeability zones coincident 
with the gold-in-soil anomalies have been 
delineated and should be considered as priority 
targets for future drilling programmes. The 
Abimbo target in the far west of the West Kenya 
project area is expected to be the first target 
tested in 2015; this target is a Gold-Copper-
Molybdenum-Arsenic soil geochemical anomaly 
that extends over 6km
2
 and is co-incident with  
a large IP anomaly.

South Houndé Joint Venture 
In November, Acacia entered into an earn-in 
agreement with Sarama Resources Ltd (“Sarama”) 
whereby Acacia can earn an interest of up to 70% 
with the expenditure of up to US$14 million over 
a number of staged payments, at Sarama’s highly 
prospective South Houndé Project in Burkina Faso 
(the “Project”). Acacia may increase its interest  
in the Project to 75% on satisfaction of certain 
conditions relating to resource delineation. 
The Project comprises seven contiguous 
exploration licences covering a total area of 
814km
2
 in south-east Burkina Faso approximately 
300km south-west of Ouagadougou and 90km 
south-east of Bobo-Dioulasso, the second largest 
city in Burkina Faso. Access to the area is via  
a major sealed bitumen road from Ouagadougou  
to Bobo-Dioulasso and then via a network of 
secondary and tertiary roads. The Project area  
is sparsely populated. 
Sarama has identified a number of high-quality 
exploration targets including the 1.5Moz Au 
Tankoro Resource. The Tankoro Resource extends 
over 5.5km strike within a 25km long mineralised 
corridor, one of three such mineralised corridors 
on the property. Previous exploration, including 
surface geochemistry, geophysics (IP), aircore and 
reverse circulation drilling, has defined a number 
of high-quality exploration targets along strike 
from the Tankoro Resource and on multiple 
sub-parallel north-northeast trending corridors 
within the South Houndé Project. 
Going forward, exploration programmes will 
target high grade extensions to the existing 
Tankoro resource base, both along strike  
and at depth. Regional programmes will  
target new high-value discoveries across  
the Project through the use of geophysics  
(IP and aeromagnetic surveys) and extensive 
drilling programmes. 
The South Houndé JV agreement was signed in 
November 2014 with an initial three-month work 
programme commencing shortly thereafter. By 
the end of 2014, soil sampling had commenced 
on the Tyikoro licence and an induced polarisation 
(IP) survey extending the Tankoro IP grid had 
been completed. Additionally, a total of 59 
aircore holes (3,377 metres), seven reverse 
circulation holes (944 metres) and two diamond 
core holes (624 metres) had been completed 
across several targets; we expect to release 
initial results during Q1 2015.
It is anticipated that two diamond rigs and one 
reverse circulation rig will be in operation for 
most of Q1 2015 following up positive aircore 
results and IP targets, as well as testing for high-
grade plunge extensions to the MC and MM zones.

W e delivered strong financial results in 201 4 and 
returned to free cash generation during the year  
in spite of a lower gold price.
Introduction
The continued strong operational performance 
during the year was partially offset by the 
continuing weak gold price environment in 2014, 
with the average realised gold price US$121 per 
ounce lower than the prior year. This is reflected 
in the Acacia Group’s financial results for the 
year ended 31 December 2014.
Key highlights
• Revenue of US$930.2 million was  
US$1.2 million higher than 2013, driven  
by an increase in sales volumes of 60,083 
ounces (9%), which offset the 9% decrease  
in the average realised gold price.
• Cash costs decreased to US$732 per ounce 
sold from US$812 in 2013, driven by the 
higher production base, lower labour costs, 
lower warehouse costs and lower corporate 
costs incurred and allocated to site. 
• All-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) decreased  
to US$1,105 per ounce sold from US$1,346 
in 2013 due to lower cash costs, lower 
sustaining capital expenditures and 
capitalised development costs combined 
with the impact of increased sales volumes 
on per unit costs.
• EBITDA increased by 5% to US$252.7 million, 
mainly driven by lower direct mining costs. 
• Operational cash flow of US$289.5 million 
was 55% higher than 2013, primarily as  
a result of reduced operating costs and 
decreased working capital investment  
due to a decrease in other current assets, 
mainly driven by VAT refunds received from 
the Tanzanian Government, an increase  
in trade payables due to the timing of 
payments, partially offset by an investment 
in gold inventory and an increase in doré 
and concentrate receivables. 
The following review provides a detailed analysis 
of our consolidated results for the year ended 
31 December 2014 and the main factors 
affecting financial performance. It should be 
read in conjunction with the audited consolidated 
financial statements and accompanying notes 
on pages 101 to 145, which have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted for use in  
the European Union (“IFRS”). 
Discontinued operation – Tulawaka
Following the acquisition of Tulawaka by  
STAMICO in February 2014, the financial results 
of Tulawaka have been presented as discontinued 
operations in the consolidated financial 
statements. The comparative results in the 
consolidated income statement have been 
presented as if Tulawaka had been discontinued 
from the start of the comparative period, 
effectively excluding the net result relating to 
Tulawaka from individual income statement lines 
and aggregating it in one line called “Net profit/
(loss) from discontinued operations”.

Market overview
Our financial results are impacted by external 
drivers in the form of commodity prices, 
exchange rates and the cost of energy.  
Their impact in 2014 and our positioning  
going into 2015 are set out below. 
The market price of gold has a significant 
impact on Acacia’s operating earnings and its 
ability to generate cash flows. Gold price 
volatility continued to be elevated during 2014 
with the gold price ranging from a high of 
US$1,385 per ounce to a low of US$1,142 per 
ounce and closing the year at US$1,206 per 
ounce. Market gold prices averaged US$1,266 
per ounce in 2014, a 10% decline from the 
prior year average of US$1,411. 
The price of gold has been influenced by US 
Dollar strength, low interest rates worldwide, 
investment demand and the monetary policies 
implemented by major world central banks. 
Exchange traded fund (“ETF”) outflows were  
in part met by strong physical demand in Asia 
with jewellery demand in China accounting for 
one third of the world market. Gold is still 
viewed as a portfolio diversifier by central 
banks, which now hold a significant portion  
of global bullion reserves and continue to 
increase holdings.
As the US economy improved during 2014, the 
US Federal Reserve started to taper its bond 
purchase programme which culminated in 
September 2014. Equities performed well and 
the Dollar appreciated which, together with 
divergence in major central bank policies, 
caused gold prices to be extremely volatile 
during 2014. 
We continued our policy of no gold hedging 
during 2014. 
Copper
Acacia also produces copper as a co-product 
which is recognised as a part of revenue. Copper 
traded between US$2.86 and US$3.37 per 
pound in 2014. The average market copper  
price for 2014 was US$3.11 compared with 
US$3.32 per pound in 2013. Key external drivers 
of the copper prices include Chinese demand, 
the world’s largest consumer, the US growth 
outlook, existing stock levels and supply growth. 
During 2014 we utilised an option collar  
strategy whereby 75% of our estimated copper 
production was hedged at an average floor  
price of US$3.12 per pound and an average 
ceiling price of US$3.41 per pound, resulting  
in a realised gain of US$408 thousand for the 
year. In 2015, we have continued this strategy 
and put in place floor protection on 24% of our 
expected copper production at an average floor 
price of US$3.08 per pound and an average 
ceiling price of US$3.35 per pound. 
Fuel
Brent Crude oil traded between US$57 and 
US$115 per barrel and averaged US$100 per barrel 
(2013: US$109 per barrel) while trading at around 
US$58 per barrel at the end of the year. We 
consumed approximately 496,000 barrels of diesel 
in 2014 (2013: 610,000). Diesel fuel is refined 
from crude oil and is therefore subject to the same 
price volatility affecting crude oil prices and has a 
significant impact on our production costs. Crude 
oil has been impacted by the strength of the US 
Dollar and increased supplies from North America 
that resulted in an oversupply. Our overall oil 
exposure is heavily impacted by grid power reliability 
across all three operations and mining activity  
at our open pit mines. During 2014, we utilised  
an option collar strategy to hedge 75% of our 
estimated diesel consumption at an average floor 
price of US$88 per barrel and average capped price 
of US$105 per barrel. In 2015, we have continued 
this strategy and put in place protection on 
approximately 75% and 64% of our expected 2015 
and 2016 consumption respectively with average 
floors of US$97 and US$75 and a capped price  
of US$110 and US$90 per barrel respectively.
Currency exchange rates
A portion of Acacia’s expenditure is incurred in 
currencies other than US Dollars. The exposure 
relating to other currencies represented 
approximately 26% of the Company’s total 
expenditure in 2014, of which the main 
contributing currencies are the Tanzanian shilling 
and the South African rand. In 2014, the rand 
declined significantly against the US dollar  
as the US dollar strengthened, domestic factors 
persisted and investors shunned riskier rand-
denominated assets. The Tanzanian shilling 
remained relatively stable as the Bank of Tanzania 
imposed exchange controls throughout the year. We 
have put in place floor protection on approximately 
75% of our expected rand operating expenditures 
for 2015 with average floors of ZAR10.43. In light 
of potential rand weakness we have average 
ceilings of ZAR12.80 for 2015.

is stated for continuing operations
Revenue
Revenue for 2014 of US$930.2 million was  
in line with 2013. The 9% increase in sales 
volumes (60,083 ounces) was more than offset 
by a 9% decrease in the realised gold prices 
from US$1,379 per ounce sold in 2013 to 
US$1,258 in 2014 as a result of lower market 
prices. The increase in sales ounces was due  
to the higher production base. 
Included in total revenue is co-product revenue  
of US$45.3 million for 2014, which increased by 
5% from the prior year period (US$43.0 million) 
due to higher copper sales volumes, partly offset 
by a lower realised copper price. The 2014 
average realised copper price of US$3.01 per 
pound compared unfavourably to that of 2013 
(US$3.24 per pound), and was driven by global 
market factors regarding supply and demand. 
Cost of sales
Cost of sales was US$688.3 million for 2014, 
representing a decrease of 4% on the prior year 
(US$713.8 million). The key aspects impacting 
the cost of sales for the year were:
• Lower depreciation and amortisation 
charges driven by the lower capital base 
employed for the year slightly offset by the 
higher production base; and
• Cost savings across labour, energy and  
fuel and general administration costs, 
combined with an increased investment  
in gold inventory relating to ore stockpiles  
at Buzwagi and gold in circuit.
This was partially offset by:
• A lower proportion of mining costs being 
capitalised at Buzwagi and North Mara  
due to the change in mine plans; 
• Higher maintenance costs at Buzwagi and 
Bulyanhulu due to increased maintenance 
activity as a result of a focus on implementing 
improved maintenance practices and the 
impact of maintenance cycles; and
• Higher refining charges due to increased 
sales ounces. 
PERFORMANCE REVIEW
38 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
FINANCIAL REVIEW 
CONTINUED Central costs
Corporate administration expenses totalled 
US$32.7 million for 2014, a 4% decrease on  
2013 (US$34.0 million) driven by further savings  
in labour costs as a result of the continued 
restructuring of the corporate function and savings 
in travel costs, partially offset by increased legal 
fees. Stock-based payments of US$8.3 million,  
a change from negative US$1.8 million in 2013, 
increased as a result of the stronger share price 
performance, specifically when compared to our 
peers, impacting on the valuation.
Exploration and evaluation costs
Exploration and evaluation costs of US$18.3 
million were incurred in 2014, 8% higher than 
the US$16.9 million spent in 2013. The key 
focus areas for 2014 were extension drilling  
on both Reef 1 and 2 at Bulyanhulu (US$7.2 
million), and exploration programmes at the 
West Kenya Joint Venture project amounting  
to US$5.6 million. Also included in exploration 
costs is US$1.5 million relating to our 
investment and share of expenses of the  
South Houndé project in Burkina Faso. 
Corporate social responsibility expenses
Corporate social responsibility costs incurred 
amounted to US$10.8 million for the year 
compared to the prior year of US$12.2 million. 
The main projects for 2014 related to Village 
Benefit Implementation Agreements (“VBIAs”) at 
North Mara and larger contributions to general 
community projects funded from the Acacia 
Maendeleo Fund; of the total spend for 2014, 
US$8.5 million was spent on Acacia Maendeleo 
Fund projects and VBIAs.
Other charges
Other charges amounted to US$47.9 million,  
58% higher than 2013 (US$30.4 million). The main 
contributors were: (i) Acacia’s ongoing programme 
of zero cost collar contracts as part of a 
programme to mitigate the negative impact  
of copper, rand and fuel cost market volatility. 
The entry into these arrangements resulted  
in a combined mark-to-market revaluation  
loss of US$13.6 million, due to the fact that 
these arrangements do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, combined with a significant  
decline in the market price of oil, (ii) non-cash 
foreign exchange losses mainly related to the 
indirect tax receivables due to the weakening  
of the Tanzanian shilling (US$13.5 million),  
(iii) Operational Review costs, including external 
services and retrenchment costs of US$13.7 
million and (iv) legal costs of US$6.7 million. 
Refer to Note 10 of the consolidated financial 
statements for further details.
Finance expense and income
Finance expense of US$10.0 million for 2014 was 
5% higher than 2013 (US$9.6 million). The key 
drivers were accretion expenses relating to the 
discounting of the environmental reclamation 
liability (US$4.7 million) and US$2.4 million 
(US$3.1 million in 2013) relating to the servicing  
of the US$150 million undrawn revolving credit 
facility. Other costs include bank charges and 
interest on finance leases. Interest costs relating 
to the project financing on the Bulyanhulu CIL Plant 
Expansion project were capitalised to the cost of 
the asset up to 30 September 2014, due to the 
facility being directly attributable to the asset.  
For the year ended 31 December 2014, US$2.9 
million of borrowing costs have been capitalised to 
the project. From 1 October 2014, borrowing costs 
relating to the Bulyanhulu CIL Expansion project 
were expensed as the new CIL circuit was fully 
commissioned. The first principal repayment for 
this facility will be made in July 2015. 
Finance income relates predominantly to 
interest charged on non-current receivables  
and interest received on money market funds. 
Refer to Note 12 of the consolidated financial 
statements for details.
Taxation matters
The taxation charge was US$26.0 million for 
2014, compared to a credit of US$188.0 million 
in 2013. The tax charge was made up solely of 
deferred tax charges and reflects the impact  
of the profitability on a year-to-date basis. The 
effective tax rate in 2014 amounted to 23% 
compared to 20% in 2013. This was mainly 
driven by the increase in taxable income and the 
utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses 
at Buzwagi (US$21.1 million), all recorded in Q4 
2014, driven by the mine’s anticipated future 
profitability as per the revised mine plan.
Net earnings from continuing operations
As a result of the factors discussed above, net 
profit from continuing operations for 2014 was 
US$89.2 million, against the prior year loss of 
US$740.8 million. Lower costs of sales and no 
impairment charges incurred in 2014 contributed 
to the variance. This was partially offset by the 
higher tax charge and other charges.
Earnings per share
The earnings per share for 2014 amounted to 
US22.1 cents, an increase of US212.5 cents 
from the prior year loss of US190.4 cents. The 
increase was driven by increased net profit  
with no change in the underlying issued shares. 
Earnings per share from continuing operations 
amounted to US21.8 cents.
Financial position
Acacia had cash and cash equivalents on hand  
of US$293.9 million as at 31 December 2014 
(US$282.4 million as at 31 December 2013).  
The Group’s cash and cash equivalents are with 
counterparties whom the Group considers to 
have an appropriate credit rating. Location of 
credit risk is determined by physical location of 
the bank branch or counterparty. Investments are 
held mainly in United States dollars, with cash 
and cash equivalents in other foreign currencies 
maintained for operational requirements. 
During 2013, a US$142 million facility (the 
“Facility”) was put in place to fund the bulk of 
the costs of the construction of the Bulyanhulu 
CIL Plant Expansion project (the “Project”). The 
Facility is collateralised by the Project, and has a 
term of seven years with a spread over Libor of 
250 basis points. The seven year Facility is 
repayable in equal instalments (bi-annual) over 
the term of the Facility, after a two year repayment 
holiday period. The interest rate has been fixed 
at 3.6% through the use of an interest rate swap. 
The full facility of US$142 million was drawn in 
2013 with the first repayment due in H2 2015. 
The above complements the existing undrawn 
revolving credit facility of US$150 million which 
runs until November 2017.
The net book value of property, plant and 
equipment increased from US$1.28 billion in 
December 2013 to US$1.43 billion in December 
2014. The main capital expenditure drivers  
have been explained in the cash flow used  
in the investing activities section below, and have 
been offset by depreciation charges of US$124.1 
million. Refer to Note 20 to the consolidated 
financial statements for further details.
Total indirect tax receivables, net of a discount 
provision applied to the non-current portion, 
decreased from US$159.8 million as at 31 
December 2013 to US$108.1 million as at 31 
December 2014. The decrease was mainly due to 
refunds of US$132.8 million received during 
2014, which was partially offset by a net increase 
in current VAT receivables of approximately US$81 
million. The net deferred tax position decreased 
from an asset of US$14.9 million as at 31 
December 2013 to a liability of US$11.1 million 
as at 31 December 2014. This was mainly as a 
result of taxable income in 2014, the impact of 
timing differences and the utilisation of previously 
unrecognised tax losses at Buzwagi (US$21.1 
million), driven by the mine’s anticipated future 
profitability as per the revised mine plan.
Net assets attributable to owners of the parent 
increased from US$1.93 billion in December 
2013 to US$2.0 billion in December 2014.  
The increase reflects the current year profit 
attributable to owners of the parent of  
US$90.4 million and the payment of the  
final 2013 dividend of US$8.2 million and  
the 2014 interim dividend of US$5.7 million.

revaluation of assets
2  Non-current asset movements relates to the investment in the land acquisitions reflected as prepaid operating leases and Tanzanian Government receivables
Capitalised development
Capitalised development capital includes 
capitalised stripping for North Mara (US$40.9 
million) and Buzwagi (US$31.4 million) and 
Bulyanhulu capitalised underground 
development (US$60.2 million).
Non-cash capital
Non-cash capital was US$22.3 million and 
consisted mainly of reclamation asset 
adjustments (US$21.0 million) and the full year 
increase in capital accruals (US$6.9 million), 
partially offset by the revaluation of rand-based 
assets. The reclamation adjustments were 
driven by changes in estimates of future 
reclamation cash flows combined with lower  
US risk free rates driving lower discount rates. 
Other investing capital
The sale of Tulawaka to STAMICO resulted  
in a cash payment of the balance of the 
rehabilitation fund, less the transaction 
consideration on completion, and amounted  
to US$11.6 million. During 2014, North Mara 
incurred land purchases totalling US$9.0  
million. This was offset by a reduction in other  
non-current assets of US$7.4 million. 
Cash flow – continuing and discontinued 
operations
Cash flow from operating activities was US$289.5 
million for 2014, an increase of US$102.4 million, 
when compared to 2013 (US$187 .1 million). The 
increase relates to the increased gold production 
and improved cost performance as well as an 
increase in inflows associated with working capital 
of US$61.3 million when compared to 2013. The 
working capital inflow relates to a decrease in 
other current assets of US$28.0 million, mainly 
driven by VAT refunds received from the Tanzanian 
Government and an increase in trade payables of 
US$22.7 million due to the timing of payments 
compared to the prior year. This was partially 
offset by an investment in gold inventory of 
US$29.2 million and an increase in doré and 
concentrate receivables of US$10.0 million.
Cash flow used in investing activities was 
US$257.0 million for 2014, a decrease of 34% 
when compared to 2013 (US$386.9 million), 
driven by lower sustaining capital expenditure at 
Buzwagi and North Mara, lower expansionary 
capital expenditure due to higher spending on 
the Bulyanhulu CIL Expansion project in 2013 
and lower capitalised development expenditure 
at Buzwagi and North Mara.
Sustaining capital
Sustaining capital expenditure includes the 
investment in mine equipment of US$21.8 
million, mainly relating to component change 
outs at North Mara and Bulyanhulu and 
investment in tailings and infrastructure at 
Bulyanhulu (US$18.3 million), North Mara 
(US$7.1 million) and Buzwagi (US$7.0 million).
Expansionary capital
Expansionary capital expenditure consisted 
mainly of the Bulyanhulu CIL Expansion project 
(US$44.5 million) and the Gokona Underground 
project at North Mara (US$13.1 million).

FINANCIAL REVIEW 
CONTINUED Cash flow used in financing activities for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 was an outflow of 
US$19.0 million, a decrease of US$101.3 million 
on an inflow of US$82.3 million in 2013. The 
outflow relates to payment of the final 2013 
dividend of US$8.2 million, payment of the 2014 
interim dividend of US$5.7 million and finance 
lease payments of US$5.1 million.
Dividend
An interim dividend of US1.4 cents per share was 
paid to shareholders on 22 September 2014. 
The Board of Directors have recommended a 
final dividend for 2014 of US2.8 cents per share, 
subject to the shareholders approving this 
recommendation at the AGM. 
Significant judgements in applying 
accounting policies and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty
Many of the amounts included in the 
consolidated financial statements require 
management to make judgements and/or 
estimates. These judgements and estimates  
are continuously evaluated and are based on 
management’s experience and best knowledge 
of the relevant facts and circumstances, but 
actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the consolidated financial 
information included in this release. Information 
about such judgements and estimation is 
included in the accounting policies and/or  
notes to the consolidated financial statements, 
and the key areas are summarised below.
Areas of judgement and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the consolidated financial statements include:
• estimates of the quantities of proven and 
probable gold reserves;
• the capitalisation of production stripping 
costs;
• the capitalisation of exploration and 
evaluation expenditures;
• review of goodwill, tangible and intangible 
assets’ carrying value, the determination  
of whether these assets are impaired and 
the measurement of impairment charges  
or reversals;
• the estimated fair values of cash generating 
units for impairment tests, including 
estimates of future costs to produce  
proven and probable reserves, future 
commodity prices, foreign exchange rates 
and discount rates;
• the estimated useful lives of tangible and 
long-lived assets and the measurement of 
depreciation expense;
• property, plant and equipment held under 
finance leases; 
• recognition of a provision for environmental 
rehabilitation and the estimation of  
the rehabilitation costs and timing  
of expenditure;
• whether to recognise a liability for loss 
contingencies and the amount of any  
such provision;
• whether to recognise a provision for accounts 
receivable, a provision for obsolescence on 
consumables inventory and the impact of 
discounting the non-current element of the 
indirect tax receivable;
• recognition of deferred income tax assets, 
amounts recorded for uncertain tax 
positions, the measurement of income tax 
expense and indirect taxes;
• determination of the cost incurred in the 
productive process of ore stockpiles, gold in 
process, gold doré/bullion and concentrate, 
as well as the associated net realisable 
value and the split between the long-term 
and short-term portions;
• determination of fair value of derivative  
instruments; and
• determination of fair value of stock options 
and cash-settled share-based payments.
Going concern statement 
Acacia Group’s business activities, together with 
factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic report and Perfomance review sections 
of this Annual Report. The financial position of 
Acacia Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the 
preceding paragraphs of this financial review. 
At 31 December 2014, the Group had cash and 
cash equivalents of US$293.9 million with a 
further US$150 million available under the 
undrawn revolving credit facility, which remains in 
place until November 2017. Total borrowings at 
the end of the year amounted to US$142 million, 
of which the first repayment is only repayable  
in H2 2015. 
Included in other current assets are amounts 
due to the Group relating to indirect taxes of 
US$45.9 million which are expected to be 
received within 12 months, but these will be 
offset to an extent by new claims submitted for 
input taxes incurred during 2015. The refunds 
remain dependent on processing and payments 
of refunds by the Government of Tanzania. 
We expect that the above, in combination with 
the expected operational cash flow generated 
during 2015, will be sufficient to cover the 
capital requirements and other commitments  
for the foreseeable future. 
In assessing Acacia Group’s going concern 
status, the Directors have taken into account 
the above factors, including the financial 
position of Acacia Group and in particular its 
significant cash position, the current gold and 
copper price and market expectations for the 
same in the medium term, and Acacia Group’s 
capital expenditure and financing plans. After 
making appropriate enquiries, the Directors 
consider that Acacia and Acacia Group as  
a whole have adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and that it is appropriate to adopt  
the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.

OUR RELATIONSHIPS  
AND COMMITMENT 
TO STAKEHOLDERS 
W e contribute to the economic 
growth of our host communities, 
regions and countries to assist  
the progression of sustainable 
socio-economic development.
Acacia’s direct economic contribution is made up of the economic value  
we add by paying our employees, Governments, suppliers, shareholders, 
contractors and communities. However, our true economic contribution  
is far greater once the wider effects of our presence are considered.  
These include the indirect effects of people spending their wages, 
Governments distributing tax and royalty revenues, and neighbouring 
communities using the infrastructure developed for our operations.  
Our direct economic contribution in 2014 was US$920 million compared  
to US$959 million in 2013. 
The distribution of Acacia’s taxes includes royalties, indirect taxes (VAT  
and fuel levies), payroll taxes (inclusive of social security payments and  
other taxes such as withholding taxes), stamp duties and environmental 
levies. Geographically, the majority of our taxes are paid in Tanzania,  
being the location of our operating mines. Our net taxation contribution  
was US$121 million in 2014, compared to US$132 million in 2013,  
as a result of the reduction in our workforce reducing payroll taxes. 
94.5%
of Acacia employees in Tanzania are Tanzanians

Our areas of focus
Our sustainability practices are focused on those areas that are material  
to our business and operations, these being community relations, employees, 
environment, health and safety, and security and human rights. Details of 
activities as regards each of these areas and our performance for the year 
are further described below.
Community relations
We continued to make good progress across 
Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) and 
Community Relations initiatives during the 
year, having achieved a positive outcome  
to the majority of our targets and priorities. 
Throughout 2014 we enhanced stakeholder 
engagement and community cohesion 
activities, notably through the Brazuka 
initiative, this being the FIFA World Cup soccer 
screening initiative we introduced during the 
year to promote community engagement.  
This initiative involved the screening of World 
Cup football matches in the vicinity to all of our 
operations and the conduct of Fursa (meaning 
opportunity) seminars with local communities, 
with the objective of reviewing opportunities to 
progress community economic development 
over the longer term. Both elements of this 
initiative achieved positive outcomes, with the 
football screening events receiving extensive 
positive media coverage and attendance levels 
of approximately 2,000 or more local residents  
at each screening location. 
During the year, we also commenced an 
extensive review of our CSR approach and 
strategy, in order to assess success levels 
across current CSR programmes and identify 
further areas for improvement and 
Employees 
We continued to make noticeable progress 
across a variety of employee initiatives 
throughout 2014, whilst maintaining 
acceptable levels across core employee 
metrics. Annual turnover across our operations 
was approximately 23%, a slight increase on 
2013 (20%) due to ongoing organisational 
restructuring at Bulyanhulu. We continued to 
progress our commitment to the localisation  
of our workforce throughout 2014, with annual 
national employment levels amounting to 
approximately 94% of our total workforce,  
an increase on 2013 levels (93%).
We continued to invest in training and 
development programmes throughout the  
year, notably through the introduction of 
Tufanikiwe Pamoja, our cultural transformation 
programme, the WeCare programme,  
our enhanced health and safety training 
programme, and a number of additional 
business improvement and project 
management programmes. We also 
maintained our focus on longer-term  
training programmes, such as our IMDP 
programme, with 11 employees graduating 
from this programme in 2014 and 
development, particularly in the context of 
economic empowerment initiatives. In this 
regard, during the year we took a number of 
steps to enhance local procurement initiatives, 
for example through increased use of local 
catering supplies to our operations. We will  
look to progress this further in 2015. 
In addition to site specific programmes, during 
the year we continued to progress actions 
required for the development of an artisanal  
and small-scale mining project, in collaboration 
with the World Bank, AngloGold Ashanti and the 
Tanzanian Ministry of Energy and Minerals. Key 
achievements included the completion of a 
feasibility study as regards the suitability of 
potential sites for operation of the project.  
The feasibility study is under review and we will 
look to assess options for the implementation 
of its recommendations in 2015. 
A total of 77 new grievances were lodged  
during the year, a significant decrease on 2013 
grievance levels (269 new grievances lodged). 
The decrease was due to a reduction in the 
number of cases lodged as regards historic 
land compensation matters at North Mara, 
which have had a significant impact on 
grievance levels in prior years. 
51 apprentices graduating from the Integrated 
Mining Technical Training (“IMTT”) programme. 
Approximately 9% of our overall workforce  
is comprised of women, something which is 
reflective of gender diversity generally within the 
mining industry. Of this, female representation 
across our management structures equalled 
approximately 10% at Board level and 20% at 
SLT level. All levels are broadly consistent with 
female representation levels in 2013.

Health and safety 
Group-wide Total Reportable Injury Frequency 
Rate (“TRIFR”) was 0.86 for 2014 compared  
to 0.68 in 2013, a disappointing outcome.  
This was further compounded by the tragic 
employee fatality which occurred at 
Bulyanhulu during the year. Both of these 
events run counter to our ultimate safety 
objective of safeguarding and maintaining  
the safety of all employees in the workplace. 
As a result, management instigated a number 
of additional health and safety initiatives 
during the year in order to drive and highlight 
our expectations in respect of health and 
safety in the workplace. One of the key 
projects introduced during the year was the 
Tunajali or WeCare programme, which is a 
behavioural safety programme designed to 
embed a culture of safety in the workplace,  
in addition to customary systems of checks 
and processes. This programme has now 
been rolled out across all of our operations 
and we expect this to have a positive impact 
on health and safety practices going forward.
In addition to the introduction and 
implementation of the WeCare programme,  
we continued to progress and strengthen the 
implementation of our critical risk standards, 
which apply to specific operating practices to  
Environment
Environmental performance for 2014 was  
good overall, with the Group successfully 
completing the majority of key initiatives  
and priorities for the year. Key achievements 
include the introduction of further 
enhancements to Acacia’s environmental 
strategy in order to support operational 
initiatives, gaining re-approval for all mine 
closure plans, in accordance with applicable 
regulatory approval and review requirements, 
and obtaining full certification for Buzwagi 
under the International Cyanide Code. 
Throughout the year Acacia’s GHG emissions 
continued to be impacted by interruptions to 
electricity supply in Tanzania and our continued 
reliance on self-generation of power. Overall, 
2014 GHG emissions equalled 371,508 
tonnes of CO 2, in line with 2013 levels. 
However, as a result of energy conservation 
projects during the year, our energy usage, 
assessed on the basis of mega joules  
of energy used per tonne of ore milled, 
decreased by 7.4%, when compared to 2013 
usage levels. Further information on Group 
GHG emissions is provided on page 86.
As regards water management practices,  
our water usage in 2014 increased by 14.8% 
when compared to 2013, largely as a result  
of the impact of the commissioning of the  
new CIL plant at Bulyanhulu. We will look  
to enhance water management practices in  
2015 following completion of the CIL plant 
commissioning process as part of Group  
water management practices.
Security and human rights
In 2014, the Company continued its 
enhancement of security and safety 
infrastructure, as well as completing a review 
of its security resourcing and operational 
model. As a result, the Company transitioned 
management of security at North Mara and 
some regional security support services to 
an external provider, with encouraging initial 
results. In addition to this, the increased 
integration of security operations with 
community relations activities took on a 
greater focus in 2014 and will continue in  
the year ahead. This reflects the recognition 
that security practices need to focus on 
understanding and addressing the underlying 
drivers of security incidents in the areas in 
which we operate.
Throughout the year, security policies, 
procedures and techniques were subject to 
ongoing reviews to align with evolving best 
practice and the operational requirements of 
each of our operations, something which will 
continue into 2015 as part of overall security 
governance practices. We also completed an 
annual external review of our performance 
against a number of international standards 
and principles, including the Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human Rights  
and use of force protocols. The outcome  
of these reviews was encouraging overall, 
showing consistent levels of improvement 
across all operations.
We also affirmed our commitment to the 
activities of Search for Common Ground,  
an international NGO focused on conflict 
reduction and building sustainable peace 
through dialogue, media and community 
engagement. Search for Common Ground 
conducted over 300 sessions with more  
than 12,000 stakeholders in the communities 
around Buzwagi, Bulyanhulu and North Mara 
on topics including conflict resolution, human 
rights, sexual harassment and violence 
against women and the dangers of illegal 
intrusion.  This included providing training  
to over 1,500 members of Tanzanian Police 
units based in the vicinity of our operations on 
Voluntary Principles, Use of Force procedures 
and the detection and prevention of sexual 
harassment. We will continue to work with 
Search for Common Ground to progress our 
joint commitment to promoting human rights 
and appropriate conflict resolution practices 
as part of programmes aimed at promoting 
secure and safe environments in and around 
our operations.
set out required safety standards, introducing 
additional enhancements to the following 
standards during the year: mobile equipment, 
ground control, working at heights, hazardous 
chemicals, hazardous energy isolation and 
aviation. We also progressed a number of 
initiatives within an occupational health and 
safety context to increase the effectiveness  
of existing occupational health programmes 
and continued to progress health 
assessments, including malaria control 
assessments, for our employee and  
wider community base.

Bulyanhulu and North Mara, where significant steps have been  
taken during the year to support longer-term mining activities. 
The Board’s plan for 2015
Focus areas for 2015 include:
Operational and financial performance reviews
Risk management and internal controls reviews 
Annual mining planning review
Capital project and exploration reviews
Government relations reviews 
Further strategic reviews 
The makeup of the Board’s focus areas for 2015 will not significantly 
change from 2014 and still comprises key monitoring activities as 
regards operational performance and cost controls. Additional focus 
will however, be placed on risk management and internal controls 
reviews to assess additional requirements, if any, for alignment  
with risk management assessments under the 2014 edition of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, Government relations, given the 
forthcoming elections in Tanzania, and further strategic reviews  
to support the execution of the long-term plan we set out in  
November 2014.
GOVERNANCE 
OVERVIEW
Kelvin Dushnisky
Chairman of the Board
Dear Shareholders, 
As noted in my Chairman’s statement, we have continued to make 
significant progress across the business in 2014, having attained 
production levels that exceeded guidance expectations, whilst 
continuing to deliver noticeably on cost control objectives. 
This operational performance was complemented by a review of the 
composition of the Board and its Committees and their respective 
responsibilities to ensure continuing alignment with the Company’s 
evolving business model. Whilst this governance review has  
not resulted in any significant change to the Board’s remit of 
responsibilities or its composition, nor that of its core Committees 
(Audit, Compensation, EHS&S and Nomination & Governance), 
following this review we took the decision to dissolve the Technical 
Committee and I also decided to step down from my position  
as a member of the Compensation Committee. 
In line with previous years, all members of the Board and its 
Committees completed an annual performance and effectiveness 
evaluation for the reporting period and, again, all evaluations were 
concluded positively, showing efficient and effective performance levels 
across all core governance functions. Further details of this assessment 
are provided on page 58. The Company also completed and achieved  
a satisfactory conclusion to its annual risk management and internal 
controls assessment, further details of which are provided on page 55.
In 2015, the Board will continue to focus its attentions as required to  
drive increasing levels of operational and financial performance, whilst 
overseeing and supporting management in the ongoing enhancements 
to the Company’s strategy and business model, in line with the 
long-term plan set out for Acacia at our Investor Day in November.  
As part of this, we will continue to assess our governance practices 
against the requirements set out in the latest edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, which takes effect from 2015 onwards, 
particularly in the context of ongoing assessments applicable to 
internal controls and risk management systems and the introduction  
of enhanced reporting to support going concern and business viability 
statements. We will also conduct our first external performance 
assessment, in line with best practice requirements under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, and will report against this accordingly.

GOVERNANCE REPORT
Board composition
As at 31 December 2014, the Board comprised a Non-Executive 
Chairman, one Executive Director and eight Non-Executive Directors,  
of whom seven were independent.
Board changes during 2014
As noted in the Chairman’s Statement, two Non-Executive Directors left 
the Board this year. David Hodgson decided not to stand for re-election 
at the Company’s 2014 AGM and Rick McCreary stepped down from the 
Board in August 2014. There were no new Board appointments during 
the reporting period.
Retirement and re-election
In line with the requirements for annual re-election under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, all existing Directors will offer themselves  
for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. The Board determines all 
Directors to be eligible for re-election.
Board leadership
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
In line with best practice, the roles of Chief Executive Officer and 
Chairman, and their related responsibilities, are separated. The divisions 
of responsibility and the specifications of each role are set out in writing 
and reviewed periodically as part of annual corporate governance 
reviews. Responsibilities are divided so as to ensure that the Chairman 
remains principally responsible for the leadership of the Board and 
ensuring that the Board plays a full and constructive part in the 
development and determination of the Company’s strategy and  
overall commercial objectives. The Chief Executive Officer is primarily 
responsible for all executive management matters affecting Acacia  
and is principally responsible for running the Company’s business.  
All members of executive management report directly to him.
Senior Independent Director
Mr Tomsett is Acacia’s Senior Independent Director (“SID”). The 
responsibilities and duties of the SID are determined in accordance  
with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code.  
In particular, the SID is required to:
• act as a sounding board for the Chairman;
• act as an intermediary for other Directors, when necessary;
• ensure that an annual appraisal of the Chairman is conducted by  
the Non-Executive Directors, without the Chairman present; and
• be available to shareholders for discussion purposes, in cases where 
contact between such shareholders and the Chairman and/or CEO 
has been ineffective or is otherwise inappropriate.
Matters reserved
There is a schedule of matters that the Board has specifically reserved 
for its decision. This schedule was reviewed and updated during the year 
and includes matters such as setting the Group’s strategic aims and 
objectives, approving significant contractual commitments (including 
merger and acquisition activity), approving capital-raising, approving 
changes to the Group’s share capital and corporate structure, approving 
financial reports and ensuring maintenance of a sound system of internal 
control and risk management.
Delegation of authority
The Board has delegated responsibility for certain matters to four 
Committees, namely the Audit Committee, the EHS&S Committee,  
the Nomination & Governance Committee and the Compensation 
Committee. The membership, Chairmanship and activities of each  
of these Committees are set out in each Committee report on  
pages 59 to 63 and as part of the Remuneration Report.
Board effectiveness
Board meetings and attendance
Board decisions are predominantly made by achieving a consensus at 
Board meetings. In exceptional circumstances, decisions may be taken 
by the majority of Board members. Questions arising at any meeting are 
determined by a majority of votes. In the case of an equality of votes, 
Acacia’s Articles of Association do not provide the Chairman with a 
second or casting vote. All Directors are required to take decisions 
objectively and in the best interests of the Company. As part of their 
duties as Directors, Non-Executive Directors are expected to apply 
independent judgement to contribute to issues of strategy and 
performance and to scrutinise the performance of management.
The Board is scheduled to meet at least four times a year, and at  
such other times as are necessary to discharge its duties. The Board 
met a total of eight times in 2014. Five meetings were held in person, 
and three meetings were held by teleconference. Details of individual 
attendance are provided in the table opposite. From time to time, the 
Board schedules meetings so as to allow for a meeting to be held in 
Tanzania, if appropriate, in order to provide for further access to the 
wider Acacia workforce. During the year one Board meeting was held in 
person in Tanzania as part of the Directors’ annual site visit to operations.
Board briefings and development
The Board receives monthly management reports and quarterly reports 
outlining all material operational, financial and strategic developments. 
These ensure that Board members remain properly briefed on the 
performance and financial position of the Group on a continuous basis. 
Board and Committee papers are circulated prior to all meetings to allow 
Directors to be briefed in advance of discussions. Board meetings 
include a quarterly operational and financial performance review to 
ensure that, in addition to specific scheduled matters and any other 
business, core business performance is monitored and assessed on a 
continuous basis. In addition to scheduled Board meetings, all Directors 
have access to members of the Senior Leadership Team and to whatever 
further information they need to perform their duties and to satisfy  
their responsibilities. Acacia’s independent Non-Executive Directors  
and Committee Chairmen meet with members of the Senior Leadership 
Team to receive more in-depth briefings on Board and Committee 
matters whenever required or requested. In addition, all Directors 
continue to have free access to visit operations outside scheduled Board 
arrangements and each Director is expected to participate in at least  
one operational site visit per year. Board training and development  
needs are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Ordinarily, training standards 
and requirements form part of Board evaluation criteria. Directors may  
take independent professional advice, as necessary, at the Company’s 
expense in the furtherance of their duties. In addition to this, each Board 
Committee is entitled to seek independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, where necessary, to assist or guide the Committee 
in the performance of its functions.
GOVERNANCE
54 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control  
and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. In line with  
this responsibility, the Board has established ongoing processes and 
systems for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks that 
the Group faces, which have been in place throughout the year and  
up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. For 2014 purposes, 
Acacia’s system of internal controls and risk management takes into 
account the recommendations contained in the Turnbull Guidance on 
Internal Systems and Controls published by the Financial Reporting 
Council in October 2005 (the “Turnbull Guidance”). The system is 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
Acacia’s business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board principally bases its monitoring of internal controls on its 
review of management reports and assessments, and on the quarterly 
reports it receives on the status of Acacia’s internal control environment.
This is supported by the risk profile reviews that Acacia’s internal audit 
function carries out to help the Board identify and manage the most 
significant risks and events that could affect the Company’s operations, 
financials and performance. Where necessary, the Board is assisted by 
its Committees in reviewing internal systems and controls, particularly 
the Audit Committee, which is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control and financial risk management systems.
An overview of the governance structure used for Acacia’s approach to 
risk management and the processes and procedures used in the context 
of risk management is provided on pages 22 and 23 of this Annual Report.
In compliance with its obligations, the Board conducted an annual 
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management  
and internal control systems for the reporting period. The review covered 
all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance 
controls. In conjunction with Acacia’s internal audit function and members  
of the Senior Leadership Team, the Board conducted a specific assessment 
of internal controls, which considered all significant aspects of internal 
control for the reporting period. During the course of its review of the 
system of internal control, the Board did not identify or hear of any 
failings or weaknesses that it determined to be material. Therefore  
a confirmation of any necessary actions undertaken is not required. 
Additional information regarding the internal control and risk management 
process specifically in relation to the financial reporting process and  
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is provided as 
part of the Audit Committee report and the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements.
The Board regularly reviews the Company’s internal controls and risk 
management framework and systems; during 2015 the Board will assess 
them against the enhanced assessment requirements introduced by the 
2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code, taking into account 
the FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting that has been introduced to replace 
the Turnbull Guidance for financial reporting periods commencing on or 
after 1 October 2014.

any transactions and relationships with the Barrick Group are conducted 
at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms. The Relationship 
Agreement will continue for so long as Acacia is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange and Barrick owns or controls at least 15% of Acacia’s 
issued share capital or voting rights.
The Relationship Agreement provides Barrick with certain Director 
appointment rights in line with a sliding scale, structured as follows:
Barrick percentage shareholding Barrick Director appointment rights
40% or more The higher of three Non-Executive 
Directors and the maximum that may  
be appointed under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
25% up to 40% The higher of two Non-Executive Directors 
and one less than the maximum number 
of Non-Executive Directors that may be 
appointed under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
15% up to 25% The higher of one Non-Executive Director 
and two less than the maximum number 
of Non-Executive Directors 
In addition to Director appointment rights, and subject to certain exceptions, 
as part of the terms of the Relationship Agreement, Barrick has undertaken 
that members of the Barrick Group will not carry on the exploration of 
gold or silver in Africa or acquire, whether through an asset purchase  
or the purchase of securities, a gold or silver mining business in Africa 
that competes with Acacia without giving Acacia the option to exercise 
certain rights of first refusal for so long as Barrick holds 30% or more  
of the issued share capital or voting rights of Acacia. Acacia has given  
a reciprocal non-compete commitment to Barrick in this regard.
Acacia entered into the Relationship Agreement at the time of its initial 
public offering in 2010. During the year we amended the Relationship 
Agreement to ensure full compliance with the independence requirements 
introduced to the Listing Rules, which took effect in November 2014. 
Following these amendments the Relationship Agreement expressly 
provides that:
(i)  any and all transactions with Barrick (or its associates) shall be 
conducted at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms; 
(ii)  neither Barrick, nor any of its associates, will take any action that will 
prevent Acacia from complying with its obligations under the Listing 
Rules; and 
(iii)  neither Barrick, nor any of its associates, will propose or procure the 
proposal of a shareholder resolution which is intended or appears to 
be intended to circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules. 
In addition, as a result of recent Listing Rule changes, the Listing Rules 
now require premium listed companies with controlling shareholders  
to provide a confirmation in their annual reports that all of the 
independence provisions contained in their relationship agreements  
have been complied with. In line with this requirement, the Board has 
assessed Barrick and Acacia’s compliance with the Relationship 
Agreement’s independence requirements, as amended, and has 
assessed compliance with these requirements, in line with practices 
employed in any event since the IPO. As such, the Board can confirm  
that Acacia has complied with the independence requirements stated 
above since their adoption and, so far as the Board is aware, Barrick  
and its associates have also complied with these requirements. In this 
regard, all members of the Board support the giving of this statement 
and no independent Non-Executive Director has raised any objections  
in this regard. 
AGM
Acacia’s 2015 AGM will be held on 23 April 2015 at 10.00 am (UK time). 
The business of the meeting will be conducted in accordance with Companies 
Act 2006 requirements and standards promoted by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Chairman of the Board and the Chairmen of the 
Audit, Compensation, EHS&S and Nomination & Governance Committees 
will be available to answer questions put to them by shareholders at the 
meeting. The AGM Notice is included in the documentation that has been 
provided with this Annual Report and is also available on the Company’s 
website. In accordance with best practice, the notice has been sent to 
shareholders at least 20 business days prior to the date of the meeting.
Conflicts of interest
Mr Dushnisky and Mr Galbraith are nominee Directors appointed by 
Barrick. These individuals hold a number of cross directorships with 
members of the Barrick Group, which give rise to situations in which 
these Directors could have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts,  
or possibly may conflict, with those of Acacia. In addition, as a result  
of their employment within the Barrick Group, these individuals also  
hold interests under Barrick’s restricted stock unit plan and other 
employee incentive plans. 
Certain other members of Acacia’s senior management team hold 
interests under Barrick’s stock option plan as a result of prior 
employment within the Barrick Group. These interests were acquired 
prior to joining Acacia and are not deemed to be material interests.
The Companies Act 2006 requires directors to avoid situations where 
they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or may 
possibly conflict, with company interests. However, the Act does allow 
directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts of interest where a company’s articles of association contain  
a provision to that effect. Acacia’s Articles of Association contain such 
provision and a procedure for this. In accordance with this procedure,  
the conflicts outlined above were declared and authorised by the Board. 
GOVERNANCE
56 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 The monitoring and, if appropriate, authorisation of any actual or potential 
conflict of interest is an ongoing process. Directors are required to notify 
the Company of any material changes in positions or situations that have 
already been considered and any new situations. In addition, Directors are 
required to declare interests in potential or actual transactions and are 
required to abstain from voting on such transactions, subject to permitted 
exceptions. If a question arises as to whether any interest of a Director 
prevents him or her from voting or being counted in a quorum in the 
context of a potential or actual transaction, the matter is referred to the 
Chairman, whose findings are final and conclusive. In the context of 
questions relating to any such conflict of the Chairman, the question may 
ultimately be decided by a resolution of the other Directors. The Board 
reviews conflicts of interest on a periodic basis and maintains a record  
of all declared conflicts.
Specifically as regards nominee Directors appointed by Barrick, the 
Relationship Agreement provides that if any transaction or arrangement 
arises directly between a member of the Barrick Group and a member  
of the Acacia Group and does or could, in the opinion of a majority of 
Directors (excluding any Director(s) appointed by Barrick), give rise to a 
conflict of interest between Acacia and any Director appointed by Barrick, 
any such matter must be approved and authorised at a duly convened 
Board meeting or in writing by a majority of Directors (excluding any 
Director(s) appointed by Barrick) prior to the Company taking further 
action in relation to such matter. Save for the matters set out above,  
no other conflicts of interest were disclosed to the Board during the 
reporting period.
Corporate governance compliance
For the year under review, as a UK company with a premium listing on  
the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, Acacia is required to 
make certain statements regarding the way it is governed, as required by 
the 2012 edition UK Corporate Governance Code, which is available at 
www.frc.org.uk. Accordingly, this report explains how Acacia has applied 
the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code during 2014.
Generally, Acacia seeks to comply with all relevant provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code wherever possible and for the reporting year 
it is the Board’s view that Acacia has complied with all such provisions, 
save for the following:
• Mr Dushnisky was not independent on appointment as Chairman  
and an external search consultancy was not used in connection  
with his appointment. Given Mr Dushnisky’s experience within  
the mining sector, his skill set and his familiarity with the operating  
and geographical environment in which the Company’s assets  
are located, the Board believes his appointment to be in the  
best interests of the Company irrespective of this (Provisions  
A.3.1 and B.2.4). 
• Board and Board Committee performance assessments for 2014 
were conducted by means of self-assessment, rather than external 
facilitation. This is due to the fact that the Board prioritised its time 
this year on core matters required to be performed in order to 
complete the Company’s re-branding initiatives and to complete the 
execution of operational and cost control reviews during the year, 
which supported the Company’s achievement of 2014 operational 
and financial guidance objectives. The Board remains mindful of  
the timing requirements for the external facilitation of performance 
reviews and has committed to execute the 2015 performance 
evaluation in line with this requirement (Provision B.6.2).
• Acacia has not adopted a formal diversity policy; however, we ensure 
that all recruitment is conducted on the basis that we hire the best 
candidate for all positions, at all levels, including Board and senior 
management positions, irrespective of gender or race (Provision B.2.4).
Lastly, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires that the Board 
provides a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of Acacia’s 
position and prospects in its external reporting. Accordingly, the 
Directors were responsible for the preparation and approval of this 
Annual Report and consider the Annual Report and Accounts for 2014, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and believe 
that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
Acacia’s performance, business model and strategy.
Acacia’s external auditors have reviewed those parts of this statement, 
which they are required to review under the Listing Rules. In addition  
to compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, as part of 
commitments given in connection with Acacia’s secondary listing on the 
Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, the Board has undertaken to comply with 
the Corporate Governance Guidelines issued by the Tanzanian Capital 
Markets and Securities Authority to the extent that these requirements are 
equivalent to applicable UK corporate governance standards. In the case 
of any conflict between the two, the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code prevail.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
59 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
GOVERNANCE Significant issues considered by the Committee in 2014
In addition to carrying out the activities referred to above, we reviewed 
and considered the following in the context of significant issues relating 
to Group financial statements:
Indirect tax recoverability
As part of ongoing monitoring and review of taxation matters, we have 
reviewed the status, recoverability and classification of the Company’s 
indirect tax receivables relating to VAT charged on imports and the 
domestic supply of goods and services. In this regard, we have received 
reports from management on the status of discussions and negotiations 
of such matters between management and the Tanzanian Revenue 
Authority (“TRA”); we have reviewed management’s ongoing calculations 
of amounts so outstanding; the procedure established to recover refunds 
and amounts due under the escrow account established to fund refunds 
due in respect of portions of the receivable; the audit process followed 
to confirm such refunds; and the overall time frame for the receipt of 
such refunds against amounts outstanding under the receivable from 
time to time. The Committee has also taken into account the views and 
contributions of the external auditors as regards recoverability and 
classification of relevant indirect tax receivables. Based on the  
foregoing, the Committee has satisfied itself that the Company’s  
indirect tax receivables are recoverable and appropriately classified  
in the circumstances and is satisfied with the suitability of the  
related disclosures contained in this Annual Report.
Deferred tax
A number of tax assessments have been raised by the TRA in prior years 
which have been challenged by members of the Group. We have reviewed 
the basis of these assessments and discussed with management their 
views as to why the assessments are incorrect, along with the status of 
appeals and recent correspondence with the TRA. We also discussed 
these matters with the external auditors. Based on this review the 
Committee concluded that the Company had sufficiently provided for any 
uncertain tax positions and that any material contingent liabilities had 
been adequately disclosed. In addition, the Committee reviewed the 
amount of deferred tax recognised with respect to losses incurred in 
previous periods and was comfortable with the amounts recognised.
Impairment assessment 
As part of ongoing monitoring of impairment assessments, during the 
year the Committee has reviewed and examined key assumptions  
used by management for impairment testing, in particular the long-term 
average gold price used, and the factors relevant to this selection,  
such as the Company’s operating cash cost levels, the basis on which 
these assumptions were made, and related factors underpinning relevant 
mine planning, budgets and forecasts. Views and contributions of the 
external auditors as regards the impairment testing procedures and  
key assumptions used formed part of the Committee’s review of all 
impairment test calculations. Following these reviews, the Committee 
satisfied itself that key assumptions used to ascertain the carrying  
value of the Company’s cash generating units had been appropriately 
reviewed and challenged and were therefore sufficiently robust for use. 
The Committee also reviewed the disclosure contained in this Annual 
Report and, in particular, the disclosure contained in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements as regards impairment in order to 
satisfy itself of the accuracy and suitability of the disclosures so made.
Inventory level assessments
As part of ongoing cost control and inventory management reviews,  
the Committee has reviewed and scrutinised management’s inventory 
level maintenance processes, existing inventory carrying values and  
the approach taken to ascertain write-downs, particularly as regards 
inventory at Buzwagi. Management reported to the Committee on the 
procedures undertaken to determine and monitor inventory levels  
across the Group and overall supply chain procedures required to 
achieve optimal inventory levels. In addition, management reported  
to the Committee on all adjustments required to be made to inventory 
calculations, something which was further expanded through discussions 
with the external auditors as regards their analysis and consideration  
of these issues. Based on this process the Committee is satisfied that 
management’s valuation and presentation of the Company’s inventory  
and related costs are suitable in the circumstances.
Going concern review
In addition to the matters stated above, all of which are relevant  
to the Board’s assessment of Acacia’s position as a going concern,  
the statement relating to which is provided at page 41, the Committee 
also reviewed other matters relevant to Acacia’s liquidity, namely the 
ongoing availability of net cash balances, Acacia’s hedging strategy  
and policy, and the availability of funds under existing credit facilities. 
Management reported to the Committee on each of these matters  
and was questioned accordingly. In this regard, the Committee has  
also taken into account the views of the external auditors in order  
to satisfy itself of the position taken by the Board as regards to the 
appropriateness of the going concern assumption contained in this 
Annual Report.
Fair, balanced and understandable review
At the request of the Board, the Committee has also reviewed the 
narrative content of the Annual Report in order to make a recommendation 
that the report satisfies revised narrative reporting requirements in  
that the Annual Report, when taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.  
In this regard the Committee has taken advice from the Company’s legal 
function to satisfy itself of the relevant legal and regulatory framework 
underpinning this disclosure standard.
Internal and external audit reviews 
As regards internal audit, throughout the year the Committee received 
regular reports on matters under review by the internal audit function, 
and has reviewed such matters and raised questions with the Head  
of Risk and Internal Audit accordingly. We also reviewed the internal  
audit charter, mandate and performance in order to assess ongoing 
effectiveness, following which the Committee concluded that the internal 
audit function remains effective and performs in accordance with 
requirements of the business.
GOVERNANCE
60 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
CONTINUED As regards external audit, we have assessed the effectiveness of  
the external audit process via responses to surveys received from  
the Chief Financial Officer, members of the finance and treasury function, 
and in particular members of the Company’s financial reporting team  
and the Company secretariat. The survey comprised a range of factors 
including the following:
• Progress achieved against the agreed external audit plan
• Competence with which the external auditors handled key accounting 
and audit judgements and communication of the same between 
management, the Committee and the external audit team
• Compliance with relevant regulatory, ethical and professional 
guidance on rotation of lead audit partners
• Qualifications, expertise, resources and the external auditor’s  
own assessment of their quality control procedures
• The stability and continuity provided to the business as a result  
of the continued appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(“PwC”) as external auditors
Based on this assessment, the Committee concluded that the  
external auditors remain effective and we will be recommending the 
reappointment of the external auditors at the forthcoming AGM in  
light of this assessment. 
As regards external audit tender considerations, PwC have acted as 
external auditors for the Group since its listing on the London Stock 
Exchange in March 2010. In this regard, we note that the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) 
Order 2014, which requires mandatory tendering of audit services (at 
least every ten years) by FTSE 350 companies, came into effect on  
1 January 2015 and applies to financial reporting years as of this date.  
The Committee will review the requirements of this order in 2015 in order 
to ensure appropriate compliance with its requirements. 
As regards non-audit services provided by the external auditors,  
the Committee reviews the status of all non-audit services on a  
quarterly basis and is required to consider, and where appropriate 
provide prior approval for, the provision of all non-audit work by the 
external auditors to ensure that any such work can be conducted  
without adversely affecting auditor independence.
Generally, the auditors are precluded from engaging in non-audit  
services that would compromise their independence, objectivity or 
violate any professional requirements or regulations affecting their 
appointment as auditors. The auditors may, however, provide non-audit 
services which do not interfere with their independence, and where  
their skills and experience make them a logical supplier, subject to 
pre-approval by the Committee. For example, this may include the 
conduct of certain matters relating to taxation, given the materiality of 
taxation considerations to the financial assessment and external audit  
of the Company. The Company’s procedures require that any non-audit 
services proposed to be provided by the auditors be supported by  
a justification as to why the appointment of the external auditors to 
provide the services is in the Company’s best interests, and how auditor 
independence would be safeguarded in the specific context of the 
proposed services. In addition to this, senior members of the external 
audit team and the lead audit partner rotate periodically and at least 
every five years in line with PwC’s internal policies on independence. 
As a Company we also maintain a strict discipline on the recruitment  
of any former employees of the external auditors to ensure independence 
is not undermined in this regard. In line with this, during the year the 
Committee adopted a written policy regarding the recruitment of former 
employees of the external auditor to formalise practices that have been 
employed since the Company’s IPO. 
The policy prohibits the hiring of any former member of the external audit 
team into any financial oversight role or as an officer of the Company for 
a period of two years following their association with the audit, save in 
instances where the appointment has been pre-approved by the Committee. 
Between meetings, the Committee Chairman has delegated authority to 
deal with such appointments at his discretion. Any such interim approval 
must be ratified at the next meeting of the Committee. In addition,  
any employee of the external auditor who accepts employment with  
the Acacia Group whatever the role must cease all activity as regards  
the audit immediately and tender their resignation to the audit firm.

Key responsibilities
We play a leading role in reviewing the structure, size and composition  
of the Board and in reviewing prospective new Board appointments and 
succession planning requirements. We also have primary responsibility 
for making recommendations to the Board on the composition of Board 
Committees and we manage recommendations for the retirement and 
replacement of Directors. In addition, our remit of responsibilities 
includes delegated authority from the Board to oversee and review 
Acacia’s corporate governance policies and procedures, including 
independence reviews and the monitoring of Company procedures  
for the management of actual and/or potential conflicts of interest. 
Activities in 2014 and plans for 2015
Our activities during the year were wide ranging, and comprised the 
following in particular:
• Reviewing Committee composition based on succession planning, 
skill set and qualification requirements
• Reviewing our terms of reference and our remit of responsibilities  
in light of ongoing developments within the Company’s business  
and operating environment and developments within a corporate 
governance context
• Reviewing the Board’s structure, size and composition in the context 
of the Company’s strategic and business objectives 
• Monitoring and reviewing the Company’s procedures for Board 
appointments and the reappointment of Directors in accordance  
with the Board assessment and skills matrix
• Reviewing the Company’s core corporate governance policies in line 
with best practice developments and recent trend developments
The Committee also provided oversight and review of the Board and 
Board Committees’ annual performance and effectiveness evaluations, 
an overview of which is provided on page 58. In 2015, the Committee 
will continue to focus on the majority of the above matters, these being 
core to its remit of responsibilities. In addition to this, the Committee will 
oversee the execution of the Board and Board Committees’ first external 
performance assessment. 
As regards diversity, whilst the Company has not adopted a formal policy, 
we base all recruitment on the premise that we strive to attract a broad 
mix of individuals from both the traditional and non-traditional mining 
labour markets in order to create a diverse workgroup and maintain a 
unique company culture. Above all, we aim to hire all individuals on the 
basis of the best candidate for all positions, at all levels, including Board 
and senior management positions, irrespective of gender.
Save for appointments made by Barrick under nomination rights contained 
in the Relationship Agreement, Board appointments are made on the 
basis of pre-determined job descriptions which include, as regards 
independent Non-Executive Directors, estimates of time commitment 
requirements. From a recruitment and candidate search perspective,  
our existing Directors provide access to a wide network of potential 
Board appointment candidates, particularly within the extractive industry, 
as a result of their collective experience and standing within the extractive 
sector. In addition to this, we look to retain external search consultants 
to assist us in identifying potential candidates for Board positions,  
when appropriate to do so. We did not make any new appointments to  
the Board this year and, as such, no external recruitment consultants 
were retained during the year for Board recruitment purposes.

63 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT
Dear Shareholders,
Company performance in 2014 was strong overall and during the  
year we saw the achievement of a number of important Company goals. 
Key performance highlights included exceeding production guidance, 
delivering a reduction in AISC and cash costs during the year whilst 
progressing a number of wider business initiatives including the re-launch 
of our company as Acacia Mining; the approval of the Gokona Underground 
project; and our entry into West Africa through the execution of the 
exploration earn-in and joint venture arrangement for the South Houndé 
project in Burkina Faso.
As part of our ongoing review of compensation practices, during the  
year we decided to further align the interests of our executives with the 
longer-term interests of shareholders by adjusting the implementation  
of the approved policy, as follows:
Increased performance targets for short-term incentive (STI)
In order to promote the payment of bonuses for out-performance, we have 
toughened the performance requirements applicable to the vesting of  
STI awards. From 2014 onwards, performance in line with “budget” will 
typically deliver no more than 30% of target bonus (100% of target bonus 
in previous years). Further details as regards the performance assessment 
applicable to the 2014 STI is provided on page 75.
Enhanced assessment of LTIP award grants
In 2013, we changed the basis of assessment for the LTIP TSR 
performance condition to ensure that vesting of all Executive Director  
LTIP awards made from 2014 onwards is assessed on the basis of 
median TSR. In addition to this, during the year we adopted additional 
criteria to assess individual performance ratings at the time of grant  
in order to further align LTIP awards with performance expectations. 
All of the above amendments fall within the existing scope of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 
AGM. The policy report below is therefore as disclosed in the 2013 
Directors’ Remuneration Report save for a number of minor refinements 
in wording to clarify the operation of the policy. 
As regards 2014 key corporate governance developments affecting 
remuneration practices, for the time being the Committee has made  
the following decisions:
Michael Kenyon,
Compensation Committee Chairman
Bonus deferrals
We note the increasing focus of institutional investors on mandatory bonus 
deferrals as part of FTSE 250 compensation practices. In this regard, the 
Committee continues to monitor this practice in order to review options as 
appropriate for the Company to address corporate governance trends whilst 
safeguarding the flexibility required to determine year-on-year requirements 
for executive remuneration within the scope of the Company’s existing 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 
The use of malus and clawback provisions for LTIP and STI payments
We have noted the increased focus on malus and clawback provisions 
applying to awards under executive incentive schemes. In this regard,  
the Company’s existing compensation practices already provide for  
the clawback of Executive Director STI and LTIP awards in the event  
of individual misconduct or financial misstatement/misreporting. The 
Committee is currently considering the practical effectiveness that  
the adoption of malus provisions (in addition to the existing clawback 
provisions) would have in order to determine whether such provisions 
should be introduced over the longer term, as part of future policy revisions. 
Extension of performance and retention periods applicable to LTIP awards 
We have noted the increasing trend of extending LTIP performance 
periods beyond three years and/or introducing additional holding 
requirements for vested LTIP awards. The Committee does not believe it 
is appropriate to adopt these practices at this stage, given the enhanced 
performance requirements placed on the vesting of STIs and the grant  
of LTIs and specific considerations with regards to maintaining the 
Company’s “free-float” status, all of which must be taken into account 
when considering options available to us in the structuring of any 
retention period applicable to executive awards. 
The Committee will continue to monitor these and other compensation 
trends throughout 2015 in order to assess ongoing requirements for the 
Company’s compensation practices. In addition and in line with current 
best practice, given the level of shareholder approval received at  
the 2014 AGM for the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (approximately 
98.4% in favour of the policy), we will not be submitting the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy for approval at the forthcoming 2015 AGM.
CEO Salary increase for 2015
For 2015, the Committee has decided to increase the salary payable  
to the CEO to £475,000. This increase reflects both the CEO’s strong 
performance since his appointment and the fact that no increases  
were given last year. This new salary remains below market for the 
industry in which Acacia operates and equates to a 5.7% per annum 
increase since appointment. 
As required under the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, the remaining 
content of this Remuneration Report is divided into elements of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (pages 65 to 70), which are provided  
for continuing information purposes, and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration for 2014 (pages 71 to 81), which will be subject to  
an advisory shareholder vote at the 2015 AGM.
GOVERNANCE
64 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Summary table for Executive Directors’ remuneration policy
Fixed remuneration
Base salary Pension Benefits
Purpose To provide an appropriately competitive level of 
base salary with due regard to the size and nature 
of the responsibilities of each role, as well as  
an individual executive’s experience.
To help provide  
for an appropriate 
retirement benefit.
To provide benefits which are competitive in  
the market in which the individual is employed.
Operation Reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 
1 January and made at the discretion of the 
Compensation Committee.
Salaries are benchmarked against international 
gold mining, general mining and FTSE listed 
companies of similar size and complexity.
The Compensation Committee also takes into 
account corporate and individual performance 
and experience; general market conditions;  
and salary increases applied within the Company 
as a whole.
Executive Directors  
receive contributions  
into a personal pension  
scheme of their choice,  
or a cash supplement  
of commensurate value.
The Group does not 
operate any defined  
benefit schemes.
Executive Directors receive benefits, which  
usually include the provision of a company car  
or cash alternative, health and life insurance, 
liability insurance, fitness club membership  
and professional membership; however, the 
Compensation Committee retains discretion to 
approve any other form of benefit that it deems 
appropriate to award depending on individual 
circumstances. For example, relocation 
allowances and international transfer-related 
benefits are often provided for, when required,  
in line with general industry practices for the 
recruitment of international employees.
Opportunity To avoid setting expectations of Executive 
Directors and other employees, no maximum 
salary is set under the Remuneration Policy. It is 
not anticipated that salary increases for Executive 
Directors will exceed those of the wider workforce 
over the period during which this Remuneration 
Policy is effective. Where increases are awarded  
in excess of the wider employee population,  
the Committee will provide the rationale in the  
relevant year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Executive Directors  
receive contributions  
or an equivalent cash 
supplement equal to a 
percentage of gross base 
salary in line with market 
norms at the relevant  
point in time.
The value of benefits will generally be assessed  
on the basis of market norms at the relevant  
point in time.
The Compensation Committee retains the 
discretion to approve a higher total cost of 
benefits in exceptional circumstances  
(e.g. relocation) or in circumstances where  
factors outside the Company’s control have 
changed materially (e.g. increases in medical 
coverage inflation).
Performance measures Not applicable. Not applicable. Not applicable.
Short-Term Incentive (STI)
Purpose To reinforce the delivery of key short-term operational objectives on an annual basis in order to promote performance  
as regards business priorities for each financial year in the context of individual and Company performance.
Operation Performance measure weightings and targets are set at the start of the year and weighted to reflect business priorities.  
At the end of the year, the Compensation Committee determines the extent to which targets have been achieved, taking into 
account Company-wide performance and the individual performance of each Executive Director.
STI payments are delivered in cash; clawback provisions apply to any STI payment made to an Executive Director in the event  
of individual misconduct or financial misstatement/misreporting.
Opportunity The STI provides Executive Directors with an annual bonus opportunity in the range of 0% to 150% of base salary, with target  
bonus opportunity of up to 75% of base salary.
Performance  
measures
Bonus outcomes are assessed by the Compensation Committee on a scorecard assessment, based on the achievement  
of the targets set for each performance measure and the Committee’s broad assessment of Company performance.
Performance measures are based on challenging budget and stretch targets for Company-wide financial and operational  
performance and, where appropriate, individual performance. Performance measures may include financial, operational, growth, 
production, cost and capital expenditure control and sustainability metrics. Performance measures are selected annually to 
reflect key strategic initiatives and matters underpinning the key financial and non-financial performance indicators used to 
manage performance across the Acacia Group. Performance measures will be weighted appropriately each year according to  
the business plan. Weightings of performance measures may vary, typically up to 10% and 50%, with the range of performance 
required under each measure calibrated to reflect the Company’s annual published guidance range, particularly as regards 
production, cash costs and capital expenditure. For threshold performance, the STI is anticipated to be up to 75% of Executive 
Director base salary, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee.
Whilst performance measures, weightings and targets for any given year will not be disclosed on a prospective basis due to 
commercial sensitivities, the Compensation Committee aims to provide such details retrospectively as part of the Annual Report  
on Remuneration, unless ongoing commercial sensitivities discourage such disclosures.
Directors’ remuneration policy
PERFORMANCE REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
65 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
GOVERNANCE Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Purpose To reinforce an enterprise culture that promotes and protects shareholders’ long-term interests, so as to reward long-term 
decision making and performance that support the delivery of shareholder returns and drive shareholder value over the 
long term.
Operation Awards of conditional shares, options or restricted stock units (“RSUs”) may be granted annually, with the maximum value  
that may be awarded to each Executive Director defined as a percentage of base salary at the date of grant.
Vesting is based on Acacia’s corporate performance over a three-year period. There is no retest provision.
Clawback provisions are included in the LTIP for Executive Directors, whereby an award is subject to clawback for one year  
from the vesting date (or exercise date, if relevant) in the event of exceptional circumstances of individual misconduct or  
financial misstatement/misreporting.
Opportunity The LTIP permits a maximum award with a value equal to 200% of base salary at the time of grant to be made each year  
under normal circumstances. The Committee may exceed this limit in exceptional circumstances only. Such circumstances 
would include, for example, specific recruitment or retention scenarios. The exercise of this discretion would be assessed  
in each case on the circumstances in question.
The level of LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors each year is determined by the Committee, within the limits set out 
above, with reference to a range of factors including individual performance ratings. Maximum performance, which will be 
assessed as 35% outperformance of the median TSR over the three-year performance period going forward, can deliver  
vesting of up to 2x the value of the award granted, e.g. an award with a value of 150% of base salary at the time of grant  
would, if maximum performance were achieved, vest at a value equal to 300% at the time of vesting.
Additional RSUs are credited to reflect dividends paid on Acacia Ordinary Shares prior to the vesting date. Such RSUs are subject 
to the same vesting provisions as the underlying awards.
Performance measures Subject to continued employment and Acacia’s relative TSR performance over a three-year performance period when compared 
to the constituents of the Euromoney Global Gold Index, TSR performance must be at least equal to that of the TSR comparator 
group in order to receive any payment under LTIP awards, at which level 50% of the target award will vest. If no entitlement has 
been earned at the end of a three-year performance period, awards will lapse.
The Compensation Committee reviews the comparator group of international gold miners against which TSR performance is 
measured from time to time to ensure it remains appropriate. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine  
the treatment of comparators in the event of their delisting or otherwise in any event which, in the opinion of the Committee, 
compromises the suitability of a company as a comparator for Acacia. Additionally, the Committee may, at its discretion, reduce  
the number of awards vesting in the event that the achievement against the performance condition is not a genuine reflection  
of the underlying performance of the Company. More generally, the performance measures applied to LTIP awards are reviewed 
periodically to ensure they remain aligned with shareholder interests and, in this regard, the Committee retains discretion to 
employ performance measures other than TSR to the LTIP in order to allow for performance assessments to evolve over time.
Share Option Plan (SOP)
Purpose To reinforce an enterprise culture that promotes and protects shareholders’ long-term interests, so as to reward long-term 
decision making and performance that support the delivery of shareholder returns and drive shareholder value over the 
long term.
Operation Whilst the LTIP is expected to be used as the main long-term incentive for Executive Directors going forward, the Committee 
retains the ability to grant stock options under the SOP where appropriate, such as in recruitment or retention scenarios.
The Compensation Committee will set a vesting period for SOP awards appropriate to the circumstances at the time of grant. 
Historically, this has included vesting in equal parts over four years or vesting after three years. All awards expire seven years 
from the date of grant. There are no clawback provisions included under the SOP.
Opportunity The SOP permits a maximum share option award with a value equal to 200% of base salary at the time of grant to be  
made each year under normal circumstances. The Committee may exceed this limit in exceptional circumstances only.  
Such circumstances would include, for example, specific recruitment or retention scenarios. The exercise of this discretion  
would be assessed in each case on the circumstances in question.
In the event that a stock option award was used for annual incentive purposes, such awards would ordinarily be granted at a 
target level equal to 150% of base salary at the time of grant. In this regard, the Committee would look to use an appropriate 
valuation model, for example, the Black-Scholes model, for purposes of ascertaining the fair value of any award made.
Performance  
measures
The Compensation Committee determines the performance metrics applying to share option awards as appropriate to the 
circumstances at the time of grant, based on the purpose of making such award, i.e. whether for recruitment, retention or  
as a matter of annual performance incentive. Generally, in the event that the Committee were to grant an SOP award as an 
incentive, it would look to apply an appropriate performance condition.

Performance measures Not applicable.
market-wide developments that were generally unforeseeable or  
remote at the time of setting performance measures, but nonetheless 
occur during a performance period. It is for such reasons that the 
Compensation Committee retains a number of discretions for the 
operation of all incentive schemes (STI, LTIP and SOP) including,  
but not limited to, the ability to determine the following:
• Scheme participants
• The timing of grant and size of awards
• Appropriate treatment of vesting of awards in the context  
of restructurings and/or takeovers
• Appropriate adjustments to awards in the event of variations  
to the Company’s share capital
• Absent specific bad leaver scenarios, the ability to determine and 
designate leavers as good leavers in order to determine appropriate 
treatment of awards in exit scenarios
• Treatment, size and grant of awards in a recruitment context
• The application, scope, weighting and targets for applicable 
performance measures and performance conditions from time to 
time, including any amendments to existing performance measures/ 
conditions and related targets
Whilst it may not be possible to give an exhaustive list of Compensation 
Committee discretions, the exercise of discretions and the rationale 
underpinning their use, if any, will generally be provided in context, as part  
of the Annual Report on Remuneration. In this regard we can confirm that  
no discretions have been exercised during 2014.
Approach to recruitment of Executive Directors
When determining the remuneration package for a new Executive Director  
the Compensation Committee aims to offer a package that is sufficiently 
competitive, to attract, motivate and retain candidates of the calibre and 
experience required to run our business. This will generally be determined  
in each case not only in the context of the skills required for a position  
and those of each candidate, but will also be determined on the basis  
of recruitment trends within the global mining industry and any additional 
considerations relevant to the recruitment of executives in the FTSE,  
and other markets outside London. In addition, our approach to recruitment  
will also depend on whether we use external recruitment or internal 
promotion routes.
Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis
The chart below provides an estimate of the potential future reward 
opportunity for the Chief Executive Officer, and the potential split between 
the different elements of remuneration under three different performance 
scenarios: Minimum, On-target and Maximum.
Potential reward opportunities are based on the Remuneration Policy, applied 
to the latest base salary. The STI and LTIP are based on the level of maximum 
opportunities applied in 2015. Note that the LTIP awards granted in a year  
do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the 
projected value excludes the impact of share price movement.
The minimum scenario reflects base salary, pension and benefits (i.e. fixed 
remuneration) which are the only elements of the Chief Executive Officer’s 
remuneration package not linked to performance.
The on-target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target STI 
(75% of salary) and target vesting of the LTIP (200% of salary).
The maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus maximum payout 
under all incentives (150% of salary under the STI and full vesting of an LTIP 
award at maximum performance, which would be equal to 400% for an award 
granted at target of 200% of base salary).
Use of Compensation Committee discretions
Generally, it is not possible for any remuneration policy to pre-empt  
every possible scenario and for this reason the Compensation Committee 
has been provided with the ability to apply various discretions and 
judgements in order to ensure the achievement of fair outcomes and to 
maintain the flexibility required to balance the interests of individuals and 
those of the Company. For example, the Compensation Committee may 
be required to exercise discretion when determining whether or not the 
outcomes of performance measures and targets applicable to incentive 
plans are fair in context, or if realities encourage the use of upward or 
downward adjustments. By means of illustration, this may be the case  
as a result of the impact of wider socio-economic or political factors or 
PERFORMANCE REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT

GOVERNANCE External recruitment
In determining appropriate remuneration for an external candidate, the Compensation Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors 
(including quantum, the nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from) to ensure that arrangements are in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders. For such purposes, the Compensation Committee may make use of all of the existing components  
of the Remuneration Policy as follows:
Component Approach
Maximum annual  
grant value
Fixed  
remuneration
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, 
experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and their current basic salary. Where new 
appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased 
increases over a period of two to three years subject to their development in the role.
 
N/A
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions or an equivalent cash supplement, which is 
equivalent to that received by existing executives and in line with market norms.
 N/A
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may include (but are not limited to) the 
provision of a company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance and any necessary 
relocation expenses.
 N/A
Variable 
remuneration
STI The STI described in the Summary Table for Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy will apply to 
new appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment 
over the year. Targets for the individual element will be tailored towards the executive.
150% of salary
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other executives, as 
described in the Summary Table for Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
200% of salary*
SOP New appointees may be granted awards under the SOP, as described in the Summary Table for 
Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
200% of salary*
*  Based on target level; award can be higher in circumstances deemed by the Committee to be exceptional, i.e. where it is necessary to buy out incentive arrangements 
or make offers equivalent to sign-on bonuses.
The Compensation Committee may also make an award under the terms  
of one of the Company’s incentive plans outlined above in respect of a  
new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving  
a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant 
factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, 
the likelihood of those conditions being met and the term remaining to  
their vesting. In addition, where candidates are recruited from overseas, 
the Committee may be required to consider additional benefits received  
in the home jurisdiction or arrange for a form of substitution of such 
benefits in addition to the payment of suitable relocation allowances.  
The Compensation Committee may also consider it appropriate to grant an 
award under a structure not included in the Remuneration Policy, exercising 
the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.2 R where necessary. Such 
an award would include, for example, a sign-on payment. In connection with 
this, and as explained in assurances given at the time of publishing the 
2013 Annual Report, the Compensation Committee confirms that, following 
discussions with shareholder representatives, any arrangement specifically 
established to recruit an individual would take the form of performance-
related variable remuneration. On recruitment, the value of this remuneration 
would be capped at the limits contained in the LTIP and SOP or the value  
of awards which the individual had to surrender in order to be recruited, 
whichever is the greater. The policy that exists for current Executive 
Directors would then apply to the balance of the individual’s remuneration 
package. In addition, the Compensation Committee does not envisage  
that a cash payment such as a “golden hello” would be offered.
Internal promotion
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal 
promotion, the Committee will be consistent with the policy used for 
external appointees detailed above. Where an individual has contractual 
commitments made prior to his or her promotion to Executive Director 
level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements even in 
instances where they would not otherwise be consistent with the 
prevailing Remuneration Policy at the time of appointment.
Approach to Executive Director exit arrangements
Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early 
termination, are carefully considered by the Compensation Committee  
and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the quality 
required to manage the Company. The Committee considers appointments  
of an indefinite term and with a notice period of one year to be appropriate. 
The service contract used for the Company’s current CEO, being the sole 
Executive Director at present, provides for compensation of 12 months’ 
salary in the event of early termination. The Company has the discretion to 
pay such compensation in instalments, requiring the Executive Director to 
mitigate loss (i.e. by gaining new employment) over the relevant period, or in  
a lump sum. If notice to terminate is served by either the Executive Director 
or the Company, the Executive Director can continue to receive basic salary, 
benefits and pension for the duration of his/her notice period during which 
the Company may require the individual to continue to fulfil his/her current 
duties or may assign a period of garden leave, depending on the 
circumstances in question. The service contract used for any new hire  
would be based on similar terms. The CEO’s service contract is available  
for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Generally, in an exit scenario the Company will honour all contractual 
entitlements, this being a matter required by the operation of law, and for 
individuals who relocated from overseas, reasonable relocation costs will 
be considered as appropriate in the circumstances.
The treatment of incentive arrangements in exit scenarios are considered 
on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant contractual 
terms of the individual, the circumstances of the exit and any applicable 
duty to mitigate. Generally, the payment of incentives as part of exit 
arrangements is determined on the basis of good leaver/bad leaver

REMUNERATION REPORT  
CONTINUED and change of control scenarios. Summary termination, termination for 
gross misconduct or gross negligence or termination in circumstances which 
would justify summary termination are all examples of bad leaver scenarios. 
Good leavers include individuals who have left the Company as a result  
of retirement, injury, disability or death. In addition, the Compensation 
Committee retains the discretion to determine any leaver that is not a  
bad leaver as a good leaver. This discretion is viewed as necessary by the 
Company given the vast range of scenarios in which an individual may leave 
the Company where conduct is not at issue. The availability of this discretion 
is particularly relevant in exit scenarios in which an individual’s performance 
per se is not at issue. Whilst it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of 
such scenarios, examples would include circumstances in which the Board 
determines a need to change the Company’s strategic direction or focus,  
or is required to review Board and management composition generally, as a 
result of operational or market developments, or other developments in the 
business, such as entry into new markets or a restructuring of the business. 
In any event, when exercising such discretion the Compensation Committee 
would always recognise and take into account the balance of shareholder 
interests and those of the departing individual. 
The table above summarises how the variable incentives are typically 
treated in specific circumstances, subject to the exercise of the 
discretions described above. 
Executive Director external appointments
It is the Board’s policy to allow Executive Directors to accept non- executive 
directorships of other quoted companies for which they would normally be 
allowed to retain fees. Any such directorships must be formally approved 
by the Chairman of the Board. Currently, no such positions are held by the 
Company’s sole Executive Director.
Approach to Non-Executive Director remuneration
The Board aims to recruit Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre with 
broad commercial, international and other experience relevant to mining 
operations. Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination & Governance Committee. Their 
appointment is for an initial term of three years, subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders at each AGM in accordance with the 
requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Upon the 
recommendation of the Nomination & Governance Committee, they may  
be re-appointed for two additional terms of three years, subject to their 
continuing to satisfy requirements for continuing appointment and, again, 
subject to annual re-election by shareholders. The terms of engagement  
of the Non-Executive Directors are set out in a letter of appointment. 
These letters do not contain any provision for compensation for early 
termination of office. Requirements for notice periods are reviewed on a 
case by case basis. All letters of appointment for Non-Executive Directors 
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Non-Executive Director remuneration primarily focuses on the payment of 
fees. Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to participate in any of the 
incentive plans available to Executive Directors. However, Non-Executive 
Directors may participate in the Company’s DSU Plan. This plan provides 
Non-Executive Directors with the option to elect to waive some or all of their 
annual fees in return for a deferred right to a cash payment, payable only 
after a participant ceases to hold office with the Company. Broadly, cash 
payments under this plan are calculated by reference to the fair market  
value of the Company’s shares at the time of payment and remain subject  
to market fluctuations in the context of the Company’s share price until the 
time of payment. This plan was adopted by the Company in 2012 to address 
certain practices and trends of North American mining companies, which 
provide for similar elections to be made in order to ensure that our practices 
for Non-Executive Director compensation structures remain flexible and 
competitive against our global peers. Elections under the plan are made 
annually, usually in April of each year. In addition, to align Non-Executive 
Director interests with shareholders, the Company has adopted Non-Executive 
Director shareholding guidelines for its independent Non-Executive Directors, 
which require relevant individuals to acquire a minimum shareholding 
equivalent to their annual base fee within two years from election to the 
Board, which may be satisfied through the purchase of Acacia Ordinary 
Shares or by electing to waive base fees for DSUs. Details as regards current 
outstanding awards under the DSU Plan and Acacia Ordinary Shares currently 
held by Non-Executive Directors are provided on page 80.

all relevant facts and matters including performance, time elapsed since grant and the interests of Acacia’s 
shareholders. Alternatively, Acacia awards may be exchanged for new equivalent awards in the acquirer 
where appropriate.
Any Stock Options which remain unexercised six months from the vesting date will lapse.

GOVERNANCE Summary table for Non-Executive Director remuneration policy
Fees
Purpose To attract and retain candidates with the required skill and experience to form part of the Board and to ensure fees paid to the  
Non-Executive Directors are competitive and comparable with other companies of equivalent size and complexity operating within  
the global mining industry.
Operation The base fee for Non-Executive Directors is reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 April each year. Fees payable to the 
Chairman are determined by the Compensation Committee, while the base fee and any other fee payable to the other Non-Executive 
Directors are determined by the Board.
In addition to the base fee, additional fees are payable for acting as Senior Independent Director and as chair of any of the Board’s 
Committees (Audit, Compensation, EHS&S, Nomination & Governance) and for individual membership of such Committees.  
These additional fees are also reviewed annually, with any adjustment effective 1 April each year. In the event that the Board requires  
the formation of an additional Board Committee, fees for the chair and membership of such Committee will be determined by the Board  
at the time.
No base fee or fee for membership of Board Committees is payable to Non-Executive Directors appointed by Barrick pursuant to the 
nomination rights contained in the Relationship Agreement.
Non-Executive Director fee levels are benchmarked against international gold mining, general mining and FTSE listed companies of similar 
size and complexity. Time commitment, responsibility, and technical skills required to make a valuable contribution to an effective Board 
are taken into account when reviewing fee levels.
Opportunity Non-Executive Director fee increases are set in response to the outcome of the annual fee review. Fees for the year ending 31 December 
2014 are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. The maximum aggregate annual fee for all Directors provided in the Company’s 
Articles of Association is £3,000,000.
Performance 
measures
Not applicable.
Deferred Share Unit Plan (DSU Plan)
Purpose To ensure Acacia Non-Executive Director compensation structures remain flexible and competitive against global peers.
Operation Non-Executive Directors can elect to waive some or all of their annual fees in return for a deferred right to a cash payment under the  
DSU Plan. The value of additional DSUs is credited to reflect dividends paid on Acacia Ordinary Shares over the period of participation.
Cash payments become payable only after a participant ceases to hold office with the Company.
Opportunity Non-Executive Directors can waive up to 100% of their annual fee.
Performance 
measures
Cash payments are calculated by reference to the fair market value of Acacia’s Ordinary Shares at the time of payment and remain  
subject to market fluctuations in Acacia’s share price until payment.
Awards lapse in the event that an individual is summarily terminated for: (i) breach of contract; (ii) breach of Director’s duties;  
or (iii) misconduct, or if an individual resigns in circumstances justifying summary termination.
Approach to recruitment of Non-Executive Directors
In the case of hiring or appointing a new Non-Executive Director, the Board will utilise the Remuneration Policy summarised in the table entitled 
Summary Table for Non-Executive Director remuneration policy, above. A base fee which is aligned with the prevailing fee schedule would be payable  
for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting as Senior Independent Director or as Chair of any of the Board’s Committees and for 
individual membership of such Committees. Non-Executive Directors would also be eligible to waive some or all of their annual fees in return for a 
deferred right to a cash payment under the DSU Plan.
Approach to Non-Executive Director exit arrangements
As regards Non-Executive Director resignation, retirement or termination, base fee and any additional fees would be payable to the resignation/ 
retirement/termination date and treatment of any awards under the DSU Plan would be as follows:
DSU Plan
Event Timing of vesting Calculation of vesting/payment
Retirement, injury, disability, death On leaving office Save in the case of certain circumstances, * DSU awards vest in full on leaving  
office, whereby the relevant cash payment made in respect of awards is determined 
by reference to the fair market value of an Acacia Ordinary Share at the time 
of payment.
Change of control (not including 
internal reorganisations)
On leaving office
* Summary termination or termination for gross misconduct or termination in circumstances which would justify summary termination.

Chairman’s introduction to this report.
Advisers
Kepler Associates (“Kepler”) was appointed by the Compensation  
Committee in 2010 and retained during the year. The Compensation 
Committee evaluates the support provided by its advisers annually and  
is comfortable that the Kepler team provides independent remuneration 
advice to the Committee and does not have any connections with the 
Company that may impair its independence. Kepler is a founding member 
and signatory of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, details 
of which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com
 In 2014, Kepler provided independent advice on trends and developments, 
reporting regulations, the LTIP TSR performance condition, revisions to the 
Committee’s terms of reference and benchmarking data for selected senior 
executives. Kepler does not advise the Company on any issues outside 
compensation and governance thereof. Kepler’s total fees for the provision  
of remuneration services in 2014 were £72,199 on the basis of time and 
materials. The Committee also received legal advice from Travers Smith LLP 
as regards certain remuneration practices during the year and the legal 
aspects to the structure of the Remuneration Policy, the total fees for which  
equalled £10,682.

Executive Director salaries
The following table shows Executive Director salaries for 2013 and 2014 and those payable for 2015:
2015 salary 2014 salary 2013 salary
Brad Gordon £475,000 £425,000 £425,000
For 2015, the Committee has decided to increase the salary payable to the CEO to £475,000 to reflect continuing improved performance over 2014 
and the fact that no salary increases were given to the CEO or other members of the SLT in 2014. This new salary remains below the market average 
for the market in which Acacia operates and equates to a 5.7% per annum increase since his appointment. 
Non-Executive Director fees
For the year ending 31 December 2014, no fees were paid to Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, appointed by Barrick pursuant to its 
nomination rights under the Relationship Agreement. Fees paid to independent Non-Executive Directors were paid as follows:
Fee component Amount (per annum)
Base fee £75,000
Senior Independent Director fee £25,000
Chair of Audit Committee fee £20,000
Chair of Compensation Committee, EHS&S Committee,  
and Nomination & Governance Committee fee £15,000

74 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Executive Directors’ Short-Term Incentive awards
For the year ending 31 December 2014, Executive Director STI awards were earned on the basis of Company-wide performance, this being 
representative of the overall leadership, management and performance of an individual holding this position. During the year, we simplified the 
Company-wide performance measures to focus on the core metrics which we use to assess performance as regards safety, production, cost control 
and profit generation. These performance metrics were assessed on the basis of individual weightings and in line with a range of performance targets 
to provide for threshold, target and maximum performance, as outlined in the table below.

Notes to STI scorecard table: 
(i)  Please refer to page 20 of this Annual Report for an explanation of how TRIFR is measured and its relevance to safety performance. 
(ii)  Please refer to page 20 of this Annual Report for an explanation of how gold production is measured and its relevance to our productivity levels.  
For STI KPI purposes production from Bulyanhulu Upper East was discounted in order to reflect normalised adjustments made to the  
applicable free cash flow KPI (see (iii) below). 
(iii)  For STI KPI purposes, free cash flow is calculated as: (gold revenue, copper revenue, silver revenue) – (all costs including sustaining capital, corporate social 
responsibility costs, finance leases relating to operations and exploration) + dividends +/- working capital. For STI KPI purposes, free cash flow was normalised  
for the gold price and unbudgeted costs relating to Bulyanhulu Upper East and Lower West acceleration and the Gokona Underground project. 
(iv)  Please refer to page 20 of this Annual Report for an explanation of how AISC is measured and its relevance to cost control achievements across the business.  
For STI KPI purposes, AISC attributable to Bulyanhulu Upper East, Lower West and Gokona Underground was discounted in order to reflect normalised adjustments 
made to the applicable free cash flow KPI (see (iii) above). 
As noted in the Committee Chairman’s introduction to this report, throughout 2014 we saw increasing levels of Company performance and the achievement  
of a number of important Company goals. Key performance highlights include: annual production of 718,651 ounces, (adjusted to 714,545 ounces for STI KPI 
purposes), ahead of our original 2014 production guidance and a 13% improvement on 2013 production levels; AISC of US$1,105 per ounce sold (adjusted  
to US$1,078 per ounce sold for STI KPI purposes), 18% lower than 2013 AISC levels; and cash costs of US$732 per ounce sold, being 10% below 2013 cash 
cost levels. Together these cost and operational achievements allowed us to achieve positive cash flow levels, assessed as approximately US$86.4 million for 
STI KPI purposes. However, from a safety perspective TRIFR for 2014 was 0.86, a disappointing outcome. On this basis, the Company’s performance for the 
year was assessed as 71.3%, which has been reflected in STI award for the year paid to Brad Gordon (see page 72).
For 2015, the CEO’s STI opportunity will be 75% of base salary for target performance with a maximum opportunity of 150% for maximum performance. 
Broadly, performance measures for 2015 will continue to focus on production, costs, safety and profitability and will be assessed primarily on Company 
performance with an element of individual performance. Further details of 2015 performance measures, weightings and targets will be provided as 
part of the 2015 Annual Report on Remuneration.

As explained in the introduction to this report, in the event that maximum performance is achieved, the TSR performance condition operates so as to 
deliver up to two times the value of the initial award at the date of vesting. For all awards, additional RSUs are granted to reflect dividends paid on 
Acacia Ordinary Shares prior to the vesting date. 
The August 2013 awards made to Brad Gordon represent awards made as part of Brad’s recruitment package. This award is subject to the satisfaction of the 
TSR performance condition applicable at the time of making the award, this being the assessment of the Company’s TSR on a weighted mean basis against 
the comparator group. 
The comparator group for awards made to Brad Gordon in 2013 is as follows:  
Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. IAMGOLD Corp. 
AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. Kinross Gold Corporation 
Buenaventura Mining Company* New Gold Inc.

Centerra Gold Inc. Randgold Resources Ltd. 
Eldorado Gold Corp. Semafo Inc.
Gold Fields Ltd. Yamana Gold Inc. 
Harmony Gold Mining Co. Ltd.
* Translation into English.
 
For purposes of assessing performance against the 2013 comparator group, TSR will be assessed over the performance period on a weighted mean basis,  
as follows:
Acacia’s TSR % outperformance of comparator group weighted mean over three years % of target level of award
+20% 200%

As part of his recruitment package Brad Gordon received a stock option award equal to 841,308 Acacia Ordinary Shares on 21 August 2013, representing  
an award with a fair market value (at the time of grant) equal to one year of base salary (£425,000). The fair market value of the award was ascertained using  
the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation (31.5% of the market value of an Acacia Ordinary Share). The market price of Acacia Ordinary Shares at the time of  
this award was £1.60, assessed on the basis of the average of middle market quotations from the Daily Official List of the LSE for the day of grant and the 
following two dealing days. The award vests in equal parts over four years and expires seven years from the date of grant. Vesting is subject to the satisfaction 
of a TSR performance condition similar to that outlined above for the RSU award made to Mr Gordon in 2013. No SOP awards were granted in respect of 2014. 
The first tranche of Mr Gordon’s 2013 SOP award was tested for performance as at 20 August 2014. Over the relevant period, Acacia TSR of 101.3% 
exceeded the weighted mean of comparators by 109.4%, which resulted in 100% of this tranche vesting. Consequently, 210,327 options became 
exercisable to Mr Gordon on 20 August 2014.

Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration 
for SLT members. Given that the Company operates across a number of diverse economies with pay levels and structures reflecting local market 
conditions, the Compensation Committee believes that using the SLT as a subset for purposes of comparing CEO pay against wider employee pay 
provides a more meaningful comparison than using pay data for all employees.
The CEO’s remuneration includes base salary, taxable benefit and STI payments and for 2014 includes the sum of payments made to Brad Gordon.  
SLT data is based on a consistent set of employees, i.e. the same individuals appear in the 2013 and 2014 populations.

REMUNERATION REPORT  
CONTINUED Executive Director exit arrangements (audited)
As noted in the 2013 Annual Remuneration Report, due to a number of commercial sensitivities, the Board took the decision to place Greg Hawkins  
on garden leave following his departure from the Company in August 2013, in accordance with the flexibilities provided to address exit arrangements 
under Executive Director service contracts. As such Greg’s official termination date was 20 August 2014. During this period Greg continued to receive  
a monthly salary and the benefits afforded under his service contract as regards permanent health insurance, life assurance and the use of a company 
car/payment of a car allowance. The exit arrangements also provided for the following: 
• The determination of outstanding LTIP awards on a good leaver basis to allow for vesting in accordance with existing vesting schedules, subject  
to satisfaction of applicable performance conditions at the end of each performance period
• Relocation arrangements, up to a maximum amount of £100,000, given his status as an international employee and country of origin and the 
payment of certain legal fees in relation to the execution of exit arrangements
• The cancellation of all outstanding stock options. 
As a result, during the year Mr Hawkins received the following payments: an amount equal to £312,218 in aggregate in terms of salary during  
his period of garden leave, an amount equal to £152,881 in respect of taxable benefits and an amount equal to £78,054 in respect of pension.  
He also received £76,250 in respect of relocation. 
In addition, Mr Hawkins’ outstanding LTIP awards continue to subsist, subject to being pro-rated to reflect time of employment during the relevant 
performance periods. Vesting is assessed against the TSR performance condition in place at the time the awards were granted. The applicable TSR 
performance condition provides for the assessment of the Company’s TSR performance on a weighted mean average against a comparator group of 
international gold mining companies. The comparator group and basis of assessment under the structure of this performance condition is as follows:
Comparators*
Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. IAMGOLD Corp. 
AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. Kinross Gold Corporation 
Buenaventura Mining Company Petropavlovsk PLC
Centamin plc Polyus Gold International Limited 
Centerra Gold Inc. Randgold Resources Ltd. 
Eldorado Gold Corp. Semafo Inc.
Gold Fields Ltd. Yamana Gold Inc.
Harmony Gold Mining Co. Ltd. Zijin Gold Mining Group Co. Ltd.
*  For the February 2013 RSU award the comparator group also includes New Gold Inc., and excludes Zijin Gold Mining Group Co. Ltd and Polyus Gold 
International Limited.
Acacia’s TSR % outperformance of comparator group weighted mean over three years* % of interests transferred
+20% 200%
0% 100%
-12.5% 50%
Below -12.5% 0%
* Where performance is between the above levels, the percentage of RSUs to be transferred is determined on a proportionate basis.
The RSU award granted to Greg Hawkins in November 2011 vested in respect of 2014. Over the relevant three-year performance period, the Company’s 
TSR was 54.6%, which was 12.8% above the weighted mean of the applicable comparator group. As a result, 164% of the original interests awarded 
were due to vest based on performance, further details of which are provided below:

GOVERNANCE Directors’ interests in Acacia Ordinary Shares and shareholding requirements (audited)
Executive Directors are required to acquire a minimum holding in Acacia Ordinary Shares equivalent to two times base salary over a period of five years. 
For these purposes, LTIP awards are taken into account but stock options awards made under the SOP are not taken into account when assessing 
whether or not shareholding requirements have been satisfied. Independent Non-Executive Directors are required to acquire a minimum holding 
equivalent to their annual base fee within two years of election to the Board, which may be satisfied via the acquisition of Acacia Ordinary Shares or  
by electing to waive base fees for DSUs under the Acacia DSU Plan. The table below shows the shareholding of each Director against their respective 
shareholding requirement as at 31 December 2014 along with the form of their interests in Acacia Ordinary Shares.

Notes:
(a) RSUs and stock option awards vest subject to a relative TSR performance condition.
(b)  The Company’s DSU Plan for Non-Executive Directors provides Non-Executive Directors with the option to elect to waive some or all of their annual fees in return for a 
deferred right to a cash payment, payable only after a participant ceases to hold office with the Company. Broadly, cash payments under this plan are calculated by 
reference to the fair market value of Acacia’s Ordinary Shares at the time of payment and remain subject to market fluctuations in the context of Acacia’s share price 
until the time of payment.
(c) Based on Acacia’s share price at the time of acquiring shares and/or electing to receive DSUs and/or receiving RSU awards.
(d) Consists of options awarded on recruitment which vest subject to a relative TSR performance condition.
David Hodgson held interests in 13,000 shares prior to his departure in April 2014 and also held interests in DSUs which vested subsequent to his 
departure. Rick McCreary did not have any interests in the Company’s shares during his tenure as a Director. 
Subsequent to year end, Brad Gordon’s interests in RSUs were increased to reflect the 2014 LTIP award, taking his aggregate unvested RSUs to 
1,110,308 RSUs. Details of this award are provided on page 77 of this report. There have been no other changes in Directors’ shareholdings between 
31 December 2014 and 9 March 2015. As regards Ambassador Mwapachu’s shareholding, dividend reinvestment applicable to DSU interests during 
H1 2015 will operate so as to ensure the applicable shareholding guideline requirements are satisfied shortly following the publication of this report. 
Mr Lucas and Ms English have a further ten months to satisfy applicable shareholding guideline requirements.

Strategic Risks 
Single country risk
All of Acacia’s revenue is derived from production at its three operations in  
Tanzania. In order to ensure continued growth, the Group needs to identify new  
resources and development opportunities through exploration and acquisition targets.  
This is particularly the case in the context of the identification of potential growth  
opportunities in other territories, something which is required to strengthen the  
business through geographic diversification in order to mitigate the effects that  
significant in-country developments could have on our operations and business.
Chief Financial Officer/ 
Vice President, Exploration.
Acacia assesses a wide range of potential growth opportunities 
to build on its existing portfolio, particularly acquisition and 
development opportunities outside Tanzania to maximise  
growth potential and to help mitigate the effects that significant 
developments in Tanzania could have on our business.
• Continuing evaluation  
of corporate development  
opportunities across Africa. 
• Entry into West Africa through 
Earn-In Arrangement for South 
Houndé Project in Burkina Faso.
High Please  
see our 
Exploration 
review.
Financial Risks
Significant changes to commodity prices 
Acacia’s financial performance is highly dependent on the price of gold and, to a  
lesser extent, the price of copper and silver. Fluctuations in the pricing of these  
commodities, which are largely attributable to factors beyond Acacia’s control,  
will likely have a corresponding impact on Acacia’s financial condition, particularly  
in the context of rapid pricing fluctuations.
Chief Financial Officer. Acacia’s strategic objective is to provide maximum exposure  
to the price of gold and, as such, a no-gold-hedging policy  
has been adopted. Acacia has entered into hedging 
arrangements for certain commodity exposures (copper,  
silver and diesel) to attempt to mitigate the impact of  
pricing fluctuations for such commodities. We also monitor  
our exposure to commodity price fluctuations as part  
of financial and treasury planning and controls procedures.
• Ongoing review of commodity  
price fluctuations as part of  
financial management controls.
High
 
Please see  
our Financial 
review.
External Risks
Political, legal and regulatory developments
Acacia’s exploration, development and operational activities are subject to extensive laws  
and regulations governing various matters in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Acacia’s 
ability to conduct its business is dependent on stable and consistent interpretation and 
application of laws and regulations applicable to mining activities and its operations, 
particularly in Tanzania. Changes to existing applicable laws and regulations, a more  
stringent application or interpretation of applicable law and regulation, or inconsistencies  
and irregularities in the interpretation of applicable law and regulation by relevant Government 
authorities could adversely affect the progression of Acacia’s operations and development 
projects. Acacia’s operations and financial condition will also be adversely affected if existing 
Mineral Development Agreements are not honoured by the Tanzanian Government. The Group  
may also be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, and political  
and/or economic instability in Tanzania or any of its surrounding countries.
Vice President, Corporate Affairs. Acacia management assesses legal and political risks  
as part of its evaluation of potential projects. It actively  
monitors legal and political developments in countries in  
which its existing operations are located. Acacia management 
actively engages in dialogue with Governments and legal policy 
makers in regions in which it is present to discuss all key legal 
and regulatory developments applicable to its operations. 
• Continuing enhancement of 
Governmental and regulatory 
engagement and dialogue.
High Please see  
the Strategic 
report.
Occupational health and life-threatening diseases
Due to the nature of the Group’s operations, a wide range of occupational health diseases, 
such as noise-induced hearing loss and lung diseases, pose a risk to the Group’s workforce. 
In addition, tropical and infectious diseases, such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, pose significant 
health risks to the Group’s employees, due to the epidemic proportions that such diseases 
may have in areas at which the Group’s operations are located. Further, there is a risk that the 
Ebola epidemic may expand and impact Group operations. The potential liabilities related to 
such diseases and the impact that these diseases may have on the Group’s workforce may 
have an adverse effect upon the Group’s operations and financial condition.
Executive General Manager,  
Organisational Effectiveness.
The Group has implemented a number of malaria and 
tuberculosis programmes and HIV/AIDS awareness and 
prevention programmes for its employees, their families  
and the local communities surrounding its operations. It also 
provides occupational health services to its employees at its 
mine clinics and it continues to improve preventative hygiene 
initiatives. Health and safety and risk management systems  
are in place onsite at all of Acacia’s operations.
• Continuing implementation  
of preventative occupational health 
& safety programmes.
• Preparation of an Ebola Action Plan.

and trades principally through its subsidiaries and subsidiary undertakings in 
various jurisdictions. Further information as regards Acacia’s subsidiaries is 
provided in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 106.
Strategic report
The requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as regards the production  
of a strategic report are satisfied in the Strategic report contained at pages

Directors’ indemnity and insurance
In accordance with Acacia’s Articles of Association and to the extent 
permitted by the Companies Act 2006, Acacia may indemnify its Directors 
out of its own funds to cover liabilities incurred as a result of their office.  
The relevant provision contained in the Articles can be categorised as a 
“qualifying third-party indemnity provision” under the Companies Act 2006. 
Acacia has adopted Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance, which 
provides insurance cover for any claim brought against Directors or officers 
for wrongful acts in connection with their positions. The insurance provided 
does not extend to claims arising from fraud or dishonesty and it does not 
provide cover for civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed by law.
Global GHG emissions data for period 1 January 2014  
to 31 December 2014
According to the GHG Protocol developed by the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute, GHG emissions 
are classified as either direct or indirect, and from there are divided further 
into Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. Direct GHG emissions are 
emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the reporting entity. 
Indirect GHG emissions are emissions that are a consequence of the activities 
of the reporting entity but that occur at sources owned or controlled by 
another entity. Each scope is classified as follows:
• Scope 1 emissions: direct emissions from sources owned or operated 
by our Company.
• Scope 2 emissions: indirect emissions attributable to our Company 
due to its consumption of purchased electricity, notably our 
consumption of electricity from TANESCO.
• Scope 3 emissions: all other indirect emissions associated with 
activities that support or supply our Company’s operations.
For 2014, in light of practicalities, we have calculated Acacia’s Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions footprint on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions 
only and will look to measure and report on other greenhouse gases in 
future reporting years. Going forward, we will also look at opportunities  
to monitor and calculate Scope 3 emissions.

Total 371,508 369,319 0% 100% 100%
Total CO
2
 emissions for 2014 amounted to 371,508 tonnes, in line  
with 2013. The reduction in Scope 1 emissions was offset by an increased 
proportion of grid power in Tanzania being generated from fossil fuels.  
In addition, the Company monitors its GHG emissions ratio on the basis  
of CO
2
 produced per tonne of ore milled. For 2014 this equated to 0.0451 
per tonne of ore milled, this being a marginal decrease on 2013 (0.0462).

of US4.2 cents for 2014. Subject to the shareholders approving this 
recommendation at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 29 May 2015 
to shareholders on the register at 8 May 2015. The ex-dividend date is 7 May 
2015. Acacia will declare the final dividend in US dollars. Unless a shareholder 
has elected or elects to receive dividends in US dollars, dividends will be paid 
in pounds sterling with the US dollar amount being converted into pounds 
sterling at exchange rates prevailing on or around 11 May 2015. Currency 
elections must be made by return of currency election forms. The deadline  
for the return of currency election forms is 11 May 2015.
Share capital
As at 31 December 2014, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 
410,085,499 Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each. The voting rights of all 
Acacia Ordinary Shares are identical, with each share carrying the right to 
one vote. The Company holds no Ordinary Shares in Treasury and does not 
have any class of share other than its Ordinary Shares. Further details on 
voting rights and rights relating to the transfer of shares are provided below.
Acacia’s Articles of Association provide the authority for the Company to 
purchase its own shares (including any redeemable preference shares), 
provided that it complies with any applicable requirements contained in the 
Companies Act 2006, the CREST regulations or any other applicable law.  
As part of resolutions passed at the 2014 AGM, the Company obtained 
shareholder approval to make market purchases of up to 41,008,550 of its 
Ordinary Shares, equivalent to 10%, of the issued share capital at the time  
of approval. The authority was granted subject to stated upper and lower 
limits in accordance with Listing Rule requirements and expires at the 
forthcoming AGM. The authority was not exercised during the year under 
review. An equivalent shareholder resolution will be sought as a matter of 
ordinary business at the forthcoming AGM. Details of Acacia’s issued share 
capital and any movements during the year are included in Note 24 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 132.

As regards Barrick’s shareholding, on 10 March 2014, Barrick announced its 
divestment of approximately 41.0 million Acacia Ordinary Shares by way of  
a placement to institutional investors (the “Placing”). The placement was 
conducted by way of an accelerated bookbuild offering process launched on 
10 March, which completed on 11 March 2014. The Placing was conducted 
at a price of 275 pence per Ordinary Share. UBS Limited, J.P . Morgan 
Securities plc (which conducts its UK investment banking business under  
the name J.P . Morgan Cazenove) and RBC Europe Limited acted as joint 
bookrunners and placing agents in relation to the Placing. As part of terms 
applicable to the Placing, Barrick undertook not to dispose of any further 
Acacia Ordinary Shares without the consent of the joint bookrunners for  
a period of 120 days, provided that such consent would not be required:  
(i) in the event of an offer for the entire issued share capital of Acacia made  
in accordance with the requirements of the City Code on Takeovers and 
Mergers; or (ii) with respect to a single sale of 10–20% of Barrick’s remaining 
shareholding in Acacia to a single corporate or strategic purchaser as part  
of a single transaction, provided that such purchaser agrees to be bound by 
an equivalent restriction for the remainder of the lock-up period. This lock-up 
period has now expired. The table above reflects Barrick’s shareholding post 
completion of the Placing accordingly. 
As at 1 March 2015, Blackrock Investment Management had increased  
their holding to 20,815,784 shares representing 5.08% of the issued share 
capital. All other major shareholders remain unchanged from 31 December 
2014. As a result, the percentage of issued share capital held by major 
shareholders as at 1 March 2015 equalled 74.12% in aggregate.

Material agreements containing change of control 
provisions/significant agreements with Directors/
Controlling Shareholders 
The Directors consider the following as material agreements/arrangements 
for Acacia’s business and operations, which alter or terminate on a change  
of control of Acacia and/or significant agreements with Directors/Barrick:
• Relationship Agreement: see page 56 of this report for an overview 
of the Relationship Agreement. In addition to the Relationship 
Agreement, Acacia entered into a Services Agreement with Barrick  
in February 2010 as part of arrangements for the IPO, under which 
Barrick provides certain services to the Acacia Group for the ongoing 
operation of the business. These services include support for 
information technology, technical services and other administrative 
and corporate functions. The agreement’s termination events include 
a basis for either party to terminate the agreement with immediate 
effect in the event of specified breaches of the agreement, 
insolvency, analogous events or a change of control. Whilst this 
agreement remains in force, limited services are provided under it 
and no services provided are deemed to be material or significant. 
• Credit Agreement: an overview of the Credit Agreement between, 
among others, the Company and Citibank International plc as 
administrative agent, is provided in Note 30 to the consolidated 
financial statements on page 137. A change of control is a mandatory 
prepayment event under the Credit Agreement and, subject to certain 
exceptions, a termination event.
Acacia’s mining concessions are held by its operating companies in  
Tanzania. Under applicable law, a change of control of the operating 
companies requires the consent of the Minister of Energy and Minerals  
in Tanzania. In addition, each Acacia Group operating mine has a Mineral 
Development Agreement (“MDA”) with the Tanzanian Government.  
The material terms and conditions of each MDA are substantially similar  
and include provisions governing royalty payments, taxes and other charges, 
banking arrangements, local procurement obligations, and import rights.  
The MDAs also provide for no expropriation or nationalisation rights.  
Broadly, these rights provide that the Tanzanian Government will not 
nationalise or compulsorily acquire the whole or any part of Acacia’s  
interest in the applicable special mining licences or any of its property  
or its contractors’ or subcontractors’ property used for the purpose of  
mining operations or in relation to the applicable special mining licences, 
without adequate compensation. Each MDA is governed by Tanzanian  
law. Adherence to the terms and conditions of the MDAs is of significant 
importance to Acacia’s business, given the agreements’ overall  
importance to our operations.
Certain employment contracts for members of the Company’s Senior 
Leadership Team, excluding the current CEO, contain change of control 
provisions, which provide entitlements to severance payments in the event  
of being dismissed without cause or resigning for good reason in the  
12 months following a change of control. Any payment made under these 
arrangements would replace the entitlement to receive payment under 
applicable contractual notice periods in each case. Special provisions also 
allow the early exercise of awards made under the Company’s Stock Option 
Plan (“SOP”) and early vesting of awards made under the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (“LTIP”), in the event of a takeover, reconstruction or winding up. In such 
circumstances, the Compensation Committee determines whether and to 
what extent options or awards become exercisable, by taking into account all 
relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, satisfaction of 
any applicable performance condition. When determining the vesting of LTIP 
awards or options, the Compensation Committee may proportionately reduce 
the award depending on the time which has elapsed between the first day  
of the performance period and the date of change of control. Alternatively, 
awards may be exchanged for new equivalent awards where appropriate.

GOVERNANCE

OTHER INFORMATION  
CONTINUED Shareholder rights
The rights and obligations attaching to the Ordinary Shares contained in the 
Articles of Association are as follows:
Voting rights
Subject to any special rights or voting restrictions contained in the Articles of 
Association for any class of share, at any general meeting every member who 
is present in person or by proxy shall, on a show of hands, have one vote and 
every member present in person or by proxy shall, on a poll, have one vote  
for each share of which he or she is the holder. A resolution put to a vote  
of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands, unless a poll is duly 
demanded. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, a poll may 
be demanded by the Chairman; by at least five members who have the right 
to vote at the meeting; by a member or members representing not less than 
one-tenth of the total voting rights of all the members having the right to vote 
at the meeting; or by a member or members holding shares conferring a right 
to vote at the meeting, being shares on which an aggregate sum has been 
paid up equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the  
shares conferring that right. Unless the Directors otherwise determine,  
a shareholder is not entitled to vote at a shareholders’ meeting, either in 
person or by proxy, or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in 
relation to a shareholders’ meeting, unless and until all calls or other sums 
presently payable by him or her in respect of that share with interest and 
expenses (if any) have been paid to the Company or if (s)he or any other 
person appearing to be interested in shares has been issued with a notice 
pursuant to Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 (requiring disclosure of 
interest in shares) and has failed to provide the required information within 
14 days from the service of the notice.
Dividend rights
The Board may declare and pay dividends on any class of shares carrying  
a fixed dividend expressed to be payable on fixed dates and may from time  
to time pay interim dividends as it thinks fit. Final dividends shall be  
declared by ordinary shareholder resolution, in accordance with Board 
recommendations. No dividend declared by shareholders shall exceed the 
amount recommended by the Board. Provided that the Board acts in good 
faith, it shall not incur any liability to shareholders for any loss that they may 
suffer by the lawful payment of any fixed or interim dividend on any shares 
ranking after or pari passu with those shares. Except as otherwise provided 
by the rights attached to shares, all dividends shall be apportioned and paid 
proportionately to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or 
portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid, but if any share 
is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular 
date, it shall rank for dividend accordingly. No amount paid up on a share in 
advance of the date on which a call is payable shall be treated as paid up  
on the share.
Payment of any dividend declared may be satisfied wholly or partly by  
the distribution of specific assets, and in particular of paid up shares  
or debentures of the Company, with shareholder approval. The Directors may 
retain any dividend or other money payable on or in respect of a share on 
which the Company has a lien and may apply the same towards satisfaction 
of the monies payable to the Company in respect of that share.
Unless the Directors otherwise determine, the payment of any dividend or 
other money that would otherwise be payable in respect of shares will be 
withheld, and the Company shall have no obligation to pay interest on it, 
 if such shares represent at least 0.25% of the nominal value of the issued 
share capital of their class and the holder, or any other person appearing 
to be interested in those shares, has been issued with a Section 793 notice 
and has failed to supply the information required by such notice within 14 days. 
Furthermore, such a holder shall not be entitled to elect to receive shares 
instead of a dividend. The payment by the Board of any unclaimed dividend  
or other monies on or in respect of a share into a separate account shall not 
constitute Acacia a trustee in respect thereof. All dividends unclaimed for  
a period of 12 years after having been declared or become due for payment 
shall be forfeited and shall revert to Acacia.
Transfer of shares
Subject to any applicable restrictions, each member may transfer all or any  
of his or her shares, which are in certificated form, by instrument of transfer 
in writing in any usual form or in any other form acceptable to the Board  
and may be under hand only. Such instrument shall be executed by or on 
behalf of the transferor and (in the case of a transfer of a share which is  
not fully paid up) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor shall be 
deemed to remain the holder of such share until the name of the  
transferee is entered in the register in respect of it.
All transfers of shares which are in uncertificated form shall, unless the 
CREST regulations otherwise provide, be effected on a relevant system.
The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without giving any 
reason, refuse to register any transfer of a share in certificated form  
(or renunciation of a renounceable letter of allotment) unless:
(i) it is in respect of a share which is fully paid up;
(ii) it is in respect of only one class of shares;
(iii) it is in favour of not more than four joint transferees;
(iv) it is lodged duly stamped (if so required) at the transfer office;
(v) it is accompanied by the relevant certificate for the shares to which  
it relates and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably 
require to prove the title of the transferor and the due execution of  
the transfer or, if the transfer is executed by some other person on  
his behalf, the authority of that person to do so; and
(vi) in the case of partly paid shares listed on the London Stock Exchange, 
such refusal would prevent dealings in such shares from taking place 
on an open and proper basis.
Unless the Board otherwise determines, a transfer of shares will not  
be registered if the transferor or any other person appearing to be interested 
in the transferor’s shares has been issued with Section 793 shares in 
respect of shares representing at least 0.25% of their class and the relevant 
information has not been supplied within 14 days. This restriction on transfer 
will not automatically apply if the member is not personally in default as 
regards supplying the information required and the proposed transfer is  
only part of the member’s holding, provided that certain requirements  
are satisfied at the time of presenting the transfer for registration.

GOVERNANCE Division of assets on a winding up
If the Company is wound up the liquidator may, with the sanction of  
a shareholder special resolution, divide the whole or any part of the 
Company’s assets between shareholders. In such circumstances the 
liquidator may value any assets and determine how the division shall  
be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of 
shareholder. Subject to certain requirements, the liquidator may also  
vest any part of the assets in trustees on such trusts for the benefit of  
the shareholders, but no shareholder shall be compelled to accept any 
assets on which there is a liability.
Variation of rights
If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into shares of 
different classes, rights attached to a class may only be varied in such 
manner (if any) as may be provided by prescribed rights or, in the absence  
of any such provision, either with the consent in writing of the holders of not 
less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the class  
or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general 
meeting of the holders of shares of the class duly convened and held.
Powers of Directors
Managing the business
Acacia’s business is managed by the Board, and the Articles of Association 
permit the Board to exercise all of the Company’s powers in this regard. 
These powers may be exercised by any meeting of the Board at which a 
quorum of two Directors is present. The power of the Board to manage the 
business is subject to any limitations imposed by the Companies Act, the 
Articles of Association or any directions given by special resolution of the 
shareholders applicable at a relevant time. The Articles contain an express 
authority for the appointment of Executive Directors and provide the Directors 
with the authority to delegate or confer upon such Directors any of the 
powers exercisable by them upon such terms and conditions and with such 
restrictions as they see fit. The Articles contain additional authorities to 
delegate powers and discretions to Board committees and subcommittees.
Borrowing powers
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the CREST  
regulations and any other applicable law, the Directors may exercise  
all the powers of the Company to borrow money, guarantee, indemnify, 
mortgage or charge its undertaking, property (present and future) and 
uncalled capital or any part or parts thereof and issue debentures and other 
securities, whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability  
or obligation of Acacia or of any third party up to a maximum amount of  
two times the aggregate of the Group’s adjusted total equity, calculated  
in accordance with the procedure contained in the Articles of Association. 
Borrowings in excess of this amount require prior shareholder approval.
New issues of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the CREST 
regulations and every other enactment for the time being in force relating 
to the Directors’ authority to allot shares and/or the disapplication of 
pre-emption rights and to any resolution of the Company in general 
meeting regarding the same, the Directors may allot (with or without 
conferring a right of renunciation), grant options over or otherwise  
dispose of them to such persons, at such times and on such terms  
as they think proper. 
Acacia’s shareholders passed the following resolutions relating to the 
allotment and pre-emption right disapplications at the 2014 AGM: 
(i)   The Directors were granted authority to allot new shares (or grant 
rights to subscribe for or convert securities into shares) up to a 
nominal value of £13,532,821, equivalent to approximately 33%  
of the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company, exclusive  
of treasury shares, at the time of passing the resolution. In addition  
to this, the Directors were also granted authority to allot additional 
new shares (or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security  
into shares) up to a further nominal amount of £13,532,821,  
but only in connection with a rights issue.
(ii)   Pre-emption rights were disapplied over new shares allotted for  
cash pursuant to the authority granted at (i) above, but only: (a) in 
connection with a pre-emptive offer or rights issue; or (b) otherwise  
up to a nominal value of £2,050,427 (equivalent to approximately  
5% of the Company’s total issued Ordinary Share capital at the time  
of passing the resolution).
These authorities have not been exercised during the reporting period and will 
expire on the date of the forthcoming AGM. Equivalent resolutions for a renewal 
of these authorities will be put to the shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Shareholders may appoint any person who is willing to act as a Director  
by ordinary resolution and may remove any Director by ordinary resolution. 
The Board may appoint any person to fill any vacancy or as an additional 
Director, provided that they are submitted for re-election by the shareholders 
at the AGM following their appointment. Specific conditions apply to the 
vacation of office, including cases where a Director becomes prohibited  
by law or regulation from holding office, or is persistently absent from 
Directors’ meetings, or if three-quarters of appointed Directors request  
his or her resignation or in the case of mental incapacity or bankruptcy.  
Barrick’s rights to appoint Directors are summarised on page 56. Additional 
information regarding director re-election requirements is provided on page 54 
as part of the corporate governance report.

OTHER INFORMATION  
CONTINUED Under applicable UK law, the Directors are responsible  
for preparing the Annual Report, the consolidated financial 
statements and parent company financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
Responsibility for financial statements
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 
prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit  
or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
• Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES  
STATEMENT Mineral reserves and mineral resources estimates contained in this  
Annual Report have been calculated as at 31 December 2014 in accordance 
with National Instrument 43-101 as required by Canadian securities 
regulatory authorities, unless otherwise stated. Canadian Institute of  
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (“CIM”) definitions were followed for 
mineral reserves and resources. Calculations have been reviewed, verified 
(including estimation methodology, sampling, analytical and test data) and 
compiled by Acacia personnel under the supervision of Acacia Qualified 
Persons: Nic Schoeman, General Manager Technical Services, Haydn 
Hadlow, Chief Mineral Resources Manager, and Samuel Eshun, Technical 
Service Manager. However, the figures stated are estimates and no 
assurances can be given that the indicated quantities of metal will be 
produced. In addition, totals stated may not add up due to rounding.
Mineral reserves have been calculated using an assumed long-term average 
gold price of US$1,300 per ounce, a silver price of US$20.00 per ounce 
and a copper price of US$3.00 per pound. 
Reserve calculations incorporate current and/or expected mine plans  
and cost levels at each property and reflect contained ounces.
Mineral resources have been calculated using an assumed long-term average 
gold price of US$1,500 per ounce, a silver price of US$20.00 per ounce and 
a copper price of US$3.00 per pound and reflect contained ounces. 
Resources have been estimated using varying cut-off grades, depending 
on the type of mine or project, its maturity and ore types at each property. 
Reserve estimates are dynamic and are influenced by changing economic 
conditions, technical issues, environmental regulations and any other 
relevant new information and therefore these can vary from year to year. 
Resource estimates can also change and tend to be influenced mostly  
by new information pertaining to the understanding of the deposit and 
secondly the conversion to ore reserves. In addition, estimates of inferred 
mineral resources may not form the basis of an economic analysis and it 
cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will 
ever be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, investors are cautioned 
not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, 
that it can be economically or legally mined, or that it will ever be upgraded  
to a higher category. Likewise, investors are cautioned not to assume  
that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever 
be upgraded to mineral reserves. 
Definitions 
A Mineral Resource
A concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or 
on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there 
are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, 
quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics  
of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific 
geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. Material of 
economic interest refers to diamonds, natural solid inorganic material,  
or natural solid fossilised organic material including base and precious 
metals, coal, and industrial minerals. Mineral Resources are sub-divided, 
in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and 
Measured categories. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level  
of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource.  
An Indicated Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than  
an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a lower level of confidence than  
a Measured Mineral Resource.
An Inferred Mineral Resource 
The part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality  
are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling 
gathered through appropriate sampling techniques from locations such  
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. Geological evidence 
is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality 
continuity. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence 
than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be 
converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the 
majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated 
Mineral Resources with continued exploration. 
An Indicated Mineral Resource
The part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with 
sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in 
sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately 
detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient  
to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points  
of observation. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of 
confidence than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource  
and may only be converted to a Probable Mineral Reserve. 
A Measured Mineral Resource 
The part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence 
sufficient to allow the application of Modifying Factors to support detailed 
mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 
Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, 
sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade  
or quality continuity between points of observation. A Measured Mineral 
Resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to either an 
Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral Resource. It may be 
converted to a Proven Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve.
A Mineral Reserve
The economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral 
Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which 
may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by 
studies at Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include 
application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the 
time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. Mineral 
Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable 
Mineral Reserves and Proven Mineral Reserves. A Probable Mineral 
Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a Proven Mineral Reserve.
Modifying Factors
These are considerations used to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral 
Reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, 
metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors.
A Probable Mineral Reserve
The economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the 
Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Mineral Reserve is lower than 
that applying to a Proven Mineral Reserve. Probable Mineral Reserve 
estimates must be demonstrated to be economic, at the time of 
reporting, by at least a Pre-Feasibility Study.
A Proven Mineral Reserve
The economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. A Proven 
Mineral Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying 
Factors. Proven Mineral Reserve estimates must be demonstrated to be 
economic, at the time of reporting, by at least a Pre-Feasibility Study.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
96 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion, Acacia Mining plc’s group financial statements  
(the “financial statements”):
• 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as  
at 31 December 2014 and of its profit and cash flows for the  
year then ended;
• 
have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the  
European Union; and
• 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
Acacia Mining plc’s financial statements comprise:
• 
the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2014;
• 
the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• 
the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• 
the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and
• 
the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary  
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the 
Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), rather than in the 
notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from  
the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union.
Our audit approach – Overview
Materiality
Overall group materiality: $8.45 million which 
represents approximately 5% of profit before tax 
adjusted for items included within “Other Charges” 
(as presented on the face of the Consolidated 
Income Statement and detailed within note 10).
Scope
We identified three mine sites located in Tanzania 
which, in our view, required an audit of their 
complete financial information. In addition we 
conducted other audit procedures in London, 
South Africa and Tanzania. Taken together, the 
territories and functions where we performed our 
audit work accounted for 100% of revenue and 
approximately 93% of profit before tax.
Areas of focus
Impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible 
assets and property, plant & equipment;
Taxation including provisions for uncertain 
deferred tax positions and the recoverability  
of indirect taxes; and
The recoverability of the consumables balances  
at the Buzwagi site.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the  
risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for 
example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk  
of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified 
as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we 
tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an 
opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible assets 
and property plant and equipment
Acacia Mining has goodwill of $127.9 million, indefinite-lived intangible 
assets of $83.3 million and property, plant & equipment of $1,425.3 
million* as at 31 December 2014. Impairment charges to goodwill, 
indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant & equipment have 
been recognised in prior periods. 
For the Bulyanhulu mine, which contains goodwill ($121.5 million)  
and property, plant and equipment ($1,042.3 million), and Exploration 
assets, which contains goodwill ($6.4 million), indefinite-lived intangible 
asset ($83.3 million) and property, plant and equipment ($2.7 million) 
the determination of recoverable amount, being the higher of value-in-
use and fair value less costs to dispose, requires judgement on the part 
of management in both identifying and then valuing the relevant Cash 
Generating Units . Recoverable amounts are based on management’s 
views of variables such as future commodity prices, timing and approval 
of future capital and operating expenditure and the most appropriate 
discount rate. 
Management must also determine the recoverable amount for  
other assets including property, plant & equipment when impairment 
indicators are identified. As at 31 December 2014, North Mara  
and Buzwagi have $361.2 million of property, plant & equipment.
As well as considering indicators of impairment, for assets other  
than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets management must 
determine whether any indicators of reversal of previous impairments 
are apparent. In particular, management assessed whether previously 
recorded impairments against property, plant & equipment should be 
reversed in light of changes in mine plans, and improved profitability. 
*  includes $19.1 million of Corporate Office property, plant and equipment,  
not considered to be within the scope of this area of focus.
We evaluated management’s future cash flow forecasts, and the process by 
which they were drawn up, including verifying the mathematical accuracy of 
the cash flow models and agreeing future capital and operating expenditure to 
the latest Board approved budgets and the latest approved Life of Mine plans.
For each significant mine site, we used our specialist valuation knowledge  
to evaluate the appropriateness of key market related assumptions in 
management’s valuation models, including both short term and long term 
gold prices, and discount rates. We assessed the reasonability of 
management’s future capital and operating expenses in light of their 
historical accuracy and the current operational results.
We also performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions within 
the cash flow forecasts using a range of higher discount rates and lower 
long term gold prices based on what, in our view, a market participant  
may apply. Having ascertained the impact of the changes in assumptions, 
we considered the likelihood of such movement in those key assumptions 
arising and the overall impact on the recoverability of the assets and 
goodwill. Our analysis illustrated that using more conservative assumptions 
did not result in impairment and that the disclosures covered the significant 
areas of judgement. 
In considering potential impairment reversals we focussed on North Mara, 
and considered whether continued progress with the Group’s planned 
underground development was at a sufficiently advanced stage to support  
a sustainable reversal of the prior year impairment, however determined 
that a reversal is not required.
Deferred and indirect taxes
The Group has material deferred tax balances which include prior year 
tax loss assessments that continue to be in dispute with the Tanzanian 
Revenue Authority. 
In addition, the Group has recorded significant indirect tax receivables,  
of which a material amount has not been refunded in a timely manner.
We read correspondence between management and the Tanzanian Revenue 
Authority and assessed management’s position in relation to the specific 
matters disputed. Refer to note 34 for tax related contingencies disclosed.
In relation to deferred tax, we also assessed the availability of estimated 
future taxable income to utilise recognised carry forward losses and the 
reversal of temporary deferred tax differences by comparing the estimates 
to the to the latest Board approved budgets and the latest approved Life  
of Mine plans.
We also determined; based on payments received to date, a reduction in  
the level of receivable, and the existence of a memorandum of settlement 
for the long term element of the receivable, that the indirect tax receivable 
was recoverable, and appropriately classified between current or non-current. 
We examined the Annual Report disclosures to ensure the risk associated 
with recovery was evident. 
Consumables (Inventory) balances at Buzwagi site
We focused on this area because of the risk of existence of the large 
quantity of consumables on hand at Buzwagi ($99 million), in addition  
to the short remaining life of mine that could have an adverse impact  
on the valuation of the consumables. 
We attended two independent inventory sample counts performed by 
local management during the course of the year including one at year  
end. During these counts we observed the Group’s process and procedures 
and performed independent test counts by selecting a sample of items  
from both the accounting records and from the inventory on hand.
We tested management’s assessment of inventory net realisable value 
through substantive testing of the provision in place for slow moving and 
obsolete inventory and compared this to the forecast usage over the 
remaining life of mine. Based on the forecast usage we found that sufficient 
provision exists. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
98 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough 
work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting 
processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group’s assets and operations are primarily located at three mine 
sites in Tanzania. Financial reporting processes related to the activities 
of these mine sites are undertaken at shared business centres (“SBCs”) 
located in Dar es Salaam and Johannesburg.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be performed at each of the three  
mine sites and the SBCs by us, as the Group engagement team and  
by component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under  
our instruction. We requested that full scope audits were performed at 
Acacia Exploration and each of the three main mine sites which includes 
the relevant SBC. Where the work was performed by component auditors, 
we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit 
work at those sites/SBCs to be able to conclude whether sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion 
on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Involvement of our Group engagement team included site visits at the 
three mines, conference calls with our Tanzanian audit team, review of 
the Tanzanian auditor work papers, attendance at local audit clearance 
meetings, and other forms of communication as considered necessary 
depending on the significance of the accounting and audit issues arising.
Materiality
The scope of our audit is influenced by our application of materiality.  
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of  
our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and 
to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group 
materiality
$8.45 million (2013: $11 million).
How we  
determined it
Approximately 5% of profit before tax adjusted 
for items included within “Other Charges”  
(as presented on the face of the Consolidated 
Income Statement and detailed within note 10).
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
We considered an adjusted measure to be  
the most relevant in assessing the underlying 
financial performance of the Group as this 
provides us with a consistent year on-year  
basis for determining materiality. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above $1 million (2013:  
$1 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our  
view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement, set out on page 41, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that 
it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going 
concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that  
the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the 
Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the 
financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded 
that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AND THE AUDIT
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement  
set out on page 91, the Directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 
16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not,  
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures  
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
• 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and 
• 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements,  
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in  
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements  
of Acacia Mining plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 and on the

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
106 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies  
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
a) Basis of preparation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (“IFRS”), International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations and those parts  
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under  
the historical cost convention basis, as modified by the revaluation of 
financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) 
at fair value through profit or loss.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States 
dollars (US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand US 
dollars except when otherwise indicated.
Where a change in the presentational format between the prior year and 
current year financial statements has been made during the period, 
comparative figures have been restated accordingly. No presentational 
changes were made in the current year.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the 
use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management  
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity,  
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
financial statements are disclosed in Note 2d.
b) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following new standards and amendments to standards are 
applicable and were adopted by the Group for the first time for the 
financial year beginning 1 January 2014.
• 
Amendment to IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’,  
on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. This amendment 
clarifies that the right of set-off must not be contingent on a future 
event. It must also be legally enforceable for all counterparties in  
the normal course of business, as well as in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy. The amendment also considers settlement 
mechanisms. The amendment did not have a significant effect on the 
Group financial statements.
• 
Amendments to IAS 36, ‘Impairment of assets’, on the recoverable 
amount disclosures for non-financial assets. This amendment 
removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs 
which had been included in IAS 36 by the issue of IFRS 13.
• 
Amendment to IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and 
measurement’, on the novation of derivatives and the continuation  
of hedge accounting. This amendment considers legislative changes 
to ‘over-the-counter’ derivatives and the establishment of central 
counterparties. Under IAS 39 novation of derivatives to central 
counterparties would result in discontinuance of hedge accounting. 
The amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting 
when novation of a hedging instrument meets specified criteria.  
The Group has applied the amendment and there has been no 
significant impact on the Group financial statements as a result.
• 
IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’, sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy 
if that liability is within the scope of IAS 37 , ‘Provisions’. The interpretation 
addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy  
and when a liability should be recognised. The Group is not currently 
subjected to significant levies so the impact on the Group is not material.
• 
IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’, builds on existing 
principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining 
factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated 
financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides 
additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where 
this is difficult to assess. The amendment did not have a significant 
effect on the assessment of control.
• 
IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’, focuses on rights and obligations  
of the parties to the arrangement rather than its legal form. 
Proportional consolidation of joint arrangements is no longer 
permitted. The amendment did not have a significant effect on  
the Group financial statements.
• 
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’, includes the 
disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities 
including joint arrangements, associates, structured entities and 
other off-balance sheet vehicles. The amendment did not have  
a significant effect on the Group financial statements.
c)  New and amended standards and interpretations  
not yet adopted 
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have 
been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2015:
• 
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014.  
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification  
and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but 
simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three 
primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised  
cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L. The basis  
of classification depends on the entity’s business model and  
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. 
Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at  
fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception 
to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now 
a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss 
impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no 
changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition 
of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for 
liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9  
relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the 
bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic 
relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and  
for the “hedged ratio” to be the same as the one management actually 
use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation 
is still required but is different to that currently prepared under  
IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted subject to 
EU endorsement. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact.
• 
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, deals with 
revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, 
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising 
from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised 
when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has 
the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good  
or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 
‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and 
earlier application is permitted. The standard is not expected to have 
a significant impact on the Group.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
d)  Significant judgements in applying accounting policies 
and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Many of the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 
require management to make judgements and/or estimates. These 
judgements and estimates are continuously evaluated and are based  
on management’s experience and best knowledge of the relevant facts 
and circumstances, but actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the consolidated financial statements. The life of mine  
plans are central to a number of key estimates. Information about  
such judgements and estimations is included in the accounting policies  
and/or notes to the consolidated financial statements, and the key  
areas are summarised below. Areas of judgement and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty that have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements include:
• 
Estimates of the quantities of proven and probable gold reserves – 
Note 2h)
• 
The capitalisation of production stripping costs – Note 2i)
• 
The capitalisation of exploration and evaluation expenditures  
– Notes 2l) and 9
• 
Review of goodwill, property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets’ carrying value, the determination of whether these assets  
are impaired and the measurement of impairment charges or 
reversals – Notes 2o), 2p), 2q), 2r), 20 and 21
• 
The estimated fair values of cash generating units for impairment 
tests, including estimates of future costs to produce proven and 
probable reserves, future commodity prices, foreign exchange rates 
and discount rates – Notes 2r) and 21
• 
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and the 
measurement of depreciation expense – Notes 2o) and 20
• 
Property, plant and equipment held under finance leases – Notes 2o) 
and 20
• 
Recognition of a provision for environmental rehabilitation and the 
estimation of the rehabilitation costs and timing of expenditure  
– Notes 2u) and 28
• 
Whether to recognise a liability for loss contingencies and the amount 
of any such provision – Notes 2u), 28 and 34
• 
Whether to recognise a provision for accounts receivable, a provision 
for obsolescence on consumables inventory and the impact of 
discounting the non-current element of the indirect tax receivable  
– Notes 2n), 2y), 2w), 17, 18 and 23
• 
Recognition of deferred income tax assets, amounts recorded for 
uncertain tax positions, the measurement of income tax expense and 
indirect taxes – Notes 2y), 13 and 22
• 
Determination of the cost incurred in the productive process of ore 
stockpiles, gold in process, gold doré/bullion and concentrate, as well 
as the associated net realisable value and the split between the 
long-term and short-term portions – Notes 2n) and 17
• 
Determination of fair value of derivative instruments – Notes 2w) and 31
• 
Determination of fair value of share options and cash-settled 
share-based payments – Notes 2v) and 25
e) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial position 
as at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, and operating results 
and cash flows for the years then ended. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the 
Company and companies controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries).
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has the control, 
directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies in 
order to obtain benefits from their activities. Control is presumed to  
exist where the Company has more than one half of the voting rights 
unless it can be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute 
control. Control does not exist where other parties hold veto rights  
over significant operating and financial decisions. In assessing control, 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible as well 
as other contractual arrangements that enable the Company to exercise 
control are taken into account. The consolidated financial statements 
include all of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows 
of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating intercompany 
transactions as noted above.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary 
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements  
from the date on which control passed to the Group, and have been 
excluded from the date on which control transferred out of the Group. 
For partly-owned subsidiaries, the net assets and net earnings attributable 
to non-controlling interests are presented as “Equity attributable  
to non-controlling interests” in the consolidated balance sheet and  
“Net profit attributable to non-controlling interests” in the consolidated 
income statement, respectively.
f) Business combinations
On acquiring a business, the acquisition method of accounting is used, 
whereby the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable net 
assets on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition. Provisional 
fair values allocated at a reporting date are finalised within 12 months  
of the acquisition date. Acquisition costs are expensed.
When purchase consideration is contingent on future events, the initial 
cost of the acquisition recorded includes an estimate of the fair value  
of the contingent amounts expected to be payable in the future.  
The cost of the acquisition is adjusted when revised estimates are made, 
with corresponding adjustments made to goodwill.
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair values of the identifiable 
net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill, which is 
reviewed for impairment annually or when there is an indication of 
impairment. If the fair value attributable to the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets exceeds the cost of acquisition, the difference  
is recognised in the income statement.
g) Foreign currency translation
The Group’s transactions are denominated in a number of different 
currencies (primarily US dollars, Tanzanian shillings (“shillings”), South 
African rands (“rands”), UK pounds sterling (“pounds”) and Australian 
dollars. The Group has liabilities that are primarily denominated in US 
dollars. The US dollar is the Company’s (and its main subsidiaries’) 
functional currency, as well as the Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar are translated  
at the exchange rates as at the date of transaction. Monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the US dollar are 
translated to US dollars at year-end exchange rates. All differences  
that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary assets 
measured at historical cost in a currency other than US dollars are 
translated using the exchange rates at the date of the initial transactions.
Where non-monetary assets are measured at fair value in a currency 
other than US dollars they are translated into US dollars using the 
exchange rates on the date when the fair value was determined.

Australian dollar (US$: AUD) 1.12 1.03
UK pound (US$: GBP) 0.60 0.64
h) Determination of ore reserves
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based  
on information compiled by Qualified Persons as defined in accordance  
with the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 43-101 
“Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects” requirements. Reports to 
support these estimates are prepared each year. Proven and probable 
(“2P”) reserves, and for certain mines other mineral resources, 
determined in this way are used in the calculation of depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment charges, the assessment of life of mine 
stripping ratios and for forecasting the timing of the payments related  
to the environmental rehabilitation provision.
In assessing the life of a mine for accounting purposes, mineral 
resources are only taken into account where there is a high degree  
of confidence of economic extraction.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, 
and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change 
significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the 
forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or 
recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may, 
ultimately, result in the reserves being revised.
i) Stripping costs
In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden  
and other waste materials to access ore from which minerals can be 
extracted economically. The process of mining overburden and waste 
materials is referred to as stripping. Stripping costs incurred in order  
to provide initial access to the ore body (referred to as pre-production 
stripping) are capitalised as mine development costs.
Stripping costs incurred during the production stage of a pit are 
accounted for as the costs of the inventory produced during the period 
that the stripping costs were incurred, unless these costs provide a 
future economic benefit to an identifiable component of the ore body. 
Production phase stripping costs generate a future economic benefit 
when the related stripping activity: (i) improves access to a component  
of the ore body to be mined in the future, (ii) increases the fair value  
of the mine (or pit) as access to future mineral reserves becomes less 
costly; (iii) increases the productive capacity or extends the productive 
life of the mine (or pit). For production phase stripping costs that 
generate a future economic benefit, the current period stripping costs 
are capitalised as open pit mine development costs.
Capitalised open pit mine development costs are depreciated on a units  
of production basis whereby the denominator is the estimated ounces  
of gold in proven and probable reserves and the portion of resources 
considered probable of economic extraction based on the current life  
of mine plan in the components of the ore body that have been made 
more accessible through the stripping activity. Capitalised open pit mine 
development costs are depreciated once the open pit has entered 
production and the future economic benefit is being derived.
j) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence exists that all of the 
following criteria are met:
• 
the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have 
been transferred to the buyer;
• 
neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually 
associated with ownership, nor effective control over the goods sold 
has been retained;
• 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• 
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale will 
flow to the Group; and
• 
the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the sale can be 
measured reliably.
Gold doré sales
Gold doré is unrefined gold bullion bars usually consisting of 90%  
gold that is refined to pure gold bullion prior to sale to our customers. 
Revenue from gold doré sales is recognised at the time of sale  
to a third party. The sales price is based on the gold spot price  
at the time of sale.
Concentrate sales
Concentrate is a processing product containing the valuable ore mineral 
gold, copper and silver from which most of the waste mineral has been 
eliminated, that undergoes a smelting process to convert it into gold 
bullion, copper and silver concentrate. Under the terms of concentrate 
sales contracts with independent smelting companies, gold, copper and 
silver in concentrate is sold at trailing monthly average spot prices based 
on contract quotational periods.
Revenue is recorded at the shipped on board date, which is also when 
risks and rewards pass to the smelting companies, using market prices 
on the expected date that final sales prices will be fixed. Variations 
between the price recorded at the shipment date and the actual final 
price set under the smelting contracts are caused by changes in market 
prices, and result in an embedded derivative in accounts receivable.  
The embedded derivative is recorded at fair value each period until final 
settlement occurs, with changes in fair value classified as provisional 
price adjustments and included as a component of revenue. Co-product 
revenues from the sale of other products, such as copper and silver, 
contained in the concentrate are recognised in revenue.
Co-products
Revenue from the sale of co-products, such as copper and silver, 
contained in concentrates are recognised in revenue.

k) Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of direct mining costs (which include personnel 
costs, general and administrative costs, energy costs (principally diesel 
fuel and electricity), maintenance and repair costs, operating supplies, 
external services, third-party smelting, refining and transport fees),  
and depreciation related to sales as well as production taxes and royalty 
expenses for the period. Cost of sales is based on average costing for 
contained or recoverable ounces sold as well as production taxes and 
royalty expense for the period. All costs are net of any impairment to 
reduce inventory to its net realisable value.
l) Exploration and evaluation
Exploration expenditures
Exploration expenditures relate to the initial search for mineral  
deposits with economic potential as well as expenditures incurred for  
the purposes of obtaining more information about existing mineral 
deposits. Exploration expenditures typically comprise costs that are 
directly attributable to:
• 
researching and analysing existing exploration data;
• 
conducting geological studies;
• 
exploratory drilling and sampling for the purposes of obtaining core 
samples and the related metallurgical assay of these cores; and
• 
drilling to determine the volume and grade of deposits in an area 
known to contain mineral resources or for the purposes of converting 
mineral resources into proven and probable reserves.
Exploration expenditures incurred at greenfield sites (sites where  
the Group does not have any mineral deposits that are already being 
mined or developed) are typically expensed as incurred, unless it can  
be demonstrated that the related evaluation expenditures will generate  
a future economic benefit. Exploration expenditures incurred at 
brownfield sites (sites that are adjacent to a mineral deposit that is 
classified within proven and probable reserves and are already being 
mined or developed) are capitalised if the following criteria are met:
• 
the drilling is being done in an inferred or measured and indicated 
resource; and
• 
there is an existing proven and probable reserve that is contiguous  
or adjacent to where the drilling is being done; and
• 
it is probable that the resource will be converted to a proven and 
probable reserve.
The assessment of probability is based on the following factors: results 
from previous drill programmes; results from a geological study; results 
from a mine scoping study confirming economic viability of the resource; 
and preliminary estimates of the volume and grade of the deposit,  
and the net cash flows expected to be generated from its development. 
Costs incurred at brownfield sites that meet the above criteria are 
capitalised as a component of property, plant and equipment (“mine 
development costs”) pursuant to IAS 16, ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’. 
All other drilling and related exploration costs incurred at these sites are 
expensed as mine site exploration. Exploration expenditures incurred for 
the purposes of determining additional information on a mineral deposit  
that is classified within proven and probable reserves or for the purposes 
of extending an existing mineral deposit that is classified within proven 
and probable reserves and is already being mined or developed are also 
capitalised as mine development costs.
Evaluation expenditures
Evaluation expenditures arise from a detailed assessment of deposits  
or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential 
in order to determine their technical feasibility and commercial viability. 
They typically include costs directly attributable to:
• 
detailed engineering studies;
• 
examination and testing of extraction methods and metallurgical/
treatment processes;
• 
surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements;
• 
permitting activities; and
• 
detailed economic evaluations to determine whether development  
of the reserves is commercially justified, including the preparation  
of scoping, pre-feasibility and final feasibility studies.
Evaluation expenditures incurred at greenfield and brownfield sites are 
expensed as incurred, unless it can be demonstrated that the related 
evaluation expenditures will generate a future economic benefit.
Evaluation expenditures incurred at operating mines/development 
projects are capitalised as a component of property, plant and 
equipment, “Mining properties and development costs”, respectively.
Acquired exploration and evaluation properties
Exploration and evaluation stage properties acquired either as an 
acquisition of individual assets or as part of a business combination are 
capitalised as an intangible asset, “Acquired exploration and evaluation 
properties”. Exploration and evaluation stage properties represent 
interests in properties that do not have mineralised material classified 
within proven and probable reserves. The value of such properties  
is primarily driven by the nature and amount of mineralised material 
contained in such properties, including value attributable to the rights  
to explore or develop: i) a property containing mineralised material 
classified as a measured, indicated or inferred resource; or ii) a 
prospective greenfield property with significant exploration potential. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures incurred on such properties 
subsequent to their acquisition are expensed as incurred until the 
technical and commercial viability of developing the property has been 
demonstrated under the same criteria described above for exploration 
and evaluation expenditures.
m) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net profit for the period 
attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary Shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings 
per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if additional 
Ordinary Shares are assumed to be issued under securities that entitle 
their holders to obtain Ordinary Shares in the future. For share options, 
the number of additional shares for inclusion in diluted earnings per 
share calculations is determined using the treasury share method.  
Under this method, share options, whose exercise price is less than  
the average market price of our Ordinary Shares, are assumed to be 
exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase Ordinary Shares  
at the average market price for the period. The incremental number  
of Ordinary Shares issued under share options and repurchased from 
proceeds is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
110 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 n) Inventories
Material extracted from the Group’s mines is classified as either ore  
or waste. Ore represents material that, at the time of extraction,  
is expected to be processed into a saleable form and sold at a profit. 
Waste represents material that is required to be removed to access ore 
bodies. Ore is recorded as an asset that is classified within inventory  
as material is extracted from the open pit or underground mine. Ore is 
accumulated in stockpiles that are subsequently processed into gold in  
a saleable form under a mine plan that takes into consideration optimal 
scheduling of production of our reserves, present plant capacity, and the 
market price of gold and copper. Work in process inventory represents 
gold, copper and silver in the processing circuit that has not completed 
the production process, and is not yet in a saleable form. Finished goods 
inventory represents gold in saleable form that has not yet been shipped. 
Mine operating supplies represent commodities and other raw materials 
consumed in the production process, as well as spare parts and other 
maintenance supplies that are not classified as capital items. Inventories 
are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with cost being 
determined on a weighted average cost basis. Average costs are 
calculated by reference to the cost of inventory at the beginning of the 
period together with the cost of inventory produced in a period.
Gold, copper and silver ore contained in stockpiles is measured by 
estimating the number of tonnes added and removed from the stockpile, 
and the associated estimate of gold contained therein (based on assay 
data) and applying estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on  
the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified  
by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated to ore stockpiles based on 
quantities of material stockpiled using current mining costs incurred  
up to the point of stockpiling the ore and include: direct labour costs; 
materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the 
extraction of ore, including an allocation of stripping costs attributable  
to current period production; an allocation of mine site overhead costs; 
and depreciation of mining properties and property, plant and equipment 
used in the extraction of ore, reduced by an allocation of capitalised 
stripping costs. As ore is processed, costs are removed based on 
recoverable quantities of gold and the stockpile’s average cost per unit. 
Ore that is not expected to be processed in the 12 months following  
the balance sheet date is classified as non-current.
Costs capitalised in process and finished goods inventory include: the 
cost of stockpiles processed; the cost of commodities and raw materials 
consumed in the production process; direct labour; repair and maintenance 
costs; energy costs; depreciation of property, plant and equipment used 
in the production process; and an allocation of mine site overhead costs. 
Costs are removed from finished goods inventory and recorded in cost  
of sales based on the average cost per ounce of gold, copper and silver 
sold in the period.
Cost of mine operating supplies is the purchase cost, including allocated 
freight costs where applicable.
Provisions are recorded to reduce ore stockpiles, work in process and 
finished goods inventory to net realisable value where the net realisable 
value of the inventory is lower than its cost at each balance sheet date. 
Net realisable value is determined with reference to relevant market 
prices less applicable variable selling expenses. Provisions recorded 
also reflect an estimate of the remaining costs of completion to bring the 
inventory into its saleable form. Provisions are recorded to reduce mine 
operating supplies to net realisable value, which is generally calculated 
by reference to its salvage or scrap value, when it is determined that the 
supplies are slow moving and/or obsolete. Provisions are reversed to 
reflect subsequent recoveries in net realisable value where the inventory 
is still on hand at the balance sheet date.
o) Property, plant and equipment
Mineral properties and mine development costs
Mineral properties and mine development costs are stated at cost,  
less accumulated depreciation and applicable accumulated impairment 
losses. The acquisition cost of a mineral property is the estimated fair 
value of proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and 
inferred resources acquired as a result of a business combination  
or asset acquisition. Capitalised mine development costs include: 
pre-production stripping costs; production stripping costs that result  
in a future economic benefit (refer to Note 2i) for capitalisation criteria  
for stripping costs); costs incurred to access reserves at underground 
mining operations; and exploration and evaluation expenditures that 
result in a probable future economic benefit (refer to Note 2l) for 
capitalisation criteria for exploration and evaluation expenditures).
Development costs incurred at underground mines to build new shafts, 
drifts and ramps that provide physical access to the underground ore are 
capitalised as incurred. These costs can be incurred throughout the life 
of the underground mine.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and applicable impairment losses. Cost includes all expenditures incurred 
to prepare an asset for its intended use including: the purchase price; 
brokers’ commissions; and installation costs including architectural, 
design and engineering fees, legal fees, survey costs, site preparation 
costs, freight charges, transportation insurance costs, duties and 
borrowing cost.
Costs that extend the productive capacity or useful economic life of an 
asset are capitalised. Costs incurred that do not extend the productive 
capacity or useful economic life of an asset are considered repairs and 
maintenance and expensed as incurred.
The Group enters into leasing arrangements and arrangements that  
are in substance leasing arrangements. The determination of whether  
an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance  
of the arrangement at inception date, including whether the fulfilment  
of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or  
assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.  
A reassessment after inception is only made in specific circumstances. 
Leasing arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group are classified as 
finance leases.
Finance leases are recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability  
at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value of the leased property 
and the present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum 
lease payments over the term of the lease. Each lease payment is 
allocated between the liability and finance costs using the effective 
interest method, whereby a constant rate of interest expense is 
recognised on the balance of the liability outstanding. The interest 
element of the lease is charged to the income statement as a finance 
expense. The property, plant and equipment assets acquired under 
finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the 
asset and the lease term. All other leases are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in  
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Assets under construction
Assets in the course of construction at both our development projects 
and operating mines are capitalised in the “assets under construction” 
account. The cost of assets under construction comprises its purchase 
price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working 
condition for its intended use, at which point it is transferred to property, 
plant and equipment and depreciation commences. Development 
projects are recorded at cost, less applicable accumulated impairment 
losses. Development projects represent interests in properties that 
contain proven and probable reserves and where development activities 
are ongoing. The cost of development projects is composed of: the 
estimated fair value of development stage assets acquired as a result  
of a business combination or an asset acquisition; and costs associated 
with the construction of tangible assets, such as processing plants, 
permanent housing facilities and other tangible infrastructure associated 
with the project. Assets under construction also contain deposits on  
long lead items. Assets under construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated, net of residual value,  
over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine if shorter on a 
straight-line basis. For mineral properties and mine development costs, 
the economic benefits of the assets are consumed in a pattern which is 
linked to the production level. Such assets are depreciated on a unit of 
production basis. Depreciation commences when assets are available 
for their intended use. In applying the units of production method, 
depreciation is normally calculated using the quantity of gold, copper  
and silver extracted from the mine (or pit) in the period as a percentage 
of the total quantity of material expected to be extracted in current and 
future periods based on estimates of recoverable proven and probable 
reserves and, for some mines, mineral resources. Such non-reserve 
material may be included in the depreciation calculations where there is 
a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction and the production 
of the non-reserve material is reflected in the life of mine plan.
Development costs that relate to a discrete section of an ore body and 
which only provide benefit over the life of those reserves are depreciated 
over the recoverable proven and probable reserves of that discrete 
section. Discrete sections include capitalised underground development 
costs or production stripping costs incurred for the purposes of providing 
access to specific ore blocks or areas of the mine and which only provide 
an economic benefit over the period of mining that ore block or area. 
Development costs incurred which benefit the entire ore body are 
depreciated over the recoverable proven and probable reserves of the 
entire ore body.
The expected depreciation rates of the major categories of assets are 
as follows:
Mineral properties and development costs UOP*
Plant and equipment 4% – 25%
Underground mobile equipment 14.3% – 20%
Light vehicles and other mobile equipment 33.3% – 50%
Furniture, computer and office equipment 33.3% – 50%
*  UOP indicates assets which are depreciated on the basis of units of production 
(“UOP”), in this case ounces of gold, copper and silver produced in a period 
divided by the total recoverable reserves and resources of gold, copper and 
silver expected to be mined based on the current life of mine plans.
Each asset’s estimated residual value and useful life are reviewed,  
and adjusted if appropriate, on an annual basis. The estimate of  
residual value and useful life is based on the physical condition and  
life limitations of buildings, plant and equipment and the present 
assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine for the 
mining property and development cost asset. Changes to the estimated 
residual values or useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
p) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially determined based 
on provisional fair values. Fair values are finalised within 12 months of 
the acquisition date. For non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, non-controlling 
interests are initially recorded based on the minorities’ proportion of the 
fair values for the assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.
Goodwill that is acquired through business combinations is allocated  
to cash generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that are expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Each of the 
Group’s CGUs that has an allocation of goodwill is also an operating 
segment as defined by IFRS 8. Consequently, goodwill is tested for 
impairment at the individual CGU level.
Goodwill is not amortised; rather it is tested annually for impairment in 
accordance with accounting policy (Note 2r). Goodwill impairments are 
not reversible.
q) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by way of an asset acquisition or business 
combination are recognised if the asset is separable or arises from 
contractual or legal rights and the fair value can be measured reliably on 
initial recognition. On acquisition of a mineral property in the exploration 
stage, we prepare an estimate of the fair value attributable to the 
exploration potential, including mineral resources, if any, of that property. 
The fair value of the exploration potential is recorded as an intangible 
asset (acquired exploration potential) as at the date of acquisition.  
When an exploration stage property moves into development, any 
acquired exploration intangible asset balance attributable to that 
property is transferred to non-depreciable mining interests within 
property, plant and equipment.
Impairment testing and the reversal of impairments are conducted in 
accordance with accounting policy (Note 2r).
r) Impairment of non-current assets
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or at any time during the 
year if an indicator of impairment is considered to exist. We review and 
test the carrying amounts of intangible assets when events or changes 
in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if there is any 
indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss shall be recognised for a CGU if, and only if, the 
recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of the 
unit. The impairment loss shall first be allocated to the CGU and then to 
the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount 
of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised in prior years for non-financial assets 
other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been 
change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. This reversal  
is recognised in the consolidated statement of income and is limited  
to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of any 
depreciation, had no impairment been recognised in prior years. After 
such a reversal, any depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
112 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 The recoverable amount of an asset is assessed by reference to the 
higher of value in use (“VIU”) being the net present value (“NPV”)  
of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, and fair 
value less costs to dispose (“FVLCD”). Impairment assessments are 
conducted at the level of CGUs, which is the lowest level for which 
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other 
assets. Each operating mine and development project represents a CGU 
for impairment testing purposes. An impairment loss is recognised for 
any excess of carrying amount of a CGU over its recoverable amount.
The FVLCD of a CGU is based on an estimate of the amount that the 
Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arm’s length basis.  
There is no active market for the Group’s CGUs. Consequently, FVLCD  
is derived using discounted cash flow techniques (NPV of expected future 
cash flows of a CGU), which incorporate market participant assumptions. 
Cost to sell is based on management’s best estimates of future selling 
costs at the time of calculating FVLCD. Costs attributable to the sale  
of a CGU are not considered significant.
The expected future cash flows utilised in the NPV model are derived 
from estimates of projected future revenues, future cash costs of 
production and capital expenditures contained in the life of mine (“LOM”) 
plan for each CGU, which are updated on an annual basis. The Group’s 
LOM plans reflect proven and probable reserves and convertible 
resources and are based on detailed research, analysis and modelling  
to optimise the internal rate of return for each CGU. As such, these plans 
consider the optimal level of investment, overall production levels and 
sequence of extraction taking into account all relevant characteristics  
of the ore body, including waste-to-ore tonnes ratios, ore grades,  
haul distances, chemical and metallurgical properties impacting process 
recoveries and capacities of available extraction, haulage and processing 
equipment. Projected future revenues reflect the forecasted future 
production levels at each CGU as detailed in the LOM plans. Included  
in these forecasts is the production of mineral resources that do not 
currently qualify for inclusion in proven and probable ore reserves where 
there is a high degree of confidence in their economic extraction. This  
is consistent with the approach that a market participant would utilise  
in preparing a forecast of expected production levels. Projected future 
revenues also reflect the Group’s estimate of long-term gold prices, 
which is determined based on current prices, an analysis of the expected 
total production costs of producers and forward pricing curves and 
forecasts of expected long-term prices prepared by research analysts. 
These estimates often differ from current price levels, but this 
methodology is consistent with how a market participant would assess 
long-term gold prices.
The estimates of future cash costs of production and capital 
expenditures are derived from the LOM plans for each CGU. Costs 
incurred in currencies other than the US dollar are translated to US 
dollars using expected long-term exchange rates based on the relevant 
forward pricing curve for that currency. Oil prices are a significant 
component, both directly and indirectly, of the expected cash costs of 
production. Estimates for long-term oil prices used in the LOM plans are 
based on the spot price at the time, the forward pricing curve and 
long-term oil price forecasts prepared by analysts.
The discount rate applied to present value is based upon the real 
weighted average cost of capital applicable to the CGU. The discount  
rate reflects equity risk premiums over the risk-free rate, the impact of 
the remaining economic life of the CGU and the risks associated with  
the relevant cash flows based on the country in which the CGU is 
located. These risk adjustments are based on observed equity risk 
premiums, historical country risk premiums and average credit default 
swap spreads for the period.
In determining FVLCD, a market multiple is applied to the NPV of each 
CGU. Gold companies typically trade at a market capitalisation that is 
based on a multiple of their underlying NPV. Consequently, a market 
participant would generally apply an NPV multiple when estimating  
the fair value of a gold property. The NPV multiple utilised in the 
determination of the FVLCD of a CGU considers the NPV multiples 
observed on comparable companies. These observed multiples are 
primarily derived from research analyst reports and take into 
consideration the following: i) estimate of underlying NPV prepared by  
the analyst; ii) estimate of target market capitalisation prepared by the 
analyst; iii) market capitalisation on the date of the analyst report; and 
iv) market capitalisation on the date of the impairment test. The NPV 
multiple applied also takes into consideration the remaining economic 
life of the CGU. For CGUs with a remaining economic life of five years or 
less, an NPV multiple on the lower end of the observed multiple range is 
utilised. For other CGUs, the median observed NPV multiple is utilised.
The VIU of a CGU is generally lower than its FVLCD, due primarily to the 
application of a market multiple to the underlying NPV of a CGU when 
determining its FVLCD. Consequently, the recoverable amount of a CGU 
for impairment testing purposes is determined based on its FVLCD.
s) Contributed surplus
The Company did not exist until 12 January 2010, and did not become 
the parent company for the Group until 22 February 2010 when the 
transfer of the members of the Group pursuant to the Pre-IPO 
Reorganisation was completed. Contributed surplus represents the 
difference between the cumulative investment in the entities and 
businesses which form part of the consolidated Acacia Mining plc Group 
and non-controlling interests.
t) Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity  
as a deduction from the proceeds.
u) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation  
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that  
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the 
effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting  
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a finance cost.
Rehabilitation costs
The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Group normally 
give rise to obligations for environmental rehabilitation. Rehabilitation 
works can include facility decommissioning and dismantling; removal  
or treatment of waste materials; site and land rehabilitation. The  
extent of work required and the associated costs are dependent  
on the requirements of relevant authorities and the Group’s 
environmental policies.

113 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
CONTINUED
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Provisions for the cost of each rehabilitation programme are recognised 
at the time that environmental disturbance occurs. When the extent  
of disturbance increases over the life of an operation, the provision  
is increased accordingly. The major parts of the carrying amount of 
provisions relate to tailings pond closure/rehabilitation; demolition of 
buildings/mine facilities; ongoing water treatment; and ongoing care  
and maintenance of closed mines. Costs included in the provision 
encompass all closure and rehabilitation activity expected to occur 
progressively over the life of the operation and at the time of closure  
in connection with disturbances at the reporting date. Estimated costs 
included in the determination of the provision reflect the risks and 
probabilities of alternative estimates of cash flows required to settle  
the obligation at each particular operation. Routine operating costs that 
may impact the ultimate closure and rehabilitation activities, such as 
waste material handling conducted as an integral part of a mining or 
production process, are not included in the provision. Costs arising  
from unforeseen circumstances, such as the contamination caused by 
unplanned discharges, are recognised as an expense and liability when 
the event occurs that gives rise to an obligation and reliable estimates  
of the required rehabilitation costs can be made.
The timing of the actual rehabilitation expenditure is dependent upon a 
number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating 
licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. 
Expenditure may occur before and after closure and can continue for  
an extended period of time depending on rehabilitation requirements. 
The majority of the expenditure is expected to be paid over periods of  
up to 30 years with some payments into perpetuity. Rehabilitation 
provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, 
discounted to their present value using a current, market-based estimate 
of the real risk-free pre-tax discount rates. The unwinding of the discount 
is included in finance expense and results in an increase in the amount 
of the provision. Provisions are updated each reporting period for the 
effect of a change in the discount rate and the change in estimate is 
added or deducted from the related asset and depreciated prospectively 
over the asset’s useful life.
Significant judgements and estimates are involved in forming 
expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the 
associated cash flows. Those expectations are formed based on existing 
environmental and regulatory requirements or, if more stringent, Group 
environmental policies which give rise to a constructive obligation.
When provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially recognised,  
the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset, representing part  
of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation. 
The capitalised cost of closure and rehabilitation activities is recognised 
in property, plant and equipment and depreciated accordingly.
It is possible that management’s estimates of provisions could change 
as a result of changes in regulations, the extent of rehabilitation required, 
and the means of reclamation or cost estimates. Rehabilitation provisions 
are adjusted as a result of changes in estimates. Those adjustments  
are accounted for as a change in the corresponding value of the related 
asset, except where a reduction in the provision is greater than the 
remaining net book value of the related assets, in which case the value 
is reduced to nil and the remaining adjustment is recognised in the 
income statement. In the case of closed sites, changes to estimated 
costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Changes  
to the capitalised cost result in an adjustment to future depreciation  
and finance expense. On an annual basis, the Group reviews for changes 
in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations.
v) Employee benefits
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation  
plan (the “Share Option Plan”), a long-term incentive plan (the “LTIP”),  
a legacy restricted share unit plan (the “Legacy RSU Plan”) and a 
deferred share unit plan (the “DSU” Plan).
Share-based payments
Share options
Share options can be granted under either the Company LTIP or the 
Share Option Plan. The Company receives services from employees  
as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair 
value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed  
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
• 
including any market performance conditions;
• 
excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets and 
remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
• 
excluding the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the 
requirement for employees to save).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about  
the number of options that are expected to vest. The total expense is 
recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of 
the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each 
reporting period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting 
conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, 
if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company may issue new shares  
or procure the transfer of existing shares to satisfy the exercise. Where 
shares are issued, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised. The grant by the Company  
of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary 
undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair 
value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant 
date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase  
to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit 
to equity.
Long-term incentive plans
The Company has a cash-settled, Restricted Share Unit (“RSU”) plan for 
select employees. Under the terms of the RSU plan, selected employees 
are granted RSUs where each RSU has a value equal to one Ordinary 
Share of the Company. RSUs granted to Executive Directors and the 
other members of the Senior Leadership Team vest based on the 
Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance against the 
market cap-weighted TSR of a comparator group of companies over the 
vesting period (referred to as Performance RSUs). RSUs vest over a 
two-and-a-half or three-year period and are settled in cash. Additional 
RSUs are credited to reflect dividends paid on Ordinary Shares of the 
Company during the vesting period with a corresponding charge to the 
compensation expense. A liability for RSUs is measured at fair value on 
the grant date and is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, with a corresponding charge to the compensation expense.  
At the grant date the fair value of the awards is determined from the 
market value of the shares at the date of award and adjusted for any 
market based vesting conditions attached to the award e.g. relative  
TSR performance. Changes in the fair value of the RSU liability, due to 
changes in the price of Ordinary Shares of the Company, are recorded 
each period, with a corresponding charge to the compensation expense.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
114 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Compensation expenses recognised for RSUs incorporate an estimate 
for expected forfeiture rates. The expected forfeiture is estimated based 
on historical forfeiture rates of the Group and expectations of future 
forfeiture rates. Adjustments to compensation expense are recognised  
in periods where the actual forfeiture rate differs from the expected rate.
Legacy RSU plan
Historically, the Barrick Group has maintained a Restricted Share Unit 
(“RSU”) plan for selected employees who now work for the Group. This 
plan operates in an incidental manner to the Company RSU plan. These 
existing legacy restricted share units will continue to be administered 
and accounted for based on the movement of the fair value of the Barrick 
Ordinary Share for recording of liabilities and compensation expense.
LTIP deferred share units
Under the Deferred Share Unit (“DSU”) plan, the Non-Executive Directors 
can elect to receive all or part of their annual director fees in DSUs. Each 
DSU has the same value as one Acacia Ordinary Share. DSUs must be 
retained until the Director leaves the Board, at which time the cash value 
of the DSU is paid out. Additional DSUs are credited to reflect dividends 
paid on Acacia Ordinary Shares. A liability for DSUs is measured at  
fair value on the grant date and is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, with a corresponding charge to the Directors’ 
compensation expense. At the grant date the fair value of the awards  
is determined from the market value of the shares at the date of award. 
Changes in the fair value of the DSU liability, due to changes in the price 
of Ordinary Shares of the Company, are recorded each period, with a 
corresponding charge to the Directors’ compensation expense.
Defined contribution plan
The Group’s Tanzanian employees are members of either the National 
Social Security Fund (“NSSF”) or the Parastatal Pension Fund (“PPF”), 
which are defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a 
plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate 
entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
contribution if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all 
employees the benefits relating to the employee service in the current 
and prior periods. The Group and employees both contribute 10% of  
the employees’ gross salaries to the schemes. The contributions are 
charged to the income statement when they are due.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by  
the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group 
recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to 
either: terminating the employment of current employees according to  
a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; or providing 
termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary 
redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance 
sheet date are discounted to their present value.
Bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where it is 
contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created  
a constructive obligation.
Other entitlements
The estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual  
leave entitlement at the balance sheet date is recognised as an 
expense accrual.
w) Financial instruments
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair  
value. For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents 
include cash, and money market funds. For the purposes of the cash 
flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not 
qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair 
value through profit and loss or available for sale. These are initially 
recognised at fair value, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet 
date. These are classified as non-current assets, where the receivables 
are discounted and held at their net present value.
Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, other 
assets and cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the 
provision is the difference between the carrying amount and the expected 
cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. The carrying amount 
of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount 
of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, 
the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain 
derivatives as either:
a)   hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm 
commitment (fair value hedge);
b)  hedges of the income/cost of a highly probable forecast transaction  
or commitment (cash flow hedge); or
c)  hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net 
investment hedge).
The Group documents at inception of the transaction the relationship 
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging 
transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are 
used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes  
in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging 
purposes are disclosed in Note 31. Movements in the hedging reserve 
are shown in other comprehensive income. The full fair value of a 
hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when 
the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and 
as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged 
item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified as a 
current asset or liability.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(a) Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify 
as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with 
any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are 
attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss relating to the effective 
portion is recognised in the income statement within “finance costs”. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the 
income statement within other charges. Changes in the fair value of the 
hedge attributable to interest rate risk are recognised in the income 
statement within “finance costs”.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the 
adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the 
effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the 
period to maturity.
(b) Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that  
are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion 
is recognised immediately in the income statement within “other charges”.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, when 
the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating  
to the effective portion is recognised in the income statement. However, 
when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition  
of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains 
and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and 
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred 
amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of 
inventory or in depreciation in the case of property, plant and equipment.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when 
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the 
income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
transferred to the income statement within “other charges”.
(c) Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for 
similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective 
portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income.  
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the 
income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income 
statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
Embedded derivatives
Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives  
at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, with 
reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly 
modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly  
and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are 
separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives.
Financial liabilities
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period 
of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the 
establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of 
the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility 
will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down 
occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some 
or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a 
prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the 
facility to which it relates. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities 
unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest  
rate method.
x) Finance income and finance expense
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the 
effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the 
estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest 
rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as 
interest income.
Interest is recognised as a borrowing cost on a time proportion basis 
using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs that relate directly 
to the construction of property, plant and equipment during the time that 
it is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use are 
capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
y) Taxes
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is 
recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, respectively.
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods 
are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to 
the taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are 
those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary 
differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of  
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates enacted  
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply when the related deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred 
income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
116 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences, except:
• 
where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction  
that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit/loss; and
• 
in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
• 
where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary 
differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of 
the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit 
or loss; and
• 
in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries deferred income tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary 
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will 
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part 
of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each 
balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become 
probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to 
be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Uncertainties regarding availability of tax losses, in respect of enquiries 
raised and additional tax assessments issued, have been measured 
using the single best estimate of likely outcome approach.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is 
recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, 
if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets 
against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes 
relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Indirect tax
Indirect tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in indirect tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions or 
receivables where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be 
paid to or received from the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws
used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. If the receivable is expected to be 
received in more than 12 months from year end, the receivable is 
discounted and held at its present value. Amounts expected to be 
payable or receivable in more than 12 months are classified as 
non-current assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, as appropriate.
z) Royalties
Royalty arrangements based on mineral production are in place at each 
operating mine. The primary type of royalty is a net smelter return 
(“NSR”) royalty. Under this type of royalty the Group pays the holder an 
amount calculated as the royalty percentage multiplied by the value of 
gold production at market gold prices less third-party smelting, refining 
and transportation costs.
The North Mara mine is also subject to a land royalty (land tenements 
(“LT”)) based on the net revenue derived from the open pit mines.
Royalty expense is recorded when revenue from the sale of gold, copper 
and silver production is recognised.
The following percentages apply:
Bulyanhulu 4% NSR
**
North Mara – Nyabirama and Nyabigena pits 4% NSR
**
, 1% LT
North Mara – Gokona pit and underground 4% NSR
**
, 1.1% LT
Buzwagi 4% NSR
**
, 30% NP
I*
*  The NPI is calculated as a percentage of profits realised from the Buzwagi mine 
after all capital, exploration and development costs and interest incurred in 
relation to the Buzwagi mine have been recouped and all operating costs 
relating to the Buzwagi mine have been paid. No amount is currently payable.
** The Group agreed to a voluntary 1% increase in the NSR royalty rate in 2012.
aa) Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership 
are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments 
made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the 
lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the period of the lease.
The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of 
property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance 
leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the 
fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments.
Each finance lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance 
charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, 
are included in other liabilities. The interest element of the finance cost 
is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce 
a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability 
for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance 
leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and 
the lease term.
bb) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a 
liability in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

3. Discontinued operations and disposal group assets and liabilities held for sale
On 15 November 2013, Acacia announced that an agreement was reached with STAMICO, the Tanzanian State Mining Corporation, whereby STAMICO 
would acquire the Tulawaka Gold Mine (“Tulawaka”) and certain exploration licences surrounding Tulawaka for consideration of US$4.5 million and the 
grant of a 2% net smelter royalty on future production in excess of 500,000 ounces, capped at US$500,000.
On 4 February 2014, Acacia announced the completion of the sale. STAMICO has taken ownership and management of the rehabilitation fund 
established as part of the closure plan for the mine, in return for the assumption of all remaining past and future closure and rehabilitation liabilities 
for Tulawaka, and has indemnified the other parties to the agreement in relation to these liabilities. The transfer was completed with a net cash 
payment of US$11.6 million by Acacia to STAMICO for the balance of the rehabilitation fund, less the transaction consideration. This resulted in a 
gain of US$4.1 million. After non operational costs incurred in the year to 31 December 2014 and other closing adjustments, this resulted in a total 
cash outflow year to date of US$5.3 million.
The financial results of Tulawaka have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. The comparative results 
in the consolidated income statement have been presented as if Tulawaka had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
118 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 4. Segment reporting
The Group has only one primary product produced in a single geographic location, being gold produced in Tanzania. In addition the Group produces 
copper and silver as a co-product. Reportable operating segments are based on the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(“CODM”) to evaluate segment performance, decide how to allocate resources and make other operating decisions. After applying the aggregation 
criteria and quantitative thresholds contained in IFRS 8, the Group’s reportable operating segments were determined to be: North Mara gold mine; 
Bulyanhulu gold mine; Buzwagi gold mine; and a separate Corporate and Exploration segment, which primarily consists of costs related to other 
charges and corporate social responsibility expenses as well as discontinued operations (Tulawaka gold mine). Segment results and carrying values 
include items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Segment carrying values are 
disclosed and calculated as shareholders’ equity after adding back debt and inter-company liabilities, and subtracting cash and inter-company 
assets. Segment liabilities are not reported since they are not considered by the CODM as material to segment performance. Capital expenditures 
comprise additions to property, plant and equipment. The Group has also included segment cash costs per ounce sold and all-in sustaining cost per 
ounce sold (non-IFRS financial performance measures). Segment information for the reportable operating segments of the Group for the years ended 
31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 is set out below.

7. Impairment charges
In accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ and IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, a review for impairment of goodwill is undertaken annually or at  
any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist and in accordance with IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’, a review for impairment  
of long-lived assets is undertaken at any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist. 
During 2013, the prevailing gold price fell significantly which forced a review of the gold price outlook used for long-term planning and reserve 
estimation. As reported in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013, on a gross basis, and before taking into 
account the impact of deferred tax, the total impairment charge booked in 2013 amounted to US$690.5 million at Buzwagi, US$307.3 million at 
North Mara, US$46.6 million relating to Nyanzaga and US$16.7 million at Tulawaka. 
At the end of 2014, the annual review for impairment of goodwill and indefinite life assets was performed. The review compared the recoverable 
amount of assets for the cash generating units (“CGU”) to the carrying value of the CGUs including goodwill. For the purposes of the Group’s 
impairment assessment, each operating mine has been determined to be a separate CGU. The recoverable amount of an asset is assessed by 
reference to the higher of value in use (“VIU”), being the net present value (“NPV”) of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset,  
and fair value less costs to dispose (“FVLCD”). The FVLCD of a CGU is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale 
transaction on an arm’s length basis. There is no active market for the Group’s CGUs. Consequently, FVLCD is derived using discounted cash  
flow techniques (NPV of expected future cash flows of a CGU), which incorporate market participant assumptions. Cost to dispose is based on 
management’s best estimates of future selling costs at the time of calculating FVLCD. Costs attributable to the disposal of a CGU are not considered 
significant. The expected future cash flows utilised in the NPV model are derived from estimates of projected future revenues, future cash costs  
of production and capital expenditures contained in the life of mine (“LOM”) plan for each CGU. The Group’s LOM plans reflect proven and probable 
reserves and are based on detailed research, analysis and modelling to optimise the internal rate of return for each CGU. FVLCD measurements are 
defined as level three fair value measurements as they are valued using unobservable inputs.
The discount rate applied to calculate the present value is based upon the real weighted average cost of capital applicable to the CGU. The discount 
rate reflects equity risk premiums over the risk-free rate, the impact of the remaining economic life of the CGU and the risks associated with the 
relevant cash flows based on the country in which the CGU is located. These risk adjustments are based on observed equity risk premiums, historical 
country risk premiums and average credit default swap spreads for the period.
The VIU of a CGU is generally lower than its FVLCD, due primarily to the fact that the optimisation of the mine plans has been taken into account 
when determining its FVLCD. Consequently, the recoverable amount of a CGU for impairment testing purposes is determined based on its FVLCD.
The key economic assumptions used in the reviews during 2014 and 2013 were:

Tanzanian shilling (US$:TZS) 1,700 1,600
Long-term oil price per barrel US$100 US$120
Discount rate 5% 5%
For purposes of testing for impairment of non-current assets, a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used to estimate the recoverable 
amount for CGUs could result in an additional impairment charge. The carrying value of the net assets relating to Buzwagi are most sensitive to 
changes in key assumptions in respect of gold price and a US$100 per ounce decrease in isolation would lead to an impairment of approximately 
US$12 million. 
The annual review for impairment of intangible assets related to exploration properties was performed by comparing the carrying value to the FVLCD 
which was derived based on analyst market prices for the exploration properties and similar assets. No impairments were triggered by this review.

Tax periods remain open to review by the Tanzanian Revenue Authority (“TRA”) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the  
filing of the corporate tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. 
Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. Because a number of tax periods remain open to review by tax authorities, there 
is a risk that transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result  
in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest.
14. Earnings/(loss) per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential Ordinary Shares. The Company has dilutive potential Ordinary Shares in the form of share options. The weighted average number  
of shares is adjusted for the number of shares granted assuming the exercise of share options.
At 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, earnings per share have been calculated as follows:

Trade receivables other than concentrate receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30-90-day terms. Concentrate receivables are 
generally on 60-120-day terms depending on the terms per contract. Trade receivables are amounts due from customers in the ordinary course  
of business. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.  
The carrying value of trade receivables recorded in the financial statements represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The Group does not 
hold any collateral as security. Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any provisions for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.

22. Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued
Uncertainties regarding availability of tax losses, in respect of enquiries raised and additional tax assessments issued by the TRA, have been 
measured using the single best estimate of likely outcome approach resulting in the recognition of substantially all the related deferred tax assets 
and liabilities. Alternative acceptable measurement policies (e.g. on a weighted average expected outcome basis) could result in a change to deferred 
tax assets and liabilities being recognised, and the deferred tax charge in the income statement.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the Group is in a 
position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with such investments in subsidiaries is represented by the contribution of those 
investments to the Group’s retained earnings and amounted to US$325 million (2013: US$327 million).

Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables 
are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Terms and conditions of the above payables liabilities:
• 
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled on 30-day of statement terms
• 
Accruals and other payables are non-interest bearing and have an average term of 30-60 days
27. Borrowings
During 2013, a US$142 million facility (the“Facility”) was put in place to fund the bulk of the costs of the construction of one of Acacia’s key growth 
projects, the Bulyanhulu CIL Expansion project (the “Project”). The Facility is collateralised by the Project, has a term of seven years with a spread 
over LIBOR of 250 basis points. The interest rate has been fixed at 3.6% through the use of an interest rate swap. The seven year Facility is repayable 
in equal instalments over the term of the Facility, after a two year repayment holiday period. The first principal payment is due in H2 2015. The full 
facility of US$142 million was drawn at the end of 2013. Interest accrued to the value of US$0.7 million was included in accounts payable at year 
end. Interest incurred on the borrowings as well as hedging losses on the interest rate swap were capitalised as an asset until the CIL plant was 
commissioned at the beginning of Q4 2014 and have since been expensed. An amount of US$1.0 million has been expensed.

1   Rehabilitation provisions relate to the decommissioning costs expected to be incurred for the operating mines. This expenditure arises at different times over the life  
of mine for the different mine sites and is expected to be utilised in terms of cash outflows between years 2015 and 2050 and beyond, varying from mine site to mine site.
2  Other provisions relate to provisions for legal and tax-related liabilities where the outcome is not yet certain but it is expected that it will lead to a probable outflow of 
economic benefits in future.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
134 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Rehabilitation obligations arise from the acquisition, development, construction and normal operation of mining property, plant and equipment, 
due to Government controls and regulations that protect the environment on the closure and reclamation of mining properties. The major parts of  
the carrying amount of the obligation relate to tailings and waste rock dump closure/rehabilitation; surface contouring; demolition of buildings/mine 
facilities; ongoing water treatment; and ongoing care and maintenance of closed mines. The fair values of rehabilitation provisions are measured  
by discounting the expected cash flows using a discount factor that reflects the credit-adjusted risk-free rate of interest. Acacia prepares estimates  
of the timing and amount of expected cash flows when an obligation is incurred and updates expected cash flows to reflect changes in facts and 
circumstances. The principal factors that can cause expected cash flows to change are: the construction of new processing facilities; changes  
in the quantities of material in reserves and a corresponding change in the life of mine plan; changing ore characteristics that impact required 
environmental protection measures and related costs; changes in water quality that impact the extent of water treatment required; and changes  
in laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment.
Each year Acacia assesses cost estimates and other assumptions used in the valuation of the rehabilitation provision at each mineral property  
to reflect events, changes in circumstances and new information available. Changes in these cost estimates and assumptions are recorded as 
an adjustment to the carrying amount of the corresponding asset. Rehabilitation provisions are adjusted to reflect the passage of time (accretion) 
calculated by applying the discount factor implicit in the initial fair-value measurement to the beginning-of-period carrying amount of the provision. 
Settlement gains/losses will be recorded in other (income) expense.
Other environmental remediation costs that are not rehabilitation provisions are expensed as incurred.

Revolving credit facility
The Group has a revolving credit facility in place for a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million, which was negotiated on 24 November 2010 with  
a syndicate of commercial banks, led by Citibank. The facility has been provided to service the general corporate needs of the Group and to fund potential 
acquisitions. All provisions contained in the credit facility documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial and customary terms for such finance 
arrangements and when drawn the spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis points. During 2014, the term of the facility was successfully extended to 2017  
at a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million. At 31 December 2014, none of the funds were drawn under the facility. The shares of all significant 
subsidiaries have been pledged as security for the loan. Costs associated with the revolving credit facility have been included in finance expenses.

assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, 
and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions 
and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and 
constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Board of Directors has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and 
procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted 
in its oversight role by internal audit which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of 
which are reported to the Audit Committee.
a) Market risk, including commodity price, foreign currency and interest rate risks
Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its financial instruments.
Gold price
The market price of gold is one of the most significant factors in determining the profitability of the Group’s operations. The price of gold is subject to volatile 
price movements over short periods of time, especially in the current market environment, and is affected by numerous industry and macro-economic 
factors that are beyond the Group’s control. In 2014 the price ranged from US$1,142 to US$1,385 per ounce, with an average market price of US$1,266 
per ounce (2013: US$1,411 per ounce). The Group’s policy is to sell gold at prevailing market prices.
The table below summarises the impact of changes in the market price on gold. The impact is expressed in terms of the resulting change in the Group’s 
profit after tax for the year or, where applicable, the change in equity. The sensitivities are based on the assumption that the market price changes by 10% 
with all other variables held constant. The impact of a similar change in copper and silver is not material to the Group’s profit after tax.

In 2014, the copper price ranged from US$2.86 to US$3.37 per pound, with an average market price of US$3.11 per pound (2013: US$3.32 per 
pound) and closing at US$2.88 per pound.
In 2014, the silver price ranged from US$15 to US$22 per ounce, with an average market price of US$19 per ounce (2013: US$24 per ounce).
Our hedging strategy for 2014 was zero-cost collar contracts as a result of improved pricing to manage the impact of the copper price fluctuations. 
The Group does not use such derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
The Group had copper collar contracts for 8.4 million pounds containing purchased put and call options with an average strike price of US$3.12 per 
pound and US$3.41 per pound respectively maturing in 2014. These transactions are economic hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting 
treatment. Changes in the fair value of these options are recorded as a component of other income/expense in the income statement.
We entered into new zero cost collar contracts in the second half of of 2014 which will mature in 2015. These transactions are economic hedges  
and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of these options are recorded as a component of other charges in the 
income statement.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had 3.6 million pounds of copper collar contracts outstanding containing purchased put and call options with an 
average strike price of US$3.08 per pound and US$3.35 per pound respectively (2013: average forward rate of US$3.72 per pound). These will all 
mature in 2015.

138 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 Oil price
Diesel fuel is refined from crude oil and is therefore subject to the same price volatility affecting crude oil prices. The Group enters into Brent oil 
option contracts to manage the impact of oil price fluctuations. In 2014, oil prices traded between US$57 and US$115 per barrel with an average 
market price of US$100 (2013: US$109 per barrel).
The table below summarises the impact of changes in the market prices of crude oil. The impact is expressed in terms of the resulting change in  
the Group’s profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2014. The sensitivities are based on the assumption that the market price changes by 
US$10 per barrel with all other variables held constant. The effect on profit after tax (before hedging) is calculated based on actual consumption for 
the year and does not address the indirect impact of a change in the oil price on other costs.

During the year, the Group added 36,000 barrels of Brent oil collar contracts for calendar year 2014 consisting of sold put options and bought call 
options with average strike prices of US$96.25 per barrel and US$110 per barrel respectively. The designated contracts act as a hedge against 
variability in market prices, in a pre-defined range, of the cost of future fuel purchases over the next year. At 31 December 2014, the Group had a 
total 527,000 barrels of Brent crude oil net purchase options outstanding. These contracts mature in 2015 and 2016 and consist of sold put options 
with average strike prices of US$97 per barrel and US$85 per barrel and bought call options with average strike prices of US$110 per barrel and 
US$103 per barrel respectively.
These contracts are treated as accounting hedges in accordance with IAS 39. Hedged items are identified as the first stated quantity of forecasted 
consumption purchased in a future month. Hedge effectiveness is assessed using linear regression utilising the concept of the hypothetical derivative 
method. The effective portion of changes in intrinsic value of the commodity contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income until the forecasted 
expenditure impacts earnings. During 2014, these hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as they did not meet the hedge effectiveness 
criteria. Changes in the fair value of these options were therefore recorded as a component of other charges in the income statement.
Risks relating to the use of derivatives
By using derivatives, in addition to credit risk, we are affected by market risk. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be 
adversely affected by a change in commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. 
We manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s transactions are denominated in a number of different currencies (primarily US dollars, Tanzanian shillings, and South African rands).  
The Group has liabilities that are primarily denominated in US dollars. The US dollar is the Company’s (and its subsidiaries’) functional currency,  
as well as the Group’s presentation currency. Therefore, transactions in currencies other than the US dollar give rise to foreign currency translation 
risk. The Group’s primary exposure to this risk arises from direct mine operating costs and corporate administration costs that are transacted in 
shillings and rands, respectively. Consequently, fluctuations in the US dollar/shilling/rand exchange rates increase the volatility of cost of sales, 
corporate administration costs and overall net earnings, which are reported in US dollars. The vast majority of all direct mining costs and corporate 
administration costs are denominated and settled in US dollars. Consequently, the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Group’s reported 
direct mining and corporate administration costs is not significant.
The exchange rates at the end of each financial year are detailed in Note 2g).
Historically, the relationship between the gold price and the value of the shilling and rand provide a natural hedge against fluctuations in the exchange 
rate of these currencies against the US dollar. Generally, a strengthening of the shilling/rand, which would cause an increase in reported US dollar 
operating costs, corresponds with an increase in the US dollar gold price, which results in an increase in reported US dollar revenues.
The Group enters into rand/US dollar collar contracts to manage the impact of currency fluctuations on rand denominated operating and capital 
expenditures. In 2014, the rand traded between R10.29 and R11.76 per US dollar, and averaged R10.85 per US dollar (2013: R9.63 per US dollar).
The Group added R159 million of rand collar contracts for 2014 with purchased put and sold call options with average strike prices of R8.90 and 
R9.80 respectively up to April 2014 to hedge forecasted rand denominated capital spend in part of 2014. In 2014 no new contracts were entered on 
forecasted lower rand denominated capital expenditure. The transactions were classified as economic hedges, not qualifying for hedge accounting 
treatment as they did not meet the hedge effectiveness requirements.

32. Financial risk management continued
At 31 December 2014, the Group had US$26 million of rand collar contracts outstanding containing purchased put and sold call options with average 
strike prices of R10.43 and R12.80 respectively (2013: US$114 million of rand collar contracts with purchased put and sold call options with average 
strike prices R9.57 and R11.06 respectively) and R171 million of rand collar contracts with purchased put and sold call options with average strike 
prices of R10.50 and R12.65 respectively. These contracts all mature in 2015. The 2014 transactions are economic hedges and do not qualify  
for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of these options are recorded as a component of other charges in the income statement.  
The contracts booked in the second half of 2015 were booked with rand nominal values and therefore act as a hedge against variability in the  
rand/US dollar exchange rate over the period. These contracts are treated as accounting hedges in accordance with IAS 39. Hedged items are 
identified as the first stated quantity of rand spent during the month. Hedge effectiveness will be assessed using linear regression utilising the 
concept of the hypothetical derivative method. The effective portion of changes in intrinsic value of the currency contracts is recorded in other 
comprehensive income until the forecasted expenditure impact occurs.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instruments will fluctuate due to changes 
in market interest rates. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose 
the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents.
At present, available funds are held with financial institutions at variable rates and primarily denominated in US dollars; interest income is not 
materially affected by changes in short-term interest rates. During 2013, the Group entered into an Export Credit Insurance Company (“ECIC”) backed 
seven year term loan facility of US$142 million to fund the construction of the CIL Process plant at Bulyanhulu. As at 31 December 2014 the loan is 
fully drawn. Interest is payable on the loan at LIBOR plus 250 basis points. The revolving credit facility’s spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis points. 
Group debt levels are impacted by the amount of operating cash flow generated by its operating mines, as well as capital expenditure requirements 
related to existing operations and development projects.
In 2013, the Group entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the interest on the ECIC backed loan for the Buly CIL Process plant. The terms 
of the interest rate swap contracts fix this at 3.59% versus the floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. These contracts are treated as accounting hedges 
in accordance with IAS 39. Hedged items are identified as the first stated quantity of rand spent during the month. Hedge effectiveness is assessed 
using linear regression utilising the concept of the hypothetical derivative method. The effective portion of changes in intrinsic value of the currency 
contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income until the forecasted expenditure occurs. For 2014, these gains or losses were capitalised 
against the Bulyanhulu CIL Process plant asset until the plant was brought into operation. Thereafter the gains or losses have been included as  
part of interest expense in the income statement.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
140 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. For cash and cash 
equivalents and trade and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet, net of any overdraft positions.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks, as well as trade and other receivables. The Group’s financial assets  
are held with counterparties who the Group considers have an appropriate credit rating. Location of credit risk is determined by physical location  
of the bank branch, customer or counterparty. The maximum allowable term to maturity for any individual security is three months. Investment 
counterparties must have a credit rating of at least “Baa1” or better by Moody’s Investor Services or “BBB+” by Standard and Poor’s. No more than 
25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the United States of America  
or the United Kingdom, or in any one industry group. Investments are primarily held in United States dollars. Cash and cash equivalents in other 
foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements. As at 31 December 2014 the Group has money market and short-term investments 
of US$144.0 million. All of the funds have at least a “BBB+” rating from Standard and Poor’s. The Group also has US$149.9 million of cash on hand 
with banks with credit ratings ranging from “A-1” to “A-2”.
With respect to other receivables, the most significant debtor is the Tanzanian Revenue Authority (“TRA”). Following the abolishment of Government 
Notices regarding VAT relief and fuel duty exemption for mining companies in 2009, Acacia signed a Memorandum of Settlement during 2011 with  
the TRA to address the treatment of the certain outstanding indirect tax refunds in respect of fuel levies and VAT that allows Acacia to offset income 
tax payable against outstanding VAT and fuel levy refunds as it becomes payable. Also, the Minister of Finance reinstated VAT relief and the fuel 
exemption followed by an agreement to allow for an escrow facility in respect of fuel and road levies. Through the Finance Act, 2012 issued on 19 
October 2012, VAT Relief was again abolished. Throughout the past two years, Acacia has been actively involved in discussions with the Tanzanian 
Government and the TRA to resolve the issue. The amendments conflict with certain provisions contained in the Group’s existing Mine Development 
Agreements (“MDAs”) which guarantee the fiscal stability of its operations. As part of a short-term solution, the Government during the third quarter 
of 2013, agreed to an escrow arrangement on VAT in relation to imported goods and services, whereby funds are restricted to the repayment of VAT 
refunds. As at 31 December 2014, the discounted amounts due to the Group were approximately US$108.1 million (prior year US$159.8 million).  
We received refunds to the value of US$132.8 million during the year under review.
Group policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. Individual exposures are monitored  
with trade customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s exposure to credit risk  
is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each of the counterparties. The Group’s financial assets are with counterparties who the 
Group considers have an appropriate credit rating. During the year, receivables to the value of US$32 million (2013: US$71 million) were advanced  
by a financial institution under a factoring agreement. This agreement reduces the risk of default of receivables.
Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets described in Note 30. The Group does 
not hold collateral as security for any trade receivables. The Group does not grade the credit quality of receivables.
c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of loss from not having access to sufficient funds to meet both expected and unexpected cash demands. The Group manages 
its exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring that its operating and strategic liquidity levels are well above minimum internal requirements. Prudent liquidity 
risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash balances, and the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. 
At the end of both 2014 and 2013 the Group was in a positive net cash position, as disclosed in Note 19. Details of the undrawn revolving credit 
facility are given in Note 30.
In the ordinary course of business, the Group receives cash proceeds from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements. The cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested to maximise returns while ensuring that capital is safeguarded 
to the maximum extent possible by investing only with financial institutions with a strong credit rating. Insignificant uncommitted overdraft facilities 
are maintained with several banking counterparties to meet the Group’s normal funding requirements. The Group’s primary source of liquidity is 
operating cash flow, and over the past two years the Group has generated an average of about US$238 million per year. The principal risk factor 
affecting operating cash flow is market gold prices. 
The principal uses of liquidity are sustaining capital expenditures at existing operating mines, construction activities at development projects, and 
interest payments. Sustaining capital expenditures, including capitalised development costs, have averaged about US$230 million per year over the 
past two years. The following table outlines the expected maturity of the Group’s significant financial assets into relevant maturity groupings based  
on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. As the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows, these balances may not agree with the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.

Capital risk management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio to support  
its business and provide financial flexibility in order to maximise shareholder value. In order to ensure a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio, 
management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions, which are approved by the Senior Leadership Team before 
submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.

34. Commitments and contingencies
The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. As at 31 December 2014, the Group has the 
following commitments and/or contingencies:
a) Legal contingencies
As at 31 December 2014, the Group was a defendant in approximately 289 lawsuits. The plaintiffs are claiming damages and interest thereon for the 
loss caused by the Group due to one or more of the following: unlawful eviction, termination of services, wrongful termination of contracts of service, 
non-payment for services, defamation, negligence by act or omission in failing to provide a safe working environment, unpaid overtime and public 
holiday compensation. 
The total amounts claimed from lawsuits in which specific monetary damages are sought amounted to US$184.7 million. The Group’s Legal Counsel 
is defending the Group’s current position, and the outcome of the lawsuits cannot presently be determined. However, in the opinion of the Directors 
and Legal Counsel, no material liabilities are expected to materialise from these lawsuits that have not already been provided for. 
Included in the total amounts claimed is an appeal by the TRA intended for a tax assessment of US$21.3 million in respect of the acquisition of 
Tusker Gold Limited. The case was awarded in favour of Acacia however the TRA has served a notice of appeal. The calculated tax assessment  
is based on the sales price of the Nyanzaga property of US$71 million multiplied by the tax rate of 30%. Management is of the opinion that the 
assessment is invalid due to the fact that the acquisition was for Tusker Gold Limited, a company incorporated in Australia. The shareholding  
of the Tanzanian related entities did not change and the Tusker Gold Limited group structure remains the same as prior to the acquisition. 
Also included in the total amounts claimed are TRA claims to the value of US$41.3 million for withholding tax on historic offshore dividend payments 
paid by Acacia Mining plc to its shareholders. In addition to the claim, there are six other withholding tax claims which have not been quantified. 
These claims are made on the basis that Acacia is resident in Tanzania for tax purposes. Management are of the opinion that the claims do not have 
substance and will be successfully defended.
In 2013, a number of Tanzanian claimants represented by Leigh Day initiated proceedings against African Barrick Gold plc (now Acacia Mining plc) and 
its subsidiary, North Mara Gold Mine Limited (“NMGML”), in the English Courts in relation to injuries and fatalities at the North Mara mine. The claims 
were denied by Acacia Mining and NMGML and the litigation and further claims have been settled out of court.
NMGML and Diamond Motors Ltd (DML) have entered into arbitration over the interpretation of drilling contracts entered into by the parties, relating 
to periodic rate review and other provisions of the contracts. The claim by DML against NMGML is quantified as US$17.2 million, together with 
interest and unspecified damages. NMGML has counterclaimed against this amount and raised a provision of US$4.2 million reflecting the view  
of NMGML as to the proper interpretation and application of the rate review clauses of the contracts. 
A claim has been made for US$15 million by the contractor responsible for the engineering, procurement and construction of a carbon in leach circuit 
at Bulyanhulu Gold Mine (“BGML”). BGML has made claims in relation to delay damages and other breaches of the contract totalling US$22 million. 
Management are of the opinion that it will be successful in respect of both claims.
b) Tax-related contingencies
The TRA has issued a number of tax assessments to the Group relating to past taxation years from 2002 onwards. The Group believes that these 
assessments are incorrect and has filed objections to each of them. The Group is attempting to resolve these matters by means of discussions with 
the TRA or through the Tanzanian Appeals process. During 2013, the Board ruled in favour of BGML in relation to seven of ten issues raised by the 
TRA in final assessments for 2000 – 2006 years under review. The TRA filed a notice of intention to appeal against the ruling of the Board and Acacia 
filed a counter appeal in respect of BGML to the Appeals Tribunal for all three items that were lost. The Tribunal delivered its judgement in 2014 and 
confirmed the Board’s decision on the three items that Acacia lost. Following the Tribunal’s decision, notices of intention to appeal were filed. The

positions that were ruled against BGML were sufficiently provided for in prior year results and management is of the opinion that open issues will not 
result in any material liabilities to the Group.
c) Exploration and development agreements – Mining licences
Pursuant to agreements with the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, the Group was issued special mining licences for Bulyanhulu, Buzwagi, 
North Mara and Tulawaka mines and mining licences for building materials at Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi Mines. The agreement requires the Group to pay 
to the Government of Tanzania annual rents of US$5,000 per annum per square kilometre for as long as the Group holds the special mining licences and 
US$2,000 per annum per square kilometre for so long as the Group holds the mining licences for building materials. The total commitment for 2015 for 
the remaining special mining licences and mining licences for building materials amount to US$0.66 million (2014: US$0.65 million). Subsequent to 
year-end, the transfer of the Tulawaka Special Mining Licence to STAMICO was approved.
d) Purchase commitments
At 31 December 2014, the Group had purchase obligations for supplies and consumables of approximately US$64 million (2013: US$48 million).
e) Capital commitments
In addition to entering into various operational commitments in the normal course of business, the Group entered into contracts for capital 
expenditure of approximately US$20 million (2013: US$6 million).
35. Related party balances and transactions
The Group had the following related party balances and transactions during the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF ACACIA MINING PLC  
REPORT ON THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion, Acacia Mining plc’s parent company financial statements 
(the “financial statements”):
• 
give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2014 and of its loss and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
• 
have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the  
European Union; and
• 
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
Acacia Mining plc’s financial statements comprise:
• 
the parent company balance sheet as at 31 December 2014;
• 
the parent company income statement and statement  
of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• 
the parent company cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• 
the parent company statement of changes in equity for the year  
then ended; and
• 
the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary  
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the 
Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), rather than in the 
notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from  
the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinions
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK  
& Ireland)”) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information 
in the Annual Report is:
• 
materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Company acquired in the course  
of performing our audit; or
• 
otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Adequacy of accounting records and information  
and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit; or
• 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• 
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration report – Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from  
this responsibility.
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AND THE AUDIT
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement  
set out on page 91, the Directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 
16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not,  
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other 
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into 
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit 
involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed; 
• 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and 
• 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
146 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements,  
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in  
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.

PARENT COMPANY  
CASH FLOW STATEMENT
PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION STRATEGIC REPORT
151 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
1. Corporate information
Acacia Mining plc, formerly African Barrick Gold plc (the “Company”) was 
incorporated on 12 January 2010 and re-registered as a public limited 
company on 12 March 2010 under the Companies Act 2006. It is 
registered in England and Wales with registered number 7123187.
On 24 March 2010 the Company’s shares were admitted to the Official 
List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority (“UKLA”) and to trading on 
the main market of the London Stock Exchange, hereafter referred to as 
the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). The address of its registered office is 
5th Floor, 1 Cavendish Place, London, W1G 0QF, United Kingdom.
Barrick Gold Corporation (“BGC”) currently owns approximately 63.9%  
of the shares of the Company and is the ultimate controlling party  
of the Group. The financial statements of BGC can be obtained from  
www.barrick.com
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 were 
approved for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company on 9 March 
2015. The primary activity of the Company is as holding company for the 
Acacia Mining Group of companies.
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
financial statements are set out below. 
a) Basis of preparation 
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (“IFRS”), IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a 
historical cost basis.
The Company’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that the Company should 
be able to operate within the level of its current financing.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. The Company therefore adopts the 
going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars (US$) and all values 
are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000) except when otherwise 
indicated. Where a change in the presentational format between the prior 
year and current year financial statements has been made during the 
period, comparative figures are restated accordingly. No changes were 
made to presentational format in the current year.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the 
financial statements are set out below.
b) New and amended standards adopted by the Company
The following new standards and amendments to standards are 
applicable and were adopted by the Company for the first time for the 
financial year beginning 1 January 2014.
• 
Amendment to IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’, on 
offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. This amendment 
clarifies that the right of set-off must not be contingent on a future 
event. It must also be legally enforceable for all counterparties in the 
normal course of business, as well as in the event of default, 
insolvency or bankruptcy. The amendment also considers settlement 
mechanisms. The amendment did not have a significant effect on the 
Company financial statements.
• 
Amendments to IAS 36, ‘Impairment of assets’, on the recoverable 
amount disclosures for non-financial assets. This amendment 
removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of cash 
generating units which had been included in IAS 36 by the issue  
of IFRS 13.
• 
Amendment to IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and 
measurement’, on the novation of derivatives and the continuation  
of hedge accounting. This amendment considers legislative changes 
to ‘over-the-counter’ derivatives and the establishment of central 
counterparties. Under IAS 39 novation of derivatives to central 
counterparties would result in discontinuance of hedge accounting. 
The amendment provides relief from discontinuing hedge accounting 
when novation of a hedging instrument meets specified criteria.  
The amendment did not have an impact on the Company  
financial statements.
• 
IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’, sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay  
a levy if that liability is within the scope of IAS 37, ‘Provisions’.  
The interpretation addresses what the obligating event is that  
gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognised.  
The Company is not currently subjected to significant levies so the 
impact on the Company is not material.
• 
IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’, builds on existing 
principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining 
factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated 
financial statements of the parent company. The standard provides 
additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where 
this is difficult to assess. The amendment did not have a significant 
effect on the assessment of control.
• 
IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’, focuses on rights and obligations  
of the parties to the arrangement rather than its legal form. 
Proportional consolidation of joint arrangements is no longer 
permitted. The amendment did not have a significant effect on  
the Company financial statements.
• 
IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’, includes the 
disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other entities 
including joint arrangements, associates, structured entities and 
other off-balance sheet vehicles. The amendment did not have  
a significant effect on the Company financial statements.
c)  New and amended standards, and interpretations not 
yet adopted
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have 
been published and are effective for the Company’s accounting periods 
beginning after 1 January 2014:
• 
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014.  
It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification 
and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but 
simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three 
primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised  
cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L. The basis  
of classification depends on the entity’s business model and  
the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. 
Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at  
fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception 
to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now  
a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred  
loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there 
were no changes to classification and measurement except for the 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
152 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014 recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive 
income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. 
IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing 
the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic 
relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for 
the “hedged ratio” to be the same as the one management actually 
use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation 
is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 
39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on  
or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted subject to EU 
endorsement. The Company is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact.
• 
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, deals with 
revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, 
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising 
from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised 
when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has 
the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or 
service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 
‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and 
earlier application is permitted. The standard is not expected to have 
a significant impact on the Company. 
d)  Significant judgements in applying accounting policies 
and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Many of the amounts included in the parent company financial 
statements require management to make judgements and/or estimates. 
These judgements and estimates are continuously evaluated and are 
based on management’s experience and best knowledge of the relevant 
facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the parent company financial statements. Information about 
such judgements and estimation is included in the accounting policies 
and/or notes to the financial statements, and the key areas are 
summarised below.
Areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the parent 
company financial statements include: 
• 
Whether to recognise a provision for accounts receivable – Notes 2h) 
and 9;
• 
Recognition of deferred income tax assets, amounts recorded for 
uncertain tax positions, the measurement of income tax expense and 
indirect taxes – Notes 2j) and 5; and
• 
Review of property, plant and equipment and investments in 
subsidiaries, the determination of whether these assets are impaired 
and the measurement of impairment charges or reversals – Notes 2f), 
7 and 8.
e) Foreign currency translation
The Company’s transactions are denominated in a number of different 
currencies (primarily US dollars and UK pounds sterling). The Company 
has liabilities that are primarily denominated in US dollars. The US  
dollar is the Company’s functional currency, as well as the Company’s 
presentation currency. Transactions in currencies other than the US 
dollar are translated at the exchange rates as at the date of transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than  
the US dollar are translated to US dollars at year-end exchange rates.  
All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. 
Non-monetary assets measured at historical cost in a currency other than 
US dollars are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the initial 
transactions. Where non-monetary assets are measured at fair value in  
a currency other than US dollars they are translated into US dollars using 
the exchange rates on the date when the fair value was determined. 
The following exchange rates to the US dollar have been applied:

f) Investment in subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company has the power, directly 
or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies in order to 
obtain benefits from their activities. Control is presumed to exist where 
the Company has more than one half of the voting rights unless it can be 
demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control. Control does 
not exist where other parties hold veto rights over significant operating 
and financial decisions. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible as well as other contractual 
arrangements that enable the Company to exercise control are taken  
into account.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether 
there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment 
exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in 
a subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair 
value less costs to dispose and the value in use. Fair value is determined 
as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the investment in 
an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. 
If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, 
a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment 
at the recoverable amount. Where an impairment charge has previously 
been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting 
period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no 
longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an 
estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is 
reversed to the income statement to the extent that the increased 
carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed the 
original carrying value.

g) Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as 
a deduction from the proceeds.
h) Financial instruments
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. 
For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents 
include cash, and money market funds. For the purposes of the cash 
flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not 
qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair 
value through profit and loss or available for sale. These are initially 
recognised at fair value, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet 
date, which are classified as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables comprise other receivables and cash and cash 
equivalents at the balance sheet date.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. 
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Financial liabilities
Other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
i) Finance income and finance expense 
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective 
interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Company reduces the 
carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash 
flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and 
continues unwinding the discount as interest income.
j) Taxes
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is 
recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, respectively.
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation 
is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate 
on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. The 
tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance 
sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
Indirect tax 
Indirect tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in indirect tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions or 
receivables where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be 
paid to or received from the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws 
used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. If the receivable is expected to be 
received in more than 12 months from year-end, the receivable is 
discounted and held at its present value. Amounts expected to be 
payable or receivable in more than 12 months are classified as 
non-current assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, as appropriate.
k) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a 
liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

Revolving credit facility
The Group has a revolving credit facility in place for a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million, which was negotiated on 24 November 2010 
with a syndicate of commercial banks, led by Citibank. The facility has been provided to service the general corporate needs of the Group and to fund 
potential acquisitions. All provisions contained in the credit facility documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial and customary terms 
for such finance arrangements and when drawn the spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis points. During 2014, the term of the facility was successfully 
extended to 2017 at a maximum aggregate amount of US$150 million whereby existing lenders opted to take up US$25 million from lenders who 
opted not to extend. At 31 December 2014, none of the funds were drawn under the facility. The shares of all significant subsidiaries have been 
pledged as security for the loan.
16. Financial risk management
The Company has exposure to the following risks through its commercial and financial operations:
a) credit risk; and
b) liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for 
assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk management framework. 
The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market 
conditions and the Company’s activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a 
disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. For cash and cash 
equivalents and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

16. Financial risk management continued
Credit risk arises from loans to two subsidiaries, receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks. The Company’s financial assets 
are with counterparties whom the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. Location of credit risk is determined by physical location  
of the bank branch, customer or counterparty. The maximum allowable term of maturity for any individual security is 12 months. Investment 
counterparties must have a credit rating of at least Baa2 or better by Moody’s Investor Services or BBB by Standard and Poor’s. No more than  
25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the United States of America, 
United Kingdom and Barbados, or in any one industry group. Investments are held mainly in United States dollars and cash and cash equivalents  
in other foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements.
Company policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. The Company’s exposure to credit 
risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Company’s financial assets are with counterparties whom the 
Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each class  
of financial assets in Note 15. The Company does not hold collateral as security for any receivables. The Company does not grade the credit quality  
of receivables.
b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of a 
shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.
The following table outlines the expected maturity of the Company’s significant financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the 
remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. As the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows, these balances may not agree with the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash flow from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from 
settlement of current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Capital risk management
The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio to support its 
business and provide financial flexibility in order to maximise shareholder value. In order to ensure a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio, 
management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive committee before submission 
to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT
165 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Non-IFRS measures
Acacia has identified certain measures in this report that are not 
measures defined under IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures disclosed  
by management are provided as additional information to investors in 
order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing Acacia’s 
financial condition and operating results. These measures are not in 
accordance with, or a substitute for, IFRS, and may be different from  
or inconsistent with non-IFRS financial measures used by other 
companies. These measures are explained further below.
Average realised gold price per ounce sold 
A non-IFRS financial measure which excludes from gold revenue:
• 
Unrealised gains and losses on non-hedge derivative contracts; and
• 
Export duties.
Cash cost per ounce sold
A non-IFRS financial measure. Cash costs include all costs absorbed  
into inventory, as well as royalties, by-product credits and production 
taxes, and exclude capitalised production stripping costs, inventory 
purchase accounting adjustments, unrealised gains/losses from 
non-hedge currency and commodity contracts, depreciation and 
amortisation and corporate social responsibility charges. Cash cost  
is calculated net of co-product revenue.
The presentation of these statistics in this manner allows Acacia to 
monitor and manage those factors that impact production costs on a 
monthly basis. Acacia calculates cash costs based on its equity interest 
in production from its mines. Cash costs per ounce sold are calculated 
by dividing the aggregate of these costs by gold ounces sold. Cash costs 
and cash cost per ounce sold are calculated on a consistent basis for 
the periods presented.
The table below provides a reconciliation between cost of sales and total 
cash cost to calculate the cash cost per ounce sold.

Attributable cash cost per ounce (US$/oz) 732 827
All-in sustaining cost (AISC)
A non-IFRS financial measure. The measure is in accordance with the 
World Gold Council’s guidance issued in June 2013. It is calculated by 
taking the aggregate of cash costs, corporate administration costs, 
reclamation and remediation costs for operating mines, corporate social 
responsibility expenses, mine exploration and study costs, capitalised 
stripping and underground development costs and sustaining capital 
expenditure. This is then divided by the total ounces sold. A reconciliation 
between cash cost per ounce sold and AISC is presented below:

AISC is intended to provide additional information for what the total 
sustaining cost for each ounce sold is, taking into account expenditure 
incurred in addition to direct mining costs, depreciation and selling costs.
EBITDA
A non-IFRS financial measure. Acacia calculates EBITDA as net profit  
or loss for the period excluding:
• 
Income tax expense;
• 
Finance expense;
• 
Finance income;
• 
Depreciation and amortisation; and
• 
Impairment charges of goodwill and other long-lived assets.
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
166 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
GLOSSARY OF TERMS 
CONTINUED EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and 
analysts. It does not have any standardised meaning prescribed by  
IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for 
measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA 
excludes the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes,  
and the effects of changes in operating working capital balances,  
and therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash  
flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies  
may calculate EBITDA differently.
A reconciliation between net profit for the period and EBITDA is 
presented below:
Year ended 
31 December
(US$’000) 2014 2013
Net(loss)/profit for the period 89,935 (798,433)
Plus income tax (credit)/expense 25,977 (187,959)

Plus finance expense 10,081 9,668
Less finance income (1,401) (1,700)
EBITDA 252,716 240,407
1  Depreciation and amortisation includes the depreciation component of the cost 
of inventory sold.
Cash cost per tonne milled
A non-IFRS financial measure. Cash costs include all costs absorbed  
into inventory, as well as royalties, by-product credits and production 
taxes, and exclude capitalised production stripping costs, inventory 
purchase accounting adjustments, unrealised gains/losses from 
non-hedge currency and commodity contracts, depreciation and 
amortisation and corporate social responsibility charges. Cash cost  
is calculated net of co-product revenue. Cash costs per tonne milled are 
calculated by dividing the aggregate of these costs by total tonnes milled. 
Operating cash flow per share
A non-IFRS financial measure, calculated by dividing net cash generated 
by operating activities by the weighted average number of Ordinary 
Shares in issue.
Free cash flow
The net increase/decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year.
Cash from sustaining operations
The cash flow generated post the spend required to sustain the Group 
and its operations. It is calculated as free cash flow adjusted for 
expansionary capital expenditure, exploration, the cash flow associated 
with one-off type items and other charges, and dividends.
Mining statistical information
The following describes certain line items used in the Acacia Group’s 
discussion of key performance indicators:
• 
Open pit material mined – measures in tonnes the total amount  
of open pit ore and waste mined.
• 
Underground ore tonnes hoisted – measures in tonnes the total 
amount of underground ore mined and hoisted.
• 
Total tonnes mined includes open pit material plus underground  
ore tonnes hoisted.
• 
Strip ratio – measures the ratio waste to ore for open pit 
material mined.
• 
Ore milled – measures in tonnes the amount of ore material 
processed through the mill.
• 
Head grade – measures the metal content of mined ore going  
into a mill for processing.
• 
Milled recovery – measures the proportion of valuable metal 
physically recovered in the processing of ore. It is generally stated  
as a percentage of the metal recovered compared to the total metal 
originally present.
• 
Total production costs – measures the total cost of production  
and is an aggregate of total cash costs as well as production  
specific depreciation and amortisation.

167 ACACIA MINING PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2014
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Basis of preparation for the reporting of tax data 
This basis of preparation supports the reporting of tax data contained on 
page 42 of this Annual Report. Generally, the references to “Tax” in this 
context mean any amount of money required to be paid to, or repaid by, 
a Government. 
In overview, the key information presented as regards Tax is as follows:
Taxes borne
These are taxes that the Acacia Group is obliged to pay to a Government 
on its own behalf, or taxes that it is obliged to pay to a third party and 
that can/cannot be recovered from a Government. The main taxes that 
we have included in this category are:
Government royalties
These comprise payments made to Governments in the form of royalties. 
Typically these tend to become payable, and are paid, in the year to 
which they relate. These taxes form part of our operating costs.
Corporate income tax
This comprises any tax on the business calculated on the basis of its 
profits, income or capital gains. Typically, these taxes would be reflected 
in corporate income tax returns made to Governments.
Customs duties
These comprise all customs/excise/import and export duties.  
Typically, these taxes tend to become payable and are paid to 
Governments at the point where goods are imported and exported  
from territories. These taxes form part of our operating and capital 
incurred costs.
Employer payroll taxes
These comprise payroll and employer taxes payable as a result of a 
company’s capacity as an employer. Typically, these taxes would be 
reflected in payroll tax returns made to Governments and tend to be 
payable, and are paid, on a regular basis (often monthly) throughout  
the year shortly after the submission of the return. These taxes form  
part of our operating costs.
Environmental taxes
These comprise levies or other payments to Governments relating to 
environmental policy. Typically, these taxes tend to be payable on an 
annual basis. These taxes are also included in our operating costs.
Indirect taxes
These comprise VAT and other fuel levies that arise on the purchase  
of goods and services and are paid to third parties, to be refunded by 
Governments. Typically, these taxes would form part of a sales tax return 
made to Governments. Refunds received are included in the taxes 
refunded category.
Stamp duty 
This comprises taxes that arise on transfers of assets or capital. 
Typically, these taxes would be reflected in stamp duty returns made to 
Governments and tend to become payable, and are paid, to Governments 
shortly after capital or assets are transferred.
Taxes collected
These are taxes that a company is obliged to collect from others  
and pay to Government. The main taxes that we have included in this 
category are:
Employee payroll taxes
These comprise payroll and employee taxes withheld from employee 
remuneration and paid to Governments, i.e. taxes collected by Acacia and 
remitted to Governments on behalf of employees under arrangements 
such as PAYE schemes. Typically, these taxes would be reflected in 
payroll tax returns made to Governments and tend to be payable, and  
are paid, on a regular basis (often monthly) throughout the year, shortly 
after submission of the return.
Withholding taxes collected from suppliers
These comprise taxes that are required to be withheld in advance on 
payments made to suppliers. Typically, these taxes would be reflected  
in income tax returns made to Governments and tend to be payable, and 
are paid, on a regular basis (often monthly) throughout the year shortly 
after the submission of the return.
Taxes Refunded 
These are taxes that are refunded by Governments to Acacia, and mostly 
comprise the following:
Indirect taxes (mainly VAT and fuel levies)
Typically, indirect taxes would tend to become repayable and are repaid 
by Governments regularly (often quarterly) throughout the year, shortly 
after the submission of relevant sales tax returns. Also included are 
other refunds received.

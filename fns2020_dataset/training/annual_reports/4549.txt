Delivering Growth in Our Focus 
Therapeutic Areas in Europe
Our European Pharmaceuticals Segment 
continues to show progress and achieved 
sales of £168.7 million, an increase of 66.3% 
(at constant exchange rates (“CER”)) over the 
previous year. On a like-for-like basis, adjusting 
2012 to include a full year of Eurovet revenue, 
growth is 5%, despite having been affected 
by slow trading in the third quarter due to bad 
weather, as previously reported. Importantly, 
on a like-for-like basis all key therapeutic areas 
delivered a good performance:
 ❱ Our focus companion animal products 
performed very well increasing by 18.4% 
(at CER), with our key products Vetoryl, 
Felimazole and Cardisure
®
  delivering 
double digit revenue growth.
 ❱ Despite a challenging environment for 
our food producing animal products, 
caused principally by pressure to reduce 
antimicrobials usage due to concerns over 
increasing resistance, we saw modest sales 
growth of our key water soluble antibiotics. 
Total sales for key products in this category 
remained flat due to competition issues on 
Cyclospray
®
  (an aerosol for cattle foot rot).
 ❱ Diets grew by 2.6% (at CER) driven by the 
relaunch of our new wet diet presentation 
and a new intensive support diet for 
animals post-surgery.
The results reflect the successful integration 
of Eurovet. This acquisition has met our 
expectations, expanding our geographical 
footprint in Europe, adding complementary 
products to our companion animal product 
portfolio, providing an entrance into the food 
producing animal market and increasing our 
manufacturing capabilities.
Operating profit for the European 
Pharmaceuticals Segment increased to  
£45.8 million from £28.9 million in the  
prior year.
Strong US Core Performance
Revenues in the US totalled £20.5 million, 
growth of 4.7% (at CER) compared to the 
prior year. Third party supply issues on our 
ophthalmic and dermatology ranges hampered 
the US performance, as previously described in 
our trading update on 10 July 2013. However, 
adjusting for these unexpected circumstances, 
the core sales growth was 10.3% (at CER) 
with Vetoryl continuing to grow at 11.6% and 
Felimazole at 16.3%.
During the year, Dechra Veterinary Products 
US continued to invest in and build its sales 
team in order to reinforce its marketing 
activities and further strengthen relationships 
with veterinarians. As a result the operating 
profit for this Segment was slightly down at 
£5.6 million compared to £5.9 million in 2012.
Strategic Divestment of the Services 
Segment
The divestment of our Services Segment, 
completed post year end on 16 August 2013,  
represents a further step in the Board strategy 
to create a focused pure play specialist 
veterinary pharmaceuticals business. The 
Board believes that the Pharmaceuticals 
businesses are higher margin, cash generative 
businesses, operating in a global market with 
attractive long term growth prospects. 
The net proceeds of the disposal will be 
used initially to reduce Group’s debt but 
provides the Group with additional resources 
to continue its development, both organically 
and through strategic acquisitions.
Increased Investment in Research and 
Development (“R&D”)
In 2013 our Development and Regulatory 
team achieved approvals for:
 ❱ three new products;
 ❱ three line extensions; and
 ❱ three existing products licensed into new 
territories.
At the same time, development of our novel and 
generic products continued; four projects have 
now reached the clinical phase of development. 
We will also file imminetly in the UK and the US 
for a new equine product.
As a specialist veterinary pharmaceuticals 
business, the Board has decided to increase the 
Group’ s focus and investment in R&D as a key 
driver of future growth and profitability.
Net Debt
As expected our net borrowing position  
at the end of the financial year improved 
compared to 2012, reducing from £86.7 
million to £80.8 million.

a cash generative specialist veterinary 
pharmaceuticals business which will:
 ❱ expand our geographical footprint;

continue to perform well despite a challenging 
environment and that our strategy will deliver 
enhanced Shareholder value.

What We Do
DVP EU markets and sells Dechra’s veterinary 
products throughout Europe and exports to 
over 40 countries worldwide. The business has 
an operating board of six senior managers, 
and is managed from Bladel, the Netherlands, 
Sansaw, UK, and Uldum, Denmark. In total, 
DVP EU employs 318  people. Inventory is 
managed through a central distribution centre 
in Uldum, Denmark.  
DVP EU has sales operations in 12 countries; 
Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, 
Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, 
Spain, Sweden and the UK, each run by 
regional country managers. DVP EU also 
exports to other European countries such 
as Austria, Italy and Poland, and across the 
globe to Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Middle 
East and the Far East. 
The key products in the DVP EU portfolio are 
predominantly companion animal products; 
however, with the acquisition of Eurovet, the 
range has expanded into the food producing 
animal market. During the year we have 
integrated the expertise and products from 
Eurovet and have continued to develop the 
Dechra brand across Europe. This drive to 
grow the brand will continue in the future with 
the launch of new products from the pipeline, 
an increased technical and educational 
programme, and expansion into  
new markets.
Our Market
Our customers are principally veterinarians; 
however, in some territories the route 
to market is through wholesalers and 
pharmacies. Our products are distributed 
through a mixture of our own direct sales, 
wholesalers and national distributor channels. 
When critical mass within a country is 
reached, and whenever financially beneficial, 
local sales operations are established. We 
look to build teams with local knowledge who 
can draw from Dechra’s technical expertise 
across the Group.
Our Expertise 
In order to forge relationships with customers, 
technical dinners and seminars are held to 
provide a face-to-face programme to educate 
veterinarians on our key therapeutic sectors. 
Key opinion leaders, at both local and 
international levels, are recruited for seminars 
and presentations; additionally, webinars 
and online interactive educational tools are 
available on the DVP EU website. 
We have identified eight core therapeutic 
categories where we leverage our expertise: 
endocrinology, dermatology, ophthalmology, 
equine, cardiovascular, analgesia and critical 
care, diets/nutrition, and antibiotics for food 
producing animals. As well as novel products, 
DVP EU also produces generic products and 
specialist, therapeutic and maintenance pet 
diets.
“Our customers are 
principally veterinarians; 
however, in some 
territories the route 
to market is through 
wholesalers and 
pharmacies.”

Looking Forward
DVP EU is performing strongly in the three 
major European markets. The UK was the 
fastest growing EU market during the year, 
France and Germany also saw solid growth. 
DVP EU’s export business is also expanding 
in markets around the world. In endocrinology, 
an important therapeutic sector, Vetoryl, 
Felimazole and Forthyron
®
 are key growth 
drivers as we gain marketing approval in an 
increasing number of countries. 
Other key products include the broad 
dermatology range, including Fuciderm
®
, 
Malaseb, Canaural 
®
and the DermaPet range. 
Cardisure, a generic product in DVP EU’s 
cardiovascular category, shows significant 
potential, as does Comfortan
®
, a recently 
approved product, in the analgesic category. 
Over ten technical seminars were held to 
introduce Comfortan to veterinarians in the 
UK, a total of 865 veterinarians attended, 
demonstrating a strong interest in this 
product. 
Across all territories the business is committed 
to developing new products and services that 
support the work of veterinarians. We will be 
expanding the Dechra brand through newly 
established subsidiaries within the EU and 
we will continue to develop our international 
presence through strong relationships with 
key partners.

heart of the ‘Animal Health Corridor’, which 
is the world’s largest concentration of animal 
health businesses.
Led by an operating board of four  
senior managers, DVP US comprises 42 
employees, 26 of whom are field-based 
sales representatives responsible for around 
1,000 clinics each. The rest of the team 
consists of marketing professionals, in-house

support staff and a customer service team.
Our Market
Our customers are primarily small animal 
and equine veterinarians, of which there are

clinics across the country. DVP US provides 
products that solve clinical problems and 
help veterinarians treat medical conditions,  
thereby building their business.
DVP US currently only markets companion 
animal and equine products; it is estimated 
that there are around 80 million dogs and 
95 million cats in the US at present and pet 
ownership is increasing. The animal health 
market is approximately $15 billion, out 
of a total US spend of $50 billion on pets. 
Spending in the pet market is recovering 
since the decline seen in the recent global 
financial crisis. It is now beginning to build, 
with industry experts predicting an annual 
growth rate of 3% to 5%.

In the US, veterinarians and clinics are 
primarily supplied through distributors. Our 
sales representatives promote and sell 
products directly, but also network and 
visit clinics together with these distributors. 
Becoming increasingly important are 
corporate pet hospitals, such as Banfield and 
Veterinary Centers of America (“VCAs”) which 
are consolidating the market and delivering 
good growth. 
Our Expertise
To increase knowledge of Dechra  
products to all key customers, technical 
Continuing Education (“CE”) meetings, 
attended by veterinarians, are being 
leveraged. Product awareness and knowledge 
is established in a face-to-face environment, 
key opinion leaders and influencers then 
share their increased knowledge of Dechra’s 
products to a wider audience. 
The product portfolio of DVP US currently 
includes 11 NADA approvals (with 20 different 
package sizes) and 50 products that are 
non-regulated. We have niche market leading 
positions in veterinary endocrinology, veterinary 
dermatology and topical dermatology.
Our Dechra brand has gained momentum 
in the US, building on our strong reputation 
for customer service, the quality of an 
expanding product portfolio, further education 
programmes on our key areas of specialisation 
and high quality technical support.
Looking Forward
Several products in the development pipeline 
will ensure the continued organic growth of 
our US business. Commensurate with this 
growth, we will continue to invest in the sales 
and marketing infrastructure to develop a 
stronger US presence and improved contact 
with veterinarians.

Key Products and Specialisations
Historically , Dechra’ s product range was entirely focused on companion animals and 
horses. However , the acquisition of Eurovet has given the Group a significant and 
strategically important platform in the food producing animal product market. The majority 
of key products in both the companion animal and food producing animal markets are 
novel or have clear marketing advantages over competitor products. Several of our branded 
ranges have market leading positions in the majority of territories in which we operate.
Dermatology and Care
Dermatology represents approximately 20% of veterinarians’ 
clinical time and is currently a major focus area for the industry. 
Best practice and management techniques look to adopt more 
topical products, as opposed to oral treatments, with the aim 
of utilising antibiotics more appropriately. Dechra’s product 
portfolio, with its range of licensed and non-licensed topical 
products, is well positioned for this approach.
Canaural was first licensed in 1975 and is still the leading first 
line treatment for otitis externa in cats and dogs in several EU 
territories. Canaural, which is now registered in 27 countries, 
can also be used in conjunction with our leading ear cleaning 
product CleanAural
®
.
Fuciderm, licensed in 1995, is the only licensed product for 
the treatment of surface pyoderma in dogs, such as acute 
moist dermatitis and intertrigo. It is a key product within our 
dermatology range, selling into 23 countries.
Malaseb, was first licensed in 1996 and is still the market leading 
medicated shampoo for cats and dogs. It is used to treat skin 
diseases caused by Malassezia and staphylococcal infections.
Animax, licensed for the treatment of skin conditions in dogs 
and cats, is only approved in the United States. The marketing 
rights for this product were acquired in May 2007. This product 
is currently unavailable due to third party supply issues.
DermaPet, acquired in October 2010, is a range of shampoos, 
conditioners and ear products to treat numerous skin and ear 
conditions in dogs and cats. Key brands are Triz, MalAcetic and 
Malaket.
The Care range comprises unlicensed products which 
complement our pharmaceutical range. They are available over 
the counter within veterinary practices. The three key products 
are CleanAural, a non-irritant cleaner suitable for frequent use 
in ears producing excess wax, Neutrale™, a range of specialist 
shampoos for skin conditions in dogs, and Lubrithal
®
, an eye 
lubricant for cats and dogs.
Ophthalmology 
Ophthalmology is an area of veterinary medicine where 
we have a number of leading products including licensed 
pharmaceuticals, unlicensed care products and instruments.
Fucithalmic
®
 Vet, licensed in 1993, is the only licensed product 
available for the treatment of conjunctivitis associated with 
staphylococcal infections. It is highly effective because of its 
unique sustained release formulation that ensures prolonged 
retention within the eye. It is currently licensed in 21 countries.
Additionally, we market a range of ophthalmic products 
in the USA. There are six products in the range, with the 
majority being the only veterinary licensed products in the US 
market. These products are currently unavailable due to third 
party supply issues; however, we anticipate relaunch in the 
2013/2014 financial year.

Equine Medicine 
The Group has a wide range of licensed products supporting 
the equine veterinarian. The leading product with the highest 
sales is Equipalazone
®
 which is licensed in five major EU 
countries.
Equipalazone was first licensed in a sachet presentation in 
1972 and subsequently in paste and injection presentations. It 
continues to be the leading non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(“NSAID”) for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, such 
as lameness arising from acute and chronic laminitis in horses.
Equidone Gel was approved in 2010 for the treatment of fescue 
toxicity in horses. This niche product is targeted specifically at 
the US market.
HY-50 is used for intra-articular and intravenous treatment of 
lameness in horses caused by joint dysfunction. The acquisition 
of this product, in January 2012, strengthened Dechra’s position 
in equine pain management in several major European territories.
Domidine
®
 is an injectable used for the sedation and slight 
analgesia of horses and cattle, to facilitate physical examinations 
and treatment, such as minor surgical interventions.
Endocrinology 
Endocrine disorders are a key focus for the business with a 
number of unique licensed products treating a range of chronic 
diseases. The three leading brands are Vetoryl, Forthyron and 
Felimazole.
Vetoryl is a novel product for the treatment of Cushing’s 
syndrome (excess cortisol or hyperadrenocorticism) in dogs. It 
is marketed internationally and is the only recognised licensed 
efficacious veterinary product for the treatment of Cushing’s 
syndrome around the world.
Forthyron is licensed to treat the most widely recognised 
endocrine disorder, canine hypothyroidism. It is the only 
mutually recognised levothyroxine treatment in Europe and is 
marketed in all the major European countries.
Felimazole was the first veterinary licensed product for the 
treatment of feline hyperthyroidism. Originally licensed in the UK 
in 2002, Felimazole was then licensed in the EU in 2005, the US 
in 2009 and has subsequently been approved in Canada.
Analgesia and Critical Care 
Dechra has a wide range of products that support emergency 
medicine, pain relief and sedation.
The Vetivex range of infusion fluids are licensed for the treatment 
of dehydration. They are widely used to meet normal fluid and 
electrolyte requirements when fluids cannot be given orally, such 
as during surgery.
Sedation and analgesia are major sub-groups of critical care. 
Dechra, enhanced by the Eurovet acquisition, markets one of 
the largest ranges of products in this sector. The range covers 
a wide number of species, different degrees of pain intensity 
management and duration of effect. Within the range there are 
a number of unique licenses, Intra Epicaine
®
, a local anaesthetic 
recommended for infiltration, nerve block, intra-articular and 
epidural anaesthesia in horses, Comfortan, the only licensed 
methadone hydrochloride for analgesia in dogs and Fentadon
®
, 
the only licensed fentanyl for intra-operative analgesia and post-
operative pain management.
Atipam
®
 is a selective a2-antagonist receptor which reverses 
the sedative effects of medetomidine and dexmedetomidine in 
cats and dogs.
Sedator
®
 is licensed for sedation, analgesia and anaesthetic 
premedication and contains the active ingredient medetomidine 
hydrochloride.
Other products in the range include Buprenodale
® 
(buprenorphine), Ketamin (ketamine hydrochloride) and Plegicil 
(acepromazine maleate).

Key Products and Specialisations continued
Generics 
Several generic products are registered within the United 
Kingdom; this basket of products is marketed under the Dechra 
Veterinary Essentials
®
 brand. A number of products are also 
registered in Europe; we are in the process of in-licensing and 
registering additional products to expand our branded generic 
range within this territory. 
Cardiovascular 
This is a new area of focus following the acquisition of Eurovet.  
Cardisure is the leading product in this category. The principal 
ingredient in Cardisure is pimobendan. It is a leading treatment for 
canine congestive heart failure and is marketed throughout Europe.
Food Producing Animal
Antimicrobials
Dechra has a superior range of antimicrobial treatment products 
predominantly for swine and poultry. In a market where there 
is increased emphasis on reducing the usage of antibiotics in 
the food producing animal sector, it is essential that reliable 
and effective products are available to veterinarians to support 
them in the prudent use of antibiotics. The Solustab
®
 range has 
been specifically developed to meet this need and is renowned 
for its high level of solubility leading to a reliable and stable 
product when added to drinking water. This reduces the need for 
additional enhancing agents widely used by competitor products.
Octacillin
®
, marketed since 2003 in the Netherlands, is sold 
in 15 European countries following approvals in 2006 and 
2011. Octacillin is a highly soluble and stable antibiotic powder 
containing amoxicillin which is added to drinking water in the 
treatment of diseases in swine and poultry.
Soludox
®
, marketed in Benelux since 2002, is a highly soluble 
antibiotic powder for administration via drinking water and 
is currently sold in 16 EU countries as a result of approval, 
in 2010, for swine and chickens. The active ingredient is 
doxycycline.
Methoxasol
®
, is a ready to use liquid medication, which can 
be easily added to the drinking water of swine and poultry; it 
has been marketed in the Netherlands since the mid 1990s. 
Following successful European procedures in 2000, 2009 and 
most recently in 2012, this highly soluble liquid is marketed in 15 
EU countries. The active ingredients are sulphamethoxasol and 
trimethoprim, a proven synergistic combination for antimicrobial 
effectiveness.
Cyclospray is the leading antibiotic spray treatment in Europe 
for claw/hoof infections, interdigital dermatitis (foot rot) in sheep 
and digital dermatitis in cattle. It is widely used in the prevention 
of infection of superficial traumatic or surgical wounds in cattle, 
sheep and pigs. Cyclospray has been marketed since 2000 in 
12 EU countries. The active ingredient is chlortetracycline.
Pet Diets
Dechra has two main cat and dog diet product ranges, both 
branded Specific
®
, which are sold exclusively through veterinary 
practices. Therapeutic diets, which represent approximately 
70% of overall diet sales, provide optimum levels of nutrition in 
areas such as diabetes, arthritis and urinary, kidney, liver and 
heart problems. Life stage diets, which represent approximately 
30% of diet sales, provide premium quality daily nutrition for 
healthy dogs and cats.

What We Do
Dechra Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing 
(“DPM”) produces the vast majority of Dechra’ s 
pharmaceuticals and also manufactures for third 
parties on a contract basis. The key strategic 
objective of manufacturing is to efficiently and 
economically produce Dechra’ s veterinary 
pharmaceuticals product range, maintaining a 
robust and reliable supply chain for the Group, 
and to contribute revenue and profit to the 
Group from third party manufacturing.
Our Sites
After the Eurovet acquisition, DPM operated 
out of three sites based in Skipton, England, 
Bladel, the Netherlands, and Uldum, Denmark. 
Since then, the focus of DPM has been to 
integrate the sites, ensuring their processes 
and reporting are consistent so that the most 
effective manufacturing capabilities are available 
to DPM’ s internal and external customers. 
The small site at Uldum will be closed by the 
end of the 2013 calendar year, as part of this 
restructuring with its two key products being 
transferred to Skipton. The Skipton and Bladel 
management teams have worked closely 
together to pool their skills and technical 
capabilities to standardise procedures and 
improve quality systems across the Group. 
Work has also been ongoing in improving the 
lean processes and to introduce a standard 
ERP system across the whole of DPM.
Skipton
The site at Skipton employs 215 people, 
and offers a comprehensive range of 
pharmaceutical manufacturing and packing 
services, predominantly for companion 
animals. The site is dual-licensed to produce 
both veterinary and human products. The 
site includes a Pharmaceutical Development 
Laboratory, a Routine QC (Quality Control) 
Laboratory and a Stability Testing and 
Validation Laboratory; these play a significant 
part in the new product development 
programme and are necessary for new product 
introductions.
Bladel
The site at Bladel, acquired as part of 
Eurovet, employs 120 people. The operation 
complements the existing Dechra capabilities; 
the site predominantly manufactures 
products for food producing animals in large 
scale batches. This site also has an aseptic 
manufacturing facility to produce sterile 
injections, a new competence in DPM’s 
manufacturing portfolio.

Manufacturing Strengths and Capabilities continued
“DPM will continue to 
support new product 
development and the 
increasingly important 
product pipeline.”
Our Expertise
DPM’s primary expertise is its ability to perform 
a wide range of services which delivers the 
flexibility that the veterinary market requires 
and provides a one-stop shop for its external 
customers. Furthermore, it offers a wide 
range of dosage forms and packaging 
capabilities and also supports the Group with 
the Pharmaceutical Development Laboratory 
which is integrated and aligned with our 
manufacturing capabilities.
One-stop Shop
DPM offers an end-to-end service; from 
formulation, method validation, stability 
testing, licensing support, flexibility in scale 
of production and packaging options to take 
products to market. The supply chain for the 
majority of products is short and we offer 
reliable high service levels with exceptional 
quality control throughout.
Production Capabilities
DPM has a wide range of capabilities in terms 
of dosage form, packaging capabilities and 
production scale. We can produce high, 
medium and low volumes of almost all dosage 
forms and have great flexibility in producing 
to demand. Dosage forms include: tablets, 
capsules, creams, ointments, gels, sterile 
injectables, low volume and high volume 
powders and pre-medicated feeds. We can 
pack into sachets, tubs, bags, capsules, 
tubes, bottles and jars. These capabilities are 
very important for the production of veterinary 
products where our licensed portfolio comes in 
many dosage formats and in various scales of 
batch size. Relative to human pharmaceuticals, 
veterinary batch runs are often very small. 
A number of our licensed branded minor 
products, although highly profitable, are of such 
a small scale that it would be difficult to find a 
third party manufacturer to produce them at a 
competitive price if we were unable to perform 
the function in-house.
Product Development
The Pharmaceutical Development Laboratory 
is integrated with our production capabilities. 
The primary objective is to formulate and 
validate products for our in-house pipeline 
which is a major benefit to the Group in 
order to shorten the time to get a product 
to market. Our technical expertise and 
development capabilities are also outsourced 
to third party customers which helps to 
secure new business.
Contract Manufacturing
In addition to manufacturing our own products, 
both Skipton and Bladel generate income 
through contract manufacturing. Although 
the clear focus is on Group manufacturing, 
we still seek to increase our third party sales; 
currently approximately 50% of Skipton’s and 
approximately 10% of Bladel’s output by value 
is contract manufacturing. The external offering 
includes product development, formulation, 
trial manufacturing, validation, production and 
packaging for both human and veterinary 
pharmaceuticals.
Looking Forward
Over the coming years the in-house production 
strategy will continue. There are currently no 
significant capacity constraints; therefore, we 
will continue to pursue profitable third party 
business. DPM will continue to support new 
product development and the increasingly 
important product pipeline. Manufacturing 
will also continue to maximise effectiveness 
and efficiency and improve productivity whilst 
constantly adapting our quality, health and 
safety and environmental systems.

Regulatory Affairs
The Product Development and Regulatory 
Affairs (“PDRA)” team develops and licenses 
Dechra’s own branded veterinary product 
portfolio of novel and generic pharmaceuticals. 
Additionally, the team manages post-approval 
adverse event reporting, periodic product 
renewals and other activities required to 
maintain the product approvals.
The team of 52 people are split into 
European Regulatory Affairs, US Regulatory 
Affairs, Pharmaceutical Development and 
Product Development. They work at four 
locations: Overland Park, USA, Sansaw, 
England, Skipton, England, and Bladel, the 
Netherlands. The team includes veterinarians, 
formulation chemists, pharmacists, 
analysts, clinical trial managers and product 
development managers.
Product development process
Although some products may have a slightly 
different path, most novel and generic 
products follow a fairly standard process 
which contains five phases which Dechra 
defines as: Exploratory, Pre-Clinical, Clinical, 
File/Submission and Launch.
Dechra employs a structured process in 
its development pipeline however retains 
an opportunistic and entrepreneurial 
approach. Focus is given to the Group’s 
therapeutic specialisations: endocrinology, 
equine medicine, analgesia and critical 
care, cardiovascular, ophthalmology, 
and antimicrobials for food producing 
animals. New development opportunities 
and in-license opportunities are evaluated 
for strategic fit within these categories; 
therapeutics outside of the key areas are 
considered for inclusion in the pipeline if they

are novel and address unmet needs in the 
veterinary market.
A product’s return on investment can vary: 
novel developments tend to have a mid to 
long term realisation with attractive high value 
returns; generic developments generally have 
shorter development timescales with returns 
dependent upon the number of generic 
entrants and speed to market relative to 
competition. Dechra’s current development 
pipeline is a mix of short, medium and long 
term opportunities.
The Exploratory phase begins with identifying 
a novel molecule, an opportunity to develop 
a new formulation for an existing molecule, or 
an in-license opportunity. Before initiating a 
development programme, each opportunity 
is assessed by market need, market value, 
therapeutic indications, strategic fit and the 
likely complexity of the regulatory pathway.
The second phase of the process is Pre-
Clinical, which involves the collection 
of a range of preliminary data. When 
initiating development of a novel product, 
the correct dose has to be titrated and 
a stable formulation, that can be reliably 
and consistently manufactured, must be 
developed. For a generic product, the 
pioneer formulation may not meet the current 
regulatory requirements and may need to 
be reformulated. This phase is vital prior to 
initiating the clinical phase which involves 
expensive clinical trials or bio equivalency 
studies.
The Clinical phase is the longest part of the 
process, potentially taking two or three years. 
After the formulation has been demonstrated 
to be stable, two to three pilot batches are 
manufactured for use in safety studies, 
efficacy studies and stability testing. For 
generic products, the batches are used 
in one or more bio equivalency studies to 
demonstrate that activity will replicate the 
pioneer product. If the studies conducted 
during the Clinical phase demonstrate the 
required safety, efficacy and chemical stability 
of the product, regulatory dossiers are 
prepared for submission.
From beginning to end, this process takes on 
average between three and five years.
Our Expertise
The PDRA team includes skilled people with 
expertise in spotting niche opportunities, 
and the experience to navigate the hurdles 
of the development process. Across the four 
locations, project teams operate to tackle the 
wide range of projects. Investment in state-
of-the-art laboratories in Bladel and Skipton, 
each with their respective dosage form 
expertise, provides the resources required to 
develop novel and generic formulations cost 
effectively.
We believe our integrated and entrepreneurial 
approach to product development successfully 
delivers new products effectively and efficiently 
in the shortest possible time frame.

Product Pipeline
Our product pipeline is critical to our future success. Our novel and generics projects 
are very diverse, with the majority building on our key therapy areas. We invest when 
we can identify growth opportunities with a clear financial return focusing on novel 
therapies to treat unmet needs with intellectual property protection. Our approach 
ensures we create sustainable growth throughout our targeted global markets.
Low Risk Strategy
There are various stage gates throughout the life of a development project where progress is reviewed and decisions are taken on 
whether to continue or not. Development is inherently risky and our stepped approach mitigates the risk of a costly failure.
Wide Range of Projects
In addition to the projects shown below, there are several other exploratory projects, line extensions, territory expansions and life 
cycle management projects. There is also an ongoing programme that renews and redevelops the Specific range of pet diets.

Your questions answered
with Ian Page, Chief Executive Officer
Chief Executive Officer’s Q&A
Q
Why did Dechra decide to sell the 
Services businesses?
The Group strategy has been clear for 
several years; to develop a high margin, 
cash generative veterinary pharmaceutical 
and products business. Within this strategy 
there is clearly no place for the Services 
businesses. Historically, the Services 
businesses were the strongest part of the 
Group both in terms of turnover and profit, 
but as the years have progressed, and we 
have developed our pharmaceutical business, 
that contribution has diminished.
What actually triggered the transaction was 
a firm offer from Patterson. Patterson have a 
sole focus on Services; we believe that they 
will secure the future of the staff within the 
Services businesses and also continue to 
excel in performance at providing high levels 
of service to customers. So these factors, 
along with the firm offer, meant that we 
believed it was a strong win-win position for 
both parties.
Q
How does the sale of the Services 
businesses impact Group strategy going 
forward?
The Group strategy has not changed at 
all. If anything, the sale of the Services 
businesses has allowed us to have an 
even clearer focus on our core strategy; 
furthermore, the proceeds of the sale have 
strengthened our balance sheet considerably. 
The consequences of which are that we 
now have the capabilities to look at further 
acquisitions if they become available to us 
in the future, and also we are able to put 
a little bit more investment in our product 
development pipeline, which will strengthen 
the opportunities for future growth.

Q
Has the Eurovet integration progressed 
according to plan and has it fulfilled all 
your expectations?
It has definitely fulfilled our expectations. It 
has extended our geography, particularly 
into Germany; strengthened our companion 
animal product portfolio; enhanced our 
manufacturing capabilities and also moved 
us into the livestock sector, which is a very 
important area for us to be involved in, 
as we look at our international expansion 
opportunities.
In terms of the integration, it has delivered 
all the expected synergies to date of both 
revenue and cost nature; we expect it to 
continue to deliver further revenue synergies 
over the next couple of years.
Q
When will the product development 
pipeline start to deliver significant new 
products?
The product pipeline has actually delivered 
products year on year now for several 
years, both pharmaceuticals and diets. The 
next major product was expected to be an 
equine lameness product but unfortunately 
this was delayed due to third party contract 
manufacturing issues. However, we have 
now resolved the issues and we expect 
the product to appear within the next 12 
months within one or two major territories. 
Behind that, there is an extensive list of novel 
products that we have in development, so 
hopefully we should see at least one of these 
products appearing per year from 2014 
onwards.
Q
What are your expectations for the 
business in the medium and long term?
The world’s animal health markets are 
continuing to show growth. The companion 
animal markets remain strong in North 
America and Western Europe, and the 
livestock markets continue to increase in 
the developing world where there is a high 
demand for animal protein. So overall we 
are in a very strong position to deliver good 
organic growth with our existing portfolio 
but additionally, as I have already outlined, 
we have a very strong product development 
pipeline which will enhance that growth. We 
are looking at new countries to establish a 
presence; global expansion is high on our 
agenda; furthermore, with our strong balance 
sheet, we will hopefully be able to find one 
or two acquisitions to bolster the Group as 
a whole. So, all in all, we are in a very strong 
position to cement ourselves as one of the 
top ten global animal health companies.

The sale of the Services business is a significant step  
forward in achieving our clearly defined strategic objective.
Introduction
Strategically it has been a momentous 
year with the successful integration of 
Eurovet, acquired in May 2012, and with 
the transformational effect of the divestment 
of the Services businesses. Dechra is now 
entirely focused on developing, manufacturing 
and marketing high margin, cash generative 
veterinary pharmaceuticals and related 
products across global markets. From 
a trading perspective, a strong first half 
performance was partially offset by a poor 
third quarter, impacted by adverse weather 
and ongoing third party supply problems 
within the US. However, trading remained 
robust, with our key branded in-house 
manufactured products performing strongly. 
The acquisition of Eurovet has fulfilled 
our expectations. It has expanded our 
geographical coverage, especially in 
Germany; enhanced our manufacturing 
capabilities; added complementary products 
to our companion animal portfolio and 
provided an entrance into food producing 
animal pharmaceuticals. The food producing 
animal sector is particularly important as we 
look at opportunities to expand internationally. 
The companion animal market is not sufficient 
in scale in many countries outside of the EU 
and North America to merit our own presence 
solely with our current specialist product 
portfolio. Furthermore, the ever increasing 
demand for high quality meat protein from 
emerging markets is creating a strong global 
livestock market. Further details of the 
Eurovet integration are provided within the EU 
Pharmaceuticals Segment review.

The sale of the Services businesses, 
National Veterinary Services (“NVS”
®
) and 
the Laboratories, is a significant step forward 
in our clearly defined strategic objective 
of developing an international specialist 
veterinary pharmaceuticals business. 
Historically, the strong cash generation of 
NVS has helped to fund the growth of the 
Pharmaceuticals Segments. However, as the 
years have progressed, the Pharmaceuticals 
Segments have gained sufficient critical 
mass to fund their own development and the 
Services businesses became strategically 
less and less relevant year on year. The 
businesses have been sold to Patterson 
Companies, Inc. for £87.5 million on a debt 
free, cash free basis. 
The Board believes this is a fair valuation for 
businesses that have experienced increasing 
margin pressure over recent years as the 
customer base consolidates with the growth 
of corporate veterinary practice groups. We 
also recognise that Patterson is an ideal 
company to secure the future of the staff and 
take the businesses forward. 
“Eurovet has fulfilled 
our expectations and 
provided an entrance 
into food producing 
animal pharmaceuticals.”

Product Development
The product development pipeline continues 
to deliver: 
1. new products for global markets:
 ❱ Methoxasol, an antimicrobial for swine and 
poultry has been approved in the EU;
 ❱ Buprenodale, a multi-dose small animal 
analgesic, has received authorisation 
throughout the EU; and
 ❱ Anesketin, a generic companion animal 
sedative, has been approved in seven EU 
countries.
2. line extensions:
 ❱ Soludox, our water soluble antibiotic for 
swine and poultry, has a new indication for 
turkeys in the EU;
 ❱ Felimazole 1.25mg, a new low dose 
strength to increase dosing options has 
been approved throughout the EU; and
 ❱ Comfortan, a companion animal analgesic 
has received an extension to its approval 
for use in cats.
3. registrations in new territories:
 ❱ Libromide, used in the treatment of canine 
epilepsy, has had its EU registration 
extended into France, Austria, Portugal 
and Switzerland;
 ❱ Felimazole, for feline hyperthyroidism, has 
been approved in Australia; and
 ❱ Vetoryl, for the treatment of canine 
Cushing’s syndrome, has been approved in 
South Korea, Brazil and New Zealand.
The Methoxasol and Soludox registrations 
extend our portfolio of food producing animal 
antimicrobial products which will provide 
new opportunities in this competitive market. 
The Comfortan, Buprenodale and Anesketin 
approvals give us the widest and most 
complete range of analgesics and sedatives 
of any animal health company within the EU. 
This further strengthens our position as a 
market leader in critical care. The Felimazole 
1.25mg registration increases dosing 
options which allows veterinarians to better 
manage feline hyperthyroidism where each 
cat requires its own specific dosing regime. 
The introduction also further differentiates us 
from a generic version of the drug which has 
recently been launched in a number of EU 
territories.
There has been material progress on our 
novel product pipeline. We have previously 
reported that the first major product launch, 
an equine lameness product, to be branded 
Osphos
®
, had experienced delays due to 
an enforced change to a new third party 
manufacturer. We anticipate making a 
submission for registration of this product in 
the UK, Canada and Australia imminently. As 
the horse, in the majority of the EU, is classed 
as a food producing species we are currently 
“There has been material 
progress on our novel 
pipeline.”

conducting work to establish a maximum 
residue level prior to submission for approval 
throughout the rest of Europe. In the US the 
product already has complete safety and 
efficacy sections from the FDA. The Chemistry 
and Manufacturing Controls (“CMC”) section, 
the final requirement for the US submission, is 
dependent upon a successful FDA inspection 
of the third party manufacturing site. 
A second major product, for a canine 
endocrine disorder, was originally intended to 
be manufactured by a third party. However, 
following ongoing external supply problems 
and the successful FDA approval of our own 
site in Skipton for solid oral dosage forms, 
a strategic decision was made to invest in 
manufacturing in-house wherever possible. 
The necessary equipment has been acquired 
and validated at our Skipton site and the pilot 
batch has been manufactured. The clinical trial 
is at an advanced stage with all the dogs now 
enrolled and initial results are very positive.
There are an additional six novel products 
in the development pipeline, three of which 
have long term patent protection: four novel 
products are for the global market and two 
are targeted specifically at the EU. There 
are also three major differentiated generic 
products for food producing animals under 
development. A potential twelfth product 
is at an advanced stage of assessment for 
inclusion in the programme.
We anticipate a further two clinical trials to 
commence within the new calendar year.
In addition to the novel products in 
development we have several generics, 
territory expansion and range extending 
products in development. Furthermore, we 
have a number of exploratory ideas to pursue.

Revenue from this segment increased by  
61.0% (66.3% at constant currency) compared 
to last year. On a like-for-like basis, including 
the contribution from the Eurovet business, 
revenue grew by approximately 5%.
DVP EU
The initial objectives of the integration of 
Eurovet have been achieved within the year:
 ❱ Closure and restructuring of duplicate sales 
and marketing offices and teams in the UK, 
Benelux and Denmark;
 ❱ Dechra products launched in Germany 
through the newly acquired subsidiary with 
a smooth transition and retention of market 
share following the termination of the prior 
distribution agreement;
 ❱ The majority of the Eurovet companion 
animal products have been transferred to 
Dechra’s own sales organisation in France;
 ❱ Eurovet’s major swine and poultry products 
have been launched for the first time in 
France;
 ❱ All Eurovet products have been 
transitioned ready for launch into Norway, 
Finland and Sweden in the first quarter of 
the new financial year;
 ❱ Manufacturing rationalisation is underway, 
further details of which are provided later in 
this report; and
 ❱ Management teams have been 
successfully integrated creating a new 
operating board.
This first phase of integration has progressed 
in line with our strategy and is delivering the 
expected cost and revenue synergies.
Despite a very slow third quarter following the 
prolonged bad winter weather, pharmaceutical 
sales for the full year increased by approximately 
5% on a comparable basis. There were big 
variations in performance on a territory by 
territory basis with the UK, France, Germany 
and Iberia performing well, and the Netherlands 
and Nordics underperforming. The underlying 
performance of our key strategic licensed 
veterinary products was robust. Our own 
branded pharmaceuticals grew by 5.1% at 
constant currency; growth was delivered across 
all key therapeutic sectors. Food producing 
animal antibiotic usage remains under review 
in a number of EU markets due to concerns 
regarding antimicrobial resistance; however, we 
still saw overall growth in this sector in all markets 
other than Belgium and the Netherlands. Our 
Specific pet diets grew by 2.6% at constant 
currency; this growth was assisted by the 
relaunch of a new presentation of our wet diet 
range and also by the introduction of a new 
intensive support diet for animals in rehabilitation 
post-surgery.
As the enlarged product portfolio now has 
three areas of focus, food producing animal 
products, companion animal products and 
companion animal diets, a new strategy has 
been developed to give the sales and marketing 
teams across Europe clear direction. In our 
key therapeutic areas, where Dechra has a 
substantial market position, a strong reputation 
and an in-depth knowledge and expertise 
have been better defined and prioritised. Clear 
focus on these therapeutic sectors will allow 
us to target our marketing support and provide 
sales team prioritisation and also provide a 
structure to support key pipeline products 
which fit into these therapeutic segments. T wo 
distinct marketing teams have been created, 
one focusing on food producing animal and 
equine products, the other on companion 
animal products and diets. We are already 
seeing the benefits of improving the alignment of 
diets with companion animal pharmaceuticals. 
Our allergy diet range was promoted as part 
of a dermatological campaign, one of our key 
therapeutic categories, which resulted in strong 
sales growth. Furthermore, a key account 
management structure has been implemented 
to focus on swine, poultry and equine as the 
veterinarians within these sectors have become 
very specialised and work increasingly in a 
concentrated number of practices.

Case Study
Felimazole European
Marketing Campaign
Felimazole was the first veterinary licensed product for the treatment of feline hyperthyroidism. Originally licensed in the 
UK in 2002, it has since been approved in the EU, US and Canada, becoming a key Dechra product. However, the feline 
hyperthyroidism market is now highly competitive, with Dechra’s market share coming under pressure from alternative 
products.
In order to protect and strengthen Dechra’s position in this market, an international marketing campaign has been 
commissioned to reposition Felimazole. The objective is to highlight the benefits of Felimazole creatively through emotionally 
engaging communications, and to position Dechra as the European expert in endocrinology.
The campaign’s theme reflects the key benefit of the product, namely restoring balance to a cat by flexible dosing options.  
By visualising this in dramatic imagery, the campaign draws attention to the positive effects that Felimazole can have on the 
hyperthyroid cat and demonstrates that the poise and precision that hyperthyroidism can take away, can be restored.
The integrated campaign delivers a range of support for the veterinarian, pet owner and sales teams. It includes awareness 
generating press and banner advertising, flowcharts for diagnosis and treatment, sales aid, booklets and a loyalty pack. Key 
opinion leader-written case studies, articles and Academy learning will follow.
The campaign will be launched in Germany and the UK in September, with France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and the 
Nordics to follow in January 2014.

Manufacturing
Following the Eurovet acquisition our 
manufacturing sites were rebranded as 
Dechra Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing. After 
a detailed review of our capabilities following 
this acquisition, it was decided to close the 
manufacturing facility in Uldum, Denmark. 
This site only produced two major prescription 
products which have now been successfully 
transferred into Skipton. The care range of 
unlicensed products, previously manufactured 
at the site, are now being outsourced to a 
third party supplier. This site will be closed 
prior to the end of the 2013 calendar year. 
We are also in the process of transferring 
two Eurovet products, which were previously 
manufactured by a third party, into the Skipton 
tableting facility. Once the transfer of these 
products is complete, the full manufacturing 
synergies identified prior to the acquisition will 
be delivered. The manufacturing management 
teams of both businesses have been fully 
integrated and programmes to standardise IT 
systems and GMP compliance systems are 
progressing well. Further efficiencies are also 
being delivered; significant yield improvements 
have been achieved and batch failure rates 
have halved. Furthermore, there has been a 
year on year improvement in accident rates 
with no reported RIDDOR’s in the last 12 
months.
Third party contract manufacturing continues 
to perform strongly with an increase in 
external sales of 12.5% at constant currency 
year on year. We continue to have a high 
level of new external contract manufacturing 
business enquiries.

Case Study
New Sterile Endocrine Product 
Manufactured In-house
The Suspension is a new sterile injection product, developed for use in the treatment of Canine Hypoadrenocorticism 
(Addison’s disease). It is unique within the European market and has clear benefits over the daily tablet formulation used to 
treat the condition. 
The product was developed by Dechra’s Pharmaceutical Development Laboratory but was outsourced to an external 
manufacturer based in Swindon, UK. At the time, our injections facility was in need of significant refurbishment and we 
believed that outsourcing manufacturing to a facility that had an existing FDA approval would be the quickest way to get the 
product to market. The contractor produced three product registration batches in December 2011, but soon after decided to 
cease operations at the site. Rather than outsourcing to another contractor Dechra decided to bring the product into Dechra 
Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing’s Skipton site. In the time that had elapsed, the injection facility had gone through a major 
refurbishment and we had also gained FDA approval for our solid dose manufacturing suite. Therefore, we had the confidence 
in our capabilities to take the refurbished injection suite through the necessary approval process.
The unexpected change in manufacturing site 
actually resulted in several benefits for Dechra. 
Manufacturing in-house lowers the cost of 
producing the product and increases the margin 
on all future sales. Additionally, improvements 
were identified to optimise the production process  
which would not have been possible externally. 
Finally, while Skipton’s injectables suite had 
recently been refurbished, including a new 
autoclave, the decision to bring the product 
in-house necessitated this investment. This has 
enhanced the site’s capability for both internal and 
external customers and has contributed towards 
the ultimate aim of having global approval of the 
Skipton site for all dosage forms.

US Performance
US Pharmaceuticals
Revenue from this Segment delivered growth 
of 4.7% in the year, hampered by third 
party supply issues with the ophthalmic and 
dermatological ranges. Third party supply 
problems for our leading dermatological 
product, Animax, persisted throughout the 
year and an enforced change to a new API 
supplier resulted in a complete out of stock 
situation. Every effort is being made by our 
supplier to produce the validation batches 
required to submit a variation for the change 
in API supplier. It is possible that the product 
could be back in production for the end of 
our current financial year. As the product is 
clinically unique it is considered that we should 
be able to recover the majority of historic sales 
once Animax becomes available again.
We had also anticipated that at least one of 
our licensed veterinary ophthalmic products 
would have been back in production within 
the financial year being reported. However, 
the review period by the FDA was longer than 
expected and we still await approval for the 
change in manufacturer. If we are successful 
in this first round review by the FDA, products 
should be available for marketing within the 
first half of the financial year ending June 
2014. If a second round review is required, 
the relaunch will be extended into the third or 
fourth quarter.
The underlying performance within the US 
remains strong with our key products, Vetoryl 
and Felimazole, growing by 11.6% and 16.3% 
respectively. We continue to increase our 
reputation in the US with an ongoing educational 
programme on the conditions which our key 
products treat; within the year we held almost 
100 meetings with over 3,300 veterinarians in 
attendance. We have continued to strengthen 
our sales team and have also appointed a new 
director of marketing, Nancy Zimmerman, who is 
already having a positive impact.
In December 2012 we completed an 
agreement to in-license three new companion 
animal products: A-Cyst, Polyglycan SA 
and PolyChews. None of these products 
will make a material impact; however, they 
complement our existing range of specialist 
companion animal products and will make a 
contribution to the growth of our US business. 
Development continues on the new  
in-licensed generic product outlined in the 
Half Yearly Report. Following an initial review 
by the FDA, it is unlikely this product will 
receive registration in the 2013/2014  
financial year.

  Technical CE 
Meetings
DVP US organises technical continuing education (“CE”) meetings 
which are centred around the education of veterinarians in terms of 
recognising, diagnosing, treating and managing diseases. The meetings 
are designed to improve awareness of Dechra and instil the message 
that Dechra is a company with state-of-the-art products, technical 
knowledge and a commitment to supporting the veterinary community.
The meetings are an ongoing series of dinner seminars, with around 150 
held each year across the US. Some of these events are organised by 
the Veterinary Medical Association (“VMA”) and are hosted by Dechra 
veterinarians. They feature guest speakers including experts and key 
opinion leaders, such as specialists and university veterinary clinicians 
who are respected leaders in their discipline. Dechra also sponsors 
evenings that do not feature a Dechra speaker, when they cover topics 
pertinent to our products. This gives Dechra independent, third party 
support and adds to the Company’s reputation.
From a strategic point of view, these evenings are an inroad to markets 
DVP US is targeting, and ensures attendees are aware of Dechra 
products and how to use them as their first choice treatments. The 
seminars are RACE (“Registry for Approved Continuing Education”) 
approved, meaning that veterinarians gain educational credits for 
attending, as well as increasing their knowledge on diseases and 
treatments.
On average Dechra-led seminars are attended by over 500 veterinarians 
a year, with this figure rising significantly when Dechra-sponsored 
evenings are held at major veterinary congresses. Since Vetoryl’s launch 
in 2008 it is estimated around 4,000 veterinarians have attended a 
seminar specific to this product which supports the momentum DVP is 
currently building in the US.

Our Governance Our Financials Shareholder Information Strategic Report Our Business Our Performance 22581-04    22/08/2013    Proof 3
Our divestment of the Services Segment (announced on 
10 July 2013) was a logical strategic step following the 
successful acquisition of Eurovet in May 2012 and our stated 
objective to deliver a focused veterinary pharmaceuticals 
business. For the continuing operations in 2013, revenue and 
profits continued to grow, cash generation from operating 
activities was strong and investment to fund our advancing 
R&D pipeline increased.
All numbers are presented on a continuing operations basis for the Pharmaceuticals Segments 
and 2012 has been restated. The Services Segment is shown as a discontinued business 
in both years. Growth rates are shown on a constant exchange rate basis (“CER”) and on a 
reported basis.
Underlying Financial Results
Underlying results of the Group reflect its trading performance excluding amortisation on 
acquired intangibles, non-underlying charges and other one-off events that are inherently 
volatile. Our results, excluding non-underlying items, are summarised below.

Revenue
Total Group revenue increased by 56.6% at constant exchange and 52.2% at reported rate 
compared to the year ended June 2012. The acquisition of Eurovet occurred towards the later 
part of the 2012 financial year and hence revenue for that period included only five weeks of 
Eurovet revenue.

Revenue by Segment
As reported, European Pharmaceuticals 
revenue at £168.7 million grew by 66.3% 
(CER) as a result of the Eurovet acquisition 
and a strong performance from our core 
brands.
Revenue in the US at £20.5 million increased 
by 4.7% (CER) hampered by third party 
supply issues, as referred to in the Chief 
Executive Officer’s report. Excluding these 
issues, revenue increased approximately  
by 10%.
Revenue by Categories
On a like-for-like basis (including Eurovet for 
12 months in 2012).
All franchises reflected growth (at CER) versus 
2012:
 ❱ Pharmaceuticals increased by 4.7%
 — The companion animal products grew by 
7.8% driven by our key products Vetoryl, 
Felimazole and Cardisure
 — The food producing animal products 
declined by 3.2% due to pressure on 
antibiotic prescriptions and competition 
on Cyclospray
 ❱ Diets delivered growth of 2.6%
 ❱ Third party manufacturing had a solid 
performance with 12.5% growth

Gross Profit
Following the Eurovet acquisition, our 
pharmaceutical product mix has broadened 
to include generics and food producing animal 
products. Consequently, overall gross margins 
have declined by 4% from 57.2% to 53.2%.
Selling, General and Administrative 
expenses (“SG&A”)
The SG&A increase of £13.8 million year on year 
reflects the full impact of running a combined 
operation after realising the expected synergies 
of the acquisition of Eurovet.
Research and Development Expenses 
(“R&D”)
R&D investment has increased by £2.3 
million from £5.7 million to £8.0 million. This 
increase reflects not only our enlarged R&D 
organisation following the Eurovet acquisition 
but also our additional investment to advance 
and deliver our promising pipeline.
Discontinued Businesses
Consistent with the Group’s long term policy 
to focus its activities on the manufacture 
and marketing of specialist veterinary 
pharmaceutical products, we announced 
our intention to dispose of the Services 
Segment on 10 July 2013. The transaction 
was completed on 16 August 2013 with sales 
proceeds of £87.5 million. 
The disposed businesses have been 
accounted for as discontinued operations. 
Transaction expenses of £1.5 million have 
been recorded as non-underlying items for 
the discontinued operations. See note 29.
Total Results and Non-Underlying Items
Including the profit from the discontinued 
operations and non-underlying items, Group’s 
profit after tax of £17.9 million increased by 
60.5% (CER) and 53.4% (at reported rate).
Non-underlying items of £21.1 million for the 
continuing operations for the year comprised 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, 
rationalisation costs following the Eurovet 
acquisition and the unwinding of discounts on 
deferred and contingent consideration. Full 
details are shown in notes 4 and 5.

Taxation
The underlying tax charge from continuing 
operations for the year was £8.0 million. 
This reflects an effective tax rate of 24.1% 
compared to 26.5% in 2012. Our effective rate 
has reduced in the year as a result of changes 
to tax rates in both the UK and overseas.
Earnings per Share and Dividends
Underlying diluted EPS for the year for the 
Group business was 38.71 pence (2012: 
32.27 pence). The underlying diluted EPS for 
the continued operations was 29.07 pence, 
representing 36.6% growth (at reported 
rate) over 2012. For clarity, the EPS for the 
financial year does not reflect any future 
interest benefits or tax impact as a result of 
the divestment.
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 
9.66 pence per share (2012: 8.50 pence). 
Added to the interim dividend of 4.34 pence 
per share, this brings the total dividend per 
share for the financial year ended June 2013 
to 14.00 pence (2012: total 12.27 pence). 
Dividend cover based on underlying earnings 
was 2.8 times.
Subject to Shareholder approval at the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 17 October 
2013, the final dividend will be paid on  
22 November 2013 to Shareholders on the 
Register at 8 November 2013. The shares will 
become ex-dividend on 6 November 2013.

The net cash inflow from the Group’s activities 
increased by £17.7 million (from £19.2 million 
to £36.9 million) reflecting the impact of our 
enlarged operations. A strong cash inflow in 
the second half of the year contributed to the 
cash conversion of 107.0%. Excluding non-
underlying items, cash conversion was 98.4%. 
Following the divestment, the Group expects a 
moderate improvement in cash conversion.
The significant transaction to report for 
investing activities during the period is the 
further payment of US$16.0 million  
(£10.0 million) in respect of the acquisition of 
DermaPet, Inc. 
The net borrowing position at the end of the 
year was £80.8 million down from £86.7 
million last year. 
At the end of the year, the Group had the 
following banking facilities;
 ❱ A balance of £50.0 million on the initial 
£55.0 million term loan repayable in 
instalments through October 2016. £5.0 
million was repaid in the period; and
 ❱ A £65.0 million revolving credit facility until 
October 2016.
There was substantial headroom on all 
covenants during the year.
The Group also has an overdraft facility of 
£10.0 million, none of which was utilised at 
year end.

movement versus 2012 other than the expected 
amortisation. The strong performance in 
the underlying trade associated with these 
intangibles continues to support their carrying 
value. Details can be found in note 11.
Total working capital for continuing operations 
was £28.4 million in June 2013 compared 
to £29.7 million in 2012. This reflects our 
disciplined management of working capital.
Financial Risks
From a financial perspective we consider 
several risks, including the following:
 ❱ Our foreign currency exposure: the Group 
has significant sales in Europe, some 
revenues in US$ and operations in Danish

Risk and Risk Management
As we have stated in previous reports, the Group, like every business, faces risks and uncertainties in both its day-to-day operations 
and through events relating to the achievement of its long term strategic objectives. The Board has ultimate responsibility for risk 
management within the Group and there is an ongoing and embedded process of assessing, monitoring, managing and reporting 
on significant risks faced by the separate business units and by the Group as a whole. More detail in relation to this process can be 
found within the Corporate Governance section on pages 50 to 60.

Letter from the Chairman on Governance
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present Dechra’s Corporate Governance report 
for the year ended 30 June 2013.
The 2012/2013 financial year has seen a number of changes to the Board from both 
an Executive and Non-Executive perspective. In terms of Executive Director changes, 
Simon Evans tendered his resignation as Group Finance Director after 15 years’ service 
with the Company. During his tenure on the Board, Dechra developed from a UK based 
veterinary wholesale company into an international veterinary pharmaceuticals business. 
I would like to thank Simon for his significant contribution to the growth of Dechra and 
wish him well in his future. 
Following Simon’s resignation, JCA Group were retained to commence the search for a high calibre finance professional 
who could work alongside the Chief Executive Officer to continue to develop and progress the Group strategy. I was 
delighted that in April Anne-Francoise Nesmes agreed to join Dechra as its Chief Financial Officer. Anne-Francoise has an 
impressive financial career, the majority of which has been spent with GlaxoSmithKline during a 15 year period. I am sure 
that her experience and financial acumen will be invaluable to Dechra. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Paul 
Sandland, the Group Financial Controller, who in the interim period between Simon’s resignation and Anne-Francoise’s 
appointment, fulfilled the role of acting Group Finance Director with professionalism and commitment.
I am also pleased to report the appointment of Tony Griffin as an Executive Director in November 2012. Following the 
Eurovet acquisition in spring 2012, the Board identified the requirement for additional resource at Executive Director level 
and considered that Tony provided the relevant experience to assist in the development and implementation of the Group 
strategy, particularly given his extensive career in the veterinary pharmaceuticals industry. 
In terms of new Non-Executive Director appointments, I am pleased to welcome both Julian Heslop and Ishbel Macpherson 
to Dechra. Each of whom has a wealth of relevant experience, which will bring valuable insight to the Board as we take 
Dechra forward into its next stage as a pure play veterinary pharmaceuticals business. 
I would like to express my gratitude to Neil Warner who, after over ten years as a Non-Executive Director of Dechra, has 
expressed his intention to stand down at the 2013 Annual General Meeting. Over the years Neil has provided a valuable 
contribution as both a Board member and Chairman of the Audit Committee, in particular in terms of finance, risk and 
governance. On behalf of the Board I wish him well in his future.
The Board is currently undertaking its 2012/2013 evaluation. Following a discussion as to process it has been agreed that an 
internal evaluation will be held this year but the Board will seek to carry out an external evaluation for 2013/2014. Details of the 
findings and action points arising from the 2011/2012 evaluation are detailed in the report.
Following the move to our new head office in Northwich, Cheshire it has been decided to hold this year’s Annual General 
Meeting at the new premises. This Meeting provides Shareholders with the opportunity to meet with the Board on an 
informal basis and I hope that you will be able to attend.
Finally, should you have any questions in relation to the report, please feel free to contact myself or the Company Secretary. 
Michael Redmond
Non-Executive Chairman

Corporate Governance
Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
The Financial Reporting Council’s UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) establishes the principles of good governance 
for companies; the following report describes how the Company has applied these principles to its activities. The Board remains 
committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and continually strives to do so. In the opinion of the Directors, 
the Company has complied with the Code throughout the period under review except in respect of the composition of the Audit 
Committee. On Bryan Morton’s resignation in July 2012, Michael Redmond, Chairman of the Board, was appointed to the Audit 
Committee in order to maintain the required number of members in line with the Audit Committee Terms of Reference. Michael 
Redmond stood down as a member of the Audit Committee on 21 February 2013 upon the appointment of Julian Heslop and 
Ishbel Macpherson. 
Leadership
The Board
The Board is led by the Chairman Michael Redmond and comprises four Executive Directors and four Non-Executive Directors. The 
biographical details of the Board of Directors are shown on pages 48 and 49. 
The Chairman
The primary role of the Chairman is to:
 ❱ ensure the effectiveness of the Board in all aspects of its role;
 ❱ facilitate the effective contribution of the Non-Executive Directors, ensuring that all decisions are subject to constructive debate 
and supported by sound decision making processes; and
 ❱ lead the Board in the determination of its strategy and the achievement of its objectives.
The Chairman has a strong working relationship with Ian Page, the Chief Executive Officer, and works closely with him to ensure that 
Board decisions and strategy are implemented throughout the Group. There is a clear division of the roles and responsibilities of the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. These have been defined in writing and agreed by the Board. 
The Chairman, at the time of his appointment, did meet and continues to meet the independence criteria defined within the Code. 
As reported in the previous Annual Report, Dechra’s top ten Shareholders were consulted in August 2012 with regard to the tenure 
of the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director, each having held their respective positions for in excess of nine years. It was 
agreed with the Shareholders that it was deemed to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders that the Chairman 
should remain in position for a further three years in order to oversee the induction and development of the new Non-Executive 
and Executive Directors to the Board. The Nomination Committee considers that Michael Redmond continues to lead the Board 
effectively, maintaining his independence and integrity at all times. He provides an invaluable contribution and insight to the Board by 
reason of both his previous pharmaceutical experience and the longevity of his association with the Company. 
Therefore as agreed with the Shareholders, the Chairman’s tenure will be reviewed prior to the 2014 Annual General Meeting. 
Non-Executive Directors
Throughout the year the Non-Executive Directors have provided a solid, independent element to the Board ensuring that decisions 
are constructively challenged and debated. 
During the year an independent recruitment consultant, JCA Group, was retained to assist in the recruitment of two new  
Non-Executive Directors. At the commencement of the recruitment process an objective role description was defined and agreed by 
the Nomination Committee detailing the skills and experience required for the Board positions.
As a result, on 1 January 2013 and 1 February 2013, Julian Heslop and Ishbel Macpherson, respectively, were appointed to the 
Board and also as members of the Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees. It is intended that Julian will be appointed 
as Chairman of the Audit Committee upon Neil Warner’s retirement at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and further detail of 
this is provided in the Audit Committee Report on pages 61 to 66. It is considered that each of the newly appointed Non-Executive 
Directors brings with them a breadth of experience which will add value to the decision making of the Board and the formulation and 
progression of the Group strategy.

Corporate Governance continued
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director is available to Shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the normal channels has 
failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate. The Senior Independent Director also carries out the annual evaluation of 
the performance of the Chairman and chairs the Nomination Committee when it is considering the succession of that role. 
Neil Warner has held the position of Senior Independent Director since 5 November 2010, having been appointed as a  
Non-Executive Director with the Company on 2 May 2003.  Following Neil’s retirement from the Board at the 2013 Annual General 
Meeting it has been agreed that Ishbel Macpherson will be appointed as the Senior Independent Director.
Chief Executive Officer
The Chief Executive Officer has day-to-day responsibility for the management of the Group. He develops the Group strategy and, 
once approved by the Board, implements this throughout the business.
Ian Page is also the Non-Executive Chairman of Sanford DeLand Asset Management Limited (“Sanford”). The Board fully considered 
at the time of his appointment whether this would materially impact on his current time commitment as Chief Executive Officer 
and whether it could give rise to any conflict. As Ian Page is not involved in any investment decision made by Sanford it was not 
considered that any conflict would arise nor would there be any impact on his time commitment. Further details in relation to the 
appointment can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 67 to 83.
Chief Financial Officer
The Chief Financial Officer has day-to-day responsibility for financial planning and reporting for the Group. She is also responsible for 
managing the financial risks and works with the Chief Executive Officer on all strategic matters.
As well as assisting in the recruitment of two new Non-Executive Directors during the year, JCA Group was engaged in relation  to 
the appointment of the Chief Financial Officer following the resignation of Simon Evans. Following a rigorous recruitment process, 
Anne-Francoise Nesmes was appointed to the Board in April 2013. Anne-Francoise is a high calibre finance professional who 
has valuable international, pharmaceutical, manufacturing and commercial experience gained during her extensive tenure with 
GlaxoSmithKline PLC over a 15 year period.
Company Secretary
Zoe Goulding was appointed as Company Secretary on 2 July 2007 and acts as Secretary to the Board and its Committees. The 
primary role of the Company Secretary is to advise the Board on matters of procedure and governance, ensuring that all required 
information is made available to the Board on a timely basis. Both the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the Board as a whole.
Corporate Governance Framework
The Board is collectively responsible for the success of the Company, ensuring that the Group is appropriately managed and 
achieves its strategic objectives. The Board fulfils this responsibility by monitoring the performance of the Group, inter alia, by:
 ❱ assisting, in a challenging and constructive manner, the Executive Directors in the setting of objectives for Group operating 
performance, financial goals and strategic progress;
 ❱ evaluating the progress of the achievement of the objectives and plans; and
 ❱ monitoring all significant risks which face the Group.

There is a formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board. The schedule of matters covers a number of areas, including the 
following:
Strategy and Management Approval and monitoring of long term objectives and strategy 
Approval of the Group’s operating and capital expenditure budgets
Major organisational changes
Regular reviews of business performance
Financial Reporting Approval of the Annual Report and dividend policy
Approval of development expenditure
Approval of treasury policy
Internal Controls Review and approval of internal controls and risk management policies and processes
Corporate Governance Board and Committee composition (including succession planning)
Corporate Governance matters
Approval of policies such as Health and Safety and the Business Code of Conduct
In addition, the Board also focuses on the financial controls operated by the Executive Directors with a view to ensuring that these 
are at the requisite levels so as not to hinder day-to-day administration of the business, but to ensure adequate internal control. 
Below Board level, operational and financial controls are contained in the delegated authorities document. This document is 
reviewed on an annual basis along with the schedule of matters reserved to the Board. Where necessary these documents are 
updated in line with best practice with a view to ensuring that the processes remain robust. 
Board Meetings
The Board is scheduled to meet nine times per year. During the year two additional meetings were required to discuss the disposal 
of the Services Segment.
Attendance at the Board and Nomination Committee meetings during the year to 30 June 2013 was as follows (details of 
attendance at the Audit and Remuneration Committee meetings are provided on pages 62 and 68 respectively):

It is understood that there may be situations, either due to prior commitments or circumstances beyond their control, which mean 
a Director is unable to attend a Board or Committee meeting. In this situation the Board pack is still provided allowing the Director 
to raise any queries or discussion points either through the Chairman or Company Secretary, thereby allowing their views to be fully 
discussed at the meeting. Following the meeting any Director who was unable to attend is provided with the opportunity to discuss 
the meeting with either the Chairman, Company Secretary or any Executive Director.
The Company Secretary ensures that an accurate record of each Board meeting is made which is circulated to the Board as soon 
as practicable after the meeting. Should Directors have concerns of any nature which cannot be resolved within the Board meeting, 
they have the right to ensure their view is recorded in the minutes. On resignation, should a Non-Executive Director have any 
concerns, they have a right to provide a written statement for circulation to the Board.

Corporate Governance continued
The Board believes in the necessity for challenge and debate at Board meetings and considers that the existing Board dynamics 
and processes encourage honest and open debate with the Executive Directors. The Board believes that the decision making 
process is inclusive and is not dominated by any individual or group of individuals.
Board Meeting Agenda and Papers 
The Directors are supplied in a timely manner with all relevant documentation and financial information to assist them in the 
discharge of their duties. Prior to all Board meetings an agenda and supporting documentation is circulated to the Board. Every 
meeting agenda comprises reports from the following individuals:
 ❱ Chief Executive Officer;
 ❱ Chief Financial Officer;
 ❱ Managing Director and Finance Director of each Business Unit;
 ❱ Group HR Director; and
 ❱ Product Development and Regulatory Affairs Director.
In addition, twice a year the Board receives detailed health, safety and environmental reviews encompassing all operating segments, 
plus the activities of the Transport Risk and Sustainability Committees. Three times a year the Board receives a full risk assessment 
review for discussion, following detailed risk reviews within each of the business units. Other ad hoc material relating to specific 
projects, legal, company secretarial and regulatory matters are included as necessary. The reports ensure that the Board is updated 
on all major items of strategic planning, business performance, personnel, investments and significant policy issues. This allows the 
Board to monitor the progress of the business and provides transparency across all areas within the Group. 
Each year an annual strategic agenda is drawn up and approved by the Board. This enables the Board to focus on and discuss key 
strategic areas on a regular basis. Additionally, every six months, a comprehensive review of the Group strategy is carried out. This 
agenda provides the Board with an opportunity to speak with the senior managers on a one to one basis and gain a more in-depth 
understanding of their area of responsibility. During the year the following business presentations have been made:
Date of Meeting Presentation Subject Delivered by
August 2012 Group IT Strategy Allen Mellor (Group IT Director)
December 2012 DVP US update Mike Eldred (President, DVP US)
January 2013 Oracle implementation Allen Mellor (Group IT Director)
April 2013 Product Development and lifecycle

projects and an outline of exploratory projects
Susan Longhofer (Group Director, Product 
Development and Regulatory Affairs) and
Rob Joosten (Product Development and 
Regulatory Affairs)
May 2013 Manufacturing and Sourcing Mike Annice (Managing Director of Dechra 
Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing)
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors generally meet before each Board meeting which allows them time to review and 
discuss any matters arising from the agenda without the Executive Directors being present. The Chairman also meets regularly with 
the Chief Executive Officer outside of the scheduled Board meetings.
The Board has formally delegated specific responsibilities to Board Committees, in particular the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees. The terms of reference for each of these Committees are available on the Company’ s website or on request from the 
Company Secretary. The Board also appoints Committees on an ad hoc basis to approve specific projects as deemed necessary.
During the year the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have attended the Board meetings of the businesses which 
make up the operating segments (in relation to the US these meetings are generally held by video conference). The meetings are 
chaired by the Chief Executive Officer allowing him and the Chief Financial Officer the opportunity to obtain detailed information on 
the businesses’ strategic, operational and financial progress including any issues potentially preventing the achievement of their 
targets. Key operational information obtained from these meetings is then reported back to the Board.
The Chief Executive Officer has also chaired a number of product development meetings during the year. Representatives from 
the finance, marketing and manufacturing departments also attend these meetings thereby allowing the product pipeline to be 
comprehensively reviewed.

Following the disposal of the Services Segment a review of the operational Board meetings has taken place and it has been agreed 
that six meetings a year will be held for DVP EU, DVP US, Manufacturing and Product Development. Furthermore, four Executive 
Board meetings have been scheduled. It is the intention that these meetings will be attended by the four Executive Directors, the 
Managing Directors of the operating businesses along with the IT and HR Directors.
The Company maintains an appropriate level of Directors’ and Officers’ insurance in respect of legal action against Directors. 
Effectiveness
Board Balance and Independence
The Board recognises and understands the importance of balance and refreshment in terms of its composition. The following 
changes have taken place at Board level over the past 12 months:
 ❱ the appointment of Tony Griffin (Managing Director of DVP EU) as an Executive Director on 1 November 2012;
 ❱ the appointment of Julian Heslop (Non-Executive Director) on 1 January 2013; 
 ❱ the appointment of Ishbel Macpherson (Non-Executive Director) on 1 February 2013; 
 ❱ the appointment of Anne-Francoise Nesmes as Chief Financial Officer on 22 April 2013;
 ❱ the resignation of Bryan Morton (Non-Executive Director) on 9 July 2012; and
 ❱ the resignation of Simon Evans as Group Finance Director on 18 October 2012.
As previously stated, Neil Warner will retire as a Non-Executive Director at the 2013 Annual General Meeting having held a position 
on the Board for over ten years. As agreed with the major Shareholders the Chairman’s position will be reviewed prior to the 2014 
Annual General Meeting.
The Board considers that all the Non-Executive Directors are independent of management and free of any business or other 
relationship which could materially interfere with, or compromise, their ability to exercise independent judgement. This independence 
of mind provides them with the ability to challenge decisions and think strategically and is integral to the decision making processes 
of the Board.
Diversity
The Board understands the importance of having a diverse membership and recognises that diversity encompasses not only gender 
but also background and experience. However, the Board does not have a formal diversity policy and is generally opposed to the 
idea of stated quotas for females. The Board believes that appointments should be made solely on merit, the key criterion being 
whether or not the appointee can add to or complement the existing range of skills and experience on the Board. 
Notably, of the recent Board appointments, two out of the three have been female. Both of these appointments were made on 
merit, and not on gender. Both appointees were by far the strongest candidates for the positions and their skill set and overall 
experience fitted the objective role description approved by the Board at the outset of the recruitment process.
In terms of female representation across the Group: 22% of Board members (2012: nil); 25.0% (2012: 25.0%) of the senior 
management team; and 42% (2012: 44.8%) of the overall workforce are females.

Corporate Governance continued
Conflicts of Interest 
Pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 all Directors have a duty to avoid a situation in which they have, or could have, a direct or 
indirect conflict of interest with the Company. The Articles of Association of the Company enable the Directors to authorise any 
actual or potential conflict of interest which could arise. There are safeguards which will apply when Directors decide whether to 
authorise a conflict or potential conflict. Firstly, only independent Directors (i.e. those who have no interest in the matter being 
considered) will be able to take the relevant decision; secondly, in taking the decision the Directors must act in a way they consider, 
in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’s success. The Directors will also be able to impose limits or conditions 
when giving authorisation if they deem this to be appropriate. During the financial year under review no actual or potential conflicts 
have arisen.
Information and Professional Development
Detail in respect of the information provided to the Board prior to each meeting is provided earlier in this report. 
 
In order to ensure that the Board maintains its knowledge and familiarity with the Group’s operations it is intended that at least 
one Board meeting per year is held at one of the Group’s operational sites. During the year a Board meeting was held at Dechra 
Manufacturing, Skipton, and the main Eurovet facility (Bladel) in the Netherlands. The Board had an opportunity to be shown around 
both of these manufacturing facilities and meet with employees. 
Any newly appointed Directors are provided with comprehensive documentation aimed at providing information in relation to the 
remit and obligations of the role, current areas under consideration for the Board and the latest broker reports. New Directors are 
also offered the opportunity to visit the various business units in order to allow them to meet with the executive teams and to be 
shown around the operations. All of the new Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors appointed during the year visited 
the facilities at both Skipton and Stoke-on-Trent prior to their respective appointments. Meetings were also arranged with the 
Product Development and Regulatory Affairs Directors, the HR Director and the Managing Director and Quality Director of Dechra 
Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing.
The Company Secretary and Chairman are aware of the ongoing requirement to review and agree with each Director their training 
needs. In order to assist with these training requirements the Company Secretary provides briefings for the Directors, where 
necessary, that cover a number of legal and regulatory changes and developments relevant to the Director’s areas of responsibility. 
During the year these briefings included an update on the revised draft Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations and the new 
strategic report proposals. In addition, the Company Secretary informs the Directors of any external training courses which may 
be of relevance. It is currently considered that the mixture of internal briefings and external training courses satisfies the Directors’ 
training needs; however, this will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Each Director is entitled on request to receive information to enable him or her to make informed judgements in order to adequately 
discharge their duties. In addition, all Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and senior 
managers, and may take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in connection with their duties. 
Nomination Committee
The Board has an established Nomination Committee to lead the process for Board appointments and to make recommendations 
to the Board. During the period the Nomination Committee comprised Michael Redmond (Chairman), Julian Heslop (appointed 
1 January 2013), Ishbel Macpherson (appointed 1 February 2013), Dr Chris Richards and Neil Warner. The Chairman will not chair 
the Committee meeting if it is dealing with the appointment of his successor. Details of the work carried out by the Nomination 
Committee during the financial year have already been detailed in this report. The Nomination Committee normally meets once a 
year.  During the financial year under review three additional Nomination Committee meetings were held in order to discuss and 
recommend the various Board appointments.
The terms of reference set out the Nomination Committee’s role and the authority delegated to it by the Board. The terms of 
reference have been reviewed during the year; a copy is available on the Company website at www.dechra.com. The terms of 
reference include the following responsibilities:
 ❱ to oversee the plans for management succession;
 ❱ to recommend appointments to the Board;
 ❱ to evaluate the effectiveness of the Non-Executive Directors; and
 ❱ to consider the structure, size and composition of the Board generally.

Other significant commitments of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors were disclosed to the Board before appointment, 
the Board is notified of any subsequent changes. The letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office. Both the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors and the service 
contracts of the Executive Directors will be on display at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Board Evaluation
The Board undertakes an annual evaluation of its performance and that of its Committees. 
 
 ❱ The 2011/2012 Board evaluation:
The evaluation process was reviewed in detail by the Chairman and the Company Secretary and discussed with the Board. It 
was agreed that, given the number of changes to the Board during the review period, an internal (rather than external) evaluation 
would be the most beneficial to the Company.
A detailed discussion document was then circulated to the Board covering the following areas: (i) Board composition; (ii) strategy 
review process; (iii) the format of Board meetings and the decision process; (iv) training and development; (v) the performance of 
the Board and the individual Directors; (vi) Corporate Governance; (vii) leadership and culture; and (viii) risk assessment. One to one 
meetings were then held by the Chairman with each of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors and Company Secretary. The 
evaluation of the Chairman was undertaken by the Senior Independent Director. The findings of the internal evaluation were then 
discussed with the Board in August 2012. Overall it was noted that no new issues of material significance had been raised during 
the review, rather input revolved around progress of the previous years’ action points. The main action points were as follows:
Action Progress
Board succession planning discussion and 
implementation
Two new Non-Executive Directors have been appointed during the course 
of the year.
Furthermore, an additional Executive Director position was created by the 
appointment of Tony Griffin to the Board
Review of Board pack content and Board meeting 
discussion
Following the October 2012 strategy meeting the Board agenda was 
reviewed in order to increase focus on strategic matters. This was 
assisted by an updated programme of strategic matters for review during 
the year
Further development of the Group KPIs This has not progressed to date but a review is now necessary given the 
recent disposal of the Services Segment
Post-acquisition reviews after 12 months This has been tabled into the rolling agenda for the PLC Board Meetings
 ❱ The 2012/2013 Board evaluation
A discussion took place at the February 2013 Board meeting as to whether or not an external evaluation should be commenced 
during the 2012/2013 financial year given the Company’s move in June 2012 to the FTSE 250. It was agreed that given the 
changes to the Board (as detailed above) an internal evaluation would again be carried out. However, an external evaluation will 
be undertaken during the 2013/2014 financial year. The results of the 2012/2013 evaluation will be reported in next year’s Report 
and Accounts. 
Re-election
On appointment, Directors are required to seek election at the first Annual General Meeting following appointment. At the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, Julian Heslop, Ishbel Macpherson, Tony Griffin and Anne-Francoise Nesmes, who were all 
appointed during the financial year, will offer themselves for election. All of the remaining Directors will retire and offer themselves for 
re-election, excluding Neil Warner. Each of the Directors standing for re-election has been subject to a formal evaluation. Each of 
the Directors continues to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment, not only in respect of their roles and responsibilities, 
but also in relation to the Group and its stakeholders. The Board therefore recommends that Shareholders vote in favour of their 
respective elections and re-elections.

Corporate Governance continued
Accountability 
Financial Reporting
The Board seeks to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and prospects, through the 
Chairman’s Statement and the Directors’ Report.
The respective responsibilities of the Directors and the Auditors in connection with the Financial Statements are explained in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities and the Independent Auditor’s Report on pages 94, and 96 to 97 respectively.
Going Concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Strategic Report and Operating Review on pages 3 to 45. The principal risks that may affect the Group’s future performance 
are set out on pages 46 and 47.
During the year being reported, trading has continued to be robust with an improvement in profitability being achieved. Prior to the 
acquisition of Eurovet, the Group entered into a facilities agreement on 4 April 2012 (the “Facility Agreement”) with a syndicate of 
banks comprising Lloyds TSB Bank plc, Barclays Bank PLC, Svenska Handelsbanken AB (PUBL) and HSBC Bank plc (the “Banks”) 
under which a facility of £120 million was made available. The Facility Agreement included:
 ❱ a £55.0 million, 4½ year amortising term loan, repayable in eight instalments on 31 March and 30 September each year of  
£5.0 million per instalment, rising to £7.5 million per instalment from and including 30 September 2015 with a final instalment of 
£7.5 million on 31 October 2016. The first repayment was paid on 31 March 2013; and
 ❱ a £65.0 million 4½ year revolving credit facility committed until 31 October 2016.
The net proceeds from the disposal of the Services Segment to Patterson Companies, Inc. in August 2013 will be used to reduce 
the Group’s debt through the prepayment and cancellation of the Group’s existing £50.0 million term loan facility and the reduction 
in amounts drawn under the Group’s existing £65.0 million revolving credit facility. This revolving credit facility will be retained on an 
ongoing basis to fund the development of the business.
The Group also had cash balances of £32.8 million at 30 June 2013. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these 
annual financial statements.
Internal Control and Risk Management
The Directors are responsible for maintaining the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness from a 
financial, operational and compliance perspective. The system of internal control aims to safeguard the Company’s assets, ensure 
that proper accounting records are maintained, ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements and ensure the 
effectiveness and efficiency of operations including the assessment and management of risk. The system of internal control is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group has an established, ongoing and embedded framework of internal financial and operational control for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Group. Every four months the Board carries out a review of relevant risk areas 
and systems of internal control. The review is structured by business area and key risk strategy and is based upon a summary of 
information prepared and reviewed by the business units’ executive teams on an ongoing basis. This framework has been in place 
throughout the year under review, and has continued up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. 
The risk management process was last reviewed in 2009 and it has been agreed that the process will once again undergo a review 
during 2013/2014.
The Board has reviewed the operation and effectiveness of the internal controls for the year ended 30 June 2013. Further detail in 
respect of the risks and uncertainties faced by the Group and the mitigating action being taken can be found on pages 46 and 47.

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2013 Our Governance 22581-04    22/08/2013    Proof 3
The Group’s key systems of control include:
 ❱ Management Structure 
The Group is organised into operating segments within which there are a number of business units. Each business unit has its 
own Managing Director and executive team; there are clear reporting lines and delegated authorities in place. 
Key functions such as tax, treasury, insurance, legal and personnel are controlled centrally.
 ❱ Management Accounting Processes 
The finance function has implemented a detailed management accounting process which is in operation and allows the Board 
and management transparency in terms of financial and operational performance, measured against key performance indicators 
(set at both business unit and Group level). Detailed management accounts are prepared on a monthly basis covering all areas 
of the business; these are reviewed by the relevant business units at their management meetings and by the Board on a monthly 
basis, thereby allowing any material variances to be discussed and any necessary action taken on a timely basis. Detailed 
forecasts are prepared and discussed in detail on a quarterly basis; these are then escalated to the Board for consideration and 
approval.
The finance function maintain a financial policies manual which covers central and divisional management. The manual is 
reviewed at least annually and is also updated whenever reporting standards, legislation or internal commercial reasons dictate. 
Any changes to the policies are communicated throughout the Group’s finance function. The finance function schedules two 
annual internal conferences at which a technical update, tailored specifically to the Group’s commercial needs, is presented 
by the Auditor. During the 2012/2013 financial year this conference took place in November and April, the former meeting 
concentrated on the Senior Accounting Officer obligations and the latter provided an opportunity for the Chief Financial Officer to 
meet her team to discuss future strategy.
Business unit management certify on a quarterly basis that key financial controls have been performed and that significant risks 
have been identified. 
 ❱ Business Plans 
Business plans provide a framework from which annual budgets and forecasts are agreed with each business unit, including 
financial and strategic targets against which business performance is monitored. The plans are reviewed by executive 
management, and then by the Board for ultimate approval. Actual performance during the financial year is monitored monthly 
against budget, forecast and previous year. 
 ❱ Investment Approval 
The Group has clear requirements for the approval and control of expenditure. Strategic investment decisions involving both 
capital and revenue expenditure are subject to formal detailed appraisal and review according to approval levels set by the Board. 
Capital expenditure is controlled within each business with approval levels determined by the Board.
 ❱ Development Expenditure 
The Group has a transparent and established process for evaluating and monitoring the level of development expenditure 
incurred. As with all other business units the Product Development and Regulatory team agrees an annual budget which receives 
approval from the Board; performance against this is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Product Development and Regulatory 
team re-evaluates all projects at least twice a year (and reports all material decisions and changes to the Board). When evaluating 
projects a number of measurement criteria are considered, including the products’ net present value and return on investment. 
 ❱ Whistle-blowing and Business Ethics Policy 
The Company has a whistle-blowing policy in place which establishes a confidential channel of communication for employees to 
bring matters of concern about the running of the business to the attention of senior management. Upon being notified of such 
a concern, the policy sets out a defined process which allows a full investigation to take place and, where necessary, corrective 
action to be taken. The Audit Committee reviews the whistle-blowing policy on an annual basis.
The Business Ethics Policy is currently undergoing a review and it is intended that an updated policy is rolled out across the 
Group during 2013/2014.

Audit Committee and Auditors
Information relating to the Audit Committee is set out in the Audit Committee Report on pages 61 to 66. This details the Company’s 
compliance with the Code’s requirements in respect of audit matters. 
Responsibility for monitoring the Group’s system of internal control rests with the Board. It is assisted by the Audit Committee, 
which reviews the Half-Yearly and Annual Reports provided to Shareholders, the audit process, the systems of internal control and 
risk management. 
The Auditor is engaged to express an opinion of the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts. They independently and objectively 
review management’s reporting of the Group’s consolidated results and financial position. In addition, they review the systems of 
internal control and the data contained in the Annual Report and Accounts to the level necessary for expressing their audit opinion.
Remuneration
Details of Directors’ remuneration are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report at pages 67 to 83. This report details the 
Company’s compliance with the Code’s requirements with regard to remuneration matters. 
Relations with Shareholders
Dialogue with Institutional Shareholders
Relationships with Shareholders receive high priority and a rolling programme of meetings between Institutional Shareholders 
and Executive Directors are held throughout the year. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer give annual and 
half-yearly results presentations to Institutional Investors, analysts and media, which are also available via telephone conference. 
These meetings are in addition to the Annual General Meeting and seek to foster mutual understanding of the Company’s and 
Shareholders’ objectives. Such meetings are conducted in a format to protect price sensitive information that has not already been 
made generally available to the Company’s Shareholders. Similar guidelines also apply to communications between the Company 
and other parties such as financial analysts, brokers and media. The Company also organises site visits on a periodic basis.
Tony Griffin and Anne-Francoise Nesmes separately attended a number of the Institutional Shareholder meetings held in September 
2012 and February 2013 respectively, post the announcement of the full and half yearly results. This provided a number of 
Dechra’s major Shareholders with the chance to meet Tony Griffin and Anne-Francoise Nesmes before the commencement of their 
appointment as Executive Directors. 
Feedback is collated by the Company’s Brokers after investor presentations. The feedback is then circulated to the Board for review 
and consideration. In addition, the Board is provided with a monthly market summary report which reports on share price and share 
register movements. Where material changes in respect of remuneration or governance are proposed the Board seeks to consult 
with its major Shareholders before implementing such changes.
The annual and half-yearly results presentations are available to private investors via the Company’s website. The Company views 
the website as an important investor relations tool, and updates the website in line with best practice, ensuring that information 
relating to the Company and its activities is easily accessible. 
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
All members of the Board are scheduled to attend the Annual General Meeting and the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees will be available to answer Shareholders’ questions both during the meeting and afterwards. Notice of 
the meeting, together with the Annual Report and Accounts, is posted to Shareholders not less than 20 working days prior to the 
date of the Annual General Meeting. The information sent to Shareholders includes a summary of the business to be covered at the 
Annual General Meeting, where a separate resolution is prepared for each substantive matter. When a vote is taken on a show of 
hands, the level of proxies received for and against the resolution and any abstentions are disclosed at the meeting; this information 
will be made available as soon as practicable after the meeting on the Company website at www.dechra.com. The Notice of 
Meeting and an announcement relating to the total number of shares in respect of which Shareholders are entitled to exercise voting 
rights are made available on the Company’s website the day after the notice of meeting is posted to Shareholders. At the Annual 
General Meeting there will be an opportunity, following the formal business, for informal communications between Shareholders and 
Directors.

Letter from the Audit Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present Dechra’s Audit Committee Report for 
the year ended 30 June 2013.
Last year I advised that, following over nine years’ service with Dechra, I would be 
standing down as a Non-Executive of the Group at the 2013 Annual General Meeting 
and that the recruitment for a replacement Non-Executive Director, with recent and 
relevant financial experience, had commenced. I am pleased to report that Julian 
Heslop was appointed as a Non-Executive Director and also a member of the Audit 
Committee in January 2013 and that Julian has accepted the role of Chairman of the 
Audit Committee upon my retirement in October 2013.
Julian Heslop brings to the Committee a wealth of experience gained from serving as Chief Financial Officer of 
GlaxoSmithKline PLC between 2005 and 2011, having previously been appointed its Senior Vice President, Operations 
Controller between 2001 and 2005 and as Financial Controller of Glaxo Wellcome PLC between 1998 and 2000. 
Since Julian’s appointment in January 2013, he and I have worked closely together on all Audit Committee matters so that 
he is aware of any key issues in relation to audit matters and also to ensure a smooth and orderly handover of duties prior 
to my retirement.
I am also pleased to welcome Ishbel Macpherson as a member of the Audit Committee. Further details in respect of both 
Ishbel and Julian are provided in the Corporate Governance Report.
Last year you will recall that I reported that the Committee was in the process of defining the scope of an internal audit 
function with a view to commencing recruitment by the end of 2012. Following the resignation of the Group Finance 
Director, Simon Evans, in October 2012 it was agreed that the recruitment process be placed on hold until the new 
Chief Financial Officer, Anne-Francoise Nesmes, had taken up her role with the Company. Following Anne-Francoise’s 
appointment, and a number of discussions in relation to the potential remit of an internal audit function within Dechra, it 
has been decided that the best approach to take at the current time is to outsource the function for an interim period whilst 
consideration can be given to the longer term view of the remit and responsibilities of an internal audit function. More details 
in relation to the tender process are provided within the following report. 
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Board of Dechra for their support during my tenure as both a  
Non-Executive of the Company and also Chairman of the Audit Committee. I firmly believe that Julian Heslop is well suited 
to guiding the Audit Committee forward and I wish him well with this role.
As always, should you have any questions in relation to this report, please feel free to contact me or the Company 
Secretary.

Non-Executive Director.
Role and Responsibilities
The main role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee (the “Committee”) are set out in the written terms of reference which are 
available on the Company website at www.dechra.com. The Committee’s terms of reference are reviewed on an annual basis and 
during the 2012/2013 financial year this took place at the February meeting. Following this review no material changes to the terms 
of reference were made. The main responsibilities of the Committee remain:
 ❱ to monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Group, reviewing the annual and half-year reports in detail to ensure they 
present a balanced assessment of the Group’s position and prospects which is understandable to Shareholders and potential 
investors;
 ❱ to review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and risk management systems as described on pages 58 to 59 and, in 
conjunction with the Auditor, consider the accounting policies adopted by the Group;
 ❱ to oversee the relationship with the Auditor. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment of the 
Auditor, approves their remuneration and their terms of engagement, monitors their independence and objectivity, and sets the 
policy for non-audit work;
 ❱ to make recommendations to the Board on the requirement for an internal audit function;
 ❱ to review the arrangements for employees to raise concerns about wrongdoings, the Group’s systems and controls for 
prevention of bribery and procedures for detecting, monitoring and managing risk of fraud.
In the performance of its duties the Committee has access to the services of the Auditor and is at liberty to obtain outside 
professional advice as necessary. During the year, no legal or independent professional advice was sought. The Auditor also has 
direct access to the Committee Chairman outside the formal Committee meetings.

Membership, Meetings and Attendance
The membership of the Committee and meeting attendance is stated on the previous page. Following the resignation of Bryan 
Morton in July 2012, Mike Redmond was appointed as a temporary member of the Audit Committee to ensure adherence to the 
Committee’s terms of reference and in particular to ensure that Committee membership consisted of three Non-Executive Directors. 
This appointment was terminated on 21 February 2013 following the appointment of Julian Heslop as a Non-Executive Director.  
The Committee is pleased also to welcome Ishbel Macpherson as its most recent member. 
The Board considers that the current Committee Chairman, Neil Warner, has recent and relevant financial experience as recommended 
by the UK Corporate Governance Code as a result of his financial background. He has held a number of financial positions throughout 
his career including most recently Finance Director of Chloride Group PLC (a position he held from 1997 until the end of December 
2010) and also as Chairman of the Audit Committee of Vectura Group plc (to which he was appointed in February 2011).
Neil Warner will be standing down as a Non-Executive Director of the Company and as the Chairman of the Audit Committee at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. It is intended that Julian Heslop will replace Neil as the Committee Chairman. As detailed in 
the Chairman’s Letter on page 61, Julian worked for GlaxoSmithKline from 1998, latterly as its Chief Financial Officer from 2005 to 
2011. It is therefore considered that Julian Heslop also has sufficient recent and relevant financial experience as required under the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
Details of the members’ financial and accounting experience are contained in the biographical details of the Board of Directors on 
pages 48 to 49. 
The Auditor attends meetings of the Committee other than when their appointment or performance is being reviewed. The Chief 
Executive Officer, Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and other senior finance staff attend as and when appropriate. The Committee 
has discussions at least once a year with the Auditor without management being present; during the financial year this took place 
at the end of the August meeting. Furthermore, during the year the Committee Chairman meets informally and has access to the 
Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller and the senior audit engagement team. This group generally meets before the 
Committee meetings that consider the annual and half-yearly results.
Neither the Company nor its Directors have any relationships that impair the Auditor’s independence.

Internal Control and Internal Audit Function
The Board retains overall responsibility for establishing the systems of internal control and monitoring their ongoing effectiveness  
and also for the identification and management of risk. The Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal control activities and further detail in respect of the internal controls are provided within the Corporate Governance Section 
(on pages 58 to 59). As reported in the 2012 Annual Report, in light of the Eurovet acquisition it was agreed that the Group was 
now of sufficient size to warrant an internal audit function. The Committee discussed the role specification at the August meeting. 
Following the resignation of the Group Finance Director, Simon Evans, in October 2012 it was agreed that the recruitment process 
be placed on hold until the new Chief Financial Officer, Anne-Francoise Nesmes, had taken up her role within the Company. 
Following Anne-Francoise’s appointment, discussions in relation to the role took place between the Committee Chairman and Chief 
Financial Officer and it was decided that the best approach to take in the current circumstances was to outsource the function 
for the short term so that a longer term view could be taken on the remit and responsibilities of an internal audit function. Tender 
invitations have been forwarded to a number of accountancy firms (excluding the Auditor, KPMG) for an enterprise risk management 
and internal support control function. Proposals are expected back by 27 September 2013 with presentations to be held mid-
October. The timeframe will therefore allow the project to be initiated at the beginning of January 2014. It is anticipated that this 
ongoing support will continue for between 12 and 18 months until a firm decision can be made regarding insourcing compared to 
outsourcing in relation to the function.
Auditor 
Audit Engagement Director Rotation
In line with the ethical standards of the Audit Practices Board the Group Audit Engagement Director is rotated every five years. The 
current Group Audit Engagement Director was appointed during the 2010/2011 financial year. The next rotation is scheduled to take 
place during 2015/2016.
Independence
The Auditor annually confirms their policies on ensuring audit independence and provides the Committee with a report on their own 
audit and quality procedures. This report was reviewed during the audit strategy meeting held in May 2013 and the Committee 
remain satisfied of the Auditor’s independence. 
Effectiveness
The performance of the Auditor is reviewed annually by the Committee at the end of the annual audit cycle taking into account 
feedback from financial directors and managers of the Group involved in the audit process, together with a review of the level of 
service provided by the Auditor to the Group. The Committee are satisfied with the current Auditor’s effectiveness.
Audit Firm Tendering
The Committee are aware of the recommendations in the FRC UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to the expectation of the 
external audit being put out to tender every ten years.
KPMG Audit Plc has been appointed as the Auditor since the Company’s formation in 1997 and their performance has been 
reviewed annually by the Committee since that time. The Committee has remained consistently satisfied with the level of 
independence of the Auditor and the integrity of the audit process. However, given the recent changes in best practice the 
Committee has considered whether an audit firm tender should be undertaken during the 2013/2014 financial year. Given the 
appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer in April 2013 the Committee believes that it would not be in the best interests of the 
audit process or indeed in respect of risk management to undertake a tender so soon after this appointment.
The Committee does, however, intend to undertake a tender process and will seek to align this with the rotation of the Audit Director 
Engagement scheduled for 2015/2016. The timing of this would therefore allow the successful audit firm (not disallowing for the fact 
that this could be the incumbent firm) to take up its appointment when the current Audit Director stands down.
Re-appointment of Auditor
In the light of organisational changes within KPMG, the Directors have agreed that KPMG Audit Plc, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
KPMG LLP , will step down as Auditor at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and that a resolution to appoint KPMG LLP as 
Auditor and to authorise the Directors to set their remuneration will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. 
There are no contractual obligations that restrict the Committee’s capacity to recommend a particular firm as Auditor.

Audit Committee Report continued
Non-Audit Assignments
With respect to non-audit assignments undertaken by the Auditor, the Company has a policy to ensure that the provision of such 
services does not impair their independence or objectivity. Safeguards are in place to ensure continued audit independence 
including utilising separate teams to undertake the audit and non-audit work. When considering the use of the Auditor to undertake 
non-audit assignments, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer do at all times give consideration to the provisions 
of the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees with regard to the preservation of independence. To assist the Auditor’s independence 
Deloitte LLP was appointed in 2012 to undertake tax and compliance work in substitution for the Auditor.
Audit Fee Review
The fee proposals for the external audit and half-yearly results were considered and agreed in the May 2013 meeting.
Non-Audit Fees
The policy in respect of non-audit fees was reviewed and amended during the year ended 30 June 2009, whereby it was agreed 
that the non-audit fee be capped at 50% of the audit fee. Prior approval of the Committee is required should non-audit fees exceed 
the cap and an explanation of the reasons for exceeding the limit is provided to the Committee, who assess the qualification, 
expertise, independence and objectivity of the Auditor prior to granting approval.
The Committee firmly believes that there are certain non-audit services where it is appropriate for the Group to engage the Auditor. 
During the year, the Auditor was commissioned to carry out working capital and reporting accountant work in respect of the 
disposal of the Services Segment. The Auditor was considered the most cost effective and appropriate firm to perform this work 
given both their knowledge of the existing business and the requirement to report on the existing as well as the reduced Group. 
The Committee did not consider that the performance of this non-audit work would affect or impair the Auditor’s integrity. This is 
consistent with the ethical standard recommended by the Accounting Practices Board. 
A summary of audit and non-audit fees in relation to the year is provided in note 6 to the Group’s financial statements. This shows 
that non-audit work represented 135% of the annual audit fee and, in line with the above stated policy, reflects the Committee’s 
prior approval of the fees paid to the Auditor in respect of the disposal of the Services Segment. Excluding the costs relating to the 
disposal, non-audit work represented 39% of the annual audit fee.
Committee Effectiveness Review
During the year, the Committee reviewed its own effectiveness as a part of the overall Board evaluation process. The Committee 
considered that it acted transparently and given the number of Committee and Board meetings scheduled throughout the financial 
year, maintained a thorough understanding of the Group and its business. The Committee also considered it had the skills to 
perform its responsibilities. The results of the review were advised to the Board.

Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present Dechra’s Remuneration Report for the 
year ended 30 June 2013.
During the year the Remuneration Committee:
 ❱ reviewed the Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration package; 
 ❱ reviewed the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) performance metrics; and
 ❱ determine remuneration for the new Chief Financial Officer, Anne-Francoise Nesmes.
In respect of Ian Page’s remuneration package the Committee believed that a repositioning was required in order to reflect 
his experience, performance and overall contribution to the Group. With regards to the proposed changes to the LTIP 
performance metrics, the Committee was of the opinion that the introduction of another performance measure (alongside 
relative TSR) would allow for a more balanced assessment of success and reward of long term shareholder value.  
The Committee consulted with the Company’s major Shareholders on the proposed changes and, taking into account 
feedback from investors, a number of changes were made to both Ian Page’s remuneration package and the LTIP 
performance criteria. Detail in respect of these changes are contained within the following report. The Committee believes 
that these changes align and focus remuneration to reward longer term, sustainable performance.
During the year Dechra appointed a new Chief Financial Officer, Anne-Francoise Nesmes. Details of her remuneration 
package are provided in the following report including details of the one-off recruitment reward which it was agreed to grant 
her as partial compensation for the loss of share options granted to her by her previous employer. The Board considers 
Anne-Francoise as pivotal in assisting Ian Page to direct the Group to its next strategic stage and considers that it was in 
the best interests of the Company to create an overall recruitment package that would attract her to the role within Dechra 
and to incentivise and motivate her going forward during her career with the Company.
It should be noted that all the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors have agreed to waive an increase to 
their respective salaries and fees for the 2013/2014 financial year. An above inflation fee increase has been made to the 
Chairman and the reasons for this are detailed in the following report.  Below Board level the average pay increase across 
the Group was 1.5%.
During the coming months, the Committee will review LTIP performance metrics in light of the disposal of the Services 
Segment and will consult with major Shareholders as appropriate.
Finally, the Committee and I believe that ongoing dialogue with our major Shareholders is of key importance, should you 
have any queries in relation to this report please do not hesitate to contact myself or the Company Secretary.

Remuneration Policy and Practice
Summary of the Remuneration Policy
Dechra’s policy on Directors’ remuneration is to provide remuneration packages that:
 ❱ attract, retain and incentivise Executives of the calibre required to ensure that the Group is managed successfully to the benefit  
of Shareholders;
 ❱ provide appropriate alignment between Dechra’s strategic goals, Shareholder returns and executive reward; and
 ❱ have a competitive mix of base salary and short and long term incentives with a significant proportion of the package determined 
by stretching targets linked to Dechra’s performance.
In defining Dechra’s remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account best practice guidelines set by institutional investor 
bodies such as the Association of British Insurers. The Chairman of the Company also ensures the Company, through the 
Committee and its Chairman, maintains contact with major Shareholders about remuneration matters.
Key Elements of Remuneration 
The key elements of the Directors’ remuneration package are illustrated in the following table. The policy details below apply from

When considering 
base salary levels the 
Committee ensures 
that it provides the

recruit and retain talent 
amongst the Executive 
Directors. 
The Committee reviews 
base salaries annually 
and in doing so 
recognises the value of 
the individual, their skills

performance.
The Committee also 
takes into consideration:
(i) pay increases within 
the Group more  
generally; and 
(ii) Group organisation, 
profitability and prevailing 
market conditions.
Salary increases will 
normally be in line with 
the wider Group and the 
Committee considers 
any increase out of line 
with this very carefully. 
Higher increases may be 
awarded in exceptional 
circumstances, taking 
into account all relevant 
commercial factors. 
These could include: 
increase in scope and

considerably below 
market positioning or 
promotional increase.

Policy on External Appointments
The Company recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies and that 
this can help broaden the skills and experience of a Director. Executive Directors are only permitted to accept external appointments 
with the approval of the Board.
The only Executive Director to hold an external appointment is Ian Page. He is Non-Executive Chairman of Sanford DeLand Asset 
Management Limited, a position which he has held since 7 October 2010. During the year, Ian Page received no remuneration for 
this appointment.
Balance of Remuneration

Recruitment Remuneration Policy
When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will typically seek to use the Policy detailed on pages 70 to 73 to determine 
the Executive Director’s ongoing remuneration package. 
To facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre required to implement the Group’s strategy, the Committee retains the 
discretion to make remuneration decisions which are outside the Policy. In determining appropriate remuneration, the Committee will 
take into consideration all relevant factors (including the quantum and nature of remuneration) to ensure the arrangements are in the 
best interests of Dechra and its Shareholders.
The Committee may make an award in respect of hiring an employee to “buyout” incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous 
employer. In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these 
awards and the time over which they would have vested. The Committee would seek to incorporate buyout and recruitment awards to 
be in line with the Company’s remuneration framework so far as is practical. The Committee may consider other components including 
cash or shares awards, restricted stock awards and share options where there is a strong commercial rationale for doing so.
Reasonable costs and support will be covered if the recruitment requires relocation of the individual. Expat allowances may also be 
paid in these circumstances.
The Company recruited a new Chief Financial Officer, Anne-Francoise Nesmes, during the financial year, following the departure 
of Simon Evans. The Committee positioned the overall package for the new Chief Financial Officer at a level that was sufficient to 
recruit and retain a Chief Financial Officer of the required calibre and quality. Further details in respect of this can be found on  
page 79.

There are no expiry dates applicable to either Executive or Non-Executive Directors’ service contracts. The Company may, in its 
absolute discretion at any time after written notice has been given by either party, lawfully terminate the service contract by paying 
to the Director an amount equal to his basic salary entitlement for the unexpired period of notice (subject to a deduction at source of 
income tax and National Insurance contributions). In the event that the service contract is terminated before the end of any financial 
year, the Director shall not be entitled to any bonus in respect of that financial year. In December 2012 the Non-Executive Directors 
agreed to an amendment to their respective service contracts reducing the notice period after the initial 12 month period from  
12 months to three months’ termination by either party. The Non-Executive Directors are entitled to compensation on termination of 
their appointment confined to three months’ remuneration.
Individual Directors’ eligibility for the various elements of compensation is set out below:
Provision Treatment upon loss of office
Base Salary/Fees Base salary/fees and benefits based on the duration of the notice period receivable 
from the Company.
Annual Bonus This will be reviewed on an individual basis and the decision whether or not to award 
a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors including the 
circumstances of their departure and their contribution to the business during the 
bonus period in question.
Long Term Incentives Determined in line with the provisions of the relevant plan rules.
Pension This would be taken into account as part of the payment referred to in the base 
salary section.
Where applicable, payment of this compensation would be in full and final settlement of all claims other than in respect of share 
options or awards and pension arrangements. In an appropriate case the Directors would have regard to the departing Director’s 
duty to mitigate loss, except in the event of dismissal following a change of control of the Company. Other than as described above, 
there are no express provisions within the Directors’ service contracts for the payment of compensation or liquidated damages on 
termination of employment.

* Anne-Francoise Nesmes’ base salary on the date of appointment
In the last five years, salary increases for the Executive Directors have been in line with average salary increases for the wider 
employee population (approximately 2% to 3%).
During the 2012/2013 financial year, a comprehensive review of Ian Page’s remuneration was undertaken, which highlighted that 
his base salary had fallen behind that of his peers. Our policy on base salary continues to be to provide a fixed remuneration 
component which reflects the experience and capabilities of the individual in the role, the demonstrated performance of the 
individual in the role, and which is competitive in the market we operate. Following the comprehensive review of Ian Page’s 
remuneration package, and after consultation and support from the major Shareholders, the Committee unanimously concluded 
that a significant step up in salary was appropriate. This reflects a number of factors:
 ❱ his achievements since being appointed to Chief Executive Officer in 2001, in particular his energetic leadership of the business 
and the contribution he has made to the Group’s significant strategic and financial progress;
 ❱ his delivery of significant and sustained increases in Shareholder value in what has been a very difficult environment for most 
businesses. In a period where many companies have had to settle for navigating through a crisis, our business has grown in size, 
both in terms of its complexity and geography;
 ❱ his successful integration of a number of significant strategic acquisitions, most recently the acquisition of Eurovet; and
 ❱ the market positioning of the salary against companies of a similar size and complexity.
The increase in base salary in January to £440,000 represented an increase of 15%. This positions his salary around the median 
levels compared to companies of a similar size and complexity.
All the Executive Directors have agreed to waive an increase in salary for the 2013/2014 financial year.

Non-Executive Director Fees
Since 2008 the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors have been awarded inflationary increases only in respect of their fees. 
Furthermore, they waived any increase in 2009 and 2010. During the year a review of the Chairman’s remuneration during the year  
identified that his fee was substantially lower than that of other Chairmen of companies of comparable size and complexity. After 
due consideration, the Committee decided to increase his fee to a level more commensurate with his experience, performance and 
overall contribution to the business. The remaining Non-Executive Directors have agreed to waive an increase in their fees for the 
2013/2014 financial year.

Annual Bonus
The Company operates an annual cash incentive scheme for the Executive Directors. Annual bonuses were awarded by the 
Committee in respect of 2012/2013 having regard to the performance of the Group and personal performance objectives for the 
year. Details of the annual bonus scheme can be found in the table on page 71. 
The amount achieved for the year ended 30 June 2013 against targets for 2012/2013 is as follows:
2012/13 Targets Amount Achieved for the Year Ended 30 June 2013
Underlying profit before tax performance: 10% of salary payable 
upon the achievement of 95% of Group profit target rising to 90% 
of salary payable upon the achievement of 110% of Group profit 
target
The underlying profit before tax target was £47.0 million on a 
constant currency basis. Actual underlying profit before tax was 
£45.5 million reflecting 97% of the profit target resulting in a 
payment worth 26% of salary
Personal objectives: up to an additional 10% of salary was 
payable to Executive Directors upon the achievement of personal 
objectives
Actual performance resulted in payment worth 10% of salary. 
The objectives are based on key aspects of delivering the 
Group’s strategy

Long Term Incentive Arrangements and Share Schemes
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
LTIP Awards Vesting During the Year Ended 30 June 2013
With respect to the awards granted on 22 December 2010, the performance targets are:
1) an ‘underpin’ condition based on Group underlying diluted earnings per share performance:  no awards will vest if the Group’s 
underlying diluted earnings per share has not grown by at least RPI +3% per annum over the performance period;
2) the Company’s TSR performance: assuming that the underpin is achieved, vesting of the awards will be determined by the 
Company’s TSR performance compared to the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap Index at the start of the performance period. 
The TSR will be calculated by comparing average performance over three months prior to the start and end of the performance 
period. Vesting will be on the following basis:
TSR Performance Vesting Percentage
Below median 0%
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata vesting based on the Company’s ranking in the 
comparator group
Upper quartile 100%
As set out on page 82 for the three year period to 30 June 2013 the Company’s TSR performance was over 98% compared with an 
84% TSR for live companies in the top quartile of the comparator group. In addition the Group’s underlying diluted EPS increased by 
44.09% over the performance period as a result the LTIPs awarded in December 2010 will vest fully.
LTIP Awards Made During the Year Ended 30 June 2013
Awards were granted to the Executive Directors on 5 March 2013, on the following basis:
 ❱ 150% of salary for Ian Page; and
 ❱ 100% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
In various consultations with our major Shareholders, we have received strong support for the introduction of another performance 
measure alongside relative TSR under the LTIP to allow for a more balanced assessment of success and to reward the delivery 
of long term Shareholder value. Following consultation, the Committee resolved that 50% of the LTIP award will continue to be 
based on the Company’s relative TSR performance (relative to the FTSE 250) and 50% will be based on stretching EPS targets. 
Furthermore, to ensure the quality of earnings and delivery of other key financial performance indicators the vesting of awards under 
the LTIP will be subject to an additional Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) underpin.
Following the disposal of the Services Segment, and in line with the LTIP scheme rules, the Committee are in the process 
of reviewing the performance targets attaching to the LTIP awards granted in March 2013 and intends to consult with major 
Shareholders by the end of the calendar year in respect of the same.

Recruitment Award for Anne-Francoise Nesmes
On appointment the Committee agreed to award Anne-Francoise Nesmes two LTIP awards to the value of 100% of her base salary:
 ❱ 100% to be subject to a performance period ending 30 June 2014 with a further one year’s continued employment subject to 
claw back; and 
 ❱ 100% to be subject to a performance period ending 30 June 2015. This tranche will be subject to the same performance 
conditions as those attaching to the LTIP awards granted to the Executive Directors on 5 March 2013.
In the event of a change of control of the Company prior to the vesting dates stated above, the Remuneration Committee has 
confirmed that it will exercise its discretion to allow the two LTIP awards to vest in full and that the performance conditions would  
be waived.
The rationale behind the additional LTIP grants was as an offer of partial compensation for the loss of Performance Share Plan 
and Share Value Plan awards which Anne-Francoise Nesmes had been granted by her previous employer and which lapsed 
on the cessation of her employment with them. When Anne-Francoise Nesmes commenced her appointment with Dechra the 
Company was deemed to be in a close period by reason of the disposal of the Services Segment and therefore unable to grant 
the recruitment award. It is therefore proposed that both awards will be granted as a nil-cost option in early September (once the 
Company has announced its year end results). The grant will be made outside of the LTIP scheme rules and will be satisfied using 
market purchase shares. 
LTIP Awards for the Year Ending 30 June 2014
To align and focus Ian Page’s total remuneration package to reward longer term, sustainable performance the Committee granted 
a LTIP award to Ian Page of 150% of his salary in March 2013 and has proposed, after due consultation with major Shareholders, 
to award 200% of salary in respect of future financial years. Shareholder approval will be sought at the Annual General Meeting for 
the increase in long term incentive opportunity to 200% of salary. However, for the avoidance of doubt this level of award will not be 
a guaranteed entitlement. Whilst the Committee intends to make awards up to 200% of salary to Ian Page in the future, in line with 
best practice the Committee will review the level of award to be made each year and this level of award will be dependent on the 
Committee’s assessment of the continued growth and financial success of the Group and Ian Page’s personal performance. 
The Committee intends to make awards of 150% of base salary to Anne-Francoise Nesmes on an annual basis.
LTIP awards for the other Executive Directors will remain at 100% of base salary.
Payments to Past Directors
There were no payments made to past Directors during the period.
Payments for Loss of Office
A compensation payment was made to Simon Evans during the financial year and equated to 12 months of his salary and benefits 
plus the use of a company car until the expiry of the lease (31 March 2015). A compensation payment was also made to Bryan 
Morton during the financial year which equated to two months of his salary. No other compensation payments were made to 
Executive or Non-Executive Directors during the year.

3% per annum over the performance period) has been met; and the Group’s TSR performance for the three year period to  
30 June 2013 was in the top quartile of the FTSE Small Cap Total Return Index. The ‘underpin’ condition was tested by the Group 
and was not verified by Deloitte. Therefore the awards will vest in full.
The aggregate gain made by the Executive Directors on share options exercised during 2013 was £5,187 (2012: £727,997).

Corporate Responsibility, Social, Ethical  
and Environmental Responsibilities
A responsible approach to our stakeholders and the wider community is considered by the Board to be fundamental to the 
business. The conduct of the business towards social, environmental, ethical and health and safety issues is recognised to have an 
impact on our reputation and therefore the implementation and improvement of policies and systems is ongoing.
The Board takes ultimate responsibility for Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) and continues to be committed to developing 
and implementing appropriate policies that create and maintain long term value for all stakeholders. Sound business ethics help to 
minimise risk, ensure legal compliance and enhance Company efficiency. 
The Sustainability Committee (the “Committee”) was set up in October 2009. It has terms of reference which were approved 
by the Board in July 2010, copies of which can be obtained from the Company Secretary or via the Company’s website at 
www.dechra.com. The Committee is chaired by Ed Torr, the nominated Director responsible for environmental policy. The Company 
Secretary is secretary to the Committee. The Committee is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s social, ethical 
and environmental policy. The following report details how we have applied the main principles of this policy, a full copy of which can 
be obtained from the Company Secretary or via the Company website. 
Social Responsibilities
The Board recognises that the Group has a responsibility to its stakeholders and therefore encourages the business units to 
contribute to the social and economic welfare of the local communities in which they operate. It recognises that by taking voluntary 
action in this area it is helping to protect and develop its own business.
As reported in the 2011 Annual Report the Committee established a Group Donations Policy, which became effective  
1 July 2011. From this date, the Group will donate up to £10,000 a year to be split between an animal welfare charity, an 
environmental charity and an employee nominated charity. All employees within the Group are entitled to nominate a charity or a 
non-commercial organisation. During 2012 the chosen charities were:
Environmental Charity 
 ❱ Staffordshire Wildlife Trust: As in previous years Dechra has maintained its investment in the Corporate Membership Scheme for 
the Staffordshire Wildlife Trust (the “Trust”). The continued support provided by the Company has assisted the Trust to continue 
with their education, conservation and community projects throughout Staffordshire.
Employee Charity
 ❱ An employee at DVP EU took part in the Vatternrundan, an organised cycle race in Sweden which has been held over the last 
48 years. This year there were over 23,000 cyclists who started the 300km circuit around Lake Vattern. The employee raised 
£2,500 which was matched by the Company, and the funds donated to Cancer Research UK. 
In addition to the annual Group donation each business unit has discretion to allocate funds to local community groups,  
employee nominated charities and/or animal welfare charities. Below is a selection of what has taken place during the 2012/2013 
financial year.
Animal Welfare
 ❱ As in previous years, many of our businesses have donated obsolete and/or short dated stock, damaged products and 
consumables to various charities, ensuring that such stock is not provided to charities where the donation-in-kind could be sold 
to third parties. DVP UK continued to provide assistance to a charity called Help the Street Cats of Morocco which it has been 
involved with since 2006 providing supplies of Atipam, Canaural, Cleanaural, Fucithalmic and Sedator. NVS donated dog food to 
City Dogs Home. 
Environment
 ❱ DVP EU has continued to donate DKK0.02 for every kilowatt per hour used for the period 2011 to 2015 to Energreen ApS for the 
construction of new green energy production facilities within Denmark.
Other
 ❱ Each year DVP EU nominates a Danish charity. This year they donated DKK2,000 to the Danish Cancer Foundation. Furthermore 
as reported in the previous Annual Report, DVP EU has continued its sponsorship of three children through SOS Children’s 
Villages.
 ❱ Dechra Laboratory Services has maintained its links with local schools by offering a number of work experience placements to six 
children from local schools and four veterinary students.

Business Ethics
The Board expects all of the Group’s business activities to be conducted in accordance with the highest standards of ethical 
conduct and in full compliance with all applicable national and international legislation; in doing so we aim to maintain a reputation 
for acting responsibly and with integrity.
The Board has formalised its expectations in respect of business conduct into a policy known as The Code of Business Conduct 
(the “Code”). The Code aims to set a standard of conduct which applies throughout the Group and ensures, amongst other  
things, that:
 ❱ all third parties are treated fairly, openly and honestly;
 ❱ our employees do not accept or offer bribes, facilitation payments or other inducements; and 
 ❱ employees must avoid direct and indirect conflicts of interest (and where this is not possible, the employee must follow the 
procedure set out in the Code in order to ensure that the employee is removed from the position of conflict as soon as possible).
A whistle-blowing policy is also in place whereby employees report, in confidence, any suspected wrongdoings within the business 
which they feel unable to discuss directly with local management. Details of the whistle-bowing policy are detailed on the Company 
website at www.dechra.com. 
The Dechra Values were launched in June 2011 across the business. Further information can be found on pages 88 to 89 and via 
the Company’s website at www.dechra.com. The Board fully endorses these Values and believes that they encapsulate Dechra’s 
business ethics and set standards that all employees should strive to achieve and ultimately exceed.
Environmental Policy
The Group recognises the importance of good environmental controls. It is the Group’s policy to comply with environmental 
legislation currently in place, adopt responsible environmental practices and give consideration to minimising the impact of its 
operations on the environment. Dechra has commenced collating the data to comply with the forthcoming Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, which requires all UK quoted companies to report on their greenhouse 
gas emissions as part of their annual Directors’ Report. This will be included in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts. 
In terms of fuel, travel and waste we can report for the 2012/2013 financial year the following changes: 
Fuel
With respect to the 2012/2013 financial year, Dechra, as reported in the 2012 Report, has undertaken a review of the Company 
Car provision with the view of standardising the offering and reducing CO
2
 emission. The two lower car bands, which account for 
over 55% of the Company Car fleet, have been amalgamated and the choice of car has been reduced to two models from the 
same manufacturer which are generating between 108 and 116 CO
2
g per km. In addition band three has been capped at 160 
CO
2
/km, which account for a further 22% of the car fleet. The light commercial fleet of over 130 delivery vans now integrate an 
alternative range of vehicles including small VW Caddy vans returning over 46 mpg, as opposed to the previously standard vehicle 
that delivered only 32 mpg. The HGV fleet has been limited to 53mph and the Gloucester and Tiverton trunking routes have been 
amalgamated allowing the release of one HGV tractor unit and trailer which has resulted in a saving of least 200 miles per day. 
The average miles per gallon as at the end of June 2013 and June 2012 were as follows: 
2013 2012
HGV Fleet 10.71 9.92
Transit 32.34 32.64
The HGV fleet complies with the Euro 5 standard, a European regulation which sets emission limits for each category of pollutant 
emissions, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and combined emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. 
Following the disposal of the Services Segment in August 2013, Dechra will have a reduced car fleet and no commercial vehicles  
in the UK.

Corporate Responsibility, Social, Ethical  
and Environmental Responsibilities continued
Travel
In respect of travel, use of the video conference facilities is recommended as priority over travel. Video conference facilities are 
installed at PLC, DVP UK, DVP US, Skipton, Bladel, Netherlands and Uldum, Denmark. Whilst the Company appreciates that 
face to face meetings are beneficial the use of video conference facilities substantially reduces the amount of travel by car and 
aeroplanes.
Waste
In respect of waste, the Group is a registered member of the Waste Packaging Obligations Regulations compliance scheme. 
The general waste is then sorted for collection by third party waste management companies. Dechra Manufacturing Skipton also 
actively monitors its recycling rates. This facility continues to comply with, and exceed, effluent discharge standards into local water 
supplies, which is subject to random monitoring by Yorkshire Water Authority. Standard operating procedures are in place to ensure 
that all contaminated waste is disposed of under strict controls. Furthermore, all exhaust air is fully filtered from the manufacturing 
unit before discharge into the environment. DVP EU is legally obliged to submit an environmental impact report to the Danish 
Ministry of Environment on an annual basis.
The Group continues to review its environmental controls and encourage its own staff, suppliers and customers to achieve similar 
standards.
Health and Safety Policy
The Group attaches great importance to the health and safety of its employees and the public. The management are responsible 
and committed to the maintenance, monitoring and promotion of a policy of health and safety at work to ensure the care and  
well-being of its employees and on-site visitors. 
Each unit within the Group has an active Health and Safety Committee comprising representatives from both management and 
employees. The workforce nominates employee representatives. These committees meet on a regular basis to carry out a review 
of risk assessments and standard operating procedures as well as investigating any concerns raised by individual employees. Each 
site has the requisite number of employees trained in health and safety legislation.
For a number of years the Group has reported Lost Time Accident Frequency Rates (“LTAFR”) as a non-financial key performance 
indicator (see pages 38 to 39). The LTAFR is a calculation of all injuries that would be statutorily reportable under the Reporting 
of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (“RIDDOR”), normalised per 100,000 hours worked. This measure 
provides information to help monitor and control accidents and injuries to the workforce and is widely used as a key performance 
indicator throughout industry. The Company reports LTAFR on the same basis as in previous years, that is over-three day incidents. 
Over the course of the last 12 months the number of accidents has decreased from 10 to 5, none of which resulted in a work-
related fatality or disability. It is hoped to reduce this further during the 2013/2014 financial year. 
Any material health and safety issues or incidents which occur are discussed in detail at both the monthly business unit board 
meetings and the PLC Board meetings. The discussions include details of the incident that took place and also details of any 
remedial action which has been taken in order to mitigate or prevent a recurrence of the incident. Twice a year a comprehensive 
health and safety report is presented at each of the business unit board meetings and subsequently reported to the PLC Board 
meeting the following month for discussion and review by the Directors.

The Transport Risk Committee assesses risks relating to the Group fleet and establishes control procedures, including regular 
licence checks of all individuals who are able to drive company vehicles, investigations into all accidents and a disciplinary procedure 
for speeding offences. During the year an online driver risk assessment was undertaken by all new Company car and commercial 
vehicle drivers as part of their induction. The results of the assessment enables the Company to identify any drivers at risk and to 
provide further training to those drivers. It is intended that all drivers will be reassessed every three years. The investment so far in 
respect of the online driver assessments has had a positive impact on the number of insurance claims with both the frequency and 
severity of accidents having been reduced. Due to the disposal of the Services Segment this committee has met once during the 
year and its terms of reference will be reassessed in light of this disposal. All issues raised by this committee are reviewed by the 
Board as part of the bi-annual health and safety review. 
Employees
We recognise that the success of the Group is dependent on our ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain skilled employees. 
For a number of years the Group has reported labour turnover as a non-financial KPI using a standard formula as follows:
Total number of leavers over a period
x 100
Average total number employed over period
The Group has established a target of no more than 15% Moving Annual Turnover; during the 2012/2013 financial year we achieved 
14.84% (2012: 16.10%). 
Dechra Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Skipton is registered with ‘Investors in People’ and has continued in its commitment to 
people development through a number of apprentices embarking on the Modern Apprenticeship Scheme. Such employees are 
assisted in achieving National Vocational Qualifications (“NVQ”) as part of their apprenticeship, usually work-based but also involving 
literacy and numeracy modules.
It is the Company’s policy to provide equal recruitment and other opportunities for all employees, regardless of age, sex, sexual 
orientation, religion, race or disability. The Group gives full consideration to applications from disabled people, where they adequately 
fulfil the requirements of the role. Where existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s policy whenever practicable to 
provide continuing employment under the Company’s terms and conditions and to provide training and career development 
whenever appropriate. 
The Group continues to encourage employees to share in the growth of the Company through eligibility to participate in the SAYE 
Scheme. The SAYE Scheme is currently offered to UK employees only; the take-up for the December 2012 grant was 21.59% 
(December 2011: 15.34%). The graph below shows the percentage of employees who have taken up the SAYE Scheme over the 
last five years.

An effective values system aims to provide 
the Dechra Group with many benefits, from 
committed and happy employees to the 
best possible relationships with suppliers 
and customers. The Values play a vital role 
in bringing consistency to all the businesses 
across the Group, enabling all employees to 
be aware of what is expected of them and 
how they can achieve that. 
The initiative to define and communicate the 
Dechra Values began over two years ago. 
At the time, 75% of FTSE 100 companies 
had published sets of values, and Dechra 
recognised that there were many benefits to 
be drawn from creating and disseminating 
their own values across the Group. A 
steering group was formed in 2011 with HR 
and senior management involvement from 
each business within the Group. One of the 
aims of this group being to define a set of 
values which reflected the best aspects of 
personality and behaviour in Dechra, whilst 
also providing standards that could be 
used as a tool in managing and measuring 
employee performance.
The discussions of the steering group led 
to the creation of the six Dechra Values: 
Dedication, Enjoyment, Courage, Honesty, 
Relationships and Ambition (conveniently 
spelling Dechra), which were launched Group 
wide in July 2011. Within a year of the launch 
all employees across Dechra had received a 
Standards Guide along with training on the 
Values, explaining what each Value meant for 
them individually and how it should be applied 
alongside examples of behaviour that (i) did 
not meet the standard, (ii) met the standard, 
and (iii) exceeded the standard.
The Values have rolled out across all territories 
within which we have a legal entity, being 
initially translated into Danish, Spanish and 
French, and subsequently being integrated 
into newly acquired companies. Dutch and 
German translations will soon follow to 
allow for the Values to be rolled out to the 
more recently acquired Eurovet business. 
To demonstrate the ongoing commitment 
to these ideals, they have also become part 
of the recruitment and induction process, 
ensuring new recruits reflect and embrace the 
Values at every level of the business. 
Over the last 12 months, work has been 
ongoing to solidify the use of the Values 
across the Group with a number of 
developments in progress, most notably a 
pilot programme for the Performance and 
Development Review (“PDR”) process. This 
pilot, which came to an end in June 2013, 
trialled Dechra’s first universal appraisal 
scheme to 100 people, and met with very 
positive feedback from those involved. 
The PDR process involves three elements, 
with employees being measured against 
(i) their own role or Accountabilities, (ii) 
personal objectives (created uniquely for 
each employee) and (iii) the Dechra Values. 
Following the success of the pilot, it is 
intended that the PDR process will be spread 
further throughout the Group, demonstrating 
the integral part that the Values will play in 
career development at Dechra.   
Dechra Values
“Values play a vital role 
in enabling all employees 
to be aware of what is 
expected of them”
88 Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2013 Our Governance 22581-04    22/08/2013    Proof 3
The PDR process is just one of a number of 
ways in which we can focus on “making the 
Values live”. A branded marketing campaign is 
about to launch with the aim of increasing the 
visibility of the Values, and all employees will 
be made aware of the progress of the initiative 
to date.
Other future activity will see the Values become 
more prominent in everyday team briefings, 
workshops held to delve deeper and increase 
understanding of the Values, a growing 
presence on the intranet, and general activities 
to keep team members engaged with the 
Values in their day-to-day working life.
There is also the ambition for a recognition 
scheme to reward exceptional employees 
in future, reflecting the positive effects that 
the Values initiative has had on individuals 
and on the business as a whole. Whilst not 
measurable at its current stage, by improving 
performance at an individual and team level, 
the financial and operating performance can 
only benefit from the Group wide investment 
in the Values that has taken place so far and 
that will continue to increase.
“By improving 
performance at an 
individual and team 
level, the financial and 
operating performance 
can only benefit from the 
Group wide investment 
in the Values that has 
taken place so far and 
that will continue to 
increase”

Directors’ Report: Other Disclosures continued
Change of Control/Significant Agreements
As detailed in the Going Concern Statement on page 58 the Group has bank facilities with a syndicate of banks comprising  
Lloyds TSB Bank plc, Barclays Bank PLC, Svenska Handelsbanken AB (PUBL) and HSBC Bank Plc (the “Bank”). Under the terms 
of these facilities the Bank can give notice to the Company to repay all amounts outstanding under the facilities and cancel the 
commitments where there is a change of control of the Company. No other agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the Company following a takeover bid are considered to be significant in terms of their potential impact on the 
business as a whole.
The Company does not have agreements with any director or employee that provides compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover, other than the Company share schemes. Under such schemes outstanding options and 
awards normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at 
that time. With the exception of Anne-Francoise Nesmes the Remuneration Committee has confirmed that it would exercise its own 
discretion to vest in full should a change of control of the Company occur before the LTIP awards vest.
The Directors consider that there are no contracted or other arrangements, such as those with major suppliers, which are likely to 
influence, directly or indirectly, the performance of the business and its values. Furthermore, there are no contracts of significance 
subsisting during the financial year between any group undertaking and a controlling Shareholder or in which a Director is or was 
materially interested.
Directors
The constitution of the Board and its Committees, together with biographical notes on the Directors, is shown on pages 48 to 
49. Details of Directors’ attendance at Board and Committee meetings and a statement on Board evaluation are set out in the 
Corporate Governance Report, Audit Committee Report and Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 60, 62 and 68. 
During the financial year under review the following Board changes occurred:
 ❱ Bryan Morton resigned from his position as Non-Executive Director; 
 ❱ Julian Heslop and Ishbel Macpherson were appointed to the Board as Non-Executive Directors on 1 January and 1 February 
2013 respectively; and 
 ❱ Tony Griffin and Anne-Francoise Nesmes were appointed to the Board as Executive Directors on 1 November 2012 and 22 April 
2013 respectively. 
As at May 2013 Neil Warner has served 10 years as a Non-Executive Director and has expressed an intention to retire from the 
Board at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Under the Company’s Articles of Association Julian Heslop, Ishbel Macpherson, Tony Griffin and Anne-Francoise Nesmes will 
offer themselves for election as Directors at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Under the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all the remaining Directors will retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and offer themselves for  
re-election.
The interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company are shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 67 to 83. During 
the year no Director had a disclosable material interest in any contract or arrangement with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 
Information in relation to the Directors’ remuneration is disclosed in the Remuneration Report.
The Articles of Association state that a Director may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of the Shareholders or by the Directors, 
either to fill a vacancy or as an addition to the existing Board but so that the total number of Directors does not exceed the 
maximum number of Directors allowed pursuant to the Articles of Association. The maximum number of Directors currently allowed 
pursuant to the Articles of Association is ten.
The Articles of Association also state that the Board of Directors is responsible for the management of the business of the Company 
and in doing so may exercise all the powers of the Company subject to the provision of relevant legislation and the Company’s 
constitutional documentation. The powers of the Directors set out in the Articles of Association include those in relation to the issue 
and buy-back of shares.

indemnity provision in place during the financial year and at the date of this report. A copy of the indemnity provision will be available

given on page 84.

Events After the Reporting Period
On 10 July 2013 the Company entered into a conditional agreement for the sale of its Services Segment, namely, NVS, Dechra 
Laboratory Services and Dechra Specialist Laboratories to Patterson Companies, Inc for a total effective consideration of  
£87.5 million. The sale completed on 16 August 2013. 
Auditor

KPMG LLP , step down as Auditor of the Company at the Annual General Meeting and that a resolution to appoint KPMG LLP as 
Auditor and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Audit Information
Each of the Directors who held office at the date of the approval of the Directors’ Report confirms that, so far as he or she is aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Auditor is unaware, and each Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to 
have undertaken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Auditor is 
aware of that information.
Annual General Meeting
The 2013 Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held at 4.00 pm on 17 October 2013 at its offices at 24 Cheshire 
Avenue, Cheshire Business Park, Lostock Gralam, Northwich CW9 7UA. The notice of meeting, which includes special business 
to be transacted at the Annual General Meeting, is included within the Circular accompanying this Annual Report, together with an 
explanation of the resolutions to be considered at the meeting.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect of the  
Annual Report and the Financial Statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law 
and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable 
law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 ❱ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 ❱ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 ❱ for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
 ❱ for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent Company financial statements; and 
 ❱ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such 
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement Required under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
1) The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole; and
2) The management report, which comprises the Directors’ Report and the Directors’ Strategic Report and Operating Review, 
includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
For the year ended 30 June 2013

Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2013 Our Financials 22581.04  10 September 2013 1:31 PM Proof 3
1. Accounting Policies
Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the 
Group for the year ended 30 June 2013 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries.
(a) Statement of Compliance
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP and they are separately presented on pages 147 to 155.
(b) Basis of Preparation
The Group’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic Report and Operating Review on pages 3 to 47. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. Refer to the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 58 for details.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand. They are prepared on a 
going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except where International Financial Reporting Standards require 
an alternative treatment. The principal variations relate to derivative financial instruments, cash settled share-based transactions 
and contingent consideration that are stated at fair value.
The preparation for consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of accounting estimates and 
for management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. These judgements 
and estimates are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions 
under review and the actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates. Areas involving a high degree of judgement or 
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are, where 
necessary, disclosed separately.
Discontinued Operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a 
view to resale. Classification of a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to 
be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income 
statement is presented as if the operation had discontinued from the start of the comparative period. The disposal of the 
Services Division, as described in note 29, gives rise to a discontinued operation and restatement of comparatives.
Critical Judgements in applying the Group’s Accounting Policies and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors have made the following judgements and estimates 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. The key sources of estimation 
uncertainty which may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are also discussed below.
Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets
The Group determines whether goodwill and indefinite life assets are impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an 
estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which they are allocated. Estimating the value in use requires 
the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and also to choose a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Further detail on the assumptions used in determining 
value in use calculations is provided in note 13.
Valuation of Intangible Assets
Product rights and customer relationships that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at fair 
value at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Fair value at the date of acquisition reflects management’s judgement of the fair value of the individual intangible asset 
calculated by reference to the net present value of future benefits accruing to the Group from the utilisation of the asset, 
discounted at an appropriate discount rate.

1. Accounting Policies continued
Impairment of Receivables
The Group has estimated impairment of receivables by assessing recoverability of amounts due on a customer by customer 
basis. As described in note 22, credit risk is not highly concentrated for continuing operations.
Capitalisation of Development Costs
The Group applies judgement when assessing the probability that regulatory approval will be achieved for development 
projects and that those projects are commercially viable. This enables management to ascertain whether the criteria for the 
capitalisation of development costs have been met. 
Adoption of New and Revised Standards
The following standards and interpretations are applicable to the Group and have been adopted in the current period as they 
are mandatory for the year ended 30 June 2013 but either have no material impact on the result or net assets of the Group or 
are not applicable.
 ❱ Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’  — amends how components of other 
income are presented. The amendments require the grouping of other comprehensive income into items that might be 
reclassified to the income statement in subsequent periods and items that will not be reclassified to the income statement in 
subsequent periods.
 ❱ Amendment to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes — Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets’ — introduces a presumption for 
deferred tax purposes that recovery of the carrying amount of an investment property will normally be through sale.
In addition to the above, amendments to a number of standards under the annual improvements project to IFRS, which are 
mandatory for the year ended 30 June 2013, have been adopted in the year. 
The adoption of these standards and amendments has not had a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
New Standards and Interpretations not yet Adopted
The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption, but 
have not yet been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
 ❱ IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ — effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
 ❱ IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ — effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
 ❱ IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’  — effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
 ❱ IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurements’ — effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
 ❱ IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Separate Financial Statements’ — effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
 ❱ Amendment to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ — effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of the above amendments will have a material effect on its financial 
statements on initial adoption.

(c) Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiary Undertakings
Subsidiary undertakings are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They cease to be 
consolidated from the date that the Group no longer has control. All subsidiary undertakings have been consolidated.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are 
eliminated on consolidation.
The financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are prepared to the same reporting date as the Company. During the 
2012/2013 financial year the reporting dates of the previously acquired Eurovet companies have been brought in line with the 
Company.
(d)  Foreign Currency Translation
(i) Functional and Presentational Currency
   The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Group’s presentational currency and are 
rounded to the nearest thousand, except where it is deemed relevant to disclose the amounts to the nearest pound. 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
(ii) Foreign Currency Translation
  Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the 
dates of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and 
from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income 
statement, with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to effective cash flow hedges, which are 
recognised in other comprehensive income.
(iii) Foreign Operations
   The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Sterling at the closing rate at the reporting date. The 
income and expenses are translated to Sterling at the average rate for the period being reported. Foreign currency 
differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the foreign currency translation reserve, a separate 
component of equity. 
  Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of 
the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. On disposal of a foreign entity, accumulated exchange differences 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement in the same period in 
which the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
(e)  Accounting for Financial Assets, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
  The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: held for trading financial assets and loans and 
receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
  Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition in accordance with IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date for financial assets 
other than those held at fair value through the income statement.
  Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been 
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Gains and losses (both realised 
and unrealised) arising from changes in the value of financial assets held at fair value through the income statement are 
included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
  The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired.

1. Accounting Policies continued
  Held for Trading Financial Assets
  This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value through the 
income statement at inception. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of 
selling in the short term or if so designated by management. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are also 
categorised as held for trading. Held for trading financial assets are recognised and subsequently carried at fair value.
  Derivative Financial Instruments
  The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.  In 
accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
  Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are remeasured to fair 
value at each reporting date.
  Cash Flow Hedges
  Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in other 
comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair 
value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
  If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, 
then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income remains there until the forecast transaction occurs. When the hedged item is a non-financial 
asset, the amount recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is 
recognised. In other cases, the amount recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement 
in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
  Trade Receivables
  Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income 
statement in operating expenses.
  Trade and Other Payables
  Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
  Borrowings and Borrowing Costs
  Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
  Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability 
for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
  Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets, which are assets 
that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the 
income statement in the period in which they are incurred.

(f)  Property, Plant and Equipment
  Owned Assets
  Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment 
losses (see accounting policy (j)).
  Leased Assets
  Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as finance leases. Assets acquired by finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the 
present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses.
  Depreciation
  Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an 
item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated 
until the date the assets become available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
  
 ❱ freehold buildings 25 years
 ❱ short leasehold buildings period of lease
 ❱ plant and fixtures 3–10 years
 ❱ motor vehicles 4 years
 The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
(g)  Intangible Assets
  Goodwill
  All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on 
acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since  
1 July 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the separable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
  In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the 
amount recorded under previous GAAP . The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that 
occurred prior to 1 July 2004 were not reconsidered in preparing the Group’s opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 July 2004.
  For acquisitions prior to 1 July 2009, costs directly attributable to business combinations formed part of the consideration 
payable when calculating goodwill. Adjustments to contingent consideration, and therefore the consideration payable and 
goodwill, are made at each reporting date until the consideration is fully determined. 
  Acquisitions after this date fall under the provisions of ‘Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2009)’. For these 
acquisitions, transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, are expensed as incurred and subsequent 
adjustments to the fair value of consideration payable are recognised in the income statement.
  Contingent consideration is measured at fair value based on an estimate of the expected future payments. 
  Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but is allocated to cash 
generating units and is tested annually for impairment.

1. Accounting Policies continued
  Research and Development Costs
  Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and 
understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense is incurred.
  The Group is also engaged in development activity with a view to bringing new pharmaceutical products to market. 
Internally generated costs of development are capitalised in the consolidated statement of financial position unless 
those costs cannot be measured reliably or it is not probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group, in 
which case the relevant costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred. Due to the strict regulatory process 
involved, there is inherent uncertainty as to the technical feasibility of development projects often until regulatory approval 
is achieved, with the possibility of failure even at a late stage. The Group considers that this uncertainty means that the 
criteria for capitalisation are not met unless it is highly probable that regulatory approval will be achieved and the project is 
commercially viable.
  Where development costs are capitalised, the expenditure includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate 
proportion of overheads.
  Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
  Acquired Intangible Assets
  Intangible assets recognised as a result of a business combination are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
  Other Intangible Assets
  Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and other intangibles is recognised in the income statement as an 
expense is incurred.
  Subsequent Expenditure
  Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits 
embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
  Amortisation
  Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets 
unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for 
impairment at each consolidated statement of financial position date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date 
that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
  
 ❱ software 5 years
 ❱ capitalised development costs 5–10 years or period of patent
 ❱ patent rights Period of patent
 ❱ marketing authorisations Indefinite life
 ❱ product rights 10–15 years
 ❱ customer relationships 10 years
(h)  Inventories
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
  The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the 
inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in 
progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.

1. Accounting Policies continued
(i)  Cash and Cash Equivalents
  Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the 
purpose of the statement of cash flows.
(j)  Impairment
  The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each consolidated statement of financial position date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated.
  The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
  For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the 
recoverable amount is estimated at each consolidated statement of financial position date and when there is an indication 
that the asset is impaired.
  An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
  Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units (group of units), and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets 
in the units (group of units) on a pro-rata basis.
  An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
  In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine 
the recoverable amount.
  An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
(k)  Dividends
  Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s Shareholders or, in the case of an 
interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
(l)  Employee Benefits
   Pensions
  The Group operates a stakeholder personal pension scheme for certain employees. Obligations for contributions are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
  Dechra Veterinary Products SAS and Dechra Veterinary Products BV participate in state-run pension arrangements. 
These are not considered to be material to the Group financial statements and are accounted for as defined contribution 
schemes, with contributions being recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
  The Group sponsors defined benefit arrangements in certain countries, the most material being a defined benefit pension 
plan in the Netherlands. This is a funded career average pay arrangement, where pensionable salary is subject to a cap. 
The arrangement is financed through an insurance contract.

1. Accounting Policies continued 
  The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. 
  That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The liability 
discount rate is the yield at the Statement of Financial Position date using AA rated corporate bonds that have maturity 
dates approximating to the terms of the group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit credit method.
  All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Group’s obligation in respect of a scheme are recognised 
immediately in reserves and reported in the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Where the calculation 
results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or 
reductions in future contributions to the plan.
    Shar e-based Payment T ransactions
  The Group operates a number of equity settled share-based payment programmes that allow employees to acquire shares 
in the Company. The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Plan for Directors and Senior Executives.
  The fair value of shares or options granted is recognised as an employee expense over the vesting period on a straight-line 
basis in the income statement with a corresponding movement to equity reserves. Fair values are determined by use of 
an appropriate pricing model and are determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted. The amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the 
number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
  At each consolidated statement of financial position date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives 
that are expected to vest. The impact of the revisions of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves, over the remaining vesting period.
  The fair values of grants under the Long Term Incentive Plan have been determined using the Monte Carlo simulation 
model.
  The fair values of options granted under all other share option schemes have been determined using the Black–Scholes 
option pricing model.
  National Insurance contributions payable by the Company on the intrinsic value of share-based payments at the date of 
exercise are treated as cash settled awards and revalued to market price at each consolidated statement of financial 
position date.
(m)  Revenue Recognition
  Revenue comprises the fair value of goods sold and services provided to external customers, net of value added tax, 
rebates, promotions and returns. For both Pharmaceuticals and Services, revenue from the sale of goods is recognised 
in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. This is 
normally when the buyer takes delivery of the goods. 
  For services provided, revenue is recognised when the contractual service has been provided to the customer. No revenue 
is recognised where the recovery of the consideration is not probable or where there are significant uncertainties regarding 
associated costs or the possible return of goods.

(n)  Leases
  Operating Leases
  Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement evenly over the period of the lease, as an 
integral part of the total lease expense.
  Finance Leases
  Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability using 
the effective interest method.
(o)  Net Financing Costs
  Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, unwinding of discount on provisions, interest receivable on 
funds invested, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement (see accounting 
policy (e)) and gains or losses on the retranslation of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. 
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues. The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. The interest 
expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate 
method.
(p)  Basis of Charge for Taxation
  Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in the income 
statement except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income.
  Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous years.
  Deferred tax is provided using the consolidated statement of financial position liability method and represents the tax 
payable or recoverable on most temporary differences which arise between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes (the tax base). Temporary differences are not 
provided on: goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither 
accounting nor taxable profit and do not arise from a business combination; and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided 
is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, and is based 
upon tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date.
  A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is not probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realised against future taxable profits. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
consolidated statement of financial position date.
  Current and deferred tax credits received in respect of share-based payments are recognised in the Income Statement 
to the extent that they do not exceed the standard rate of taxation on the Income Statement charge for share-based 
payments. Credits in excess of the standard rate of taxation are recognised directly in equity.

1. Accounting Policies continued
(q)  Earnings per Share
  The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated 
by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary Shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit attributable to ordinary Shareholders 
and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, for the effects of all potential dilutive ordinary shares, which 
comprise share options granted to employees.
  There was a Rights Issue during the year ended 30 June 2012 and EPS figures have been restated to reflect the bonus 
element of this issue.
  The Group has also chosen to present an alternative EPS measure, with profit adjusted for non-underlying items. A 
reconciliation of this alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in notes 4 and 5.
2. Operating Segments
The Group has four reportable segments, as discussed below, which are based on information provided to the Board of 
Directors, which is deemed to be the Group’s chief operating decision maker. Several operating segments which have similar 
economic characteristics have been aggregated into the reporting segments.
The Services Segment comprises National Veterinary Services, Dechra Laboratory Services and Dechra Specialist 
Laboratories. This Segment services UK veterinary practices in both the companion animal and livestock sectors. On 10 July 
2013, the Group announced its intention to dispose of the Services businesses. The disposal is consistent with the Group’s 
long term policy to focus its activities on the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The Segment was not 
a discontinued operation or classified as held for sale at 30 June 2012 and the comparative consolidated income statement 
has been represented to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations. Refer to note 29 for further 
details, and segmental analysis in relation to the Services Division.
The European Pharmaceuticals Segment comprises Dechra Veterinary Products EU, Eurovet and Dechra Pharmaceuticals 
Manufacturing. Dechra Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing manufactures the vast majority of our own branded licensed 
pharmaceutical products, which are marketed through DVP EU and Eurovet. This Segment operates internationally and 
specialises in companion animal products and has expanded into the food producing animal market following the acquisition of 
Eurovet.
The US Pharmaceuticals Segment consists of Dechra Veterinary Products US which sells companion animal pharmaceuticals 
into that territory.
The Pharmaceuticals Research and Development Segment includes all of the Group’s pharmaceutical research and 
development activities.
There are varying levels of intersegment trading. Intersegment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.

Total tax recognised in equity 136 64
The Budget on 20 March 2013 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 20% by 2015. A reduction in the 
rate from 24% to 23% (effective from 1 April 2013) was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012, and further reductions to 21% 
(effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 17 July 2013.
This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly and further reduce the deferred tax liability at 30 June 2013 
(which has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at 30 June 2013) by £3.4 million.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further rate reductions, although this will 
further reduce the Group’s future current tax charge and reduce the Group’s deferred tax liability accordingly.

2011, has a carrying value of £0.9 million with an amortisation period of 8 years.
£822,000 of the marketing authorisations relate to the Vetivex range of products. The Vetivex marketing authorisations are 
regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and have not been amortised. Ownership of the marketing authorisations 
rests with the Group in perpetuity. There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit their 
useful lives. Vetivex is an established range of products which are relatively simple in nature and there are a limited number of 
players in the market. Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate that the marketing authorisations are treated as 
having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.

13. Impairment Reviews
Goodwill, indefinite life assets and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently if there are indications that amounts might be impaired. The impairment test involves determining the recoverable 
amount of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, which corresponds to the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or its 
value in use. 
Value in use calculations are performed by forecasting the future cash flows attributable to the asset being tested (or the 
relevant cash generating unit in respect of goodwill). The forecast cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate as 
described below.
Projected future cash flows have been derived from the business plan and extrapolated by applying a growth rate of 3%  
(2012: 5%) per annum up to year five and thereafter a growth rate of 0% (2012: 0%) per annum into perpetuity which is 
considered to be conservative compared to the long term average growth rate for the industry.
The business plan has been formulated based on various factors, including market growth forecasts, the experience of the 
impact of previous recessions and existing product growth. These factors reflect past experience of the Group and, where 
applicable, are consistent with external sources of information.
The pre-tax discount rates have been estimated using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, which is adjusted for 
consideration of market information, and risk adjusted dependent upon the specific circumstances of each asset or  
cash generating unit.
Value in use calculations were performed at 30 June 2013 for the following assets:

Dales 2,231 — 2,231 8.7
In all cases there was significant headroom between the carrying value and the value in use and no impairment provision is 
therefore required. An increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 1% and a reduction in the growth rate to nil would still not result 
in the requirement for an impairment provision.

(b) Unrecognised Deferred Tax 
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities 
have not been recognised is £nil (2012: £nil). The estimated unprovided deferred tax liability in relation to these temporary 
differences is £nil (2012: £nil).  Deferred tax assets in relation to losses amounting to £75,000 (2012: £368,000) have not been 
recognised due to uncertainty over their recoverability.

21.  Employee Benefit Obligations
The Group sponsors defined benefit arrangements in certain countries, the most material being a defined benefit pension 
plan in the Netherlands. This is a funded career average pay arrangement, where pensionable salary is subject to a cap. The 
arrangement is financed through an insurance contract.
The other defined benefit pension arrangements operated by the Company are unfunded: Jubilee awards of £98,000 
(2012: £61,000) for employees in the Netherlands and Germany and early retirement plan provisions in Germany of £nil  
(2012: £2,000) are recognised within other payables in the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2013.
The pension cost relating to the defined benefit pension arrangement in the Netherlands is assessed in accordance with the 
advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The major actuarial assumptions used by the actuary were:
2013 2012
Discount rate 3.90% 4.60%
Expected return on assets 3.90% 4.60%
Inflation assumption 1.90% 1.90%
Salary growth 2.40% 2.40%
Rate of increase in accrued pensions of active members 1.30% 1.90%

21.  Employee Benefit Obligations continued
In valuing the liabilities of the pension scheme at 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2012, mortality assumptions have been made as 
indicated below.
The mortality assumption follows the AG Prognosetafel 2012-2062 mortality tables with an experience adjustment in line with 
the ES-P2 tables as published by the Dutch Alliance of Insurers.
The assumptions used by the Group are the best estimates chosen by the Directors from a range of possible actuarial 
assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

Scheme Assets
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme in the Netherlands is financed through an insurance contract. Under this contract, 
a market price for the assets in respect of this insurance contract is not available. In accordance with IAS 19 for such insurance 
policies, an asset value has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows. The discount rate used for this 
calculation reflects the risk associated with the scheme assets and the maturity or expected disposal date of those assets.
The fair value of the scheme’s assets is as follows:
2013
£’000
2012
£’000
Discount rate used to value assets 3.90% 4.60%
Total fair value of assets 3,726 2,438
Actual return on scheme assets 123 10
The long term rate of return on pension plan assets is determined by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over 
the strategic asset allocation as at the year end. This rate of return is then adjusted for any expected profit sharing based on 
market related returns on notional loans.
The scheme’s assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments or any property occupied by or other assets 
used by the Group.
The employer has a contract with the insurance company Nationale-Nederlanden to cover the committed pension benefits.
The employer contributions expected to be paid into the scheme for the next financial period amount to £571,000  
(2012: £480,000).

22. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures 
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash deposits, bank loans and overdrafts, finance lease obligations, derivatives 
used for hedging purposes and trade receivables and payables.
Treasury Policy
The Group reports in Sterling and pays dividends out of Sterling profits. The role of the Group’s treasury activities is to manage 
and monitor the Group’s external and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of the Group’s corporate 
activities.
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, to finance its operations and to manage market risks 
from these operations. Derivatives, principally comprising forward foreign currency contracts, foreign currency options and 
interest rate swaps, are used to hedge against changes in foreign currencies and interest rates.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and the Group’s treasury policy 
specifically prohibits such activity. All transactions in financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from 
underlying business activities, not for speculation.
Capital Management
The capital structure of the Group consists of net borrowings and Shareholders’ equity. At 30 June 2013, net borrowings were 
£80.8 million, whilst Shareholders’ equity was £174.6 million. 
The Group maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain investors’, creditors’ and market confidence and to sustain future 
development of the business. The Group monitors both the demographic spread of Shareholders, as well as the return on 
capital, which the Group defines as total Shareholder return.
The Group manages its capital structure to maintain a prudent balance between debt and equity that allows sufficient headroom 
to finance the Group’s product development programme and appropriate acquisitions.  
The Group operates globally, primarily through subsidiary companies established in the markets in which the Group trades. The 
Group’s operating subsidiaries are generally cash generative and none are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
There are financial covenants associated with the Group’s borrowings which are cash flow cover, interest cover, net debt to 
EBITDA and consolidated net worth. The Group comfortably complied with these covenants in 2013 and 2012. There were no 
changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. 
Operating cash flow is used to fund investment in the development of new products as well as to make the routine outflows of 
capital expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt.
The Group’s policy is to maintain borrowing facilities centrally which are then used to finance the Group’s operating 
subsidiaries, either by way of equity investments or loans.

Financial Risk Management 
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
 ❱ liquidity risk
 ❱ market risk
 ❱ credit risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, and the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for measuring and managing risk.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet liabilities as they fall due. Cash forecasts identifying 
the liquidity requirements of the Group are produced quarterly. These are reviewed to ensure sufficient financial headroom 
exists for at least a 12 month period.
The Group manages its funding requirements through the following lines of credit:
 ❱ £55 million term loan
 ❱ £65 million revolving credit facility
 ❱ £10 million working capital facility
 ❱ various finance leases
The Group’s undrawn borrowing facilities at 30 June 2013 are detailed in note 20.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates or interest rates, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The majority of the Group’s borrowings bear interest at floating rates linked to base rate or LIBOR and are consequently 
exposed to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group has hedged interest rate risk on a proportion of its term loan and revolving credit facility by means of an interest 
rate swap arrangement whereby the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR is fixed at a rate of 0.83% on the term loan 
and 0.88% on the revolving credit facility. The amount of the term loan and revolving credit outstanding at 30 June 2013 
was £115.1 million (2012: £120.8 million). The hedge is in place until 31 October 2016 and the amount hedged matches the 
repayment profile of the loan.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
Foreign currency transaction exposure arising on normal trade flows is not hedged. The Group matches receipts and payments 
in the relevant foreign currencies as far as possible. To this end, bank accounts are maintained for all the major currencies in 
which the Group trades. Translational exposure in converting the income statements of foreign subsidiaries into the Group’s 
presentational currency of Sterling is not hedged.
The Group hedges selectively expected currency cash flows outside normal trading activities, principally using foreign currency 
options.

22. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be £59,009,000 (2012: £102,996,000) which is the total carrying value of the 
Group’s financial assets.
Cash is only deposited with highly rated banks.
The Group offers trade credit to customers in the normal course of business. Trade and bank references are obtained prior to 
extending credit. The financial statements of corporate customers are monitored on a regular basis.
The principal customers of the Pharmaceuticals segments are European and US wholesalers. The failure of a large wholesaler 
could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s financial results.
The largest customer of the Group (excluding assets relating to discontinued operations) accounted for approximately 2.0% of 
gross trade receivables at 30 June 2013 (2012: 1.5%). No customer accounted for more than 10% of total Group revenues.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers the debt to be no longer 
recoverable.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The following table presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities at 30 June 
2013 and 30 June 2012.
The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
 ❱ Cash and cash equivalents — approximates to the carrying amount.
 ❱ Forward exchange contracts — based on market price and exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
 ❱ Interest rate swaps — based upon the amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the instrument at the 
balance sheet date, being the market price of the instrument.
 ❱ Receivables and payables — approximates to the carrying amount.
 ❱ Bank loans and overdrafts — based upon discounted cash flows using discount rates based upon facility rates renegotiated 
after the 30 June 2012 year end.
 ❱ Finance lease obligations — based upon discounted cash flows using discount rates based upon the Group’s cost of 
borrowing at the balance sheet date.

Fair Value Hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined 
as follows:
 ❱ Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities.
 ❱ Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 ❱ Level 3 — inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

£0.3 million payment made under the terms of the Genitrix acquisition, a £10.0 million payment offset by a £0.3 million 
unwinding of discount and £0.1 million decrease due to foreign exchange differences in relation to the DermaPet acquisition, 
and a £2.1 million addition for a US generic pharmaceutical.

Sensitivity Analysis
Interest Rate Risk
A 2.0% increase in interest rates compared to those ruling at 30 June 2013 would reduce Group profit before taxation and 
equity by £621,000 (2012: £168,000).
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group has significant cash flows and net financial assets and liabilities in Danish Krone, US Dollar and Euro. 
The following table shows the impact on the Group’s profit before taxation and net assets of a 10% appreciation of Sterling 
against each of these currencies:
Profit before
taxation
£’000
Net
assets
£’000
Danish Krone 50 (15)
US Dollar (111) (359)
Euro (3,195) (12,286)
Hedges
Cash Flow Hedges
The Group has entered into an interest rate swap on the term loan of £55 million and the revolving credit facility of  
£65 million. The Group has designated this a cash flow hedge. The risk being hedged is the variability of cash flows arising 
from movements in interest rates. No ineffectiveness arose on the hedge.
The hedge is in place until 31 October 2016. The amounts recognised in equity are recycled to the income statement to offset 
gains and losses in the period in which the cash flows occurs.
The amount recognised in equity in the year ended 30 June 2013 was a liability of £nil including an income tax credit of 
£15,000 (2012: £286,000 including an income tax credit of £101,000).

The Companies Act 2006 abolishes the requirement for a company to have an authorised share capital. At the 2009 Annual 
General Meeting the Shareholders approved a resolution whereby all provisions relating to the Company’s authorised share 
capital were removed from the Company’s constitutional documents. 
During the year 287,268 new ordinary shares of 1p (2012: 379,864 new ordinary shares of 1p) were issued following the 
exercise of options under the Long Term Incentive Plan, and the Approved, Unapproved and SAYE Share Options Schemes.  
The consideration received was £845,674 (2012: £452,782). The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends 
as declared or approved at General Meetings from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at such meetings of the 
Company.
The Company issued 20,040,653 shares of 1p each by way of a 3 for 10 Rights Issue at an issue price of 300p per share 
on 16 May 2012. The Rights Issue generated net proceeds of £58,835,110 after costs of £1,286,849. The issue price 
represented a discount of 35.3% to the closing price of 464p per share on 4 April 2012, being the last business day before the 
announcement of the Rights Issue.

24. Share-based Payments
During the year, the Company operated the Unapproved Share Option Scheme, the Approved Share Option Scheme, the Long 
Term Incentive Plan and the Save As You Earn (“SAYE”) Share Option Scheme as described below:
Unapproved and Approved Share Option Schemes
Under these Schemes, options are granted to certain Executives and employees of the Group (excluding Executive Directors) 
to purchase shares in the Company at a price fixed at the average market value over the three days prior to the date of grant. 
For the options to vest, there must be an increase in earnings per share of at least 12% above the growth in the UK Retail 
Prices Index (RPI) over a three year period. Once vested, options must be exercised within ten years of the date of grant.
Long Term Incentive Plan
For awards granted before 5 March 2013: Vesting is dependent on an underpin condition based on the Company’s adjusted 
diluted earnings per share performance. No awards will vest unless adjusted diluted earnings per share has grown by at least 
3% per annum above the retail prices index over the three year measurement period. Provided this condition is met, then the 
number of shares that vest depends on the Company’s TSR performance against the FTSE Small Cap Index over the three 
year measurement period. 100% of the shares vest if the Company achieves an upper quartile performance, 25% of the 
shares vest at median performance, and awards vest on a straight-line basis for performance in between. No shares vest if 
performance is below median.
For awards granted on and after 5 March 2013: Vesting is dependent on two performance targets which must be satisfied over 
a three year performance period commencing from the start of the financial year within which the award is granted. 50% of the 
award will vest dependent on the Company’s TSR performance against an appropriate comparator group. 50% of the award 
will vest subject to a performance condition based on the annual earnings per share growth.
SAYE Option Scheme
This scheme is open to all UK employees. Participants save a fixed amount of up to £250 per month for either three or five 
years and are then able to use these savings to buy shares in the Company at a price fixed at a 20% discount to the market 
value at the start of the savings period. Prior to 16 October 2012 participants were able to save for a seven year period. The 
SAYE options must ordinarily be exercised within six months of the completion of the relevant savings period. The exercise of 
these options is not subject to any performance criteria.

National Insurance contributions are payable by the Company in respect of some of the share-based payments. These 
contributions are payable on the date of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based payments and are therefore 
treated as cash settled awards. The Group had an accrual at 30 June 2013 of £260,000 (2012: £73,000), of which £39,000 
(2012: £18,000) related to vested options. The total charge to the Income Statement in respect of share-based payments was:

The fair value of the financial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of £5,669,000. 
The fair value adjustments principally relate to harmonisation with Group IFRS accounting policies, including the application of 
fair values on acquisition, principally the recognition of product rights in accordance with IFRS 3.
The goodwill of £36,348,000 arising from the acquisition consists of the synergies, assembled workforce, technical expertise 
and the increased geographical presence in Germany and the Netherlands. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible 
for income tax purposes.
Acquisition related costs (included in operating expenses) amounted to £2,315,000. Eurovet’s results are reported within the 
European Pharmaceuticals Segment.
Acquisition of Genitrix Limited
On 1 December 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Genitrix Limited. The acquisition of Genitrix Limited, 
a veterinary pharmaceuticals company based in Billingshurst, UK, is consistent with our strategy to grow our domestic and 
international pharmaceutical business.
The remaining £300,000 contingent consideration outstanding for this acquisition was paid in the period.

Acquisition of DermaPet Inc.
On 22 October 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of DermaPet Inc., a Florida based business which 
develops and markets a range of dermatological preparations, including shampoos, conditioners and ear products, for the US 
and overseas companion animal markets. These veterinary products are marketed and distributed through the same channels 
as Dechra’s current US product portfolio.
During the period the Group paid a further US$16,000,000 (£10,033,000) in respect of the acquisition of DermaPet, Inc.  
A payment of US$15,000,000 was made which related to the achievement of a contingent milestone target, the remaining 
US$1,000,000 related to deferred consideration which was paid on the second anniversary of the completion date.
The maximum further consideration payable is US$6,000,000 of which US$1,000,000 is payable on the fourth anniversary of 
the completion date. The remaining US$5,000,000 is contingent upon revenue exceeding US$20,000,000 in any rolling 12 
month period ending on the sixth anniversary of the completion date.
29. Discontinued Operations
On 10 July 2013, the Group announced its intention to dispose of the Services businesses. However, the Group was 
committed to a plan to sell the businesses prior to 30 June 2013, therefore the assets have been classified as held for sale. 
The disposal is consistent with the Group’s long term policy to focus its activities on the manufacture and marketing of 
pharmaceutical products.
The Services businesses constitutes a reporting segment in accordance with IFRS 8.
The divestment was completed on 16 August 2013 for sale proceeds of £87.5 million. The costs to sell are £1.5 million (with an 
associated tax deduction of £0.1 million). Tax on the profit on disposal is expected to be £0.4 million. The completion accounts 
are yet to be finalised.
The Group has not recognised any impairment losses in respect of the Services businesses, neither when the assets and 
liabilities of the operation were reclassified to held for sale nor at the end of the reporting period.
The results of the discontinued operations included in the profit for the year are set out below. The Segment was not a 
discontinued operation or classified as held for sale at 30 June 2012. The comparative consolidated income statement has 
been represented to show the discontinued operation separately from continuing operations.

(i) Principal Accounting Policies of the Company
Accounting Principles
The Company Balance Sheet has been prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivatives which are stated at 
fair value in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of Preparation
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408(2) and (3) of the Companies Act 2006. 
The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £23,220,000 (2012: £4,293,000). Fees paid to KPMG Audit Plc and 
its associates for audit and non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in the individual Financial Statements of 
Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC because the Group Financial Statements are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated 
basis.
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any impairment losses. Where the consideration for the acquisition of 
a subsidiary undertaking includes shares in the Company to which the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 
apply, cost represents the nominal value of the shares issued together with the fair value of any additional consideration given 
and costs. Where investments are denominated in foreign currencies they are treated as monetary assets and revalued at each 
balance sheet date.
Intangible Assets
Product rights that are acquired by the Company are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.  
Product rights are amortised over the period of their useful lives.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. In 
accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial 
instruments are stated at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value of instruments that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the instrument 
at the balance sheet date. The fair value of forward exchange contracts and options is their quoted market price at the balance 
sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Hedging
Cash Flow Hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity to 
the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised as profit 
or loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity remains there until 
the forecast transaction occurs. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in equity is transferred 
to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised. In other cases, the amount recognised in equity is transferred to 
profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Cash Flow Statement
As the ultimate holding company of the Group, the Company has relied upon the exemption in FRS 1 (Revised) not to present 
a cash flow statement as part of its financial statements.

(i) Principal Accounting Policies of the Company continued
Dividends
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s Shareholders or, in the case of an interim 
dividend, when the dividend is paid. Dividends receivable from subsidiaries are recognised when either received in cash or 
applied to reduce a creditor balance with the subsidiary.
Interest-bearing Borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Related Parties
Under FRS 8 the Company is exempt from the requirement to disclose related party transactions with other Group 
undertakings as they are all wholly owned within the Group and are included in the Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Transactions with Key Management Personnel
There were no material transactions with key management personnel except for those relating to remuneration (see notes 7 
and 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and shareholdings.
Transactions with Other Related Parties
There are no controlling Shareholders of the Company. There have been no material transactions with the Shareholders of the 
Company.
Employee Benefits
(i)  Pensions
  The Company operates a Group stakeholder personal pension scheme for certain employees. Obligations for contributions 
are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account as incurred.
(ii)  Share-based Payment Transactions
  The Company operates a number of equity settled share-based payment programmes that allow employees to acquire 
shares of the Company. The Company also operates a Long Term Incentive Plan for Directors and senior executives.
  The fair value of shares or options granted is recognised as an employee expense on a straight-line basis in the profit 
and loss account with a corresponding movement in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the 
period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares or options (the vesting period). The fair 
value of the shares or options granted is measured using a valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the shares or options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account is 
adjusted to take into account an estimate of the number of shares or options that are expected to vest together with an 
adjustment to reflect the number of shares or options that actually do vest except where forfeiture is only due to market-
based conditions not being achieved.
  The fair values of grants under the Long Term Incentive Plan have been determined using the Monte Carlo simulation 
model. The fair values of options granted under all other share option schemes have been determined using the Black–
Scholes option pricing model.
  National Insurance contributions payable by the Company on the intrinsic value of share-based payments at the date of 
exercise are treated as cash settled awards and revalued to market price at each balance sheet date.
  Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recharges the expense to 
those subsidiaries.

(i) Principal Accounting Policies of the Company continued
Foreign Currency
Foreign currency transactions are translated into Sterling using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are 
recognised in the profit and loss account.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred tax is measured on a non-
discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply and have been substantively enacted in the periods in which the 
timing differences reverse and is provided in respect of all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed by the balance 
sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax’. 
Financial Guarantee Contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its 
Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the 
Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will 
be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
(ii) Directors and Employees
Total emoluments of Directors (including pension contributions) amounted to £2,088,000 (2012: £1,727,000). Information 
relating to Directors’ emoluments, share options and pension entitlements is set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 67 to 83.

Warning to Shareholders
Share fraud includes scams where investors are called out of 
the blue and offered shares that often turn out to be worthless 
or non-existent, or an inflated price for shares they own. During 
the year we were alerted by some of our Shareholders to cold 
calls which they had received. The callers purport to represent 
various entities, including Drexel-Bearns, a US based firm. The 
callers stated that they were seeking to gain control of investor 
shareholdings held in the Company and/or personal financial 
information. We believe these to be boiler room scams.
These types of calls are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ 
who target UK shareholders and are commonly referred to 
as ‘boiler rooms’. These ‘brokers’ can be very persistent and 
extremely persuasive. While high profits are promised, those 
who buy or sell shares in this way usually lose their money.

Advisers
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports.
If you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted 
shares, a premium price for shares you own, or free company 
or research reports, you should take these steps before handing 
over any money:
 ❱ check the FCA Register at www.fca.org.uk/firms/systems-
reporting/register to ensure they are authorised;
 ❱ confirm that the firm is genuine by asking them for their firm 
reference number and contact details. Always use the details 
on the FCA Register to contact the firm. You should only 
access the Register from the FCA website at www.fca.org.uk; 
 ❱ call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6786 if there 
are no contact details on the Register or you are told they are 
out of date;
 ❱ make additional checks to confirm that you are dealing with 
the firm direct for example checking the details on the firm’s 
website with directory enquiries or Companies House;
 ❱ search the FCA unauthorised firms list; and
 ❱ remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
If you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares or 
other investments, you will not have access to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation 
Scheme if things go wrong.
If you are approached about a share scam you should tell the 
FCA by contacting their Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 678. If 
you have been offered, bought or sold shares you can use the 
share fraud reporting form at http://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/
scams/investment-scams/share-fraud-and-boiler-room-scams/
reporting-form. 
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters or suspect 
fraud you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
 
Protecting your Identity
Suggestions for safeguarding your shares:
 ❱ ensure all your share certificates are kept in a safe place or 
hold your shares electronically in CREST via a nominee;
 ❱ keep all correspondence relating to your shares in a safe 
place or destroy the correspondence by shredding;
 ❱ notify the Registrar of a change of address in writing or via 
their website (as detailed above); 
 ❱ consider having your dividend paid directly into your bank 
account to eliminate the risk of a lost dividend cheque;
 ❱ notify the Registrar of bank account detail changes in writing 
of via their website; and
 ❱ if you decide to sell or buy shares use only brokers registered 
in your own country or the UK.

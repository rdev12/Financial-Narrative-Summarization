Strategic Report
Strategic Report Governance Financials Shareholder information Market  
overview
Businesses within the Melrose Group operate in diverse markets around 
the world. In this section, current market trends and external factors 
affecting the growth of each Melrose business are considered, together 
with individual business responses to these trends and factors. 
Elster Gas
Elster Gas is a world leader in the 
design and manufacture of gas 
measurement, process heat control 
and gas safety control equipment, 
supplying a global customer base  
in more than 110 countries. It has  
one of the most extensively installed 
utility measurement bases in the world 
with more than 75 million gas metering 
devices deployed in the last 10 years 
alone. Its complete range of end-to-
end solutions enables customers to 
efficiently manage and control natural 
gas resources.
Current market trends
Global energy consumption is continuing 
to increase. Natural gas is increasing its 
share, whilst reliance on coal and oil is 
diminishing. New gas resources, such 
as shale gas in the US, are also helping 
to change the energy mix.
While environmental concerns are 
driving European Union (“EU”) targets 
on energy consumption, the global 
economic situation is, in certain areas, 
increasing competition.
The increasing global gas consumption 
and the growing demand for unconventional 
gas sources (such as shale and biogas), 
are driving an increase in infrastructure 
projects, including Liquefied Natural 
Gas terminals. 
External factors: competition 
and regulation
The EU directive to replace the majority of 
existing meters with Smart meters by the 
end of the decade has been implemented 
in different ways across the EU. The 
UK, Italy, France and the Netherlands 
are leading the roll out. The precise 
timing of the roll out is still uncertain. 
The market is also governed by both 
national and international metrology and 
safety standards.
International legislation is aimed at driving 
down emission levels and increasing 
efficiency. The ongoing global trend to 
harmonise all regional standards to one 
global ISO standard is putting pressure on 
China to meet this global standard. China 
accounts for almost 50% of global steel 
production and steel applications are the 
most important drivers for growth within 
the process heat market. 
Business response
In response to the growth in gas 
infrastructure, Elster is supplying the  
full scope of energy measurement 
solutions worldwide, with a strong 
focus on Asia, the Middle East and 
the US. The international nature of 
the larger infrastructure projects is 
matched by Elster’s international 
presence and wide project experience.
Elster has developed a range of  
customer and market-specific integrated 
technology solutions, covering residential, 
commercial and industrial applications. 
Elster is actively involved in major pilot 
projects in preparation for the large scale 
implementation of Smart meters and is 
working in close partnership with key 
customers and technology providers in  
a number of countries. 
Specific solutions for process heat and 
heating applications are being developed 
by Elster. A dedicated Elster Gas service 
team is available around the world to 
support customers during the planning 
and start-up process. Sales and 
application skills of the engineering team 
are key factors in continuing to deliver 
high quality products and solutions, 
with “added value thinking”. This is an 
important market differentiator for the  
Gas Utilisation business.
“ Increasing global gas 
consumption and the 
growing demand for 
unconventional gas sources 
are driving an increase in 
infrastructure projects.”

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report Elster Electricity Elster Water
Elster Electricity is one of the  
largest international Smart metering 
solutions providers for residential, 
commercial, industrial, transmission 
and distribution markets.
Current market trends
Elster Electricity’s primary markets are the 
EU, US, the Middle East and Africa. The EU, 
which is its largest market, has experienced 
significant growth during the last year  
and, following calls for a European wide  
roll out of Smart meter solutions by 2022, 
significant growth is expected during the 
coming years. A regulatory framework is 
now in place in parts of the Middle East to 
upgrade the metering infrastructure, which 
is expected to result in substantial growth 
over the coming years.
External factors: competition 
and regulation
The global market will continue to see a shift 
from “traditional” metering to Smart meter 
solutions. Whilst the North America market is 
expected to remain constant at existing sales 
volumes, other markets are expected to see 
growth. In Europe, further pilot projects are 
planned which will lead to significant tender 
activities from 2015 onwards.
Business response
New products and technologies have 
been developed and successfully launched. 
During 2014, further investment will be 
made in Meter Data Collection solutions 
and in partnerships with Smart Grid 
application providers.
“ The global market  
will continue to see a  
shift from ‘traditional’ 
electricity metering to 
Smart meter solutions.”
Elster Water is a leading supplier  
of water meters recognised globally 
with sales revenue derived from  
more than 90 countries. 
Current market trends
There is an increase in the adoption of 
communicating meters for Smart metering 
projects, particularly in Europe, the Middle 
East and North America. This trend is 
also pushing growth in electronic meters, 
equipped with standard communication 
interfaces. This technology allows extended 
meter life in harsh water quality conditions, 
for example in the Middle East. Elsewhere, 
legislation on water quality is driving lead-
free materials, resulting in an increase in 
sales of polymer-bodied water meters in 
emerging, as well as established, markets.
External factors: competition  
and regulation
The global water industry continues to 
seek innovative metering solutions to 
support the objectives of water providers, 
including water conservation, customer 
service and resource efficiency. The 
competitive environment is comprised of 
a few large suppliers based in Europe and 
North America, together with many regional 
companies. Regulations are both regional 
and national, however most markets adopt 
international standards.
Business response
There is a continued focus on the delivery 
of innovative, value added products in 
market segments that are responsive to 
higher performing metering products. 
Recent innovations by the business 
include an award winning polymer-bodied 
residential meter.
Elster Water continues to work with key 
water industry partners in several regions  
to address local requirements. Strong 
customer relationships in major markets 
will ensure that Water business can 
develop meter products and solutions 
tailored to customer needs. Over the 
medium term further growth is expected  
in strategic products, including polymer 
meters, Smart meters and electronic meters.
“ Smart meter technology 
allows extended meter 
life in harsh water quality 
conditions, for example 
in the Middle East.”

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report
Strategic Report Governance Financials Shareholder information Market overview 
continued
Brush is the world’s number one 
independent supplier of turbogenerators 
and a leading supplier of other 
electricity generating machinery, 
switchgear, transformers and power 
infrastructure equipment with strong 
aftermarket service and product 
support capabilities.
Current market trends
There is a continuing trend towards 
power generation through aero derivative 
gas turbine packages. Gas is cleaner than 
coal fired generation and is an attractive 
alternative, with a lower infrastructure 
cost and increasing availability of relatively 
low cost shale gas. Emissions regulations 
and increasing concerns about the 
economics of renewals and safety of 
nuclear power means that gas will be 
preferred for the replacement of existing 
coal fired power generation.
 
Power infrastructure, particularly in 
the mature economies, is ageing, which 
is increasing demand for both new 
equipment and aftermarket services as 
plant comes to the end of its useful life. 
Although the medium-term outlook, 
particularly for the aero derivative gas 
turbine sector, is encouraging, in the short 
term, the utility, oil & gas and industrial 
market sectors have suffered from 
investment stagnation as a result of the 
global financial crisis. This has resulted 
in many projects being delayed due to 
an inability to complete financing. 
External factors: competition  
and regulation
The Brush businesses have strong  
UK revenue streams, which are  
regulated by OFGEM (Office of Gas  
and Electricity Markets). 
National content rules have also made 
direct access to the Brazilian oil & gas 
market difficult for non-indigenous 
manufacturers.
Business response
In 2014, Brush will begin delivering 
turbogenerators to Chinese customers 
from its European factories. These 
deliveries are expected to increase  
in 2015.
In addition, continued activity in the 
Middle East power market is expected  
to increase demand for Brush’s large 
air-cooled generators in 2015.

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report Bridon designs and manufactures  
a comprehensive range of lifting and 
stabilising solutions for applications  
in wire rope, fibre rope, steel wire  
and strand. The company services 
global customers in the oil & gas, 
mining, industrial, marine and 
infrastructure sectors.
Current market trends
Within the oil & gas sector, rope demand  
is likely to remain strong in the short to 
medium term in the offshore sector, with 
an increasing emphasis on the extraction 
of deep water reserves to meet growing 
global demand for oil. Activity in the 
exploration, construction, production  
and decommissioning segments is 
forecast to increase in target territories 
such as Brazil, West Africa, Australia  
and the Gulf of Mexico. 
The global mining sector weakened 
significantly in 2013 owing to falling 
commodity prices, slowing demand in 
China and a consequent restriction in 
capital and operating expenditure by the 
global mining companies. This impacted 
both new equipment orders and 
maintenance expenditure. 
Demand for ropes within the industrial 
sector improved in 2013 and is likely to 
continue, as global economic growth 
increases. The commercial construction 
market has improved in North America and 
the Middle East and there are tentative signs 
of recovery in other developed economies. 
The Chinese domestic market has been 
subdued, although it will remain a significant 
driver of demand owing to its size. In the 
medium term, global trade and the growing 
demand for energy and infrastructure are 
likely to drive crane activity and therefore 
demand for industrial ropes. 
Demand for minerals appears to have 
stabilised, although new supply sources 
lead to uncertainty regarding the trends 
for commodity prices. The global mining 
companies remain largely positive on 
growth for 2014. However, this is based 
principally on the ability of miners to cut 
costs and drive productivity, rather than 
as a result of any immediate increase in 
demand. Marginal projects are unlikely  
to be pursued, but essential maintenance 
will still have to be carried out. Increased 
forecasts for coal consumption in China, 
India and other developing countries are 
driven by urbanisation and higher 
energy demand. 
As mines begin to undertake essential 
maintenance work and more mines  
are brought under the authority of  
the Chinese government regulator,  
businesses will seek suppliers who  
deliver value. Reduced demand has  
led to intense price competition.
External factors: competition  
and regulation
The offshore oil & gas industry is heavily 
regulated by organisations such as 
The America Petroleum Institute, 
Lloyd’s of London and various industry 
and government bodies. 
Competition is increasing in the 
industrial sector, particularly from Asian 
manufacturers in the bulk/commodity end 
of the market, although the need for high 
capacity crawler, port and marine cranes 
requires high performance solutions. 
Business response
The Bridon Technology Centre has 
enhanced the technological capabilities  
of the business. This, combined with  
the new factory at Neptune Quay, UK, 
provides a strong foundation to solve the 
challenges of deeper water operations 
and changing regulations. The fast-track 
development of differentiated market-led 
technology solutions will deliver growth 
within the offshore construction market.
Within the mining sector, Bridon’s  
high performance ropes, coupled with 
their technical applications support, 
enable mines to operate more safely  
and consistently in order to achieve 
productivity gains.
Within the industrial sector, Bridon  
will launch next generation products  
this year and it continues to work on  
new developments to help extend the 
service life of cranes.

remain strong in the offshore sector with an increasing 
emphasis on the extraction of deep water reserves to 
meet growing global demand for oil.”

Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report
Strategic Report Governance Financials Shareholder information Chairman’s 
statement
I am pleased to report our 11th set of 
annual results since flotation in 2003.
2013 has been an extremely busy year 
for your Company. It has seen the 
successful integration of Elster, acquired 
in 2012, as well as the disposal of five 
businesses from our FKI acquisition in 
2008. Truth, Marelli, Crosby, Acco and 
Harris were sold during the year for a total 
of £950 million, representing a more than 
tripling of their value for shareholders 
during the five years of Melrose ownership. 
Associated with these sales and in  
line with our proven strategy, a return 
of capital of approximately £600 million 
was announced on 21 January 2014 and 
was paid on 28 February 2014. Two large 
businesses from the FKI acquisition,  
Brush and Bridon, still remain in the Group.
The current shareholder investment in 
Melrose, net of annual dividends and 
all returns of capital since 2003 (totalling 
£1.5 billion), amounts to approximately 
£0.5 billion. Our market capitalisation 
at the current share price amounts to 
£3.5 billion, meaning that approximately 
£3.0 billion of shareholder value has 
been created over the period.
We are proud of this achievement in 
growing shareholder value and the Board, 
on behalf of shareholders, recognises the 
efforts of our employees and thanks them 
for their outstanding contribution to this.
Results for the Group
These financial statements report the 
results for the Group for the year to 
31 December 2013 and comparatives 
for the previous year.
Revenue from continuing businesses 
for the year was £1,732.8 million 
(2012: £1,051.1 million) and headline profit 
before tax (before exceptional costs, 
exceptional income and intangible asset 
amortisation) was £226.1 million 
(2012: £117.9 million). 
Adjusting for the five disposals in the year, 
headline diluted EPS (before exceptional 
costs, exceptional income and intangible 
asset amortisation) on continuing 
businesses was 12.8p (2012 proforma: 
9.4p), an increase of 36%.
Further details of these results are 
contained in the Finance Director’s review.

Trading
The speedy and rigorous implementation 
of restructuring projects in our 2012 
Elster acquisition produced an equally 
swift improvement in operating margins 
– ahead of our best expectations – which 
led to an increase of over a third in Elster’s 
profits in its first full year. Since acquisition 
we have raised our expectations of what 
Elster can achieve and the outcome to 
date is very encouraging.
As we indicated, despite the subdued 
order books of recent periods, the 
remaining “FKI” businesses of Bridon and 
Brush maintained their operating margins 
– a good performance. The recent and 
continuing level of investment in these two 
businesses means that the medium-term 
outlook remains positive but weakness 
in specific market areas may hold back 
growth in the short term.
Operating cash generation remains a major 
focus and this has been another excellent 
year. This, together with the proceeds 
from disposals, has meant a substantial 
reduction of net debt to £141 million at 
the year end from £998 million last year. 
The return of capital after the year end has 
returned debt to our more usual levels.
Dividends
The Board proposes to pay a final 
dividend of 5.0p per share (2012: 5.0p). 
This will be paid on 15 May 2014 to those 
shareholders on the register at 22 April 
2014, subject to approval at the AGM 
on 13 May 2014. This gives a total for 
the year of 7.75p per share (2012: 7.6p).
We continue to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy. (1) Before exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset amortisation.

Board changes
Miles Templeman, our Senior non-
executive Director, will be stepping down 
at the conclusion of the AGM in May. He 
has been a director since our inception in 
2003 and in this time his experience and 
judgement have been highly valued by the 
Board. We will miss his distinctive input.
At the same time we were delighted 
to welcome Liz Hewitt to the Board on 
8 October 2013. Liz has an excellent 
background and experience in areas very 
relevant to Melrose’s operations and we are 
already benefiting from her contribution.
Following Miles’ departure, Perry 
Crosthwaite will become our Senior non-
executive Director. Perry will simultaneously 
relinquish his position as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, a role that will 
be filled by Justin Dowley, following the 
conclusion of this year’s AGM. Liz Hewitt 
will chair the Nomination Committee with 
effect from the end of the 2014 AGM.
Strategy 
Our strategy of “buy, improve, sell” is by 
now well understood. 2013 was a highly 
successful year particularly in the “improve” 
and “sell” categories. The speed of 
improvement in operating margins at  
Elster is a tribute to the strength of our 
management teams. But this did not dilute 
our focus on realising the value in several 
of our “FKI” businesses, nor in returning 
this to shareholders. As stated before, we 
are now actively looking for an appropriate 
opportunity to repeat the success of our 
previous acquisitions. This is a rigorous 
process and we will take as long as is 
necessary to identify the right company.
Outlook 
The recovery from the financial crisis of 
2008 has been slow, anaemic and patchy. 
Much of our growth in recent years has 
been from margin improvement rather 
than revenue growth. In common with 
many other companies, sales growth 
remains challenging and we face a 
headwind from the current strength of 
Sterling. However, there is more margin 
improvement still achievable which, 
together with the inherent strength of our 
businesses and the continuing recovery 
in most of the world’s economies, gives 
us confidence over the medium term.

Divestments during the year
Realising value in businesses at the 
appropriate time and returning all or part 
of this value to shareholders has been 
a fundamental part of the “buy, improve, 
sell” strategy that Melrose has followed 
since being founded 10 years ago. 
2013 has been another highly successful 
year for Melrose as we continue to 
“improve” elements of the portfolio and 
have implemented the “sell” phase of 
our strategy. In the second half of the year, 
we completed the disposals of five of our 
“FKI” businesses for a total consideration 
of approximately £950 million, having 
more than tripled the shareholder value 
in respect of these businesses in five 
years of Melrose ownership. In July 2013, 
Melrose sold Truth Hardware to Tyman 
PLC for £135 million. In the following 
month, we completed the disposal of 
Marelli Motori to an affiliate of The Carlyle 
Group, for a total consideration of 
£177 million. In November 2013, the 
disposal of Crosby and Acco to an affiliate 
of KKR & Co LP, was completed for 
a consideration of £633 million. Finally 
in December 2013, Melrose disposed of 
Harris Waste Management Group to Avis 
Industrial Corporation.
Return of capital
Following these divestments, and in 
accordance with our strategy, we 
announced in January 2014 our intention 
to use part of the proceeds of the 
disposals to return approximately 
£600 million in cash to shareholders 
and to undertake a share consolidation 
on an 11 for 13 basis. The balance of the 
net sale proceeds have been used to 
pay down Melrose’s existing borrowings.
Improving the portfolio
Elster
Following the sale of Crosby and Acco, 
the three Elster businesses represent two 
thirds of the revenue of the continuing 
Group. In the 18 months since their 
acquisition, the improvement programmes 
implemented within the Elster businesses 
are yielding significant results. 
The Gas business has benefited from 
strategic and operational initiatives including 
the closure of uneconomic facilities, new 
product launches and the rationalisation 
and relocation of manufacturing operations. 
The Gas business is well positioned to 
benefit from a continued growth in gas 
usage across the world. 
Operating profits in the Electricity business 
have improved significantly as a result of 
the relocation, reorganisation and 
consolidation of operational and functional 
activities both in North America and Europe. 
New products and technologies have 
been launched, enhanced quality control 
processes implemented and improvements 
to the supply chain initiated. Across the 
global market, regulatory frameworks are 
being put in place to upgrade the metering 
infrastructure from traditional metering to 
Smart meter solutions, providing significant 
growth opportunities.
In the Water business, operating profit has 
also improved substantially following the 
completion of a restructuring programme, 
product and business rationalisation and 
new product launches. Water is well 
positioned for growth.

Strategic Report Bridon
Turning to the rest of the Group, Bridon’s 
trading results in 2013 were marginally 
down on 2012. Reductions in operating 
expenditure in the mining industry 
continued to impact demand for mining 
ropes and this has offset improved trading 
conditions in other core sectors such as 
the oil & gas, commercial construction  
and industrial markets. The difficult trading 
circumstances in the mining sector are 
expected to continue for at least the first 
half of 2014. 
Bridon’s strategy is to be a global 
technology leader for demanding rope 
applications. Bridon’s new factory in 
Newcastle, UK, is fully operational and the 
Bridon Technology Centre, providing state 
of the art product design, development 
and testing facilities, was opened in 
early 2013. During the year, 19 product 
development and enhancement projects 
were completed resulting in higher 
performance ropes for the mining,  
oil & gas and industrial sectors. 
Looking ahead, while the outlook for the 
mining sector remains uncertain, demand 
from the oil & gas sector is expected 
to be solid in 2014. At the same time, 
commercial construction and industrial 
activity continue to grow in China, 
and signs of recovery are also visible 
in the US. To mitigate the effects of the 
downturn in the mining sector, Bridon  
has focused on implementing operational 
efficiency improvements and strong 
working capital control.
Brush
Market dynamics for new generators  
are likely to remain subdued in 2014. 
However, Brush has outperformed the 
turbogenerator market with operational 
efficiency gains, a strong return on  
capital investment and growth in the 
aftermarket business. 
We are investing £30 million in a new 
manufacturing plant in China to meet the 
rapid growth in demand for gas turbines  
in the region. 
A key priority for Brush is the growth and 
development of the aftermarket business 
which, during 2013, was consolidated  
into a single focused global business  
unit. This restructuring, together with 
capital investment in an aftermarket 
workshop facility in the US and new 
service offerings, has driven order intake 
up 34%, on the previous year. 
Hawker Siddeley Switchgear had another 
strong year with sales and operating  
profit achieving gains of 6% and 37% 
respectively. Performance at the 
Transformers business also improved,  
with revenue up 6%, year-on-year. 
The medium to long-term outlook for 
power generation and the gas turbine 
market is positive and Brush is well placed 
to benefit from this and the additional 
growth opportunities in China and the 
aftermarket business.
“ 2013 has been another highly successful  
year for Melrose as we continue to 
‘improve’ elements of the portfolio and 
have implemented the ‘sell’ phase of  
our strategy.” 
Outlook
Overall market conditions remain 
challenging and sales growth in 2014 is 
not going to be easy to achieve. We are 
confident that we will see further progress 
in our Elster businesses in 2014. However, 
Bridon and Brush will find it more difficult 
to improve their performance. Foreign 
exchange rates have continued to become 
an increasing headwind into 2014.
We are actively looking for our next 
acquisition and are hopeful of progress 
this year although, as ever, we remain 
disciplined in applying our criteria.

Buy Improve Sell
During the 10 years since first 
listing in 2003, there have been 
three major acquisitions. 
Elster
The largest and most recent of these was Elster 
Group SE, purchased for an enterprise value of 
£1.8 billion in August 2012. Elster is a world leading 
engineering business, established over 100 years 
ago, designing and making meters and gas utilisation 
products mainly for the energy market. The deal was 
funded by a fully underwritten Rights Issue, which 
raised £1.2 billion.
FKI
FKI plc was acquired in July 2008, for an enterprise 
value of approximately £1 billion. FKI was a major 
international diversified engineering group, including 
some businesses with very good market positions. 
Bridon, Brush, Crosby, Marelli, Truth, Harris and Acco 
were all part of FKI. However, now all but the first two 
of these businesses have been sold.
McKechnie and Dynacast
The McKechnie and Dynacast businesses were 
acquired, in May 2005, for £429 million. The various 
individual businesses that were acquired at this time 
were subsequently sold between May 2007 and June 
2012 and created considerable shareholder returns.
Buy
Melrose aims to acquire good 
manufacturing businesses that  
are currently underperforming  
their potential. 
Businesses are targeted that have  
strong headline fundamentals, such  
as high quality products, or a leading 
market share, to generate sustainable

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report FKI
FKI had a weak balance sheet and 
borrowings which were due to be 
refinanced in the near term. The financing 
terms of Melrose’s acquisition enabled 
the balance sheet issues to be resolved 
and a more appropriate group borrowing 
structure with lower overall debt leverage.
In addition to addressing the financial 
constraints facing FKI, Melrose identified  
a number of opportunities to improve  
the performance of FKI’s businesses, 
principally through an increased focus 
on cash generation and profitability. 
Melrose continues to invest in existing 
facilities and new capacity within the 
remaining businesses in order to continue 
growing these businesses. Examples of 
recent investments include Bridon’s new 
£20 million facility at Neptune Energy Park, 
Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, which became 
operational in November 2012 and a 
£30 million investment in a new production 
facility for Brush in China, which is due to 
commence production during 2015.
Since the acquisition of FKI, steps taken 
by Melrose have resulted in an increase  
in operating margin from 10% to 17%, 
which will result in substantial shareholder 
value being created.
Elster
A business with strong fundamentals, 
Elster fits the Melrose acquisition criteria.  
It is a high quality business with strong 
end markets which has the potential for 
significant development and improvement 
under Melrose management.
Elster serves markets with attractive 
long-term demand drivers such as 
growing global energy demand, energy 
efficiency and conservation and global 
gasification and is the global market 
leader in gas metering.
Melrose sees opportunities to improve 
Elster’s performance through expanding 
margins and improving the quality of 
the business through investment and 
development. Following its acquisition 
in August 2012, a variety of restructuring 
projects have already been completed 
within the Elster businesses.
Dynacast/McKechnie
Melrose successfully steered Dynacast 
through the global slowdown and the 
cost savings made during the downturn 
were retained as sales recovered. 
Melrose invested fully in Dynacast to 
expand capacity, particularly in the Far 
East and to improve efficiency.
Dynacast also successfully completed 
some bolt on acquisitions. Under Melrose 
ownership, sales in all three of Dynacast’s 
main geographic regions grew.
Within McKechnie, Melrose saw 
significant scope to invest in the business 
and improve its operational and financial 
performance by adopting a vigorous 
hands-on approach.

Strategic Report FKI
In 2013, Melrose sold five FKI businesses: 
Truth, Marelli, Crosby, Acco and Harris, 
which made up approximately half of the 
FKI group. On average these produced 
a return on the original shareholder value 
of over three times.
The combined sale price of these  
five businesses was approximately 
£950 million. In accordance with the 
Melrose strategy, a return of capital  
was made to shareholders in February 
2014 to the value of approximately 
£600 million. The balance of the net 
proceeds has been used to pay down 
Melrose’s existing borrowings.
Dynacast/McKechnie
Following the acquisition of the McKechnie 
business in 2005, its Aerospace business 
was subsequently sold for £428 million 
in May 2007, two years after the initial 
acquisition. This resulted in acquisition 
debt being repaid and a return of capital 
to shareholders of £220 million.
During the six years of ownership of 
Dynacast, as a result of the improvement 
in its performance, Melrose quadrupled 
shareholders’ investment, selling the 
business for an enterprise value of 
£377 million in July 2011. Consistent with 
Melrose strategy, following the disposal 
approximately £373 million was returned 
to shareholders in August 2011. 
The final part of the McKechnie business, 
being McKechnie Plastic Components, 
was sold for £30.7 million in June 2012.
The sale of Dynacast means that nearly 
£1 billion in cash was generated from 
the original £429 million McKechnie and 
Dynacast acquisition.

Elster Gas is a world leader 
in gas measurement and gas

With one of the most extensive 
installed utility measurement 
bases in the world and more

last 10 years alone, Elster Gas 
products enable customers  
to efficiently measure,

gas resources across the 
complete gas value chain.
From its four lead plants in Europe and 
the US, coupled with sizeable subsidiary 
operations in China, Malaysia, Russia 
and Mexico, Elster Gas designs and 
manufactures gas meters and related 
products for residential, commercial and 
industrial customers. In addition, the Elster 
Gas control equipment range of products 
is used extensively by global customers in 
both the midstream and downstream gas 
market sectors. 
Global revenues increased by over 5% in 
2013*. There were strong performances 
from the integrated Gas metering station 
business, the new wholly owned Russian 
plant and the US “Perfection” connections 
business. Global demand for conventional 
gas meters remained robust, which 
compensated for further delays in the roll 
out of Smart meters in Europe. The control 
equipment market saw strong demand for 
residential heating products, although the 
process heat market remained flat as 
global steel production stagnated in 2013. 
Operating profit increased significantly 
when compared to 2012, as the actions 
identified by the new management team  
at acquisition started to take effect.  
There has been a significant improvement 
within the North American businesses 
where operational improvements were 
implemented during the year. This included 
the closure of the in-house die casting 
operation at the Nebraska City facility.
Further good progress has also been 
made in rationalising the European 
manufacturing footprint, with production  
of a number of products previously 
manufactured in Western Europe transferred 
to the newly extended plant in Slovakia.  
In addition, three sites were closed in  
2013 and this strategy will continue to be 
executed throughout 2014 and 2015.

Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report Proven, trusted metering solutions  
for the gas industry
The introduction of new products and 
technologies requires a clear focus on 
productivity, value stream and quality; this 
includes both the metrology and safety 
aspects of gas measurement instruments. 
A key element of this is the complete 
traceability of all components over the 
entire value chain.
Semi-automatic production lines
The Elster Gas site at Lotte, Germany, features a highly automated production line  
with an annual capacity of 2 million gas meters. In future, Elster Gas’s global manufacturing  
network will be managed from Lotte. The implementation of the EU directive to replace  
the majority of existing meters with Smart meters by 2022 is expected to result in demand  
for up to 70 million Smart meters. The Lotte site is increasing its operational capacity to  
meet this demand.
Products
Universal device for volume 
conversion, billing and system 
monitoring, with optional GSM/GPRS 
modem – used in diaphragm-turbine 
or rotary meters
Rotary gas meter (RABO) for high 
measuring rates, compact dimensions 
and high accuracy
Encal 3000 gas Chromotograph for 
Biogas analysis applications
Chekker mechanical index for 
diaphragm gas meters with checksum 
generation to cross-check data for 
accurate billing
Key strengths
With proven excellence in engineering, 
sales and operational capability and a 
“Best in Class” approach to everything 
it does, Elster Gas is well positioned to 
exploit growth opportunities and to 
succeed as technology shifts towards 
Smart meter solutions. In parallel, 
Elster Gas is expanding its global 
service network winning customer 
loyalty across the world.
Capital investment to support Smart meter 
growth will be committed as required. 
These investments will primarily be at our 
Osnabruck and Stara Tura facilities and 
will be phased as the Smart rollout in 
Europe gains momentum.
In 2013, there were four major new 
product launches, focused primarily at the 
commercial and industrial sector, which is 
a key element in better positioning the 
business to exploit the projected long-term 
growth in its end markets. In Italy, Elster 
launched Themis Plus, the first commercial 
and industrial diaphragm meter in the world 
to measure, display and transmit billing data 
daily based on the standard volume of gas. 
Until now, in the gas industry these functions 
have been carried out by separate devices. 
75 million
Gas metering devices deployed over  
the last 10 years
Elster are also involved in the Smart 
residential gas meter programmes in the 
UK. While overall progress in the UK has 
been slower than expected, a number of 
key milestones have recently been passed 
and there is an expectation that more 
significant progress will be made in 2014.
Outlook
Elster Gas end markets remain healthy 
with order input in 2013 similar to that 
achieved in 2012. When coupled with 
further planned operational and cost 
improvements, Elster Gas should enjoy 
another good performance in 2014.

Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report Europe and Africa have seen significant 
growth over the last year. In Europe 
the third Energy Package is calling for a 
European-wide roll out of Smart meter 
solutions through to 2022 and significant 
growth is expected in the coming years. 
Elster Electricity is well positioned with 
a broad range of products and solutions 
to capture its fair share of the market. 
The Middle East, led by United Arab 
Emirates, where a regulatory framework 
is now in place to upgrade the metering 
infrastructure, is also expected to 
experience further growth.
The main markets served in the 
Asia Pacific regions are Australia and 
New Zealand. These are managed 
through dedicated sales offices. As with 
other regions served, the regulatory 
framework is in place to upgrade the 
metering infrastructure. 
5 million
Elster Electricity has deployed more than 5 million 
Smart residential meters over the last six years
Sales grew in Europe based on initial 
Smart metering pilot projects, which will 
pave the way for later full deployments 
across a number of key utilities within 
most served markets. Tender activities  
in the year give management confidence 
that further growth is to be expected in  
the coming years. The North American 
market saw a slight revenue decrease 
compared to the previous period in line 
with expectations following significant 
Smart metering deployment over the  
last few years.
Operating profit improved significantly 
as a result of consolidation activities 
started in 2012, both in North America 
and Europe.

this also resulted in a streamlining of all 
other central functions across sales, 
development and product management  
in the US. In Europe a similar initiative 
commenced with key operational functions 
consolidated into Romania. At the same 
time development, product management 
and sales were strengthened across all 
markets served to support the future roll 
out of Smart metering solutions. 
During 2014, management focus will be on 
further optimising processes across all 
functions, with investments in open Meter 
Data Collection solutions and partnerships  
with Smart Grid application providers. 
Outlook
The global market will continue to see  
a shift from “traditional” metering to 
Smart meter solutions in 2014. Whilst 
management expect the North America 
market to stabilise at current sales 
volumes, other markets are expected to 
see growth, especially Europe, where the 
year will see further pilot projects and 
significant tender activities for deployment 
in 2015 and beyond.

Business  
review
Elster Water designs, 
manufactures and provides a 
comprehensive range of water 
metering solutions including 
high accuracy mechanical 
meters, fully electronic meters 
and Smart metering solutions 
for residential, commercial and 
industrial sectors.
Operating profit substantially improved in 
2013, when compared to 2012. This 
followed the completion of restructuring 
work that was started in 2012 and 
completed during the first half of 2013. 
The business ceased its manufacture of 
mechanical meters for the North American 
market which resulted in the closure of its 
large production site and the creation of a 
sales and distribution centre focusing on 
electronic residential and commercial and 
industrial products for the US market. In 
Europe, Elster Water further rationalised 
product lines and closed production sites 
with the consolidation of its production 
into its core manufacturing sites and 
further investment in local sales and 
distribution centres. 
The move to higher accuracy meters and 
the discontinuation of low margin, low 
accuracy meters favourably impacted 
average meter selling prices. The Elster 
Water business continued to be very 
successful in reducing its overhead cost 
base through restructuring, which 
significantly contributed to the operating 
profit improvement. The business also 
benefited from a year-on-year reduction  
in working capital, with strong 
cash conversion. 
Total revenue reduced 15% in 2013, when 
compared to 2012. This was due to the 
cessation of North American mechanical 
meter production from the end of the  
first half of 2013, the rationalisation of  
low accuracy, low margin products in 
Germany and Poland, the closure of  
sales offices, the completion of a large 
Australian contract in 2012 and a move to 
third party distribution in South America. 
Within Europe, the Middle East and the 
Asia Pacific regions, revenues were 
generally flat. Africa delivered good  
levels of growth.

Brush Turbogenerators 
(“Turbogenerators”) is the 
world’s largest independent 
manufacturer of electricity 
generating equipment for the 
power generation, industrial,  
oil & gas and offshore sectors. 
From its four plants in the UK, Czech 
Republic, Netherlands and US it designs, 
manufactures and services turbogenerators, 
principally in the 10 MW to 250 MW  
range, for both gas and steam turbine 
applications and supplies a globally 
diverse customer base. 
In addition, Brush designs and 
manufactures system and power 
transformers under the brand name  
Brush Transformers (“Transformers”)  
and also produces a wide range of indoor 
and outdoor medium voltage AC/DC 
switchgear under the Hawker Siddeley 
Switchgear (“HSS”) brand name. 
Harrington Generators International (“HGI”) 
is a specialist UK based small generator 
manufacturer supplying the construction, 
military, telecoms and rail sectors.
Turbogenerators is a late cycle business 
and as such macro-economic factors 
typically impact new machine order intake 
with a lag of approximately 18 months. 
The global financial crisis has created 
delays in funding approvals and 
uncertainty in investment decisions 
affecting the order intake levels of Brush’s 
Turbine OEM customers. These factors  
all had a subsequent impact on market 
levels during the first half of 2013 and are 
anticipated to do so in 2014.
Whilst the turbogenerator market in 
general is believed to be circa 35% down, 
Brush managed to outperform the market 
with generator sales down just 17%. This 
performance has continued to include a 
higher than normal proportion of smaller 
machines, with unit sales just 4% down 
year-on-year.
Brush has continued its extensive capital 
investment programme across all of its 
units, focused on efficiency improvement, 
state of the art engineering machinery and 
production processes as well as product 
development. These benefits are delivering 
positive results.

bring increased demand for the European 
factories, to satisfy the demand during 
the factory build and into the long term 
for key sub-component manufacture.
The turbogenerator plant in the 
Netherlands had an improved year, 
benefiting from restructuring that took 
place in 2012. The industrial market for 
these machines remains competitive and 
further efficiency restructuring during 2014 
will position this business to compete 
more aggressively in the global market.
Investment in research and development 
continues at a strong pace in Brush with 
the introduction of uprated and new 
products across its product lines. One  
of these developments resulted in the 
delivery, in the last quarter of 2013, of a 
200 MW turbogenerator for a project in 
Colombia. This is the largest air-cooled 
generator ever built by Brush. Existing 
generators in the range have had their 
output and performance significantly 
increased as a result of the research and 
development programmes put in place by 
Brush. This has led to new orders and the 
successful retention of existing business.
The growth and development of the 
aftermarket business remained a key 
priority, capitalising on the significant fleet 
of Brush machines in the market globally, 
many of which are of an age to benefit 
from lifetime extension activities, as well as 
opportunities to use aftermarket expertise 
on third party machines. During the year 
the aftermarket business was separated 
out into one global business unit within 
Brush, to focus on this growth; this also 
allowed workshop facilities and service 
engineers to be managed more efficiently 
as one global resource. Aftermarket 
contributed strongly to 2013, helping to 
mitigate a softer market for new machines, 
by launching various new service offerings.
The aftermarket workshop facility in 
the US benefited from significant capital 
investment, increasing its efficiency and 
capacity and thus its ability to address 
the key markets of the Americas, and 
was completed in time for the important 
autumn outage season. As a result of all 
these initiatives, aftermarket order intake 
was 34% above the previous year.
The HSS business had another strong 
year with sales 6% ahead and operating 
profit 37% ahead of the previous year.  
The business was able to benefit from both  
the restructuring programme in 2012 and  
the capital project to convert the factory 
layout to product flow lines. New product 
development remains a key priority for the 
HSS business, with further enhancements 
to the indoor AC Eclipse and AC/DC rail 
network products a major focus.
Revenue within the Transformers 
business has improved by 5% year-on-
year as we enter the fourth of the current 
five year OFGEM (the UK Government’s 
Office of Gas and Electricity Markets) 
cycle. The capital expenditure 
programme approved to reorganise the 
production process and value engineer 
the product is nearing completion; 
this has resulted in significant margin 
improvement and another strong year 
of growth for the Transformers business. 
Capital was approved to develop, 
design and manufacture high voltage 
132kV transformers, to support our power 
distribution customers in the UK and 
open up increased export opportunities.
Outlook
The medium to long-term growth 
prospects in power generation and in 
particular the aero-derivative gas turbine 
market, where Brush has such a strong 
leading position, remain positive. This, 
coupled with the additional growth 
available by entering the Chinese market 
and continued operational improvements, 
means the business is well positioned to 
benefit. As stated above, the overall 
market dynamics remain challenging in the 
short term. However, this will continue to 
be mitigated by growth in the aftermarket 
business, aided by internal reorganisation, 
product development, continued 
investment and efficiency improvements.

This £30 million capital investment will 
produce generators primarily for the 
Chinese market. The investment is being 
made in support of several of its 
international turbine customers, who 
are setting up manufacturing operations 
in China to address this significant,

Bridon’s new Neptune Quay 
state-of-the-art manufacturing 
facility is capable of producing 
highly engineered ropes in 
package weights of 650 tonnes. 
The rope closing machine 
(pictured), which is the largest  
of its kind in existence, was 
constructed to a unique 
specification and will enable 
Bridon to produce engineered 
non-rotating multi-strand  
ropes for critical deepwater  
oil and gas applications.
Business  
review  
Bridon designs and 
manufactures a comprehensive 
range of lifting and stabilising 
solutions for applications in wire 
rope, fibre rope, steel wire and 
strand. The business services 
global customers in the oil & 
gas, mining, industrial, marine 
and infrastructure sectors.
Bridon’s trading results were slightly  
lower in 2013 compared to 2012. Whilst 
demand in most of Bridon’s core markets 
remained solid, reductions in expenditure 
in the mining industry impacted demand 
for mining ropes. This effect is likely to 
continue into 2014. Bridon primarily 
supplies ropes for use in existing mines 
rather than in the development of new 
mines and so should be well placed  
when the mining cycle starts to pick up. 
Bridon continued to focus on operational 
improvements across all its factories. 
Working capital control remained  
strong and profit to cash conversion 
improved significantly.
While the onshore rig count in the US and 
Canada was flat, Bridon saw increases for 
onshore oil & gas ropes, reflecting a growth 
in market share through new distribution 
channels. The offshore sector also improved, 
as global production companies invested 
in new ships and platforms. The expansion 
in exploration and drilling also offers Bridon 
the chance to compete for some significant 
contracts for bespoke anchor lines, deep 
water mooring systems and offshore crane 
ropes. The contract for the Stella deep 
water mooring system for offshore 
production was won during the year.
The mining market was much weaker in 
2013 compared to 2012 and this effect was 
felt strongly in the second half of the year. 
Falling commodity prices, reductions in 
capital expenditure by most of the larger 
mining companies, industrial relations issues 
in South Africa and lower order books for 
the mining machine OEMs combined to 
reduce demand significantly. Sales to China 
remained solid but demand in Russia and 
South Africa was subdued. In North 
America demand was also depressed. 
342 tonnes
Bridon’s new factory in Newcastle has already 
produced the largest rope ever made in the UK. 
Weighing 342 tonnes, the rope has a length of 3.5km 
and is used as a hoist rope within offshore oil and 
gas vessels

The commercial construction market in 
the Middle East demonstrated some signs 
of improvement in 2013, while crane rope 
sales showed moderate growth in North 
America, reflecting Bridon’s premier 
position with OEMs. Demand for crane 
and mining ropes remained solid in China 
and demand for oil & gas and industrial 
ropes held up well in Asia. Bridon’s 
Chinese operation based in Hangzhou 
continued to make progress, both in 
domestic and local export markets.
During the year Bridon opened a technical 
and service office in Aberdeen, UK. In 
addition, a new warehouse and service 
centre in Macae, Brazil is now fully 
operational. This facility provides wire rope, 
termination and inspection services to rig 
operators in the fast growing Brazilian  
oil & gas market, as well as supporting 
import sales into Latin America. 
Bridon has continued to upgrade its 
operations through targeted investment and 
by progress in programmes to drive quality, 
efficiency and health and safety. In both North 
America and Europe significant improvements 
were made throughout the factories in 
terms of waste reduction and efficiencies. 
In keeping with Bridon’s strategy to be the 
global technology leader for demanding  
rope applications, Bridon’s new factory in 
Newcastle, UK, is now fully operational. 
This facility has already produced the largest 
rope ever made in the UK, which weighs  
342 tonnes, has a length of 3.5km and is 
used as a hoist rope on offshore oil & gas 
vessels. The plant was profitable in its first 
year of operation. The Neptune Quay facility 
is capable of producing the world’s largest 
and most complex ropes and is equipped to 
load them directly onto barges or vessels in 
the deep water port of the River Tyne for 
export. In addition, the Bridon Technology 
Centre was formally opened in February 
2013 and has been fully operational since the 
middle of the year. The Technology Centre 
provides state of the art new product design, 
development and testing facilities and is 
already fully utilised.
In 2013, Bridon completed 19 product 
development and enhancement projects. 
For the oil & gas sector a low temperature 
polymer core was developed for the Bristar 
and Zebra ropes to allow the first high 
performance ropes to be used in arctic 
conditions at temperatures down to -50°C.
Laboratory at Bridon Technology Centre 
Bridon’s new pioneering state-of-the-art 
manufacturing facility at Neptune Quay, 
Newcastle, UK and the Bridon Technology 
Centre, Doncaster, UK demonstrate Bridon’s 
commitment to global technology 
leadership. These significant investments in 
world leading facilities and expertise greatly 
enhance the organisation’s ability to enable 
its customers to confidently face the 
toughest challenges of deepwater 
exploration and production.
During 2013, Bridon further developed its  
Bridon Academy. As part of its strategy of 
continuing to develop people capability, the 
Academy represents Bridon’s strong commitment 
to invest in its workforce. The Academy offers the 
following learning solutions: management and 
leadership, personal effectiveness, technical and 
compliance. Bridon is adopting the principle of 
70/20/10 learning – 70% on the job, 20% coaching 
and 10% formal training. Comprehensive trainer 
material has been developed and internal 
facilitators have been introduced to ensure that 
Bridon is self-sufficient with expertise being 
retained in-house.

Strategically located around the world
Three new high strength compacted 
crane ropes were developed for the 
industrial sector. Meanwhile in the mining 
sector, further enhancements were made 
to triangular strand and Tiger Blue shovel 
ropes to enhance rope performance and 
improve service life, as well as the 
development of a plastic impregnated 
rope to increase corrosion resistance in 
challenging operating conditions. 
A fully synthetic trawl warp was launched 
for use in the marine sector, which offers 
significant fuel savings to the vessels 
through reduced drag in the water, while  
a synthetic mooring rope was developed 
for Liquefied Natural Gas vessels with 
superior stability and fatigue performance.
Major planned activities for 2014 include  
a spiral strand design enhancement 
involving larger diameter wires, a patented 
advanced sheathing technology with 
translucent inspection windows and a  
new slimline socket for structural and deep 
water mooring applications. Further planned 
projects include improving rope lubrication, 
extra-long deep shaft mining ropes, as well 
as continuing the work on hybrid ropes.
Outlook
Bridon expects demand in oil & gas to 
remain solid in 2014. The oil price and 
demand for oil, particularly in the emerging 
markets, should support activity levels  
in this sector. However, the outlook for 
mining remains very uncertain. Although 
the need for mines to begin replenishing 
their operating equipment should benefit 
Bridon, the timing of this is difficult to 
predict. Commercial construction and 
industrial activity appears to be picking  
up in the US and continuing in China,  
but still remains subdued in some 
developed countries.

A variety of different health and safety KPIs are used by each of the businesses within the Group, 
which are specific to the exact nature of the business and its associated risks. 
Strategic objective
The Company has an objective to stop all preventable accidents.
Performance
As each business uses its own Health and Safety KPIs, performance in 2013 when compared to 
2012 will vary. Further information in relation to the various health and safety initiatives undertaken 
by the Group’s businesses during 2013 can be found within the Corporate Social Responsibility 
section of this Strategic Report on page 51.
Environmental and energy usage
Method of calculation
Environmental KPIs used within the Group and their method of calculation vary by business unit, 
which depends on the specific nature of the operation. A range of environmental measures are 
used, including energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, water consumption, water contamination 
and waste disposal.
Strategic objective
Each of the Group’s businesses is committed to ensuring that their operations have a minimum 
adverse effect on the environment and that ongoing reductions are achieved, where practicable. 
Particular relevance has been placed on the reduction of energy consumption and CO 2 emissions.
Performance
Investment was provided by the Group for several environmental improvement initiatives  
during 2013. The Group is now required to disclose greenhouse gas emissions data in relation to 
the 2013 financial year. See the Corporate Social Responsibility section of this Strategic Report

helps to ensure that the KPIs used are relevant to each business and take into account specific 
operational and reporting requirements. Such KPIs cover operational, quality, commercial and 
human resource measures. Further information regarding some of the Group’s recent initiatives

Strategic Report Governance Financials Shareholder information Risk  
management
The objectives of the Directors and senior 
management are to safeguard and 
increase the value of the business and 
assets of the Group. Achievement of these 
objectives requires the development of 
policies and appropriate internal control 
frameworks to ensure the Group’s 
resources are managed properly and  
any key risks are identified and mitigated, 
where possible.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the 
Group’s overall system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness, while 
the role of management at a business 
level is to implement the policies adopted 
by the Board.
The Audit Committee also monitors the 
effectiveness of the internal control 
processes implemented across the 
Group, through a review of the key 
findings presented by the external and 
internal auditors and discussions with 
senior management.
The Board is responsible for considering 
Audit Committee recommendations  
and ensuring implementation by 
management of those recommendations 
it deems appropriate for the business.
The Group operates on a de-centralised 
basis and the Board has established an 
organisational structure with clear 
reporting procedures, lines of 
responsibility and delegated authority,  
as depicted in the diagram opposite.
A summary of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that could impact on the 
Group’s performance is shown on pages 
36 to 39. Further information detailing the 
internal control and risk management 
policies and procedures operated within 
the Group are shown on pages 64 and 
65 of the Corporate Governance report.
Melrose operates in a variety of sectors and  
countries and is exposed to a wide range of risks  
and uncertainties from a strategic, operational, 
compliance and financial perspective.

The table below lists the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect the Group and highlights the mitigating actions that 
are being taken and the opportunities that the Group aims to exploit. The content of the table, however, is not intended to be 
an exhaustive list of all the risks and uncertainties that may arise.
A risk management and internal controls framework is in place within the Group to ensure that such risks and uncertainties can 
be identified and where possible managed suitably. Each Group business maintains a risk register which is reviewed regularly.
Key risk Description and impact Mitigation Strategic priorities
Strategic risk
Acquisition of new 
businesses and 
improvement strategies
As per the Group’s strategy to buy and improve good underperforming manufacturing 
businesses, there is a risk that the Group will not succeed in driving strategic operational 
improvements to generate value post acquisition or in integrating the newly acquired business 
within the Melrose Group. In making acquisitions, there is a risk of unforeseen liabilities being 
discovered which are not known at the time of the due diligence process but which arose in the 
business before it was acquired. The success of the Group’s acquisition strategy depends on 
identifying targets, obtaining authorisations and having the necessary financing. Even if an 
acquisition is completed, the acquired products and technologies may not be successful or 
may require significantly greater resources and investment than anticipated. The Group may not 
be able to integrate the businesses that it acquires. If integration is unsuccessful, anticipated 
benefits are not realised or trading by acquired businesses falls below expectations, it may be 
necessary to impair the carrying value of these assets. The Group’s return on capital employed 
may fall if acquisition hurdle rates are not met. The Group’s financial performance may suffer 
from goodwill or other acquisition-related impairment charges, or from the identification of 
additional liabilities not known at the time of the acquisition. 
• Structured and focused due diligence undertaken.
•  Focus on acquisition targets that have strong headline fundamentals – high quality products, leading 
market share but are underperforming their potential and ability to generate sustainable cash flows and 
profit growth.
•  Hands-on role taken by Directors and other senior employees of the Group. Development of strategic 
plans, restructuring opportunities, capital expenditure and working capital management.
Timing of disposals In line with our strategy and depending where the Group is within the buy, improve and sell  
strategic cycle, the expected timing of disposal of companies is considered as a principal risk which 
could have a material impact on the Group strategy. Further, due to the Group’s global operations, 
there may be a significant impact on timing of disposal due to political and macroeconomic factors. 
Depending on the timings of disposals and nature of companies’ operations there may be  
long-term liabilities which could be retained by the Group. Insufficient allowance for indemnities 
and warranties given at disposal may also affect the Group’s financial position. 
•  Directors are experienced in judging and regularly reviewing the appropriate time in a business cycle for 
disposal to realise maximum value for shareholders.
•  Each disposal is assessed on its merits, along with the extent to which indemnities, warranties and 
guarantees are provided.
Operational risk
Economic and political risk The Group operates, through manufacturing and/or sales facilities, in over 50 countries and is 
affected by global economic conditions particularly in the US and Europe. Businesses are also 
affected by government spending priorities and the willingness of governments to commit 
substantial resources. Current global economic and financial market conditions and the 
potential for a significant and prolonged global recession, may materially and adversely affect 
the Group’s operational performance, financial condition and could have significant impact on 
timing of acquisitions and disposals. 
A recession may also materially affect customers, suppliers and other parties with which the 
Group does business. Adverse economic and financial market conditions may cause 
customers to terminate existing orders, to reduce their purchases from the Group, or to be 
unable to meet their obligations to pay outstanding debts to the Group. These market 
conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to the Group 
or to change the credit terms they extend to Group businesses. 
•  Diverse range of companies operating within the Group, within a variety of different industries and 
countries, which reduces macro-economic and political risks.
•  Regular monitoring of order books and other leading indicators, to ensure the Group and each of its 
businesses can respond quickly to any adverse trading conditions. This includes the identification of cost 
reduction and efficiency measures.
Loss of key management The success of the Group is built upon strong management teams. As a result, the loss of key 
personnel can have a significant impact on performance, at least for a time. The loss of key 
personnel or the failure to plan adequately for succession or develop new talent may impact the 
reputation of the Group, or lead to a disruption in the leadership of the business. Competition for 
personnel is intense and the Group may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified 
personnel, particularly engineering professionals. The loss of key employees, the Group’s inability 
to attract new and adequately trained employees, or a delay in hiring key personnel, could 
seriously harm the Group’s business. Over time, the Group’s competitive advantage is defined by 
the quality of its people; should the Group fail to attract, develop and retain key talent, in time the 
competitive advantage will erode, leading to weaker growth potential or returns in particular with 
significant restructuring activities undertaken to improve the acquired businesses. 
•  Succession planning within the Group and its various businesses is co-ordinated via the Nomination 
Committee in conjunction with the Board and includes all Directors and senior employees.
•  The Company recognises that, as with most businesses, particularly those operating within a technical 
field, it is dependent on Directors and employees with particular managerial, engineering, or technical 
skills. Appropriate remuneration packages and long-term incentive arrangements are offered in an effort 
to retain such individuals.

Key risk Description and impact Mitigation Strategic priorities
Compliance and ethical risk
Legal, regulatory and 
intellectual property (“IP”)
There is a risk that the Group may not always be in complete compliance with laws, regulations 
or permits, for example concerning environmental or safety requirements. The Group could be 
held responsible for liabilities and consequences arising from past or future environmental 
damage, including potentially significant remedial costs. There can also be no assurance that 
any provisions for expected environmental liabilities and remediation costs will adequately cover 
these liabilities or costs.
The Group operates in highly regulated sectors. In addition, new legislation, regulations or 
certification requirements may require additional expense, restrict commercial flexibility and 
business strategies or introduce additional liabilities for the Company or Directors. Should a 
regulator’s approval process take a particularly long time, our products may be delayed in getting 
to market, which could lead to a loss of revenue or benefit a competitor with a similar product. 
Failure to comply with certain regulations may result in significant financial penalties, debarment 
from government contracts and/or reputational damage and impact our business strategy. 
•  Regular monitoring of legal and regulatory matters at both a Group and business unit level. Consultation 
with external advisers where necessary.
•  Development of suitable corporate governance and compliance procedures both at a Group and 
business unit level.
• Protection of rights over trademarks, copyright, patents, designs and trade secrets, where necessary.
Financial risk
Foreign exchange rate Due to the global nature of operations and volatility in the foreign exchange market, exchange 
rate fluctuations have and could continue to have a material impact on the reported results. The 
Group is exposed to three types of currency risk: transaction risk, translation risk and risk when 
a business that is predominantly based in a foreign currency is sold. The Group’s reported 
results will fluctuate as average exchange rates change. The Group’s reported net assets will 
fluctuate as the year-end exchange rate changes.
•  The Group policy is to protect against the majority of foreign exchange risk which affects cash, via 
financial instruments such as hedging.
•  Protection against specific transaction risks is taken by the Board on a case-by-case basis.
Pensions As at 31 December 2013, the Group has legacy defined benefit pension plans, with aggregate 
net liabilities of £219.3 million on an accounting basis. Changes in discount rates, inflation, asset 
values or mortality assumptions could lead to a materially higher deficit. For example, the cost 
of a buyout on a discontinued basis uses more conservative assumptions and is likely to be 
significantly higher than the accounting deficit. In addition, there is a risk that the plan’s assets, 
such as investments in equity and debt securities, will not be sufficient to cover the value of 
those benefits. The implications of a higher pension deficit include a direct impact on valuation, 
credit rating and potential additional funding requirements at subsequent triennial reviews. 
In the event of a major disposal, that generates significant cash proceeds which are returned 
to the shareholders, the Group may be required to make additional cash payments to the plans 
or provide additional security. 
•  Each of the Group’s key funded pension plans are now closed to new entrants and future service 
accrual. Long-term funding arrangements are agreed with each of these plans and reviewed following 
completion of actuarial valuations. Other pension plans exist within the Group but these are largely 
unfunded plans whereby funding plans are not required and benefit obligations are paid when due.
• Active management of pension plan assets.
Liquidity The Group has £341.2 million of debt as at 31 December 2013. The ability to refinance its 
borrowings in the bank or capital markets is dependent on market conditions and the proper 
functioning of financial markets. Furthermore, in line with the Group’s strategy, investment  
is made in the businesses (capital expenditure in excess of depreciation) and there is a 
requirement to assess liquidity and headroom when new businesses are acquired and  
the Group may be unable to refinance its debt when it falls due. 
•  Ensure the Company has adequate resources to meet its liabilities by reviewing its rolling forecasts, 
ensuring there is sufficient headroom within committed bank facilities to cope with market volatility.

certification requirements may require additional expense, restrict commercial flexibility and 
business strategies or introduce additional liabilities for the Company or Directors. Should a 
regulator’s approval process take a particularly long time, our products may be delayed in getting 
to market, which could lead to a loss of revenue or benefit a competitor with a similar product. 
Failure to comply with certain regulations may result in significant financial penalties, debarment 
from government contracts and/or reputational damage and impact our business strategy. 
•  Regular monitoring of legal and regulatory matters at both a Group and business unit level. Consultation 
with external advisers where necessary.
•  Development of suitable corporate governance and compliance procedures both at a Group and 
business unit level.
• Protection of rights over trademarks, copyright, patents, designs and trade secrets, where necessary.
Financial risk
Foreign exchange rate Due to the global nature of operations and volatility in the foreign exchange market, exchange 
rate fluctuations have and could continue to have a material impact on the reported results. The 
Group is exposed to three types of currency risk: transaction risk, translation risk and risk when 
a business that is predominantly based in a foreign currency is sold. The Group’s reported 
results will fluctuate as average exchange rates change. The Group’s reported net assets will 
fluctuate as the year-end exchange rate changes.
•  The Group policy is to protect against the majority of foreign exchange risk which affects cash, via 
financial instruments such as hedging.
•  Protection against specific transaction risks is taken by the Board on a case-by-case basis.
Pensions As at 31 December 2013, the Group has legacy defined benefit pension plans, with aggregate 
net liabilities of £219.3 million on an accounting basis. Changes in discount rates, inflation, asset 
values or mortality assumptions could lead to a materially higher deficit. For example, the cost 
of a buyout on a discontinued basis uses more conservative assumptions and is likely to be 
significantly higher than the accounting deficit. In addition, there is a risk that the plan’s assets, 
such as investments in equity and debt securities, will not be sufficient to cover the value of 
those benefits. The implications of a higher pension deficit include a direct impact on valuation, 
credit rating and potential additional funding requirements at subsequent triennial reviews. 
In the event of a major disposal, that generates significant cash proceeds which are returned 
to the shareholders, the Group may be required to make additional cash payments to the plans 
or provide additional security. 
•  Each of the Group’s key funded pension plans are now closed to new entrants and future service 
accrual. Long-term funding arrangements are agreed with each of these plans and reviewed following 
completion of actuarial valuations. Other pension plans exist within the Group but these are largely 
unfunded plans whereby funding plans are not required and benefit obligations are paid when due.
• Active management of pension plan assets.
Liquidity The Group has £341.2 million of debt as at 31 December 2013. The ability to refinance its 
borrowings in the bank or capital markets is dependent on market conditions and the proper 
functioning of financial markets. Furthermore, in line with the Group’s strategy, investment  
is made in the businesses (capital expenditure in excess of depreciation) and there is a 
requirement to assess liquidity and headroom when new businesses are acquired and  
the Group may be unable to refinance its debt when it falls due. 
•  Ensure the Company has adequate resources to meet its liabilities by reviewing its rolling forecasts, 
ensuring there is sufficient headroom within committed bank facilities to cope with market volatility.

review
The year to 31 December 2013 included the disposal of five 
businesses which in the prior year comprised 22% of annualised 
Group revenue and 28% of annualised Group headline operating 
profit. Consequently, in accordance with IFRS 5, the trading 
results of these businesses have been shown as discontinued 
in both years. 
Split of divisions
The continuing operations consist of the FKI businesses, 
containing the divisions of Energy and Lifting, and the Elster 
businesses, containing the divisions of Gas, Electricity and Water.
 
The discontinued operations include the results, up until the date 
of disposal, of the Marelli business, previously shown within the 
Energy division, the Crosby and Acco businesses, previously 
shown within the Lifting division and the Truth and Harris 
businesses, previously shown within the Other Industrial division. 
In addition, the discontinued operations in 2012 include the 
results of the MPC business, previously shown within the 
Other Industrial division.
Group trading results – continuing operations
To help understand the results of the continuing operations the 
term “headline” has been used. This refers to results calculated 
before exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible 
asset amortisation as this is considered by the Melrose Board 
to be the best measure of performance.
For the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group achieved 
revenue from continuing operations of £1,732.8 million (2012: 
£1,051.1 million). Headline operating profit in the year ended 
31 December 2013 was £274.9 million (2012: £149.3 million) and 
the headline operating profit margin (defined as the percentage 
of headline operating profit to revenue) increased from 14.2%  
in 2012 to 15.9% in 2013. The results for 2013 are not directly 
comparable to 2012 as the prior year performance includes only 
four months of Elster trading after its acquisition on 23 August 
2012. This is explained in more detail later in this report.
After exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible  
asset amortisation, Group operating profit was £219.9 million 
(2012: £54.0 million).

Central costs comprise £13.5 million (2012: £13.7 million) of 
Melrose corporate costs and a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) 
accrual of £13.0 million (2012: £8.5 million). The LTIP accrual 
includes an amount of £4.0 million in respect of the Melrose 
share-based Incentive Plan (2012: £3.5 million), and a charge of 
£9.0 million (2012: £5.0 million) for the cash-based divisional 
management incentive plans. 
“ Headline operating profit in the year ended

Headline operating profit margin increased  
from 14.2% in 2012 to 15.9% in 2013.”
Proforma Group trading results
The results for 2013 are not directly comparable to 2012 as the 
prior year performance includes only four months of Elster trading 
after its acquisition on 23 August 2012. A more appropriate 
comparative to use for 2012 would include a full year’s ownership 
of Elster in 2012, along with an allowance for the finance costs of 
the acquisition and a consistent number of shares in both years, 
at constant currency. The pre-ownership results of Elster were 
prepared under previous accounting policies and US GAAP.

Finance costs and income
The net headline finance cost in 2013 was £48.8 million (2012: 
£31.4 million).
In 2013 the Group had a blended interest rate of 3.1% (2012: 
2.7%). The increase in the absolute value of finance costs results 
from the full year effect of the higher net debt following the 
acquisition of Elster on 23 August 2012. 
Net interest on external bank loans, overdrafts and cash balances 
was £34.4 million (2012: £21.9 million). Melrose uses interest rate 
swaps to fix the majority of the interest rate exposure on its drawn 
debt. More detail on these swaps is given in the finance cost risk 
management section of this review. 
Also included in the net headline finance cost is a £4.7 million 
(2012: £2.4 million) amortisation charge relating to the 
arrangement costs of raising the bank facility, a net interest cost 
on pension liabilities of £9.0 million (2012: £6.2 million) and a 
charge for the unwinding of discounts on long-term provisions of 
£0.7 million (2012: £0.9 million). 
The introduction of IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits” in 2013 
has resulted in the pension interest charge being £5.1 million 
higher than it would have been under the previous accounting 
standard and increased the 2012 pension interest charge by 
£2.7 million.
Tax
The headline Income Statement tax rate was 27% (2012: 27%). 
The headline tax rate was expected to increase in 2013, where a 
full year of 2013 Elster results are included, but the disposal of 
FKI businesses with tax rates higher than the Group average 
offset this expected increase.
The reason that the headline tax rate for the Group is lower than 
the weighted blend of the statutory tax rates around the world is 
the recognition of deferred tax assets that were not previously 
thought to be recoverable. There is also a small benefit from the 
release of provisions previously held against potential overseas 
tax audits which have been successfully cleared for less cost 
than expected. 
 
The tax rate after exceptional items and intangible asset 
amortisation is 29% (2012: 210%). The main reason for the higher 
rate after exceptional items than the headline rate is the 
£8.1 million exceptional tax charge on Group reorganisations 
against which there is no income.
The cash tax rate on headline continuing operations of 21% 
(2012: 24%) is again below the headline Income Statement rate 
due to the benefit arising from the utilisation of pre-existing 
Melrose Group tax losses and other deferred tax assets. The rate 
includes £9 million paid during the year in settlement of tax audits 
of the Elster businesses relating to tax periods ended prior to our 
ownership of Elster.
The deferred tax liability of £287.4 million (2012: £347.2 million) in 
respect of intangible assets is not expected to represent a future 
cash tax payment and will unwind as the brand names and 
customer relationships are amortised.
The total amount of tax losses in the Group has decreased 
during the year due to their utilisation against taxable profits and 
also as a result of some forfeiture on Group reorganisations. 
The total gross tax losses within the Group are shown below:
Tax

Total 2013 42.0 175.1 217.1
Total 2012 35.5 215.1 250.6 
Exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets
In the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group incurred 
exceptional operating costs of £19.3 million (2012: £70.8 million). 
These include £14.1 million of restructuring costs in Elster, which 
are expected to deliver further cost savings in the future, and 
other restructuring costs of £4.7 million which occurred in FKI. 
The Group benefited from exceptional income of £28.9 million 
(2012: £7.0 million) mainly as a result of success in resolving a 
number of warranty issues inherited with the acquisition of Elster 
for less expense than expected. There were no exceptional 
finance costs in the year (2012: £16.3 million).
In addition, intangible asset amortisation of £64.6 million (2012: 
£31.5 million) was charged. A net tax credit on these exceptional 
costs, exceptional income and intangible asset amortisation, of 
£18.9 million (2012: £24.1 million), and an exceptional tax charge 
of £8.1 million (2012: £5.8 million) has been taken in the year.
Overall, the net exceptional items and intangible asset 
amortisation, after tax, shows a net expense of £44.2 million 
(2012: £93.3 million).
Fair value exercise
Upon the acquisition of Elster, on 23 August 2012, in accordance 
with IFRS 3: “Business Combinations”, an extensive review of the 
Elster assets, liabilities and accounting policies commenced and 
this was completed by the half year in 2013. Certain fair value 
adjustments were identified in the first half of 2013 which 
increased goodwill by £29.3 million with corresponding increases 
to provisions of £32.9 million, deferred tax assets of £5.2 million, 
and other Balance Sheet items of £1.6 million. The 2012 Balance 
Sheet was restated for these items in accordance with IFRS 3.
Earnings per share (EPS) and number of shares in issue
In accordance with IAS 33, two sets of basic and diluted EPS 
numbers are disclosed on the face of the Income Statement, one 
for continuing operations and one that also includes discontinued 
operations. In the year ended 31 December 2013, the diluted 
EPS for continuing operations was 9.3p (2012: loss of 0.9p). For 
continuing and discontinued operations the diluted EPS for 2013 
was 43.7p (2012: 4.1p).
42
 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report Headline continuing diluted EPS for 2013 was 12.8p (2012: 
8.8p). However, to reflect the underlying earnings performance, 
a proforma basis has been used for the continuing results in 
2012. This assumes that Elster had been owned for the full year 
in 2012 (unaudited), with an allowance for the finance cost of 
the acquisition for the period Elster was not owned, and uses 
the same number of shares in both years, at constant currency. 
On this basis, the proforma headline continuing diluted EPS 
growth is 36%.
Disposals during the year
On 22 November 2013 the disposal of Crosby and Acco to a 
newly incorporated company, controlled by affiliates of Kohlberg 
Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P, was completed for a gross cash 
consideration of £632.6 million. The profit on disposal of these 
two businesses was £256.6 million after costs of £13.0 million.
Three other businesses were disposed in 2013, Truth, Marelli and 
Harris. The gross disposal proceeds for these three businesses 
was £317.8 million with related costs of £12.0 million, realising 
a profit on disposal of £144.1 million. 
These five businesses were all acquired with FKI in July 2008 
and contributed £392.8 million of revenue and £79.5 million of 
headline operating profit in 2013, shown within discontinued 
operations. During the five years of Melrose ownership, the 
shareholder value in these businesses increased by 
approximately 3.5 times. 
At 31 December 2013, £1.7 billion of cash had been generated 
from trading and disposal proceeds in respect of the FKI 
acquisition so far, which compares to the acquisition cost of just 
under £1 billion, even though two large businesses, namely 
Brush and Bridon, remain in the Melrose Group.
Cash generation and management
The cash generation performance in 2013 and the movement 
in net debt are summarised as follows:
2013
£m
Headline operating profit 274.9 
Depreciation and amortisation of computer software 
and development costs 40.7 
Working capital movement (13.5)
Headline operating cash flow (pre capex) 302.1 
Headline EBITDA conversion to cash (pre capex) % 96%
Net capital expenditure (44.6)
Net interest and net tax paid (78.4)
Defined benefit pension contributions (32.7)
Other (including discontinued operations) (37.1)
Cash inflow from trading (after all costs including tax) 109.3
The conversion of headline operating profit (before depreciation 
and amortisation) into cash was 96% in 2013 (2012: 85%). This 
strong level of cash generation was consistent across both the 
FKI and Elster businesses.
The movement in net debt in the year is reconciled as follows:
2013

Opening net debt (997.7)
Cash inflow from trading (after all costs including tax) 109.3
Net cash flow from disposals

Closing net debt (140.8)
(1)  Gross disposal proceeds of £950.4 million, less costs of £25.0 million and cash  
disposed of £37.2 million.
The Balance Sheet leverage (calculated as net debt divided 
by continuing headline operating profit before depreciation 
and amortisation) was approximately 0.4x at 31 December 2013 
(31 December 2012: 2.6x). Net debt increased in February 
2014 following the return of capital and, allowing for this, the 
proforma leverage at 31 December 2013 would have been 
2.3x which is considered to be a better measure of the 
underlying leverage level.
Capital expenditure
By business, the net capital expenditure and depreciation in the 
year was as follows:
Elster FKI Central Total
Net capital expenditure £m 18.8 25.1 0.7 44.6
Depreciation £m 26.6 13.4 0.7 40.7
Net capital expenditure to 
depreciation ratio (full year) 0.7x 1.9x 1.0x 1.1x
Melrose nine year (2005-2013) 
average annual multiple 1.3x
The net capital spend to depreciation ratio was 1.1x in 2013 
(2012: 1.7x). Within this, the ratio in the FKI businesses was 1.9x 
which included the commencement of the significant investment 
in a new factory in the Shanghai area of China. This is discussed 
further in the Chief Executive’s review. The net capital spend to 
depreciation ratio in Elster was 0.7x, while the Board assessed 
strategies for these businesses. Elster is inherently a less capital 
intensive business than FKI.

The goodwill and intangible assets have been tested for

that no impairment is required.
Provisions
Total provisions at 31 December 2013 were £177.8 million 
(31 December 2012: £287.2 million). The significant decrease year 
on year related to the cash spend on restructuring provisions that 
were mainly set up in 2012 following the acquisition of Elster, 
along with a conscious decision to resolve certain warranty 
liabilities inherited with Elster. In total, £98.2 million of cash was 
spent on provisions of which £72.2 million related to restructuring 
and warranty. The following table details the movement in 
provisions in the year:
Total

Disposal of businesses (9.8)
Other (including foreign exchange) 1.6 
At 31 December 2013 177.8 
The net release to exceptional items of £3.7 million includes 
£26.9 million of provisions originally booked as fair value 
adjustments but no longer required due to their successful 
resolution, offset by £23.2 million of exceptional costs in the year, 
mainly relating to further restructuring costs at Elster.
The significant reduction in provisions has not distorted headline 
operating profit because there was a net charge to headline 
operating profit in the year of £7.9 million.
Pensions
The Group has a number of defined benefit and defined 
contribution pension plans.
On 1 January 2013, IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits” was 
adopted which increased the pre-tax pension expense in the year 
by £7.9 million (2012: £4.8 million).
In July 2013, the FKI UK Pension Plan was demerged into three 
pension plans, resulting in two new pension plans being set up, 
namely, the Brush Group (2013) Pension Plan and the Bridon 
Group (2013) Pension Plan. These three defined benefit plans are 
now run independently and are closed to new members and to 
current members’ future service.
Despite the demerger in July 2013, the FKI UK Pension Plan 
remains the most significant pension plan in the Group with an 
accounting net deficit of £70.8 million at 31 December 2013. Plan 
assets were £452.5 million and plan liabilities were £523.3 million. 
At 31 December 2013, the three FKI UK plans had an  
accounting net deficit of £109.2 million (31 December 2012: 
£100.0 million). This was net of plan assets at 31 December 2013 
of £671.4 million (31 December 2012: £630.2 million) and liabilities 
of £780.6 million (31 December 2012: £730.2 million). 
The other UK defined benefit pension plan of significant size  
in the Group, namely the McKechnie UK Pension Plan, had a 
deficit of £0.5 million at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: 
£8.2 million). This plan had assets at 31 December 2013 of 
£182.5 million (31 December 2012: £170.8 million) and liabilities  
of £183.0 million (31 December 2012: £179.0 million). The 
McKechnie UK Pension Plan is closed both to new members  
and current members’ future service.
 
In addition, a US defined benefit plan for FKI exists. At 31 December 
2013, the FKI US plan had assets of £177.6 million (31 December 
2012: £198.3 million), liabilities of £183.0 million (31 December 
2012: £228.4 million) and consequently a net deficit of £5.4 million 
(31 December 2012: £30.1 million). This plan is closed to new 
members and to current members’ future service.
Elster has a number of defined benefit plans, most of which 
are unfunded, with a net accounting deficit at 31 December 2013  
of £101.5 million (31 December 2012: £115.2 million). Within  
this, 82%, £83.6 million, (31 December 2012: 78%) related 
to unfunded German defined benefit plans and early 
retirement programmes.

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report The assumptions used to calculate the IAS 19 deficit for all 
pension plans within the Melrose Group are considered carefully 
by the Board of Directors. 
For the most significant plan (the FKI UK Pension Plan) a male 
aged 65 in 2013 is expected to live for a further 21.9 years 
(31 December 2012: 22.1 years), whilst a woman aged 65 would 
live for a further 24.1 years (31 December 2012: 24.2 years). This 
is assumed to increase by 1.4 years (6%) for a male and 1.5 years 
(6%) for a female aged 65 in 2033. 
A summary of the other key assumptions used for all of the UK 
plans is shown below:
2013 Assumptions 
%
2012 Assumptions 
%
Discount rate 4.40 4.50
Inflation 3.40 3.00
It is noted that a 0.1 percentage point decrease in the discount 
rate would increase the pension liabilities on the UK pension 
plans by £14.8 million, or 2%, and a 0.1 percentage point 
increase to inflation would increase the liabilities on these plans 
by £10.9 million, or 1%. Furthermore, an increase by one year in 
the expected life of a 65 year old member would increase the 
pension liabilities on these plans by £24.4 million, or 3%.
The long-term strategy for the UK plans is to concentrate on the 
cash flows required to fund the liabilities as they fall due whether 
that is within the timescales of Melrose ownership or beyond. The 
pension plan cash flows extend many years into the future and 
the ultimate objective is that the total pool of assets derived from 
future company contributions and the investment strategy allows  
each cash payment to members to be made when due. In 2013 
the Melrose Group made annual contributions of £20.0 million,  
in total, (2012: £18.5 million) to the three UK schemes within  
the FKI businesses and £5.2 million (2012: £4.6 million) to the 
McKechnie UK Pension Plan. 
The Melrose Board recognises that as businesses are bought and 
sold then pension plan liabilities need to exit the Group, however 
this can be done at a time which is commercially sensible.
Risk management
The financial risks the Group faces have been considered and 
policies have been implemented to best deal with each risk. 
The most significant financial risks are considered to be liquidity 
risk, finance cost risk, exchange rate risk, contract and warranty 
risk and commodity cost risk. These are discussed in turn below.
Liquidity risk management
The Group’s net debt position at 31 December 2013 was 
£140.8 million compared to £997.7 million a year earlier. The 
decrease in net debt resulted, primarily, from the five disposals 
completed during the year. The return of capital of £595.3 million, 
discussed under post balance sheet events later in this review, 
increased net debt in February 2014.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had a committed term loan 
drawn down in two tranches of £180 million and US $290 million. 
In addition, the Group has two revolving credit facilities  
of £741.5 million and €300 million at 31 December 2013.  
These facilities are due to mature on 29 June 2017. 
The Sterling denominated term loan is subject to mandatory 
repayments of 5% on 30 June 2015, 30 June 2016 and 
31 December 2016, adjusted for non-mandatory repayments and 
cancellations. The US Dollar denominated term loan is no longer 
subject to mandatory repayment following the repayment and 
cancellation of US $210 million in the year.
The facility has two financial covenants, a net debt to headline 
EBITDA (headline operating profit before depreciation and 
amortisation) covenant and an interest cover covenant, both of 
which are tested half yearly at June and December and both of 
which afforded comfortable headroom at 31 December 2013.
The first covenant, which calculates net debt at average 
exchange rates during the period, was set at 3.25x at 
31 December 2013 and reduces to 3.0x from 30 June 2015 
onwards. For the year ended 31 December 2013 it was 0.5x 
(31 December 2012: 2.6x) but allowing for the return of capital 
was 2.3x on a proforma basis at this date. 
The interest cover covenant remains at 4.0x throughout the life  
of the facility. At 31 December 2013 it was 11.8x (31 December 
2012: 9.1x). 
The drawdown of the facilities are made in the core currencies  
of the Group, being US Dollars, Euro and Sterling and in 
proportions to protect the Group as efficiently as possible from 
currency fluctuations on net assets and profit.
 
In addition, there are a number of uncommitted overdraft, 
guarantee and borrowing facilities made available to the Group. 
These uncommitted facilities are lightly used.
Cash, deposits and marketable securities amounted to 
£200.4 million at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012: 
£156.5 million) and are offset against gross debt of £341.2 million 
(31 December 2012: £1,154.2 million) to arrive at the net debt 
position of £140.8 million (31 December 2012: £997.7 million). The 
combination of this cash and the size of the debt facilities allows 
the Directors to consider that the Group has sufficient access to 
liquidity for its current needs.
The Board takes careful consideration of counterparty risk with 
banks when deciding where to place Melrose’s cash on deposit.

Finance cost risk management
The Group remained in a net debt position at 31 December 2013. 
The Group’s facility bears interest at interbank rates plus a margin 
which varies dependent on the level of the leverage and which 
ranges from 1.40% to 2.65%. As at 31 December 2013, the 
margin was 2.25% (31 December 2012: 2.00%). 
At the beginning of 2013 the Group protected just under 80% of 
gross borrowings from exposure to changes in interest rates by 
holding a number of interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate cost 
on US $560.0 million, £336.8 million and €292.0 million of debt. 
During the year, post the disposals of businesses and the 
resulting reduction in gross debt, several interest rate swap 
arrangements were closed out. This left swap arrangements in 
place fixing the interest rate cost on US $246.8 million, 
£336.8 million and €200.0 million of gross borrowings.
For the swap arrangements that remain, the Group will pay, 
annually in arrears, a weighted blended fixed finance cost of 
0.70% (2012: 0.84%) for US Dollar swaps, 0.72% (2012: 0.78%) 
on Euro swaps and 0.91% (2012: 0.91%) on Sterling swaps, 
plus the relevant bank margin which is currently 2.25%. 
Following the return of capital, on 28 February 2014, 78% 
of gross borrowings are now protected against exposure to 
movement in interest rates.
Exchange rate risk management
The Group trades in various countries around the world and  
is exposed to many different foreign currencies. The Group 
therefore carries an exchange rate risk that can be categorised 
into three types, as described below. The Board policy is 
designed to protect against the majority of the cash risks but  
not the non-cash risks. The most common cash risk is the 
transaction risk the Group takes when it invoices a sale in a 
different currency to the one in which its cost of sale is incurred. 
This is addressed by taking out forward cover against 
approximately 60% to 80% of the anticipated cash flows over 
the following 12 months, placed on a rolling quarterly basis 
and for 100% of each material contract. This does not eliminate 
the cash risk but does bring some certainty to it.
Exchange rates used in the year

average rate Closing rate
2013 1.56 1.66

2012 1.23 1.23
The effect on the key headline numbers in 2013 for the continuing 
Group due to the translation movement of exchange rates from 
2012 to 2013 is shown below. The table illustrates the translation 
movement in revenue and headline operating profit if the 2012 
average exchange rates had been used to calculate the 2013 
results rather than the 2013 average exchange rate.
The translation difference in 2013 £m
Revenue decrease 21.3
Headline operating profit decrease 4.0
For reference in respect of the enlarged Group, an indication of 
the short-term exchange rate risk, which shows both translation 
exchange risk and unhedged transaction exchange rate risk,  
is as follows:
Sensitivity of profit to translation  
and unhedged transaction  
exchange risk
Increase in headline  
operating profit  
£m
For every 10 cent strengthening  
of the US Dollar against Sterling
5.0
For every 10 cent strengthening  
of the Euro against Sterling
8.4
The long-term exchange rate risk, which ignores any hedging 
instruments, is as follows:
Sensitivity of profit to translation  
and full transaction  
exchange rate risk
Increase in headline  
operating profit  
£m
For every 10 cent strengthening  
of the US Dollar against Sterling
7.3
For every 10 cent strengthening  
of the Euro against Sterling
6.4
No specific exchange instruments are used to protect against  
this translation risk because it is a non-cash risk to the Group. 
However, when the Group has net debt, the hedge of having a 
multi-currency debt facility funding these foreign currency trading 
units protects against some of the Balance Sheet and banking 
covenant translation risk.
46
 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report Lastly and potentially the most significant exchange risk that the 
Group has arises when a business that is predominantly based in 
a foreign currency is sold. The proceeds for those businesses 
may be received in a foreign currency and therefore an exchange 
risk might arise if foreign currency proceeds are converted back to 
Sterling, for instance to pay a dividend to shareholders. Protection 
against this risk is considered on a case-by-case basis. 
Contract and warranty risk management
The financial risks connected with contracts and warranties, 
which include the consideration of warranty terms, duration and 
any other commercial or legal terms are considered carefully by 
Melrose before being entered into.
Commodity cost risk management
As Melrose owns engineering businesses across various 
sectors the cumulative expenditure on commodities is important. 
The Group addresses the risk of base commodity costs 
increasing by, wherever possible, passing on the cost increases 
to customers or by having suitable purchase agreements with its 
suppliers which sometimes fix the price over some months into 
the future. On occasions, Melrose does enter into financial 
instruments on commodities when this is considered to be the 
most efficient way of protecting against movements. These risks 
are minimised through sourcing policies (including the use of 
multiple sources, where possible) and procurement contracts 
where prices are agreed for up to one year to limit exposure to 
price volatility.
Post balance sheet events – return of capital
Consistent with the Melrose strategy of returning proceeds to 
shareholders following significant disposals, Melrose announced 
the return of £595.3 million to shareholders on 21 January 2014, 
which was subsequently approved by shareholders on 
7 February 2014.
The return was made via a redeemable share scheme which 
gave shareholders the option of receiving a payment either on 
28 February 2014 or 7 May 2014, or a combination of both.
Alongside the capital return, a share consolidation took place 
which reduced the number of Ordinary Shares by a factor of 
11 for 13, or 15%, from 1,266.6 million to 1,071.8 million.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic Report section of the Annual Report,  
as is the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position, and borrowing facilities. In addition, the consolidated 
financial statements include the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management 
objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources and the breadth 
of the end markets that the Melrose Group companies trade in, 
both by sector and geographically, gives some balance to various 
market and economic cycle risks. Furthermore, the Group has a 
consistent cash generation record, and as a consequence, the 
Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully despite the current uncertain 
economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.

Employment policies
The Group recognises its responsibilities 
for the fair treatment of all its current and 
potential employees in accordance with 
legislation applicable to the territories 
within which it operates, together with 
relevant guidance on good practice where 
applicable. Due to the diverse nature of 
the Group’s activities, businesses are 
required to manage their employment 
matters on a decentralised basis; 
therefore, responsibility for the adoption 
of employment policies and practices sits 
at a local business unit level. This position 
ensures that rigorous and targeted 
policies and procedures are implemented 
that meet both site and local regulatory 
requirements, taking into account the 
size and nature of the businesses.
As part of this decentralised approach, 
each business is responsible for setting 
and measuring its own employment and 
employee-related KPIs and, as such, 
these vary throughout the Group. 
However, such measurements will 
generally include absenteeism, punctuality, 
headcount and employee relations issues. 
Any concerns or adverse trends are 
responded to in a timely manner. Further, 
as a Group-wide policy and so far as 
particular disabilities permit, the Company 
and each of its businesses will give 
employees disabled during their period 
of employment continued employment in 
the same job or, if this is not practicable, 
a suitable alternative job, together with 
appropriate training and/or re-training.
Equal opportunities for appropriate 
training, career development and 
promotion are also available to all 
employees within the Group regardless 
of any physical disability, gender, religion, 
race, nationality, sexual orientation or age.
Applications for employment by 
disabled persons are always fully and 
fairly considered by the Group and are 
considered on merit, with regard only 
to the job-specific requirements and the 
relevant applicant’s aptitude and ability to 
carry out the role, and where reasonable 
to do so, arrangements to enable disabled 
persons to carry out a specific role will be 
made. It is the policy of the Group that in 
recruitment, training, career development 
and promotion, the treatment of disabled 
persons should, as far as possible, be 
identical to that of other employees.
“ The Group recognises its 
responsibilities for the fair 
treatment of all its current 
and potential employees.”
Melrose seeks to be a good 
corporate citizen wherever it 
conducts business, to observe 
all national and local laws and 
take into account regional 
and local concerns, customs 
and traditions. One of the 
fundamental principles of 
Melrose is to conduct all of its 
business in an open, honest 
and ethical manner.

Strategic Report Employee initiatives
During 2013, the Group’s businesses 
implemented a range of employee-related 
initiatives. Some of these are listed below:
• Within Bridon over 1,400 employees, 
which represents 85% of its global 
workforce, completed the second 
Bridon Employee Opinion Survey in 
March 2013. The survey was designed 
to highlight areas for improvement but 
the results for 2013 also confirmed that 
positive progress in engaging the 
workforce has been made since the first 
survey in 2011. For instance, employees 
reported a better understanding of the 
link between the Bridon strategy and 
their personal objectives and daily work 
activities. It was also acknowledged  
that there were better opportunities to 
learn new skills and that management 
coaching and feedback had improved.
• In March 2013, Bridon established the 
“Bridon Academy”, a virtual framework 
for all the learning and development  
that takes place worldwide across its 
business. The Academy offers learning 
solutions in the areas of Management 
and Leadership, Personal Effectiveness, 
Technical Skills and Ethical Compliance 
and has adopted the 70/20/10 principle 
of learning – 70% on the job, 20% coaching 
and 10% formal training. Although the 
majority of training is delivered by internal 
experts and facilitators, external trainers 
are used in specialist areas. Participants 
are from a variety of functions including 
Sales, Technical, Finance, Supply Chain 
and Operations. Over 350 employees 
globally have benefitted so far from 
internal learning solutions, as part of the 
coaching and formal training elements  
of the Academy.
• The Brush Czech “Talent Academy”  
was officially launched in 2013. This  
is a four year training programme for 
selected employees with high potential 
and is divided into two parts. For the 
first three years, the courses focus  
on the development of managers’ 
competences and leadership skills.  
The fourth year is focused on practice; 
the first six months in finance and sales 
training and the next six months in 
developing operational and technical 
skills. The training is provided by an 
external company.
• Within Elster Electricity there were 
various employee related initiatives in 
2013, including an employee satisfaction 
survey in Brazil, a management 
360 degree evaluation in Romania, 
health checks for employees in Russia 
and a series of “knowledge transfer” 
training sessions, including topics such 
as pensions and health insurance.
• The Elster Gas Leadership Conference 
was established in 2013 to introduce the 
new vision, goals and future strategy for 
the business and to align management 
and business priorities with this new 
strategy. Two conferences were held  
in 2013 and senior management team 
members, Managing Directors and 
other executives were invited from  
Elster Gas businesses in Europe,  
North America and Asia.
The Group regards employee training and 
advancement as an essential element of 
industrial relations. Disputes and days lost 
through strike action are negligible.
Employee involvement, consultation 
and development
The Group attaches great importance to good 
labour relations, employee engagement 
and employee development. The diverse 
nature of the Group’s activities places the 
responsibility for the implementation and 
management of employment practices with 
local management, in a manner appropriate 
to each business.
A culture of clear communication and 
employee consultation and engagement 
is inherent in the Group’s businesses. 
Employee briefing sessions with employee 
representatives are held on a regular basis 
to communicate strategy, key changes, 
financial results, achievements and other 
important issues to employees, and receive 
feedback from them on these issues. 
Regular appraisals, employee surveys, 
notice boards, team meetings, suggestion 
boxes and newsletters are also used to 
communicate and engage with employees, 
and to solicit their feedback on issues of 
concern to them as employees.
Extensive training is available to all staff 
and is actively encouraged to ensure a 
high standard of skill is maintained across 
the Group. Cross-training programmes are 
also in place at a number of the Group’s 
businesses. The importance of training 
extends beyond on-the-job training and 
also focuses on enhancing personal 
development. Apprenticeship 
programmes are in place, which help  
to assist with succession planning in 
locations where there is an ageing 
workforce. Employees are encouraged to 
think in an innovative manner across the 
Group and have regard for both financial 
and economic factors affecting the Group.
“ In March 2013, Bridon 
established the ‘Bridon 
Academy’, a virtual 
framework for all the 
learning and development 
that takes place worldwide 
across its business.”

Health & safety
The Directors of the Company are 
committed to minimising the health and 
safety risks that each of the Group’s 
employees are exposed to by promoting 
the effective use and management of 
business specific policies and procedures.
The Group has a policy to ensure that 
the Directors are made aware of any 
serious health and safety incidents, 
wherever they occur in the world, without 
delay to ensure that suitable investigations 
and corrective action can be organised. 
Current events and issues relating to 
health and safety matters are also 
discussed within the Group at quarterly 
Board meetings of the Company.
Each business is responsible for setting  
its own detailed arrangements concerning 
health and safety policies and procedures, 
in accordance with local health and safety 
legislation. As a general rule, businesses 
strive to achieve best practice, in terms of 
what is suitable and practical for the size 
and nature of their operations. The use of 
defined and business specific health and 
safety key performance indicators are also 
used within the Group’s businesses, which 
are specific to the exact nature of their 
businesses and allow for focus, analysis 
and improvement at local levels, often on  
a location by location basis.
Many manufacturing locations within the 
Group hold ISO 18001 certification, the 
internationally recognised assessment 
standard for occupational health and 
safety management systems. This 
certification includes several of the major 
manufacturing locations within the Group.

Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report Divisional managers within each business 
unit have responsibility to ensure that 
health and safety remains a key focus 
and to ensure that active procedures 
and monitoring systems are in place to 
provide substance to written procedures. 
Detailed health and safety plans are set 
by businesses each year to determine 
annual targets and improvement initiatives.
All businesses have Health and Safety 
Committees (“H&S Committees”), which 
meet on a regular basis and are made up 
of representatives from both management 
and shop floor level personnel. Each of 
the H&S Committees has wide-ranging 
responsibilities which vary from business 
to business and include the review of 
reported incidents and the monitoring of 
incident trends. These H&S Committees 
are also responsible for ensuring that 
corrective measures are implemented 
when accidents occur and that all 
incidents, whether or not they are deemed 
reportable under local legislation, are 
given due attention.
One of the key responsibilities for these 
H&S Committees is to carry out regular 
tours of the premises in which they work, 
in order to ensure compliance with local 
policies and procedures. These tours  
also identify potential hazards, for which 
counter-measures can be identified to 
prevent accidents from happening.  
Each H&S Committee recommendation  
is followed up at the next Board meeting 
to ensure that issues are resolved. 
Additionally, operations are audited by  
the H&S Committee at least annually  
and reports of performance and 
recommended improvements are 
prepared and circulated to the divisional 
senior management teams. Divisional 
managers are provided with detailed 
health and safety reports on a frequent 
basis to ensure that such matters are 
given high visibility and that improvements 
are authorised and implemented quickly.
Health and safety initiatives
During 2013, many of the Group’s 
businesses implemented a range of health 
and safety initiatives. Some of these are 
listed below:
• Within Elster Water, a global 
occupational Health & Safety audit 
was carried out in 2013. All sites with 
assembly and/or test activities were 
reviewed by independent professional 
auditors for compliance with national, 
Elster and best practice standards. 
The intention is to provide safe and 
secure work environments for all 
employees worldwide and to motivate 
employees and management to maintain 
these standards. The audit focused on 
workplace regulations, provision and  
use of work equipment, machine safety, 
lifting operation and lifting equipment 
regulations, manual handling operations 
and personal protective equipment 
regulations. The implementation of 
identified improvement opportunities 
was initiated immediately. No significant 
shortfall for immediate attention was 
highlighted by the auditors. 
• In 2013, Brush Czech focused on 
working at height, which represents 
a serious potential workplace risk. 
New measures were introduced 
which improved safety and additionally 
helped to ensure compliance with 
ISO 18001 standards.
• Elster Electricity carried out numerous 
Health & Safety training courses in 
2013, including the prevention of 
accidents and occupational diseases 
in Argentina, training on firefighting 
equipment and fire safety in China, 
working at height in Russia and 
electricity safety and new hazardous 
communication standardisation 
training in the US.
• In 2013, a new work process was 
introduced at the Bridon site in 
Doncaster, known as a Mission Directed 
Work stream, for Safety, Health and the 
Environment; this aims to assist shift 
managers, team leaders and their teams 
in creating a work environment that is 
safe, healthy and where environmental 
risks are managed. The objectives 
include enabling employees to 
understand and apply health, safety and 
environmental policies and procedures, 
to set up and use visual controls, to 
identify and control hazards, to develop 
and implement a health, safety and 
environmental audit and to continually 
improve risk management in the work 
place. This has been implemented in  
all areas of the Doncaster site and 
assessment takes place on a monthly 
basis to ensure continual improvement.
“ Divisional managers within each business 
unit have responsibility to ensure that 
health and safety remains a key focus.”

The environment
The Directors of the Company fully 
understand the importance of the Group’s 
environmental responsibilities. Each of 
the Company’s businesses is committed 
to ensuring that their operations have 
a minimum adverse effect on the 
environment and that ongoing reductions 
in both energy usage and CO
2 emissions 
are achieved, wherever practicable.
Although there are no standardised 
environmental KPIs currently used within 
the Group, each business understands 
the importance of monitoring the impact 
of its operations on the environment. 
A range of KPIs are used as environmental 
measures, including energy consumption, 
CO
2 emissions, water consumption, water 
contamination, waste disposal, solid and 
liquid waste generation, recycling and 
volatile organic compound emissions. 
Environmental performance is measured  
via the use of KPIs in order that each  
of the businesses can plan for  
ongoing reductions.
A number of the Group’s businesses have 
achieved, or are currently in the process 
of achieving, the high standards required 
to obtain ISO 14001 Environmental 
Management Systems certification.
During the year, the Company continued 
to comply with the ongoing annual 
reporting requirements of the UK’s  
Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy 
Efficiency Scheme.
Environmental initiatives
During 2013, many of the Group’s 
businesses implemented a range of 
environmental improvement initiatives. 
Some of these are listed below:
• Investment in state-of-the-art energy 
efficient production and test equipment 
for water meters continues to reduce 
carbon emissions during the production 
process of the meters. Elster Water 
introduced two further rapid test rigs in 
Luton and Brussels. These rigs, which 
are specifically designed for volumetric 
meters, reduce test time and required 
water volume significantly compared to 
standard test rigs for other product 
lines. This reduces energy and water 
consumption considerably.
• At Bridon Hangzhou, China, the 
Maintenance Department suggested 
ways to save water, following an 
inspection of the cooling water circulation 
system and monitoring the water usage 
in the wire drawing and extrusion 
processes. By reusing cooling water 
wherever possible and introducing a 
water cooling system, the site was able 
to save 24,500 tons of water in 2013.
• At the Brush Czech facility, heating  
and lighting consumption is the major 
source of CO
2
 emissions and represents 
a substantial production cost. In order 
to decrease this cost, the company is 
renovating a different part of the building 
insulation each year, in particular 
windows and doors. They are also using 
sophisticated heating software which 
allows them to monitor and regulate the 
interior temperature during the colder 
times of the year. The temperature is 
also monitored daily and evaluated and 
adapted to current requirements of 
individual workplaces. In 2013, the 
heating temperature in the production 
buildings was optimised, which reduced 
the heating consumption by 17%.
• In 2013, a 74% saving was made in 
water usage at the Brush Loughborough, 
UK, site. The main water saving across 
the site came from the introduction of 
a new urinal outlet system called Ureco. 
This accounted for a 97% saving in 
2013 on water consumption for all of the 
mains water-fed urinals throughout the 
Brush UK site.
• At Elster Electricity in Mexico, a “Green 
Day” was held in 2013 to promote the 
care of the environment, which included 
workshops on recycling, reforestation 
and water saving. This was attended  
by both employees and their families.
• The three largest facilities in Elster  
Gas North America – Nebraska City, 
Nebraska, Perfection in Geneva, 
Ohio, and Hauck Manufacturing in 
Lebanon, Pennsylvania – completed 
their first ever registration with 
ISO 14001, Environmental Management 
Systems and attained certification in 
2013. The two facilities in Germany 
at Mainz and Lotte of Elster GmbH 
are not yet registered with ISO 14001 
but certification is expected to be 
obtained during 2015.
Greenhouse gas emissions
This greenhouse gas (“GHG”) report has 
been prepared for the reporting period of 
1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013. 
The data has been prepared in 
accordance with the principles and 
requirements of the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol, Revised Edition, ISO 14064 
Part 1 and the UK Government’s 
Department for Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs (DEFRA) guidance on how 
to measure and report on Greenhouse 
gas emissions 2013.
The Group has reported on all of the 
emission sources required under the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 43 
(see Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013 paragraph 18).
 
The Group does not have responsibility  
for any emission sources that are not 
included in the consolidated statement. 
The Group has used the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition), data gathered 
in accordance with the GHG reporting 
procedure and emission factors from UK 
Government’s GHG Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting 2014.
 
The financial reporting year of 2013 is the 
first year in which the Company has been 
required to disclose its GHG emissions 
data within the Annual Report. Therefore, 
the 2013 data represents the baseline 
against which reduction targets will be set.
The reported emissions cover all entities 
over which the organisation had financial 
control as at 31 December 2013. 
Emissions from entities acquired or 
disposed of during the reporting period 
(i.e. disposed on or before 31 December 
2013 or acquired after 1 January 2013) are 
not accounted for in the report. Therefore, 
data from Crosby, Acco, Truth, Marelli and 
Harris businesses has not been included 
within the reported GHG data, as these 
businesses were divested during 2013.  
No businesses were acquired during the 
reporting period.
 
52
 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Strategic Report All material emissions from within the 
organisational and operational scope 
and boundaries of the Group are reported.  
The emissions from owned vehicle 
transport (i.e. Group owned cars and 
vans, lorries and fork lift trucks) and the 
emissions associated with refrigeration 
have been excluded from the report on 
a de minimis basis. The GHG emissions 
from these sources have been estimated 
to account for less than 1% of the total 
Melrose emissions reported on an 
individual basis and as a combined total 
to account for less than 2% of the total 
Melrose GHG emissions reported. 
Supply chain assurance
Owing to the geographical and operational 
diversity of the Group’s businesses, and 
therefore its supplier base, there is no 
single over-arching Group policy currently 
in use in relation to suppliers. However,  
the security, assurance and ethical 
compliance of business supply chains is 
very important to Melrose. Responsibility 
for the implementation and management 
of all supplier-related policies rests with 
local management in each business.  
Such policies are used in a manner 
appropriate to the size and complexity  
of each business and also take into 
account the nature and geographical 
representation of key suppliers. A supplier 
approval process exists within the 
businesses, which is linked to specific  
and tailored supplier assessments and 
due diligence requirements.
Human rights and ethical standards
As is stated within the employee policies 
and supply chain assurance sections 
above, the decentralised nature of the 
Group means there is no single over-
arching policy currently in place with 
regard to human rights. However, sound 
business ethics and integrity are core to 
the Group’s values and each business 
places a high importance on its dealings 
with all employees, customers, suppliers 
and other stakeholders and is committed 
to good practice in respect of human 
rights. Employees within each Group 
business are required, at all times, to 
exhibit the highest Ievels of integrity and  
to maintain the highest ethical standards 
in business affairs.
Each of the Group’s businesses will have 
their own code of ethics in dealing with 
matters such as human rights, with all 
employee policies also being set locally 
within each business in order to ensure 
compliance with local laws and standards 
as a minimum. Responsibility for the 
communication and implementation of 
such policies rests with the relevant senior 
divisional managers.

Governance 
overview
Dear Shareholder
The Board remains committed to 
maintaining the high standards of 
corporate governance required to ensure 
that the Company can continue to deliver 
on its strategic goals and to achieve 
long-term success for the benefit of its 
shareholders. As part of this approach, 
the Board supports, applies and complies 
with the Main Principles, the Supporting 
Principles and the respective related 
provisions of corporate governance 
contained in the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “UK Code”) issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council and 
available to view on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Codes-
Standards/Corporate-governance.aspx.
In support of this commitment, the  
Board carried out a number of actions 
during 2013 designed to ensure that the 
Company remains compliant with the 
provisions of the UK Code and also  
to enable continuous improvement  
in line with best practice corporate 
governance guidelines. 
An externally facilitated Board evaluation 
process was completed towards the end 
of 2013. This is the first time that an 
external evaluation has been carried out 
in relation to the Melrose Board. This 
evaluation focused on the composition 
and performance of the Board and its 
Committees and the performance of the 
Chairman and the Senior non-executive 
Director. This evaluation process proved 
to be a valuable exercise from both a 
corporate governance and wider business 
perspective. Further details on this 
evaluation process can be found on  
pages 63 and 64 of this Corporate 
Governance report.
A number of changes are planned for the 
Melrose Board during 2014. As we have 
previously announced, Miles Templeman 
will be retiring from his role as Senior 
non-executive Director at the conclusion 
of this year’s Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”), to be held on 13 May 2014. 
Miles Templeman has held a non-
executive position on the Melrose Board 
since the original flotation in 2003. His 
advice and experience have been 
invaluable to Melrose over the last 
10 years; he has contributed in many  
ways to the Company’s success over this 
period and we wish him all the very best 
for the future. Miles will be replaced as the 
Senior non-executive Director by Perry 
Crosthwaite, who will simultaneously 
relinquish his position as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, a role that will 
be filled by Justin Dowley, following the 
conclusion of this year’s AGM. Liz Hewitt, 
who joined the Melrose Board on 
8 October 2013, will chair the Nomination 
Committee with effect from the end of the 
2014 AGM. Liz has already made a 
significant contribution since joining the 
Board and we are confident that her 
long-established and pertinent experience 
will be of considerable benefit to Melrose 
as we continue to grow the business.

Directors’  
remuneration report
Dear Shareholder, On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our report on Directors’ remuneration at the end of yet another highly successful year. The Directors’ remuneration report sets out the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 31 December 2013 and the remuneration policy for the Directors of Melrose. 
New regulations have come into effect which impact the presentation and disclosure of Directors’ remuneration and the lay-out of this report reflects those new regulations. This report is, therefore, presented in two sections: the Annual Report on Remuneration and the Directors’ remuneration policy. The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details on the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 31 December 2013 and will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM. The Directors’ remuneration policy sets out the forward-looking remuneration policy that will be subject to a binding vote at the AGM and shall take binding effect from the conclusion of that meeting. 
Since flotation in 2003 Melrose has always obtained special resolution support (requiring 75% shareholder approval, rather than the simple majority approval required for an ordinary resolution) for its Directors’ long-term incentive arrangements  from shareholders, including in respect of the 2012 Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”) that was established in 2012. Your Board understands that these arrangements are fundamental to achieving the strong returns for shareholders since flotation and closely align the interests of Directors and senior employees to those of shareholders. Base salaries and annual bonuses are deliberately set at or below the lower end of a market competitive range compared to companies of similar size and complexity to ensure  a clear focus on generation of long-term value through the LTIP . The level of reward earned by Directors and senior management under the LTIP will be dependent upon shareholder value created. 
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility for overseeing the remuneration of the Company’s Directors, Company Secretary and other senior employees.
Performance in 2013 2013 was a strong year for Melrose and marked another milestone in our “buy, improve, sell” strategy:
•  We crystallised more than three times the original shareholder value in five of the “FKI” businesses acquired in 2008.
•  These five disposals yielded a total consideration of approximately £950 million, together more than tripling shareholder value in respect of these businesses during five years of Melrose ownership.
•  In accordance with our strategy, the Board has returned approximately £600 million in cash to shareholders, equivalent to 47.0 pence per existing ordinary share. The balance of the net proceeds has been used to pay down existing borrowings of the Company.
•  The Elster improvement plan is ahead of schedule, with operating margin increased by 5* percentage points to 17.4% and operating profit up 37%*.
•  Headline diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 12.8p (2012: 9.4p*), an increase of 36%. 
•  Group revenue for continuing operations during the year was £1,732.8m (2012: £1,051.1m).
•  Group headline profit for continuing operations before tax was £226.1m (2012: £117.9m).
•  Full year dividend of 7.75p per share (2012: 7.6p per share).
It is with this in mind and in line with Melrose’s remuneration philosophy of pay for performance, that the Remuneration Committee has taken its decisions in respect of executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements for 2013 and 2014.
Our remuneration structure for executive Directors Melrose’s remuneration philosophy is that executive remuneration should be simple and transparent, support the delivery of the business strategy and pay for performance.
The Remuneration Committee feels strongly that rewards should be linked to generation and delivery of real returns to shareholders.
•  Base salary: Base salaries for all executive Directors are deliberately set at or below the lower end of a market competitive range compared to companies of similar size and complexity. Since flotation in 2003 all current executive Directors have received the same annual increases to base salary; in the last five years these increases have averaged 3%.
•  Pension: Pension contributions/salary supplements for executive Directors are payable at the level of 15% of base salary, which is considered modest for a business of the size and complexity of Melrose. No executive Director participates in, or has ever participated in, any Melrose defined benefit pension scheme.
•  Annual bonus: The maximum bonus payable is set at 100%  of base salary. All Directors who participate in the annual bonus scheme receive the same percentage bonus. In the  last five years, the average percentage of base salary payable has been 84%. The maximum opportunity is deliberately positioned below the median maximum opportunity for FTSE 100 companies.
•  Long-term incentives: The only long-term incentive arrangement in which the executive Directors participate is the 2012 Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders by special resolution in a General Meeting held on 11 April 2012. Entitlements under the 2012 Incentive Plan, details of which are provided on page 74, were awarded in April 2012. Any payment made will be dependent upon shareholder value generated over a five year time period.
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that this simple and transparent incentive framework is aligned with the Company’s strategy for growth. We believe that this remuneration strategy has also directly driven historical out-performance, supported the Company’s success and has clearly led to increased shareholder value. In this regard, our remuneration arrangements are tailored to the culture and strategy of the Company, take account of the current and forecast economic climate and provide a strong platform for the ongoing long-term success of the Company.
The remuneration policy has also enabled the executive Directors to build up and retain significant shareholdings in the Company. Further detail is given on page 74; however, the table below shows the number of Ordinary Shares held by the executive Directors as at 31 December 2013 and the value of each executive Director’s shareholding at that date as a multiple  of his 2013 base salary.
Executive Director
Number of shares  held at 31 December 2013
Value of shares  held at 31 December 2013 (1)
Value of shares  held at 31 December 2013 as a multiple of 2013 base salary Christopher Miller 17,300,343 (2) £52,887,149 125 David Roper 9,584,633 £29,300,223 69 Simon Peckham 9,664,068 £29,543,056 69 Geoffrey Martin 4,758,797 £14,547,642 43 (1)  For these purposes, the value of a share is 305.7 pence, being the closing mid-market price on 31 December 2013. (2)  As at 31 December 2013, the interest of Christopher Miller included 6,760,000 Ordinary Shares held by Harris & Sheldon Investments Limited, a company which is connected  with Christopher Miller within the meaning of section 252 of the Companies Act 2006.
2013 key decisions and incentive pay-outs The Remuneration Committee remains committed to a responsible approach to executive pay. As described in the business review section of this Annual Report and highlighted above, the Company delivered strong financial and operational results in 2013. The executive Directors’ remuneration rewards that performance. 
Annual bonuses for executive Directors are based on diluted earnings per share growth and a discretionary element based on the achievement of a range of operational deliverables. Bonuses of 100% of maximum were awarded to the executive Directors in respect of 2013.
In line with increases in previous years, an inflationary increase of 3% was made to the executive Directors’ salaries with effect from 1 January 2013, the same as for other head office employees. 
Awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan were made in April 2012 and are due to crystallise in May 2017; accordingly no executive Director received any pay-out under a long-term incentive plan in 2013. Any payment made will be dependent upon shareholder value created by May 2017. While potential value attributable to the 2012 Incentive Plan is included in the charts on page 81, this is included for illustrative purposes only. The value ultimately delivered under this plan will be determined by reference to the value delivered to shareholders over the period to crystallisation, such that the value shown in those charts is unlikely to reflect the value ultimately delivered.
Remuneration policy for 2014 The remuneration policy is set out for shareholder approval in the policy report on pages 77 to 84. Details of how the policy will be applied in practice for 2014 are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 76. Executive Directors’ base salaries have been increased by 3% with effect from January 2014, the same as for other head office employees. Non-executive Directors’ basic fees increased by 3% with effect from January 2014. The additional fees payable to the Committee Chairmen and Senior Independent Director (which have been unchanged since 2006) have been reviewed. The additional fees were considered to be below the market competitive range and have, therefore, been increased, with effect from the 2014 AGM, to bring them more in line with the market; the previous and new  fee levels are set out in the table on page 76. No other changes have been made to the structure of our executive Director remuneration for the coming year. 
Shareholder engagement We remain committed to maintaining an open and transparent engagement with our investors. We believe that a key objective of the Directors’ remuneration report is to communicate clearly how much our executive Directors are earning and how this is clearly linked to performance. I trust that you will find the new style report informative.

Audit 
Committee report
Role and responsibilities The Audit Committee’s (the “Committee”) role and responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference. These are available on the Company’s website and from the Company Secretary at the Registered Office. In discharging its duties, the Committee embraces its role of protecting the interests of shareholders with respect to the integrity of financial information published by the Company and the effectiveness of the audit. Specifically, the Committee is responsible for:
•  reviewing and monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group, including the Annual Report and interim report;
•  keeping under review the effectiveness of the Group’s financial reporting, internal audit and controls, risk management systems and compliance controls;
•  focusing and challenging the consistency of accounting policies, methods used to account for significant or unusual transactions and compliance with accounting standards;
•  reviewing the Group’s arrangements for its employees to  raise concerns in confidence about possible wrongdoing in financial reporting, in accordance with the Company’s whistleblowing policy;
•  developing, implementing and monitoring the Group’s policy  on external audit and for overseeing the objectivity and effectiveness of the auditor; and
•  reviewing and considering the Annual Report and  financial statements to ensure that it is fair, balanced and understandable and advising the Board that the statement  can be made by the Board that this is the case.
Composition Each member of the Committee is deemed to be independent by the Company and brings recent and relevant financial experience from senior executive and non-executive positions as described  in their biographies on pages 56 and 57. Given her financial qualifications and relevant experience, the Board concluded that Liz Hewitt should be invited to join the Committee.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee invites the Group Finance Director, the Head of Financial Reporting and senior representatives of the external and internal auditors to attend meetings where appropriate to the business being considered. The Committee has the right to invite any other Directors and/or employees to attend meetings where this is considered appropriate. In addition, the Committee meets at least once per year with both the external and internal auditors without management present.
Summary of meetings in the year The Committee is expected to meet not less than three times  a year. In 2013, the Committee met in March, August and November. The scheduling of these meetings is designed to be aligned with the financial reporting timetable thereby enabling the Committee to review the Annual Report and financial statements, the interim financial report and the audit plan ahead of the year end audit and maintaining a view of the internal controls and processes throughout the year. 
The attendance of its members at these meetings is shown above.
Significant issues related to the financial statements In discharging its duties under its terms of reference, the Committee undertook the following recurring activities that receive annual scrutiny:
•  reviewed the Annual Report and financial statements and interim financial report. As part of this review the Committee received a report from the external auditor on their audit of the Annual Report and the financial statements and review of the interim report;
•  considered the processes in place to generate forecasts of cash flows and accounting valuation information, including the reasonableness and consistent use of assumptions;
•  reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and disclosures made in the Annual Report and financial statements on this matter; 
•  considered the Annual Report and financial statements in the context of being fair, balanced and understandable and reviewed the content of a paper prepared by management with regard to this principle in relation to the 2013 Annual Report and financial statements. Advised the Board that in its view, the 2013 Annual Report and financial statements when taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy; and 
•  reviewed and agreed the scope of the audit work to be undertaken by the auditor.
John Grant
Audit Committee  
Chairman
The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee responsibility for overseeing the financial reporting and internal control review and reporting and for making recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of the Company’s internal and external auditors.
Significant issue considered by the Audit Committee How the issue was addressed by the Audit Committee
Provisions for legal and environmental claims and other provisions The level of provisioning for legal and environmental claims and other provisions require significant judgement. 
Although provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted for management’s best current estimates, the judgemental nature of these items means that future amounts settled may be different from those provided.
(Refer to notes 3 and 20) 
  The Committee considered management’s proposed provisioning in respect of these legal and environmental claims and other provisions including the key judgements made and relevant legal advice.
The external auditor also reported on all material provisions to the Committee.
Having considered the matter and sought guidance from the external auditor, the Committee concluded that management’s proposed provisioning and the associated disclosures in the Annual Report were appropriate.
Classification of exceptional items The reporting, classification and consistency of exceptional items, specifically restructuring and fair value releases, were an area of focus for the Committee.
(Refer to note 6) 
 The Committee considered the nature, classification and consistency of exceptional items. These items were detailed in the external auditor’s paper to the Committee. The Committee considered this issue and concluded that these exceptional items were appropriately captured and disclosed.
Taxation risks and recognition of deferred tax assets Judgement is required in determining the Group’s provision for income taxes including estimating tax provisions where additional current tax may become payable in the future following the audit by the tax authorities of previously filed tax returns. Judgement is also required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits. 
(Refer to notes 3, 8 and 21) 
 Management’s taxation judgements, accounting treatment and the appropriateness of tax disclosures have been reviewed by the Committee. 
The Committee considered whether, from an accounting perspective, an update was required to the tax provisions previously recorded in respect of specific exposures identified. In addition the Committee reviewed the tax implications of corporate transactions undertaken during the year. The Committee debated whether additional deferred tax assets should be brought onto the Balance Sheet as a consequence of, for example, the expected timing of future corporate transactions. 
Having taken input from the external auditor, the Committee agreed with management’s proposed treatment of tax risks and deferred tax assets. 
Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and other fixed assets The judgements in relation to goodwill impairment testing relate to the assumptions applied in calculating the value in use of the cash-generating units being tested for impairment. The key assumptions applied in the calculation relate to the future performance expectations of the cash-generating units. 
The Committee has also considered the related disclosures within the financial statements.
(Refer to notes 3 and 12) 
  Business plans prepared by management supporting future performance expectations used in the calculation were approved by the Board. The Committee received a detailed report on the outcome of the impairment review performed by management. The impairment review was also an area of focus for the external auditor, who reported their findings to the Committee.
The Committee considered management’s approach, the assumptions applied in relation to the impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and other fixed assets and related disclosures and, having taken input from the external auditor, agreed with management’s assessment that there were no indicators of impairment for any of the Group’s business units during the year. 
Valuation of pension liabilities The calculation of the accounting position at the year end of the Group’s pension liabilities is based on material judgemental estimates.
(Refer to notes 3 and 23)
 The Committee has considered the appropriateness of the actuarial assumptions applied by management to the valuation of the Group’s retirement plans at the year end. 
These assumptions were reviewed with the external auditor, with input and assistance from employee benefit experts. The Committee supported the assumptions and judgements applied by management.

Committee report
External audit Appointment, re-appointment and assessment of effectiveness The Committee reviews and makes recommendations with regard to the reappointment of the external auditors. In making these recommendations, the Committee considers auditor effectiveness and independence, partner rotation and any other factors which may impact the external auditor’s reappointment.
The external auditor is required to rotate the audit signing partner every five years. The Group’s audit signing partner changed as part of that rotation process in 2010 and therefore partner rotation is due in the financial year ending 31 December 2015.
The Committee has reviewed the external auditor’s performance and effectiveness taking into account input from management together with feedback from the Public Report on the Audit Quality Inspection of Deloitte LLP , issued by the Financial Reporting Council in May 2013. In making its assessment, the Committee focused on the robustness of the audit, the quality of delivery of audit services and the quality of the auditor’s staff. Based on this information, the Committee concluded that the external audit process is operating effectively and Deloitte LLP continues to prove effective in its role  as external auditor. As detailed below, the Committee regularly monitors the objectivity and independence of the external auditor. 
Deloitte LLP was appointed in 2003 when the Company commenced trading and the external audit has not been  formally tendered since then. The Committee is satisfied that the effectiveness and independence of the external auditors is not impaired in any way. There are no legal or contractual obligations that restrict the Group’s capacity to recommend a particular firm for appointment as auditor and therefore a resolution proposing the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as external auditors will be put to the shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
Audit tendering The Committee is mindful of the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code that the external audit should be put out to tender every 10 years. The Company will comply with the Competition Commission Order relating to the statutory audit market for FTSE350 companies, which is expected to come into effect from 1 October 2014. Under the proposed transitional arrangements, the Committee expects a formal tender process to be held no later than two years from the end of the current audit engagement partner rotation period which is due in the year ending 31 December 2015. This matter will be kept under review.
Non-audit services The Committee has a policy on the engagement of the external auditor for the supply of non-audit services. This is to ensure that the provision of non-audit services does not impair the external auditor’s independence or objectivity. In accordance with best practice FRC guidelines, the Company policy in relation to non- audit services is kept under regular review; the policy outlines which non-audit services are pre-approved (being those which are routine in nature, with a fee that is not significant in the context of the audit or audit-related services), which services require the prior approval of the Committee and which services the auditor is excluded from providing. The general principle is that the audit firm should not be requested to carry out non-audit services on any activity of the Company where they may, in the future, be required to give an audit opinion.
During 2013, the main non-audit services provided by  Deloitte LLP were in relation to taxation advisory, compliance  and planning services.
An analysis of the fees earned by the external auditors for  audit and non-audit services can be found in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
Auditor objectivity and independence The Committee carries out regular reviews to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence is maintained at all times. A different senior partner oversees the taxation audit of the Company compared to those working on the non-audit taxation services. 
No fees were paid to Deloitte LLP on a contingent basis. Based on these strict procedures the Committee remains confident that auditor objectivity and independence has been maintained but accepts that non-audit work should be controlled to ensure that  it does not compromise the auditor’s position.
At each year end, Deloitte LLP submits a letter setting out how it believes its independence and objectivity have been maintained. As noted above, they are also required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group audit every five years and significant subsidiary audits every seven years. 
Internal audit Due to the size and complexity of the Group, it is appropriate  for an internal audit programme to be used within the business. BM Howarth, an external firm, provides internal audit services  to the Group. A rotation programme is in place, such that every business unit will have an internal audit at least once every  three years, with the largest sites being reviewed at least once every two years. The rotation programme allows divisional management’s actions and responses to be followed up on a timely basis. The internal audit programme of planned visits is discussed and agreed with the Committee during the year.
The internal auditor’s remit includes assessment of the effectiveness of internal control systems, compliance with the Group’s Policies and Procedures Manual and a review of the businesses’ Balance Sheets. A report of key findings and recommendations is presented to the Group Finance Director, the Head of Financial Reporting and the Group Operations Controller, followed by a meeting to discuss these key findings and to agree on resulting actions.
BM Howarth present their key findings to the Committee twice during the year. These presentations include details of the site coverage for the previous year and an outline of the planned visits  for the current year. A review of the internal audit process and scope of work covered by the internal auditor is the responsibility of the Committee, to ensure their objectives, level of authority and resources are appropriate for the nature of the businesses under review. The Committee also reviews BM Howarth’s performance against the agreed internal audit programme. A report of significant findings is presented by the internal auditor to the Committee at each meeting and implementation of recommendations by the Board is followed up at the subsequent Committee meeting.
John Grant Chairman, Audit Committee 5 March 2014
Diversity The Committee currently takes into account a variety of factors before recommending any new appointments to the Board, including relevant skills to perform the role, experience, knowledge, ethnicity and gender. The most important priority of the Committee, however, has been and will continue to be ensuring that the best candidate is selected to join the Board  and this approach will remain in place going forward.
Whilst the Committee will endeavour to pursue diversity, including gender diversity throughout the Melrose Group and concurs with the recommendations of Lord Davies’ review, “Women on Boards”, the Committee does not think it appropriate to have, nor will it be committing to, any specific diversity targets in relation to the composition of the Board, or the wider businesses within the Group.
Succession planning In line with the succession planning responsibilities of the Committee, the decision was taken in early 2013 to recruit another non-executive Director to the Board, in order to take account of the impending retirement of Miles Templeman from the position of Senior non-executive Director, at the conclusion  of the 2014 AGM. It was also felt by the Committee that an additional non-executive Director serving on the Melrose Board would further complement the skill set of the Board.
The Committee undertook a formal and rigorous recruitment exercise to find a suitable non-executive Director to join the Melrose Board (see “What the Committee did in 2013”, below,  for further details). Following this process, the Committee recommended to the Board the appointment of Liz Hewitt, on 8 October 2013. In accordance with the Articles, Ms Hewitt will stand for election as a Director of the Company at the 2014 AGM.
At the conclusion of the 2014 AGM, Liz Hewitt will replace Miles Templeman as Chairman of the Committee.
What the Committee did in 2013 The main focus of the Committee during 2013, as described above, was the recruitment of a new non-executive Director to the Board. 
After the discussion of alternatives, the Committee decided to use the services of Stonehaven Executive Search, an external recruitment firm who have no other connection with the Company, to conduct an extensive search exercise.
Following a formal and rigorous recruitment process, the Committee recommended to the Board that Ms Hewitt’s long- established and highly pertinent experience would be of significant benefit to Melrose as the business continues to grow. As such, Ms Hewitt was appointed to the Board on 8 October 2013 and subsequently also became a member of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.

•  giving full consideration to succession planning in order to ensure an optimum balance of executive and non-executive Directors in terms of skills, experience and diversity;
• keeping under review the leadership needs of the business; and
•  keeping up to date and fully informed about strategic issues and commercial changes affecting the Company and the markets in which it operates.
The Committee is expected to meet not less than twice a year and during 2013 the Committee met twice. The attendance of its members at these Committee meetings is shown above.
The Committee’s full terms of reference are available to view on the Company’s website at: www.melroseplc.net/about-us/ governance/nomination-committee
Further details regarding the composition, diversity policy and the 2013 activities of the Committee are shown below.
Composition In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the majority of the members of the Committee were independent non-executive Directors throughout 2013. During the year, the Committee was chaired by Miles Templeman, with Perry Crosthwaite, John Grant and Justin Dowley also serving throughout the year. Liz Hewitt became a member of the Committee upon her appointment to the Board on 8 October 2013 (see “Succession planning” and “What the Committee did in 2013”, below, for further details). Christopher Miller, Executive Chairman of the Board, was also a member of the Committee throughout the year.
The Nomination Committee has overall responsibility  for ensuring that the Board and its Committees have  the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Company to  enable them to discharge their respective duties  and responsibilities effectively.

Annual Report 2013
Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financials Shareholder information Directors’ report
The Directors of Melrose Industries PLC 
(the “Company”) present their Annual Report 
and audited financial statements of the Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The Corporate Governance report set out on pages 62 to 65, the 
Finance Director’s review on pages 40 to 47 and the Corporate 
Social Responsibility section of the Strategic Report on pages 48 
to 53, are each incorporated by reference into this Directors’ 
report. Disclosures elsewhere in the Annual Report are cross-
referenced where appropriate; taken together, they fulfil the 
combined requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) 
and of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.
Details of significant events since the Balance Sheet date are 
contained in note 29 to the financial statements. An indication of 
likely future developments in Group businesses is included within 
the Strategic Report.
Directors
The Directors of the Company as at the date of this report, 
together with their biographical details, are given on pages 56 and 
57. There were no other persons who, at any time during the year 
ended 31 December 2013, were Directors of the Company.
Changes to the Board during the year are set out in the 
Corporate Governance report on pages 62 to 65. Details of 
Directors’ service contracts are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on page 83.
The Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the 
consolidated financial statements is set out on page 85.
Appointment and removal of Directors and their powers
The Company’s articles of association (“Articles”) give the 
Directors the power to appoint and replace other Directors. 
Under the terms of reference of the Nomination Committee,  
any appointment must be recommended by the Nomination 
Committee for approval by the Board. 
With effect from the 2012 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”),  
the Board determined that all Directors of the Company should 
stand for re-election on an annual basis, in compliance with  
the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and this 
requirement is now contained in the Articles. Therefore, all 
Directors will offer themselves for election or re-election at the 
AGM to be held on 13 May 2014. 
The Company’s Senior non-executive Director, Miles Templeman, 
has confirmed that he will retire from the Board at the conclusion 
of the 2014 AGM and so will not stand for re-election. Miles will 
be replaced in the position of Senior non-executive Director by 
Perry Crosthwaite. 
The Directors are responsible for managing the business of the 
Company and exercise their powers in accordance with the 
Articles, directions given by special resolution and any relevant 
statutes and regulations. Specific powers relating to the allotment 
and issuance of shares and the ability of the Company to 
purchase its own shares are also included within the Articles and 
such authorities are submitted for approval by the shareholders 
at the AGM each year. 
Pursuant to sections 693 and 701 of the Act and a special resolution 
passed at the AGM in 2013, the Company was authorised to 
purchase its own shares, limited to an aggregate maximum number 
equal to 10% of the issued share capital of the Company. Following 
the Share Capital Consolidation (defined below), this authority 
ceased to be valid. The Company did not purchase any Ordinary 
Shares pursuant to this authority. The resolutions being proposed 
at this year’s AGM include a resolution to renew this authority.
Insurance and indemnities
The Directors have the benefit of an indemnity from the Company 
in respect of its liabilities incurred as a result of their office.  
This indemnity is provided under the Company’s Articles and 
satisfies the indemnity provisions of the Act.
The Company has taken out an insurance policy in respect of those 
liabilities for which the Directors may not be indemnified. Neither 
the indemnity nor the insurance provides cover in the event that  
a Director is proved to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently. 
AGM
The AGM of the Company will be held at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall, 
Monkwell Square, Wood Street, London, EC2Y 5BL at 11.00am on 
13 May 2014. The notice convening the meeting is shown on pages 
146 to 151 and includes full details of the resolutions to be proposed,

In the second half of the year ended 31 December 2013, the 
Company completed the disposals of five of its “FKI” businesses, 
namely Crosby, Acco, Marelli, Truth and Harris, for a total 
consideration of approximately £950 million (see note 9 to the 
financial statements for further details). In accordance with its 
strategy, the Board decided to use part of the net proceeds 
of the disposals to return approximately £600 million in cash 
to shareholders (the “Return of Capital”). At the time of such 
decision, this return was equivalent to 47 pence per existing 
Ordinary Share of 0.1 pence nominal value each in the capital of 
the Company in issue at that time (the “Existing Ordinary Shares”).
The Return of Capital was approved by shareholders at a general 
meeting of the Company held on 7 February 2014, using a 
redeemable share scheme (in this case involving B Shares and/or 
C Shares) and was structured with the objective of enabling 
shareholders, subject to restrictions in respect of certain 
overseas shareholders, to elect to receive their cash proceeds 
of 47 pence per Existing Ordinary Share as:
•  an immediate income payment (the ‘‘Income Option’’); or
•  an immediate capital payment (the ‘‘Immediate Capital 
Option’’); or
•  a capital payment deferred until after 6 April 2014 (the ‘‘Deferred 
Capital Option’’), (collectively the “Share Alternatives”).
Shareholders were also offered a mix and match facility, such 
that they could choose to receive the cash proceeds through any 
combination of the Share Alternatives.
Only shareholders who were on the register of members at 
5.00 p.m. on 7 February 2014 (the “B/C Share Record Date”) 
were entitled to participate in the Return of Capital and the 
deadline for shareholders making their elections in respect  
of the Share Alternatives was 4.30 p.m. on 14 February 2014.

Income Option Relevant shareholders received one C Share, with a nominal value of 0.00001 pence, for  
every Existing Ordinary Share held at the B/C Share Record Date and a single C Share 
dividend of 47 pence per C Share held. The single C Share dividend became due and 
payable on 17 February 2014 and, thereafter, the C Shares were automatically converted into 
C Deferred Shares with a nominal value of 0.00001 pence each. Proceeds in respect of the 
Income Option were paid to relevant shareholders on 28 February 2014 and the C Deferred 
Shares will be redeemed by the Company on 30 April 2014 (or such other date as the 
Directors may determine) for an aggregate consideration of one penny.
757,503,886
Immediate Capital Option Relevant shareholders received one B Share, with a nominal value of 47 pence, for every 
Existing Ordinary Share held at the B/C Share Record Date and have such B Share(s) 
redeemed by the Company on 17 February 2014. Proceeds in respect of the Immediate 
Capital Option were paid to relevant shareholders on 28 February 2014.
493,363,270
Deferred Capital Option Relevant shareholders received one B Share, with a nominal value of 47 pence, for every 
Existing Ordinary Share held at the B/C Share Record Date and have such B Share(s) 
redeemed by the Company on 30 April 2014 (or such other date as the Directors may 
determine). Proceeds in respect of the Deferred Capital Option will be paid to relevant 
shareholders on 7 May 2014 (or such other date as the Directors may determine).
15,759,880
(1)  Neither the Immediate Capital Option, nor the Deferred Capital Option, were made available to any shareholders with a registered address in, or who were resident or located in, Australia, 
Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of South Africa, United States and any other territory where the invitation to participate in the Return of Capital proposals and any election for either 
the Immediate Capital Option and/or the Deferred Capital Option in respect of all or some of such shareholder’s entitlement to the Return of Capital would violate the laws of that jurisdiction or 
would require the registration of the B Shares, C Shares and/or C Deferred Shares and all such shareholders were automatically deemed to have elected for the Income Option.
Associated with the Return of Capital, a one-off Ordinary Share 
capital consolidation was approved by shareholders at the 
general meeting of the Company held on 7 February 2014, in 
the ratio of 11 for 13 (the “Share Capital Consolidation”) and the 
record date for the Share Capital Consolidation was 6.00pm on 
the same day (the “Share Capital Consolidation Record Date”).
The aim of the Share Capital Consolidation was to ensure, 
so far as possible, that the market price of an Ordinary Share 
remained approximately the same before and after the Return 
of Capital and, so far as possible, to maintain comparability of 
historical and future per share data.
The Share Capital Consolidation was effected by the sub-division 
of every Existing Ordinary Share into 11 shares of 1/110 pence 
each in the capital of the Company and, forthwith upon such 
sub-division, the consolidation of every 13 shares of 1/110 pence 
each in the capital of the Company resulting from such sub-
division into one new ordinary share of 13/110 pence in the 
capital of the Company (the “New Ordinary Shares”).

the rights attached to each of the share classes in issue as at 
31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and immediately 
following the Share Capital Consolidation on 7 February 2014,

to own approximately the same proportion of the Company after 
the Share Capital Consolidation as they did before, subject to 
fractional entitlements.

and sold in the market on shareholders’ behalf. In order to ensure that the aggregate of 
all fractional entitlements to be sold in the market added up to a whole number of New 
Ordinary Shares, between the B/C Share Record Date and the Share Capital Consolidation 
Record Date, one Ordinary Share was allotted fully paid up for cash to Investec at a price 
which was equal to the closing middle-market price of an Existing Ordinary Share on 
7 February 2014, less 47 pence. This Ordinary Share was not entitled to participate in the 
Return of Capital, but was subject to the Share Capital Consolidation. 
Only the New Ordinary Shares are traded on the London 
Stock Exchange.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that restrict the transfer of New Ordinary Shares or 
that restrict voting rights attached to the New Ordinary Shares.

Shareholders’ voting rights
Only the New Ordinary Shares have voting rights attached. In a 
general meeting of the Company, subject to the provisions of the 
current Articles and to any special rights or restrictions as to 
voting attached to any other class of shares in the Company from 
time to time:
•  on a show of hands, every member who is present (in person 
or by proxy) shall have one vote; and
•  on a poll, every member who is present (in person or by proxy) 
shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder.
If any call or other sum payable by a holder of New Ordinary 
Shares remains unpaid, they shall not be entitled to vote at a 
general meeting or class meeting in respect of any shares held 
by them. Currently, all New Ordinary Shares are fully paid.
Articles of association
The Company’s Articles were amended pursuant to a special 
resolution approved at the general meeting of the Company held 
on 7 February 2014, in order to reflect the rights and restrictions 
attaching to the B Shares, the C Shares and the C Deferred 
Shares and certain other changes required in relation to the 
Share Capital Consolidation. The rights and restrictions attaching 
to the New Ordinary Shares following the Share Capital 
Consolidation remained exactly the same as those attaching to 
the Existing Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Share 
Capital Consolidation.

Shareholder dividend
The Directors are pleased to recommend the payment of a final 
dividend of 5.0p per share (2012: 5.0p) on 15 May 2014 to 
Ordinary shareholders on the register of members of the 
Company at the close of business on 22 April 2014. This dividend 
recommendation will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming 
AGM of the Company, to be held on 13 May 2014. Subject to 
shareholder approval being obtained at the AGM for the final 
dividend, this will mean a full year 2013 dividend of 7.75p per 
share (2012: 7.6p).
In the second half of the year ended 31 December 2013, the 
Company completed the disposals of five of its “FKI” businesses, 
namely Crosby, Acco, Marelli, Truth and Harris, for a total 
consideration of approximately £950 million (see note 9 to the 
financial statements for further details). In accordance with its 
strategy, the Board decided to use part of the net proceeds of 
the disposals to return approximately £600 million in cash to 
shareholders, by way of the Return of Capital proposals 
described earlier in this Directors’ report. The Return of Capital 
was approved by shareholders at the general meeting of the 
Company held on 7 February 2014. This return to shareholders is 
not included in the full year dividend figure stated above. 
It is the intention of the Board to continue to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy, where appropriate. 
The Company offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”) 
which gives shareholders the opportunity to use their  
dividend payments to purchase further Ordinary Shares in 
Melrose Industries PLC. Further details about the DRIP and its 
terms and conditions can be found within the Investors section 
on the Company’s website at www.melroseplc.net. To the 
extent that shareholders chose the Income Option in respect  
of all or some of their entitlement to the Return of Capital, the 
DRIP could not be used in relation to the single C Share dividend 
paid to such shareholders in respect of their holdings of such 
C Shares.
Financial instruments
The disclosures required in relation to the use of financial 
instruments by the Company, including the financial risk 
management objectives and policies of the Company and the 
exposure of the Company to liquidity risk, exchange rate risk, 
contract and warranty risk and commodity cost risk, can be 
found in the Finance Director’s review on pages 40 to 47, 
which is incorporated by reference into this Directors’ report 
and in note 24 to the financial statements.
Research and development activities
Melrose Group businesses are encouraged to focus on research 
and development and to ensure that new and innovative product 
lines continue to be developed. During 2013, investment 
continued and several new product launches were either realised 
during 2013, or planned for 2014. This Group strategy helps to 
ensure that each business can remain at the forefront of 
technological advances within defined market sectors and be able 
to meet specific customer demands. Some examples of the types 
of new products being launched within the various markets are 
discussed within the Chief Executive’s business reviews on pages 
22 to 31 of the Strategic Report.

Corporate Social Responsibility section of the Strategic Report, 
which is incorporated by reference into this Directors’ report.
Environmental
The Directors of the Company fully understand the importance  
of the Group’s environmental responsibilities. Each of the 
Company’s businesses is committed to ensuring that their 
operations have a minimum adverse effect on the environment 
and that ongoing reductions in both energy usage and CO
2 
emissions are achieved, wherever practicable. 
Further details in relation to the various environmental initiatives 
that are ongoing within some of the Group’s businesses and 
statistics showing greenhouse gas emissions data are shown on 
pages 52 and 53 of the Corporate Social Responsibility section 
of the Strategic Report, which is incorporated by reference into 
this Directors’ report. 
Political donations
The Company’s policy is not to make any political donations and 
there were no political donations made during the year ended 
31 December 2013 (2012: nil).
Significant agreements and change of control
With the exception of the Group’s banking facilities, the 2012 
Incentive Plan (including the options over 2012 Incentive Shares) 
and the divisional management long-term incentive plans, there 
are no other agreements that would have a significant effect upon 
a change of control of Melrose Industries PLC as at 5 March 2014.
In June 2012, as part of the process to acquire Elster, the Group 
agreed a £1.5 billion five year multi-currency, committed bank 
facility, which states that in the event of a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid, the Company and lenders 
under this facility are obliged to enter into negotiations to 
determine whether and, if so, how to continue with the facility. 
There is no obligation for the lenders to continue to make the 
facility available for more than 30 days beyond any change of 
control. Failure to reach agreement with parties on revised terms 
could require an acquirer to put in place replacement facilities.
In the event of a takeover of the Company, options over the 2012 
Incentive Shares would be exercised and any 2012 Incentive 
Shares resulting from such exercise, or that have previously been 
issued, would convert into Ordinary Shares of 13/110 pence or 
an entitlement to a dividend paid in cash, the rate of conversion 
being based upon the offer price of the Company’s Ordinary 
Shares as calculated on the date of the change of control of the 
Company. If part or the entire offer price is not in cash, the 
Remuneration Committee will determine the value of the non-
cash element, having been advised by an investment bank of 
repute that such valuation is fair and reasonable.
Auditor
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and the 
Directors have taken all the steps which they ought to have taken 
as Directors to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information. This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of 
the Companies Act 2006.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee has reviewed 
the effectiveness, performance, independence and objectivity 
of the existing external auditor, Deloitte LLP, for the year ended 
31 December 2013 and concluded that the external auditor 
was in all respects effective. Deloitte LLP has expressed its 
willingness to continue in office as auditor. Accordingly, 
resolutions will be proposed at the AGM of the Company to 
reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditor of the Company and to 
authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration.

Statement of compliance
The Company is required to make certain statements relating 
to the way it is governed as laid down in the UK Code. The 
remainder of this Corporate Governance report describes the 
way in which the Company has applied and complied with the 
Main Principles, the Supporting Principles and the respective 
related provisions of governance set out in the UK Code.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for 
good governance. Throughout the year ended 31 December 
2013, the Company applied and complied with the Main 
Principles, the Supporting Principles and the respective related 
provisions of the UK Code, with the exception of a specific 
element of Schedule A, which recommends that grants under 
executive share options and long-term incentive plans should 
normally be phased, rather than awarded in one block. Under 
the 2012 Incentive Plan, details of which are provided on pages 
70 to 84 of the Directors’ remuneration report, entitlements to 
executive Directors were awarded in one block, rather than 
phased. The 2012 Incentive Plan was recommended as being 
in the best interests of shareholders as a whole by the Board of 
Directors and was approved by shareholders at a General 
Meeting held on 11 April 2012. With regard to all other aspects of 
executive Directors’ remuneration, the Company’s policies fully 
comply with the provisions of Schedule A of the UK Code.
The Audit Committee report, Nomination Committee report and 
Directors’ remuneration report also form part of this Corporate 
Governance report.
Main Principle A: Leadership
The Board
Details of the structure of the Board and its key responsibilities 
are shown on page 55.
Board responsibilities are discharged in conjunction with senior 
management, who in turn are responsible for the day-to-day 
conduct of the Group’s operations and for reporting to the Board 
on items of significance and progress against objectives. The 
Board meets regularly during the year as well as on an ad-hoc 
basis as required by time-critical business needs. 
There were four, formally scheduled Board meetings held during 
the year and the attendance of each Director at these meetings 
is shown on page 64. In addition, a number of unscheduled 
Board meetings were held during the year in connection with 
corporate transactions, for example, business divestments and, 
more recently, the return of capital to shareholders and 
associated share capital consolidation.
A pack of briefing papers and an agenda are provided to each 
Director in advance of each scheduled Board or Committee 
meeting. The Directors are able to seek further clarification and 
information on any matter from any other Director, the Company 
Secretary or any other employee of the Group whenever 
necessary. Decisions are taken by the Board in conjunction with 
the recommendations of its Committees and advice from 
external consultants, advisers and senior management.
The Board has introduced a fully encrypted electronic board 
portal system, enabling Board and Committee papers to be 
delivered securely to Directors. This facilitates a faster and more 
secure distribution of information, accessed using electronic 
tablets, and reduced resource usage.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising and 
supporting the Chairman and the Board on corporate 
governance matters as well as ensuring a smooth flow of 
information to enable effective decision making. All Directors 
have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary and, through him, have access to independent 
professional advice in respect of their duties, at the Company’s 
expense. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
Board, the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee.
In addition, Business Review meetings are held between 
scheduled Board meetings. These meetings are critical to 
providing the Directors with a comprehensive understanding of 
the current performance and the key issues affecting Group 
businesses, without the formality or rigidity of a Board meeting. 
Chief executives and other senior management from the Melrose 
businesses are periodically invited to attend and present to 
these meetings, providing the Directors with an opportunity to 
meet and engage with existing and emerging talent from across 
the organisation.
In accordance with its Articles and in compliance with the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company has granted a qualifying 
third party indemnity to each Director. The Company also 
maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance.
Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Vice-Chairman are, and will remain, 
separate to that of the Chief Executive of the Company, in 
accordance with best practice and Board policy.
The Chairman, with the assistance of the Vice-Chairman, is 
responsible for leadership of the Board. The Chairman sets the 
Board agenda and ensures that adequate time is given to the 
discussion of issues, particularly those of a strategic nature. 
Responsibility for ensuring effective communications with 
shareholders rests with the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and the 
two other executive Directors. 
During 2013, the non-executive Directors, led by the current 
Senior non-executive Director, Miles Templeman, held meetings 
to discuss and appraise the performance of the Chairman.
The Chief Executive is responsible for strategic direction and 
decisions involving the day-to-day management of the Company.
Main Principle B : Effectiveness
Board composition
As at 5 March 2014, the Board was comprised of an executive 
Chairman, three other executive Directors and five non-executive 
Directors, all of whom the Board considers to be independent. 
The Board believes that the Directors possess diverse business 
experience in areas complementary to the activities of the 
Company. Biographies of the Directors are shown on pages 
56 and 57 and on the Company’s corporate website at 
www.melroseplc.net. These biographies identify any other 
appointments held by the non-executive Directors. None of the 
executive Directors hold non-executive positions outside 
the Company.
62
 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Governance Non-executive Director independence
In accordance with the provisions of the UK Code, consideration 
has been given to the independence of all non-executive 
Directors. The Board considers all of the non-executive Directors 
to be independent.
Miles Templeman, currently the Board’s Senior non-executive 
Director, will retire from his position at the conclusion of the 2014 
Annual General Meeting, having been a non-executive Director of 
Melrose for the past 10 years. As part of the Board’s succession 
planning processes, Liz Hewitt was appointed as a non-executive 
Director on 8 October 2013. The Board is of the opinion that Ms 
Hewitt’s long-established and highly pertinent experience will be 
of significant benefit to Melrose as the business continues to grow, 
and that Ms Hewitt’s appointment will help to further strengthen 
the independence of the Board. In accordance with the Company’s 
Articles, Ms Hewitt will stand for election at the 2014 AGM.
The Board notes that Perry Crosthwaite has served as a  
non-executive Director on the Melrose Board since July 2005 
and, as a result, he will have served in this position for more 
than nine years during the course of 2014. The Board is of the 
opinion that, due to his invaluable experience in financial and 
other corporate matters, Mr Crosthwaite continues to maintain 
both his effectiveness and his independence. The Board 
will continue to monitor this position but feels at the present 
time that Mr Crosthwaite continues to make an important 
contribution to the Company.
The non-executive Directors are not entitled to any cash bonus 
or shares under the 2012 Incentive Plan.
Board induction, training and support
A full and formal induction programme tailored to the needs 
of individual Directors is provided for new Directors joining the 
Board. The primary aim of the induction programme is to 
introduce new Directors to, and educate new Directors about, 
the Group’s businesses, its operations and its governance 
arrangements. In the case of Liz Hewitt, the induction process 
included meetings with senior management and external 
advisers, a thorough briefing on the businesses of the Company 
and site visits to the Company’s various business operations. 
Individual induction requirements are monitored by the Chairman 
and the Company Secretary to ensure that new Directors gain 
sufficient knowledge to enable them to contribute to the 
Board’s deliberations as quickly as possible.
One of the outputs from the 2013 Board evaluation exercise was 
a desire for the Board as a whole to gain greater visibility of and 
connection with the Group’s business operations. Following this 
feedback, a visit is being organised to the Elster Gas operations 
at Osnabrück in Germany. This visit will provide the Board with an 
opportunity to meet with senior management and staff at Elster 
Gas and to receive presentations and updates on developments 
and other changes occurring in that business segment. 
Board evaluation 
Evaluation approach and process
During 2013, the Chairman held meetings with each of the 
Directors individually, including the Senior non-executive Director, 
Miles Templeman, to discuss the performance of individual 
executive Directors and the Board as a whole. In accordance 
with the provisions of the UK Code, during 2013 the Board 
engaged Lintstock Limited to undertake an independent 
evaluation of Board and Board Committee performance and to 
identify areas where performance and procedures might be 
further improved. Lintstock Limited is a specialist corporate 
governance consultancy and has no commercial dealings or 
other connection with the Melrose Group.
The first stage of the evaluation involved Lintstock engaging with 
the Chairman and the Company Secretary to discuss and agree 
the scope of the proposed evaluation and to develop a series of 
comprehensive questionnaires tailored to the specific 
circumstances of Melrose. 
All respondents were then requested to complete online 
questionnaires addressing the composition and performance of 
the Board and its Committees, and the performance of the 
Chairman and the Senior non-executive Director. The anonymity 
of all respondents was ensured throughout the process in order 
to promote the open and frank exchange of views. 
Lintstock subsequently produced a report which addressed the 
following areas: 
•  the composition of the Board and the Board’s understanding 
of the views of the Company’s major investors, stakeholders 
and of the markets in which the Company operates;
•  the involvement of the non-executive Directors in the affairs of 
the Company outside of Board and Committee meetings, the 
dynamics between the Board members and between the 
Board and senior management and the atmosphere in the 
Board room; 
•  the Board’s time management and the annual time 
commitment required of Directors, together with the Board’s 
annual cycle of work and the support afforded to the Board; 
•  the Board’s oversight of strategy, and the Board members’ 
views over the principal strategic challenges and opportunities 
facing the Company; 
•  the risk appetite of the Board and the Board’s management of 
the principal risks and uncertainties to the Group; 
•  the succession planning for executive Directors and for senior 
management at the level below the Board, and the Board’s 
visibility of potential successors for key positions from within 
the business; and 
•  the composition and performance of the Board and its 
Committees and the performance of the Chairman and the 
Senior non-executive Director. 
At a dedicated Board session, a report of the findings of the 
evaluation and its recommendations were discussed and specific 
actions agreed.

Outputs of the evaluation
The Board recognises the benefits of a thorough Board and 
Committee evaluation process. Overall, the evaluation 
demonstrated that the composition and performance of the 
Board and its Committees and the performance of the Chairman 
and the Senior non-executive Director were very effective. 
As a result of the review, amongst other things, the Board agreed:
•  to incorporate into the Board schedule visits to major operating 
businesses and periodic sessions with senior management 
from those business units;
•  that there was a need to increase the frequency of 
management presentations to the Board;
•  that further Board time should be devoted to discussions 
concerning talent management and executive and non-
executive succession planning; and
•  that there was a need to further enhance the Board’s 
understanding of risk identification and management.
In accordance with the provisions of the UK Code, it is 
anticipated that externally facilitated Board evaluations will be 
carried out every three years. In years when an external 
evaluation is not carried out, the Board will continue to complete 
internal performance-based questionnaires, with the process 
managed by the Company Secretary. The scope for each 
subsequent evaluation will be designed to build upon learning 
gained in the previous year to ensure that the recommendations 
agreed in the evaluations are implemented and that year-on-year 
progress is measured and reported upon.
Annual re-election of Directors
In accordance with the provisions of the UK Code, all of the 
Directors stood for re-election at the 2013 Annual General 
Meeting. The articles of association of the Company require the 
Directors to stand for annual re-election, thus ensuring continued 
compliance with the UK Code. As such, all Directors will offer 
themselves for election or re-election (as the case may be) at the 
2014 Annual General Meeting, to be held on 13 May 2014, with 
the exception of Miles Templeman who is retiring at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting.
Following the formal performance evaluations of each of the 
Directors and having carefully considered the commitments 
required and the contribution made by each Director, the 
Chairman is of the opinion that each Director’s performance 
continues to be effective and continues to demonstrate 
commitment to the role.
Attendance of Directors at meetings
The following table shows the attendance of each of the Directors 
at the scheduled meetings of the Board and its Committees held

Main Principle C: Accountability
Objectives and policy
The objectives of the Directors and senior management are to 
safeguard and increase the value of the business and assets of 
the Group for the benefit of its shareholders. Achievement of their 
objectives requires the development of policies and appropriate 
internal control frameworks to ensure the Group’s resources are 
managed properly and any key risks are identified and mitigated 
where possible.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the development of the 
Group’s overall risk management policies and system of internal 
control frameworks and for reviewing their respective 
effectiveness, while the role of management is to implement 
these policies and frameworks across the Group’s business 
operations. The Directors recognise that the systems and 
processes established by the Board are designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and cannot provide absolute assurance against 
material financial misstatement or loss.
The Board is committed to satisfying the internal control guidance 
for Directors set out in the revised version of the Turnbull 
Guidance on Internal Control. In accordance with this guidance, 
there is an ongoing process, regularly reviewed by the Directors, 
for identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating (where 
possible) the significant risks faced by the Group. This process for 
reviewing the Group’s internal controls is consistent with prior 
years and has been in place throughout the 2013 financial year 
and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report.
A separate Audit Committee report is set out on pages 66 to 68 
and provides details of the role and activities of the Committee 
and its relationship with the internal and external auditors.
Managing and controlling risk
The Group has policies and internal control frameworks which 
address a number of key business risks, including strategic, 
operational, compliance, ethical and financial risks. A summary 
of the Principal risks and uncertainties that could impact upon 
the Group’s performance is set out on pages 36 to 39.

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Governance The Group’s financial risk management objectives and 
policies are also described in the Finance Director’s review on 
pages 40 to 47. 
The Group operates on a de-centralised basis and the Board  
has established an organisational structure with clear reporting 
procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority. 
Divisional senior management, operational managers and 
financial controllers have been delegated responsibility by the 
Board for the establishment and implementation of detailed 
control systems as appropriate for their business. 
An established programme of regular review is in place at the 
businesses and a culture of continuous improvement is 
encouraged by the Board through regular meetings with senior 
management, review of operating performance and progress 
against business plans. The ongoing process of review provides 
assurance that the control environment is operating as intended.
The Audit Committee also monitors the effectiveness of the 
internal control process implemented across the Group through  
a review of the key findings presented by the external and internal 
auditors. Management is responsible for ensuring that the Audit 
Committee’s recommendations in respect of internal controls 
and risk management are implemented.
Following the acquisition of Elster in August 2012, the Company 
has been working hard to ensure the successful integration of 
this business into Melrose reporting and governance frameworks, 
in order to ensure a consistent approach is maintained 
throughout the Group.
Internal financial controls and reporting
The Group has a comprehensive system for assessing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, including strategic 
business planning and regular monitoring and reporting of 
financial performance. A detailed annual budget is prepared 
by senior management and thereafter is reviewed and formally 
adopted by the Board. The budget and other targets are regularly 
updated via a rolling forecast process and regular business 
review meetings are held involving senior management to assess 
performance. The results of these reviews are in turn reported 
to and discussed by the Board at each meeting. As discussed 
in the Audit Committee report on pages 66 to 68, BM Howarth 
is the Group’s internal auditor; they also assumed internal audit 
responsibility for the Elster businesses from acquisition in 
August 2012 onwards.
A total of 42 internal audit visits, covering 45.9% of Group 
turnover, were completed during 2013. These visits include 
27 Elster reporting units which, combined with the planned 
visits for 2014, will ensure that 98% of the Elster units will have 
been visited by internal audit within two years of acquisition. 
The Directors are pleased to report that there were no material 
deficiencies; the majority of the recommendations presented in 
the internal audit reports have now been, or are in the process 
of being implemented. Of the 42 sites visited in 2013, three 
sites have been chosen for “re-visits” in 2014 to ensure that  
the agreed improvements to systems and processes have 
been implemented.
The Board confirms that, from the review of internal controls,  
it has not determined any significant failings or weaknesses  
that it considers require remedial action. The Board also  
confirms that it has not been advised of any material weaknesses 
in the internal control systems that relate to financial reporting.
Whistleblowing, anti-bribery and corruption policies
The Company takes very seriously its responsibilities under the 
Bribery Act 2010 and has in place appropriate measures to ensure 
compliance. Policies in place within each business apply to all 
Directors, employees (whether permanent, fixed-term, or 
temporary), pension trustees, consultants and other business 
advisers, contractors, trainees, volunteers, business agents, 
distributors, joint venture partners, or any other person working for 
or performing a service on behalf of the Company, its subsidiaries 
and associated companies in which it has a majority interest.
The Company is currently in the process of updating its 
compliance policies and this is expected to be finalised during 
2014. As part of these ongoing improvements, it is expected  
that an independent and externally facilitated whistleblowing 
hotline will be made available to all employees within the Group. 
This facility is currently only available to Elster employees.
Main Principle D: Remuneration
Following changes to the Companies Act 2006 and in line with 
new regulations which came into effect on 1 October 2013, 
details around Directors’ remuneration, both generally and as it 
relates to the UK Code, are set out in the Directors’ remuneration 
report and are now presented in the following three sections:
•  the annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, which can be found on pages 70 and 71; 
•  the annual report on remuneration, which can be found on 
pages 72 to 77; and
•  the Directors’ remuneration policy, which can be found on 
pages 77 to 84.
Main Principle E: Relations with shareholders
The Company seeks to build on a mutual understanding of 
objectives with its institutional shareholders, via the executive 
Directors, through regular meetings and presentations following 
announcements of its annual and interim results. The non-
executive Directors are available to meet institutional 
shareholders should there be unresolved matters they wish  
to bring to their attention. The views of key analysts and 
shareholders generally are fed back to the Board directly by 
individual Directors, or via the Company’s brokers. This helps to 
ensure that all members of the Board develop an understanding 
of the views of major shareholders.
The Board welcomes the attendance of shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting. The results of the voting on each of the 
resolutions proposed will be announced shortly after the Annual 
General Meeting has concluded, via the Melrose corporate 
website at www.melroseplc.net.

Committee report
Role and responsibilities
The Audit Committee’s (the “Committee”) role and responsibilities 
are set out in its terms of reference. These are available on the 
Company’s website and from the Company Secretary at the 
Registered Office. In discharging its duties, the Committee 
embraces its role of protecting the interests of shareholders with 
respect to the integrity of financial information published by the 
Company and the effectiveness of the audit. Specifically, the 
Committee is responsible for:
•  reviewing and monitoring the integrity of the financial 
statements of the Group, including the Annual Report and 
interim report;
•  keeping under review the effectiveness of the Group’s financial 
reporting, internal audit and controls, risk management 
systems and compliance controls;
•  focusing and challenging the consistency of accounting 
policies, methods used to account for significant or unusual 
transactions and compliance with accounting standards;
•  reviewing the Group’s arrangements for its employees to  
raise concerns in confidence about possible wrongdoing in 
financial reporting, in accordance with the Company’s 
whistleblowing policy;
•  developing, implementing and monitoring the Group’s policy  
on external audit and for overseeing the objectivity and 
effectiveness of the auditor; and
•  reviewing and considering the Annual Report and  
financial statements to ensure that it is fair, balanced and 
understandable and advising the Board that the statement  
can be made by the Board that this is the case.
Composition
Each member of the Committee is deemed to be independent by 
the Company and brings recent and relevant financial experience 
from senior executive and non-executive positions as described  
in their biographies on pages 56 and 57. Given her financial 
qualifications and relevant experience, the Board concluded that 
Liz Hewitt should be invited to join the Committee.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee invites the Group Finance Director, the Head of 
Financial Reporting and senior representatives of the external 
and internal auditors to attend meetings where appropriate to the 
business being considered. The Committee has the right to invite 
any other Directors and/or employees to attend meetings where 
this is considered appropriate. In addition, the Committee meets 
at least once per year with both the external and internal auditors 
without management present.
Summary of meetings in the year
The Committee is expected to meet not less than three times  
a year. In 2013, the Committee met in March, August and 
November. The scheduling of these meetings is designed to be 
aligned with the financial reporting timetable thereby enabling the 
Committee to review the Annual Report and financial statements, 
the interim financial report and the audit plan ahead of the year 
end audit and maintaining a view of the internal controls and 
processes throughout the year. 
The attendance of its members at these meetings is 
shown above.
Significant issues related to the financial statements
In discharging its duties under its terms of reference, the 
Committee undertook the following recurring activities that 
receive annual scrutiny:
•  reviewed the Annual Report and financial statements and 
interim financial report. As part of this review the Committee 
received a report from the external auditor on their audit of the 
Annual Report and the financial statements and review of the 
interim report;
•  considered the processes in place to generate forecasts of 
cash flows and accounting valuation information, including the 
reasonableness and consistent use of assumptions;
•  reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and 
disclosures made in the Annual Report and financial 
statements on this matter; 
•  considered the Annual Report and financial statements in the 
context of being fair, balanced and understandable and 
reviewed the content of a paper prepared by management with 
regard to this principle in relation to the 2013 Annual Report 
and financial statements. Advised the Board that in its view, the 
2013 Annual Report and financial statements when taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy; and 
•  reviewed and agreed the scope of the audit work to be 
undertaken by the auditor.

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Governance Significant issue considered by the Audit Committee How the issue was addressed by the Audit Committee
Provisions for legal and environmental claims 
and other provisions
The level of provisioning for legal and environmental 
claims and other provisions require significant judgement. 
Although provisions are reviewed on a regular 
basis and adjusted for management’s best current 
estimates, the judgemental nature of these items 
means that future amounts settled may be different 
from those provided.
(Refer to notes 3 and 20) 
 
 
The Committee considered management’s proposed provisioning in respect 
of these legal and environmental claims and other provisions including the key 
judgements made and relevant legal advice.
The external auditor also reported on all material provisions to the Committee.
Having considered the matter and sought guidance from the external auditor, 
the Committee concluded that management’s proposed provisioning and the 
associated disclosures in the Annual Report were appropriate.
Classification of exceptional items 
The reporting, classification and consistency of 
exceptional items, specifically restructuring and 
fair value releases, were an area of focus for 
the Committee.
(Refer to note 6) 
 
The Committee considered the nature, classification and consistency of exceptional 
items. These items were detailed in the external auditor’s paper to the Committee. 
The Committee considered this issue and concluded that these exceptional items 
were appropriately captured and disclosed.
Taxation risks and recognition of deferred tax assets
Judgement is required in determining the Group’s 
provision for income taxes including estimating tax 
provisions where additional current tax may become 
payable in the future following the audit by the tax 
authorities of previously filed tax returns. Judgement 
is also required as to whether a deferred tax asset 
should be recognised based on the availability of 
future taxable profits. 
(Refer to notes 3, 8 and 21) 
 
Management’s taxation judgements, accounting treatment and the appropriateness 
of tax disclosures have been reviewed by the Committee. 
The Committee considered whether, from an accounting perspective, an update was 
required to the tax provisions previously recorded in respect of specific exposures 
identified. In addition the Committee reviewed the tax implications of corporate 
transactions undertaken during the year. The Committee debated whether additional 
deferred tax assets should be brought onto the Balance Sheet as a consequence of, 
for example, the expected timing of future corporate transactions. 
Having taken input from the external auditor, the Committee agreed with 
management’s proposed treatment of tax risks and deferred tax assets. 
Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and 
other fixed assets
The judgements in relation to goodwill impairment 
testing relate to the assumptions applied in calculating 
the value in use of the cash-generating units being 
tested for impairment. The key assumptions applied 
in the calculation relate to the future performance 
expectations of the cash-generating units. 
The Committee has also considered the related 
disclosures within the financial statements.
(Refer to notes 3 and 12) 
 
 
Business plans prepared by management supporting future performance 
expectations used in the calculation were approved by the Board. The Committee 
received a detailed report on the outcome of the impairment review performed by 
management. The impairment review was also an area of focus for the external 
auditor, who reported their findings to the Committee.
The Committee considered management’s approach, the assumptions applied in 
relation to the impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and other fixed assets and 
related disclosures and, having taken input from the external auditor, agreed with 
management’s assessment that there were no indicators of impairment for any of 
the Group’s business units during the year. 
Valuation of pension liabilities
The calculation of the accounting position at the year 
end of the Group’s pension liabilities is based on 
material judgemental estimates.
(Refer to notes 3 and 23)
 
The Committee has considered the appropriateness of the actuarial assumptions 
applied by management to the valuation of the Group’s retirement plans at the 
year end. 
These assumptions were reviewed with the external auditor, with input and 
assistance from employee benefit experts. The Committee supported the 
assumptions and judgements applied by management.  
In addition to these matters, the Committee considered the following significant issues in relation to the 
financial statements during the year:

External audit
Appointment, re-appointment and assessment 
of effectiveness
The Committee reviews and makes recommendations with 
regard to the reappointment of the external auditors. In making 
these recommendations, the Committee considers auditor 
effectiveness and independence, partner rotation and any other 
factors which may impact the external auditor’s reappointment.
The external auditor is required to rotate the audit signing partner 
every five years. The Group’s audit signing partner changed as 
part of that rotation process in 2010 and therefore partner 
rotation is due in the financial year ending 31 December 2015.
The Committee has reviewed the external auditor’s performance 
and effectiveness taking into account input from management 
together with feedback from the Public Report on the Audit Quality 
Inspection of Deloitte LLP , issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in May 2013. In making its assessment, the Committee focused on 
the robustness of the audit, the quality of delivery of audit services 
and the quality of the auditor’s staff. Based on this information, the 
Committee concluded that the external audit process is operating 
effectively and Deloitte LLP continues to prove effective in its role  
as external auditor. As detailed below, the Committee regularly 
monitors the objectivity and independence of the external auditor. 
Deloitte LLP was appointed in 2003 when the Company 
commenced trading and the external audit has not been  
formally tendered since then. The Committee is satisfied that the 
effectiveness and independence of the external auditors is not 
impaired in any way. There are no legal or contractual obligations 
that restrict the Group’s capacity to recommend a particular firm 
for appointment as auditor and therefore a resolution proposing 
the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as external auditors will be put 
to the shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
Audit tendering
The Committee is mindful of the recommendations of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code that the external audit should be 
put out to tender every 10 years. The Company will comply with 
the Competition Commission Order relating to the statutory audit 
market for FTSE350 companies, which is expected to come into 
effect from 1 October 2014. Under the proposed transitional 
arrangements, the Committee expects a formal tender process 
to be held no later than two years from the end of the current 
audit engagement partner rotation period which is due in the year 
ending 31 December 2015. This matter will be kept under review.
Non-audit services
The Committee has a policy on the engagement of the external 
auditor for the supply of non-audit services. This is to ensure that 
the provision of non-audit services does not impair the external 
auditor’s independence or objectivity. In accordance with best 
practice FRC guidelines, the Company policy in relation to non-
audit services is kept under regular review; the policy outlines 
which non-audit services are pre-approved (being those which 
are routine in nature, with a fee that is not significant in the 
context of the audit or audit-related services), which services 
require the prior approval of the Committee and which services 
the auditor is excluded from providing. The general principle is 
that the audit firm should not be requested to carry out non-audit 
services on any activity of the Company where they may, in the 
future, be required to give an audit opinion.
During 2013, the main non-audit services provided by  
Deloitte LLP were in relation to taxation advisory, compliance  
and planning services.
An analysis of the fees earned by the external auditors for  
audit and non-audit services can be found in note 7 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Auditor objectivity and independence
The Committee carries out regular reviews to ensure that auditor 
objectivity and independence is maintained at all times. A different 
senior partner oversees the taxation audit of the Company 
compared to those working on the non-audit taxation services. 
No fees were paid to Deloitte LLP on a contingent basis. Based 
on these strict procedures the Committee remains confident that 
auditor objectivity and independence has been maintained but 
accepts that non-audit work should be controlled to ensure that  
it does not compromise the auditor’s position.
At each year end, Deloitte LLP submits a letter setting out how it 
believes its independence and objectivity have been maintained. 
As noted above, they are also required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group audit every five years and significant 
subsidiary audits every seven years. 
Internal audit
Due to the size and complexity of the Group, it is appropriate  
for an internal audit programme to be used within the business. 
BM Howarth, an external firm, provides internal audit services  
to the Group. A rotation programme is in place, such that every 
business unit will have an internal audit at least once every  
three years, with the largest sites being reviewed at least once 
every two years. The rotation programme allows divisional 
management’s actions and responses to be followed up on a 
timely basis. The internal audit programme of planned visits is 
discussed and agreed with the Committee during the year.
The internal auditor’s remit includes assessment of the effectiveness 
of internal control systems, compliance with the Group’s Policies 
and Procedures Manual and a review of the businesses’ Balance 
Sheets. A report of key findings and recommendations is presented 
to the Group Finance Director, the Head of Financial Reporting and 
the Group Operations Controller, followed by a meeting to discuss 
these key findings and to agree on resulting actions.
BM Howarth present their key findings to the Committee twice 
during the year. These presentations include details of the site 
coverage for the previous year and an outline of the planned visits  
for the current year. A review of the internal audit process and scope 
of work covered by the internal auditor is the responsibility of the 
Committee, to ensure their objectives, level of authority and 
resources are appropriate for the nature of the businesses under 
review. The Committee also reviews BM Howarth’s performance 
against the agreed internal audit programme. A report of significant 
findings is presented by the internal auditor to the Committee at 
each meeting and implementation of recommendations by the 
Board is followed up at the subsequent Committee meeting.

Committee report
Diversity
The Committee currently takes into account a variety of factors 
before recommending any new appointments to the Board, 
including relevant skills to perform the role, experience, 
knowledge, ethnicity and gender. The most important priority 
of the Committee, however, has been and will continue to be 
ensuring that the best candidate is selected to join the Board  
and this approach will remain in place going forward.
Whilst the Committee will endeavour to pursue diversity, including 
gender diversity throughout the Melrose Group and concurs with the 
recommendations of Lord Davies’ review, “Women on Boards”, 
the Committee does not think it appropriate to have, nor will it be 
committing to, any specific diversity targets in relation to the 
composition of the Board, or the wider businesses within 
the Group.
Succession planning
In line with the succession planning responsibilities of the 
Committee, the decision was taken in early 2013 to recruit 
another non-executive Director to the Board, in order to take 
account of the impending retirement of Miles Templeman from 
the position of Senior non-executive Director, at the conclusion  
of the 2014 AGM. It was also felt by the Committee that an 
additional non-executive Director serving on the Melrose Board 
would further complement the skill set of the Board.
The Committee undertook a formal and rigorous recruitment 
exercise to find a suitable non-executive Director to join the 
Melrose Board (see “What the Committee did in 2013”, below,  
for further details). Following this process, the Committee 
recommended to the Board the appointment of Liz Hewitt, on 
8 October 2013. In accordance with the Articles, Ms Hewitt will 
stand for election as a Director of the Company at the 2014 AGM.
At the conclusion of the 2014 AGM, Liz Hewitt will replace 
Miles Templeman as Chairman of the Committee.
What the Committee did in 2013
The main focus of the Committee during 2013, as described 
above, was the recruitment of a new non-executive Director to 
the Board. 
After the discussion of alternatives, the Committee decided to 
use the services of Stonehaven Executive Search, an external 
recruitment firm who have no other connection with the 
Company, to conduct an extensive search exercise.
Following a formal and rigorous recruitment process, the 
Committee recommended to the Board that Ms Hewitt’s long-
established and highly pertinent experience would be of 
significant benefit to Melrose as the business continues to grow. 
As such, Ms Hewitt was appointed to the Board on 8 October 
2013 and subsequently also became a member of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees.

Further details regarding the composition, diversity policy and the 
2013 activities of the Committee are shown below.
Composition
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
majority of the members of the Committee were independent 
non-executive Directors throughout 2013. During the year, the 
Committee was chaired by Miles Templeman, with Perry 
Crosthwaite, John Grant and Justin Dowley also serving throughout 
the year. Liz Hewitt became a member of the Committee upon her 
appointment to the Board on 8 October 2013 (see “Succession

Remuneration  
Committee Chairman
Directors’  
remuneration report
Dear Shareholder, 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our report on 
Directors’ remuneration at the end of yet another highly 
successful year. The Directors’ remuneration report sets out the 
amounts earned in respect of the year ended 31 December 2013 
and the remuneration policy for the Directors of Melrose. 
New regulations have come into effect which impact the 
presentation and disclosure of Directors’ remuneration and the 
lay-out of this report reflects those new regulations. This 
report is, therefore, presented in two sections: the Annual 
Report on Remuneration and the Directors’ remuneration policy. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details on the 
amounts earned in respect of the year ended 31 December 2013 
and will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM. The Directors’ 
remuneration policy sets out the forward-looking remuneration 
policy that will be subject to a binding vote at the AGM and shall 
take binding effect from the conclusion of that meeting. 
Since flotation in 2003 Melrose has always obtained special 
resolution support (requiring 75% shareholder approval, rather 
than the simple majority approval required for an ordinary 
resolution) for its Directors’ long-term incentive arrangements  
from shareholders, including in respect of the 2012 Incentive Plan 
(the “LTIP”) that was established in 2012. Your Board understands 
that these arrangements are fundamental to achieving the strong 
returns for shareholders since flotation and closely align the 
interests of Directors and senior employees to those of 
shareholders. Base salaries and annual bonuses are deliberately 
set at or below the lower end of a market competitive range 
compared to companies of similar size and complexity to ensure  
a clear focus on generation of long-term value through the LTIP . 
The level of reward earned by Directors and senior management 
under the LTIP will be dependent upon shareholder value created. 
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee 
responsibility for overseeing the remuneration of the 
Company’s Directors, Company Secretary and other 
senior employees.
Performance in 2013
2013 was a strong year for Melrose and marked another 
milestone in our “buy, improve, sell” strategy:
•  We crystallised more than three times the original shareholder 
value in five of the “FKI” businesses acquired in 2008.
•  These five disposals yielded a total consideration of 
approximately £950 million, together more than tripling 
shareholder value in respect of these businesses during five 
years of Melrose ownership.
•  In accordance with our strategy, the Board has returned 
approximately £600 million in cash to shareholders, equivalent 
to 47.0 pence per existing ordinary share. The balance of the 
net proceeds has been used to pay down existing borrowings 
of the Company.
•  The Elster improvement plan is ahead of schedule, with 
operating margin increased by 5* percentage points to 17.4% 
and operating profit up 37%*.
•  Headline diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
of 12.8p (2012: 9.4p*), an increase of 36%. 
•  Group revenue for continuing operations during the year was 
£1,732.8m (2012: £1,051.1m).
•  Group headline profit for continuing operations before tax was 
£226.1m (2012: £117.9m).
•  Full year dividend of 7.75p per share (2012: 7.6p per share).
It is with this in mind and in line with Melrose’s remuneration 
philosophy of pay for performance, that the Remuneration 
Committee has taken its decisions in respect of executive 
Directors’ remuneration arrangements for 2013 and 2014.
Our remuneration structure for executive Directors
Melrose’s remuneration philosophy is that executive remuneration 
should be simple and transparent, support the delivery of the 
business strategy and pay for performance.
The Remuneration Committee feels strongly that rewards should 
be linked to generation and delivery of real returns to shareholders.
•  Base salary: Base salaries for all executive Directors are 
deliberately set at or below the lower end of a market 
competitive range compared to companies of similar size and 
complexity. Since flotation in 2003 all current executive 
Directors have received the same annual increases to base 
salary; in the last five years these increases have averaged 3%.
•  Pension: Pension contributions/salary supplements for 
executive Directors are payable at the level of 15% of base 
salary, which is considered modest for a business of the size 
and complexity of Melrose. No executive Director participates 
in, or has ever participated in, any Melrose defined benefit 
pension scheme.

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Governance •  Annual bonus: The maximum bonus payable is set at 100%  
of base salary. All Directors who participate in the annual 
bonus scheme receive the same percentage bonus. In the  
last five years, the average percentage of base salary payable 
has been 84%. The maximum opportunity is deliberately 
positioned below the median maximum opportunity for 
FTSE 100 companies.
•  Long-term incentives: The only long-term incentive 
arrangement in which the executive Directors participate is 
the 2012 Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders 
by special resolution in a General Meeting held on 11 April 
2012. Entitlements under the 2012 Incentive Plan, details of 
which are provided on page 74, were awarded in April 2012. 
Any payment made will be dependent upon shareholder 
value generated over a five year time period.
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that this simple 
and transparent incentive framework is aligned with the 
Company’s strategy for growth. We believe that this remuneration 
strategy has also directly driven historical out-performance, 
supported the Company’s success and has clearly led to 
increased shareholder value. In this regard, our remuneration 
arrangements are tailored to the culture and strategy of the 
Company, take account of the current and forecast economic 
climate and provide a strong platform for the ongoing long-term 
success of the Company.
The remuneration policy has also enabled the executive Directors 
to build up and retain significant shareholdings in the Company. 
Further detail is given on page 74; however, the table below 
shows the number of Ordinary Shares held by the executive 
Directors as at 31 December 2013 and the value of each 
executive Director’s shareholding at that date as a multiple  
of his 2013 base salary.

(1)  For these purposes, the value of a share is 305.7 pence, being the closing mid-market 
price on 31 December 2013. 
(2)  As at 31 December 2013, the interest of Christopher Miller included 6,760,000 Ordinary 
Shares held by Harris & Sheldon Investments Limited, a company which is connected  
with Christopher Miller within the meaning of section 252 of the Companies Act 2006.
2013 key decisions and incentive pay-outs
The Remuneration Committee remains committed to a 
responsible approach to executive pay. As described in the 
business review section of this Annual Report and highlighted 
above, the Company delivered strong financial and operational 
results in 2013. The executive Directors’ remuneration rewards 
that performance. 
Annual bonuses for executive Directors are based on diluted 
earnings per share growth and a discretionary element based on 
the achievement of a range of operational deliverables. Bonuses 
of 100% of maximum were awarded to the executive Directors in 
respect of 2013.
In line with increases in previous years, an inflationary increase of 
3% was made to the executive Directors’ salaries with effect from 
1 January 2013, the same as for other head office employees. 
Awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan were made in April 2012 
and are due to crystallise in May 2017; accordingly no executive 
Director received any pay-out under a long-term incentive plan 
in 2013. Any payment made will be dependent upon shareholder 
value created by May 2017. While potential value attributable to 
the 2012 Incentive Plan is included in the charts on page 81, 
this is included for illustrative purposes only. The value ultimately 
delivered under this plan will be determined by reference to the 
value delivered to shareholders over the period to crystallisation, 
such that the value shown in those charts is unlikely to reflect 
the value ultimately delivered.
Remuneration policy for 2014
The remuneration policy is set out for shareholder approval in the 
policy report on pages 77 to 84. Details of how the policy will be 
applied in practice for 2014 are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 76. Executive Directors’ base salaries 
have been increased by 3% with effect from January 2014, the 
same as for other head office employees. Non-executive 
Directors’ basic fees increased by 3% with effect from January 
2014. The additional fees payable to the Committee Chairmen 
and Senior Independent Director (which have been unchanged 
since 2006) have been reviewed. The additional fees were 
considered to be below the market competitive range and have, 
therefore, been increased, with effect from the 2014 AGM, to 
bring them more in line with the market; the previous and new  
fee levels are set out in the table on page 76. No other changes 
have been made to the structure of our executive Director 
remuneration for the coming year. 
Shareholder engagement
We remain committed to maintaining an open and transparent 
engagement with our investors. We believe that a key objective 
of the Directors’ remuneration report is to communicate clearly 
how much our executive Directors are earning and how this is 
clearly linked to performance. I trust that you will find the new 
style report informative.

(2)  Of the £240,598 attributable to pension contributions, £159,298 was paid as a supplement to base salary in lieu of pension 
arrangements. The balance of £81,300 was paid into the individual Directors’ nominated private pension plans.

(5) Liz Hewitt was appointed as a non-executive Director of the Company on 8 October 2013. 
(6)  Under the new regulations the Company is required to only include sums that are vested under the 2012 Incentive 
Share Plan as at 31 December 2013. However, for the sake of transparency, the Company has set out in this footnote an 
indicative value attributable to the 2012 Incentive Share Plan. Note 22 on page 128 of this Annual Report illustrates that 
using the Black Scholes option pricing model, the estimated value of the 2012 Incentive Share Plan as at 31 December 
2013 was £73.0 million. One fifth (representing one year of the intended five year life of this plan) of each of Messrs Miller’s, 
Roper’s, Peckham’s and Martin’s pro-rata share of this value would be £2,482,000. It is important to note that the valuation 
is purely indicative and is likely to vary given that the value delivered under the plan is entirely determined by reference  
to the value delivered to shareholders over the period to crystallisation.

Chief Executive Officer. No cash bonus was paid for the period from 9 May 2012, which is the date on which he became 
Executive Vice-Chairman.
(2)  Miles Templeman was Chairman of the Audit Committee up to 6 March 2012 but was then replaced by John Grant. 
Mr Templeman received an amount of £885 in recognition of Chairmanship of the Audit Committee from 1 January 2012  
to 6 March 2012. 
(3) Includes £5,000 in recognition of Chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee.

Mr Grant’s Chairmanship of this Committee from 6 March 2012 to 31 December 2012 an amount of £4,115 was paid.
(5)  Of the £233,595 attributable to pension related benefits, £152,295 was paid as a supplement to base salary in lieu of 
pension arrangements. The balance of £81,300 was paid into the individual Directors’ nominated private pension plans.
(6)  The figures quoted within the long-term incentive column above represent the total market value of the Ordinary Shares 
awarded to each of the executive Directors following crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan on 11 April 2012. 
These amounts were earned in respect of the circa five year period from July 2007 to April 2012. Under the new regulations 
a payment in respect of a five year period has to be recorded as paid in the year of vesting, rather than apportioned over 
the period it was earned. The market value of each Ordinary Share on this date was 406 pence. The total number of 
Ordinary Shares obtained by the executive Directors following crystallisation was 27,185,731. This value and the numbers 
of shares are stated before the rights issue that took place in August 2012. 
Annual report on remuneration 
Single total figure of remuneration 
(audited information)
In accordance with the new regulations 
governing the reporting of Directors’ 
remuneration, the total figure of 
remuneration set out in the tables 
adjacent includes the value of long-
term incentive vesting in respect of the 
financial year.
As set out on page 74, the executive 
Directors’ entitlements under the 2012 
Incentive Plan were granted in April 
2012 and deliver to participants part 
of the growth in value of the Company 
over the five year period from March 
2012 until May 2017 (or an earlier 
trigger date determined in accordance 
with the arrangements). This means 
that for the year ended 31 December 
2013, no long-term incentive vested in 
respect of the financial year.
The value of long-term incentives shown 
for the year ended 31 December 2012, 
relates to the crystallisation of the 2009 
Incentive Share Plan on 11 April 2012. 
It should be noted that this value was 
earned over a period of approximately 
five years from 18 July 2007 and no 
other long-term incentive plan vested in 
favour of any executive Director in this 
period. As disclosed in the Directors’ 
remuneration report for the year ended 
31 December 2012, during the term of 
the 2009 Incentive Share Plan the 
Directors and senior management team 
were successful in generating real 
returns for shareholders: market 
capitalisation just prior to the maturity 
date of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan 
was £1.65 billion against a net 
shareholder investment of approximately 
£14 million and approximately £1.5 billion 
of shareholder value was created; 
headline EPS increased by 120%; 
dividends to shareholders increased by 
93%; and total shareholder return was 
197% against a return of 15% for the 
FTSE 350.

Annual Report 2013
Governance Base salary
Salaries are fixed at a level which is at or below the lower end of a 
market competitive range compared to companies of similar size 
and complexity, to reflect participation in the 2012 Incentive Plan. 
Each executive Director received an inflationary increase in base 
salary of approximately 3% effective from January 2013. 
Benefits
The range of benefits provided to Directors has not changed in 
the last three years and there is no intention to widen the range 
of benefits Directors may receive. All of the executive Directors 
received other taxable benefits during 2013, being a company 
car allowance, private fuel allowance and private medical 
insurance. Mr Martin also received paid train travel to and from 
London and accommodation whilst working in London. 
Bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity is set below the maximum 
median annual bonus opportunity for FTSE 100 companies to 
reflect the participation of the executive Directors in the 2012 
Incentive Plan. For the year ended 31 December 2013, Simon 
Peckham’s and Geoffrey Martin’s (being the only executive 
Directors participating in the annual bonus plan) bonus 
opportunity was equal to 100% of base salary and bonuses 
earned were equal to 100% of base salary.

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests 
(audited information)
As disclosed at the time of the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive 
Share Plan, the executive Directors considered it appropriate 
that they, together with their immediate families, would hold at 
least half of the shares acquired pursuant to that crystallisation 
(after making adequate provision for any tax liability arising in 
connection with that crystallisation) for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has adopted the 
following guidelines in relation to the holding of Ordinary Shares by 
executive Directors who participated in the 2009 Incentive Share 
Plan and who participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan, reinforcing 
the executive Directors’ long-term stewardship of the Company 
and long-term investment in the Company’s shares. No executive 
Director may dispose of any such Ordinary Shares without the 
consent of the Remuneration Committee, which will not normally 
be withheld provided the executive Director holds at least the 
“minimum number of Ordinary Shares” referred to below.

(2)  For these purposes, the value of an Ordinary Share is 305.7 pence, being the closing

Performance graph
The total shareholder return graph below shows the value as  
at 31 December 2013 of £100 invested in the Company on 
31 December 2008, compared with £100 invested in the FTSE 
100 Index or the FTSE All Share Index. The Remuneration 
Committee considers the FTSE 100 Index and the FTSE All 
Share Index to be appropriate indices for the purposes of this 
comparison because of the comparable size of the companies 
which comprise the FTSE 100 Index and the broad nature of 
companies which comprise the FTSE All Share Index. The source 
data for the graph below assumes that all cash returns to 
shareholders made by the Company during this period are 
reinvested in Ordinary Shares.

Miller within the meaning of section 252 of the Companies Act 2006), David Roper held 8,110,074 Ordinary Shares, Simon Peckham held 8,177,288 Ordinary Shares, Geoffrey Martin held

(3)  Each of these options is over 2012 Incentive Shares. Although the option can be exercised at any time, the value which may be derived from the shares acquired on exercise will be 
determined at the relevant “trigger date” as discussed on page 79. 2012 Incentive Shares acquired on or before the trigger date may be forfeited in accordance with the Company’s  
articles of association. The option exercise price is £1 per share, which is equal to the nominal value of those shares.

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Governance In accordance with the new regulations governing the reporting of Directors’ remuneration the total figure of remuneration 
set out in the table below includes the value of long-term incentive vesting in respect of the financial year. This means  
that the full value of the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan on 11 April 2012 is shown for the year ending 
31 December 2012 and no value will be reflected in the total figure of remuneration for the 2012 Incentive Plan until the 
trigger date (which will be May 2017 or an earlier trigger date determined in accordance with the arrangements).
The value of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan was earned over a period of approximately five years. Therefore, in the view of 
the Remuneration Committee inclusion of this value in respect of the year ended 31 December 2012 does not give a fair 
representation of the Chief Executive Officer’s yearly remuneration over each of the previous five years. Therefore, an 
additional column has been added to the table below to show total remuneration excluding the value received on the 
maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan. No other long-term incentive plan vested in favour of any executive 
Director in any of the other years. 
The amount of that value shown in respect of David Roper and Simon Peckham for 2012 reflects the proportion of 2012 for 
which each was the Chief Executive Officer.

  (i)  the “Total remuneration” figure shows, in respect of David Roper, his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period 1 January 2012 to 9 May 2012 and in respect of  
Simon Peckham his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period from 9 May 2012 to 31 December 2012. Included in this figure for each of David Roper and Simon Peckham  
is the value of the long-term incentives vesting in the year pro-rated to reflect the portion of the year for which he was Chief Executive Officer; and
  (ii)  the “Total remuneration excluding the long-term incentive value” shows in respect of each of David Roper and Simon Peckham total remuneration in respect of the period for which  
he was Chief Executive Officer excluding any value received on the maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Share Incentive Plan. 
(2)   On the crystallisation in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Shares awarded in 2009, participants in the 2009 Incentive Share Plan as a whole were entitled to 10% of the increase in 
shareholder value from 18 July 2007 to 23 March 2012. As the value derived on the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Shares depended upon the shareholder value created  
over the relevant period, it is not possible to express the value derived as a percentage of the maximum opportunity. The crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Shares was satisfied by  
the conversion of those shares into Ordinary Shares. 
(3)   The value derived in 2012 from the 2009 Incentive Shares represents the Chief Executive’s share, determined in accordance with the terms of those shares, of the shareholder  
value created over a period of circa five years.

Percentage change in Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration
The table below sets out, in relation to salary, taxable benefits 
and annual bonus, the percentage increase in pay for the 
Company’s Chief Executive Officer compared to the average 
increase for a group consisting of the Company’s senior head 
office employees, Managing Directors and Finance Directors of 
Group businesses and direct senior reports of those Managing 
Directors and Finance Directors. The percentages shown  
below relate to the financial year ended 2013 as a percentage 
comparison to the financial year ended 2012. This group of senior 
management was considered an appropriate comparator group 
because of their level of seniority and the structure of their 
remuneration package. The spread of the Company’s operations 
across various countries and industries means that remuneration 
policies vary to take account of geography and industry such that 
the Remuneration Committee considers that selecting a wider 
group of employees would not provide a meaningful comparison.

Implementation of Directors’ remuneration policy for the 
financial year commencing on 1 January 2014
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that its 
remuneration framework is aligned with the Company’s strategy 
for growth and no structural changes to the Directors’ 
remuneration arrangements are proposed for 2014. Executive 
Directors’ salaries have increased by 3% with effect from January 
2014. Non-executive Directors’ basic fees increased by 3% with 
effect from January 2014. The additional fees payable to the 
Committee Chairmen and Senior non-executive Director 
(which have been unchanged since 2006) have been reviewed. 
The additional fees were considered to be below the market 
competitive range and have, therefore, been increased, with effect 
from the 2014 AGM, to bring them more in line with the market. 
The previous and new fee levels are set out in the table below.

The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for:
•  considering and making recommendations to the Board on the 
framework for the remuneration of the Company’s executive 
Directors, the Company Secretary and other senior employees;
•  ensuring the executive Directors and senior employees are 
provided with appropriate annual incentives to encourage 
enhanced performance and that they are rewarded for their 
individual contributions to the success of the Company noting 
any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout 
the Group and ensuring that executive Director remuneration 
practice is consistent with any such changes; 
•  approving the structure of and determining targets for any  
long-term incentive plans operated by the Company; and
•  reviewing, on an annual basis, remuneration trends across 
the Group and obtaining reliable and up-to-date information 
about the remuneration of Directors and senior employees 
in other companies.
Full details can be found in the terms of reference available in the 
Investor section of our website at www.melroseplc.net.
Fees for non-executive Directors are determined by the

Governance The members of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year 
were Perry Crosthwaite (Committee Chairman), Justin Dowley, 
John Grant and Miles Templeman. Liz Hewitt also became a 
member of the Remuneration Committee on 8 October 2013, 
following her appointment to the Board. The Company regards 
all members of the Remuneration Committee as independent 
non-executive Directors; the composition of the Remuneration 
Committee is therefore in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. During the year, the Remuneration 
Committee met twice. Miles Templeman did not attend one of 
the meetings and Liz Hewitt did not attend the meeting which 
took place before her appointment; other than in these two 
cases all members were in attendance. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice 
on the new remuneration reporting regulations from Deloitte LLP. 
Deloitte LLP was appointed by the Company Secretary on 
behalf of the Remuneration Committee. Deloitte LLP’s fees for 
this advice were £16,500, which were charged on a time/cost 
basis. Deloitte LLP is external auditor to the Company and 
provides certain other services (as described on page 68 of 
the Annual Report and financial statements). 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice 
provided by Deloitte LLP in relation to the new remuneration 
reporting regulations is objective and independent.

remuneration Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance metrics
Base  
Salary
Core element of fixed 
remuneration, reflecting the  
size and scope of the role. 
Purpose is to attract and retain 
Directors of the calibre required 
for the business.
Normally reviewed annually 
and usually fixed for 12 months 
from 1 January, although 
salaries may be reviewed more 
frequently or at different times 
of the year if the Remuneration 
Committee determines this is 
appropriate.
Salary is paid in cash and 
levels are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee  
taking into account a range  
of factors including:
•  role, experience and 
performance; 
• prevailing market conditions; 
•  external benchmarks for 
similar roles at comparable 
companies; and
•  salary increases awarded for 
other employees in the Group. 
To avoid setting expectations  
of executive Directors and  
other employees, no maximum 
has been set under the 
remuneration policy.
Increases may be made 
to salary levels in certain 
circumstances as required,  
for example to reflect:
•  increase in scope of role or 
responsibility; and
• performance in role.
Salary increases will take into 
account the average increase 
awarded to other employees 
in the worldwide Group.
Not applicable, although the 
individual’s contribution and 
overall performance is one of the 
considerations in determining  
the level of any salary increase.

Annual 
Bonus
Rewards performance against 
annual targets which support 
the strategic direction of 
the Company. 
Financial targets are 
set annually and pay-
out is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee 
after the year-end based on 
performance against those 
targets. The Remuneration 
Committee has discretion 
to vary the bonus pay-out 
(upwards or downwards) 
should any formulaic output 
not produce a fair result for 
either the individual executive 
Director or the Company, taking 
account of overall business 
performance.
The treatment of a “leaver’s” 
bonus participation is described 
on page 84. 
For executive Directors 
participating in the Company’s 
2012 Incentive Plan, the  
maximum annual bonus 
opportunity is 100% of 
base salary. 
The Remuneration Committee 
will have regard to various 
performance metrics (which 
will be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee) 
measured over the relevant 
financial year, when determining 
bonuses. 
At least 50% of the award will be 
based on financial measures and 
the balance of the award will be 
determined at the discretion of 
the Remuneration Committee.
Financial metrics 
The element of the bonus 
subject to a financial metric will 
be determined between 0% and 
100% for performance between 
“threshold” performance (the 
minimum level of performance 
that results in any level of pay-out) 
and “maximum” performance. 
Discretionary element 
The discretionary element of 
an award will be determined 
to the extent assessed by 
the Remuneration Committee 
between 0% and 100% based on 
the Remuneration Committee’s 
assessment of a range of financial 
and non-financial metrics. 
Benefits Ensures the overall package 
is competitive. 
Purpose is to recruit and retain 
Directors of the calibre required 
for the business. 
Executive Directors receive 
benefits in line with market 
practice and these include a 
company car allowance, fuel 
allowance, private medical 
insurance, life insurance and 
group income protection. 
Other benefits may be 
provided based on individual 
circumstances, such benefits  
may include (but are not limited 
to) travel costs to and from 
London and accommodation in 
London for executive Directors 
who are not based in London 
but who are required to work 
there and relocation allowances. 
 
Whilst the Remuneration 
Committee has not set an 
absolute maximum on the 
level of benefits executive 
Directors may receive, the 
value of benefits is set at a 
level which the Remuneration 
Committee considers 
appropriate against the market

2012 
Incentive 
Plan
Incentivises executive Directors 
over the longer-term and aligns 
their interests with those of 
shareholders by linking the level  
of reward to the value delivered  
to shareholders.
This plan was approved by  
a special resolution of 
shareholders on 11 April 2012  
and has been unchanged since.
Options are granted over 
a separate class of shares 
known as the “2012 Incentive 
Shares”. The options have 
an exercise price per share 
equal to the nominal value of 
a 2012 Incentive Share. The 
rights attaching to the 2012 
Incentive Shares are set out 
in the Company’s articles of 
association. 
Options may be exercised at 
any time up to 31 May 2017 
(the “trigger date”) and will be 
automatically exercised prior to 
the trigger date if not already 
exercised. In the event of a 
change of control or winding 
up of the Company, the trigger 
date may be a date before 
31 May 2017. 
On the trigger date, the 
holders of the 2012 Incentive 
Shares shall be entitled to 
7.5% of the increase in value 
of the Company from and 
including 22 March 2012 to the 
trigger date. This value may 
be delivered in the form of a 
dividend and/or the conversion 
of the 2012 Incentive Shares 
into an appropriate number of 
Ordinary Shares or in certain 
other ways permitted under 
the Company’s articles of 
association.
The calculation of the growth 
in value of the Company shall 
be determined in accordance 
with the formula set out in 
the Company’s articles of 
association.
The treatment of an executive 
Director’s participation in 
the 2012 Incentive Plan if he 
becomes a “leaver” is described 
on page 84.  
The value that may be delivered 
under the 2012 Incentive Plan is 
linked to the shareholder value 
created over the period from 
and including 22 March 2012 
to crystallisation; accordingly, 
it is not possible to express 
the maximum opportunity as a 
multiple of salary. Options may 
be granted over, in aggregate, 
50,000 2012 Incentive Shares. 
The options held by the 
executive Directors over 
2012 Incentive Shares as at 
31 December 2013 are set out 
on page 74.
The maximum aggregate value 
that may be realised under 
the 2012 Incentive Shares 
shall be 7.5% of the increase 
in shareholder value from and 
including 22 March 2012 to 
and including the trigger date 
(as determined in accordance 
with the Company’s articles of 
association). 
The maximum number of 
new Ordinary Shares in the 
Company that may be issued is 
5% of the aggregate number of 
Ordinary Shares in Melrose PLC 
in issue on 22 March 2012 plus 
5% of any additional Ordinary 
Shares issued or created by 
Melrose PLC after that date 
and prior to 27 November 
2012 or by the Company after 
27 November 2012. 
The value that may be delivered 
under the 2012 Incentive Plan  
will be determined by reference 
to the growth in value of the 
Company, from and including 
22 March 2012 to and including 
the trigger date calculated in 
accordance with the Company’s 
articles of association.
Retirement 
Benefits
Purpose is to recruit and retain 
Directors of the calibre required

Provides market competitive  
post-employment benefits  
(or cash equivalent). 
Directors may elect to receive 
a Company contribution to an 
individual defined contribution 
pension arrangement or a 
supplement to base salary in 
lieu of a pension arrangement.
For participants in the 2012 
Incentive Plan, 15% of 
base salary.
Not applicable. 
Although neither clawback nor malus applies to any element of the remuneration package, the Company’s articles of association give the Remuneration Committee discretion to adjust the 
calculation of the amount to which holders of 2012 Incentive Shares and of options over such shares shall be entitled in certain circumstances, as referred to on page 84.

Explanation of performance metrics chosen
Performance measures are chosen which are aligned to the 
Company’s strategy. 
Annual bonus
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual 
bonus, to reflect the key financial and strategic objectives of the 
Company and reward for delivery against these targets. When 
setting the targets, the Remuneration Committee will take into 
account a number of different reference points including its plans 
and strategy and the market environment.
2012 Incentive Plan
Value delivered under the 2012 Incentive Plan is determined 
by reference to the growth in the value of the Company, such 
that the performance metric is the level of such growth that is 
delivered to shareholders. This arrangement was considered 
appropriate by the Remuneration Committee which considers 
that the previous and similar Incentive Share arrangements, 
introduced in 2009 and which crystallised in 2012, have been 
very effective in incentivising management to deliver real value 
to shareholders over the applicable performance period.
The Company’s articles of association provide that the 
Remuneration Committee may make adjustments to the 
calculation of the amount to which the holders of the 2012 
Incentive Shares shall be entitled in certain circumstances. 
These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the 
Company’s articles of association or a change in the capital 
structure of the Company otherwise producing an anomalous 
result. Any such adjustment shall be such as the Remuneration 
Committee considers fair and reasonable and as an investment 
bank shall have confirmed is fair and reasonable so far as the 
ordinary shareholders are concerned. 
Differences between the Company’s policy on Directors’ 
remuneration and its policy on remuneration for 
other employees
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group are 
determined based on the same principle that reward should be 
sufficient as is necessary to attract and retain high calibre talent, 
without paying more than is necessary and should be achieved 
for delivery of the Company’s strategy.
The Company has operations in various countries and across 
various industries, with Group employees of differing levels of 
seniority. Accordingly, though based on the overarching principle 
above, reward policies vary to take account of these factors. 
On the introduction of the 2012 Incentive Plan, the Remuneration 
Committee considered it appropriate to recognise the required 
growth of the senior management team beyond the executive 
Directors necessary to further develop the business and 
participation includes certain non-director employees.
The Company has also implemented divisional long-term 
incentive plans for senior managers of certain businesses within 
the Group to incentivise them to create value for the Company 
and its shareholders.

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Governance Illustration of the application of Directors’ 
remuneration policy
In illustrating the potential reward the following assumptions have 
been made:
•  Minimum performance: fixed elements of remuneration only 
(base salary effective from 1 January 2014, benefits as set out 
in the single figure table for the year ended 31 December 2013 
on page 72 and pension).
•  Performance in line with expectations: fixed elements of 
remuneration as above, plus bonus of 50% of salary (other 
than in the case of Christopher Miller and David Roper who do 
not participate in the annual bonus arrangements), plus an 
amount in relation to the executive Directors’ entitlements 
under the 2012 Incentive Plan, as described opposite.
•  Maximum performance: fixed elements of remuneration as 
above, plus bonus of 100% of salary (other than in the case of 
Christopher Miller and David Roper who do not participate in 
the annual bonus arrangements), plus an amount in relation to 
the executive Directors’ entitlements under the 2012 Incentive 
Plan, as described opposite. 
The executive Directors’ entitlements under the 2012 Incentive 
Plan were granted in April 2012 and deliver to participants part 
of the growth in value of the Company from March 2012 until 
May 2017 (or an earlier trigger date determined in accordance 
with the arrangements). Accordingly, the value of participation in 
the 2012 Incentive Plan depends on shareholder value created 
and cannot be expressed as a multiple of salary. While the 
Company is not required to show the potential reward from  
that plan in these charts (because they were granted in 2012 
prior to the policy coming into effect and were granted in one 
block rather than being granted annually) it has done so for  
the sake of transparency. Therefore, for illustrative purposes,  
in the charts below, the value attributable to the 2012 Incentive 
Plan is each executive Director’s pro-rata share of the Black 
Scholes option pricing model value of the plan as at grant 
(£20.693 million). For performance “in line with expectations”, 
one fifth (representing one year of the intended five year life)  
of 50% of this value is shown. For “maximum performance”, 
one-fifth (representing one year of the intended five year life) of 
100% of this value is shown. As the value delivered under the 
2012 Incentive Plan is entirely determined by reference to the 
value delivered to shareholders over the period to crystallisation, 
the value shown in the charts is unlikely to reflect the value 
ultimately delivered to participants.

Recruitment remuneration policy
When agreeing a remuneration package for the appointment of a 
new executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will apply 
the following principles:
•  the package will be sufficient to attract the calibre of Director 
required to deliver the Company’s strategy; 
•  the Remuneration Committee will seek to ensure that no more 
is paid than is necessary; and
•  in the next annual report on remuneration after an 
appointment, the Remuneration Committee will explain to 
shareholders the rationale for the arrangements implemented. 
In addition to the policy elements set out in the table on pages 
77 to 80, the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make 
appropriate remuneration decisions outside the standard policy 
to meet the individual circumstances of the recruitment, including 
discretion to include any other remuneration component or 
award. The Remuneration Committee does not intend to use this 
discretion to make a non-performance related incentive payment 
(for example a “golden hello”). In this regard, elements that the 
Remuneration Committee may consider for the purposes of a 
remuneration package for the recruitment of a new executive 
Director include but are not limited to the following. 
Element Approach
Incentive remuneration  
opportunity
The Remuneration Committee’s intention is that a new executive Director’s incentive remuneration opportunity 
will consist of:
•  an annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of salary (i.e. as applies for existing executive Directors); and
•  an award of options over 2012 Incentive Shares, with the number of such shares awarded being equal to 
the number of such shares over which an existing executive Director was granted an option in April 2012, 
as reduced to take into account the proportion of the 2012 Incentive Plan’s life that has elapsed at the time 
of the new executive Director’s appointment. 
The Remuneration Committee’s intention is that a new executive Director would only participate in the 2012 
Incentive Plan on this basis if he/she had a similar level of experience and responsibility as the existing 
executive Directors. 
If a new executive Director did not participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan, the Remuneration Committee 
may award a maximum annual bonus opportunity of up to 300% of salary until such time as a new long-
term incentive arrangement is put in place for the executive Directors in which that new executive Director 
could participate.  
 
Compensation for  
forfeited remuneration  
arrangements 
Whilst considered unlikely, the Remuneration Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to 
buy out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Remuneration 
Committee will have regard to relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to such 
arrangements, the form of those awards (e.g. cash or shares) and the timeframe of such awards. While such 
awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to below, the Remuneration 
Committee’s intention is that the value awarded (as determined by the Remuneration Committee on a fair and 
reasonable basis) would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements. Where considered 
appropriate, buy-out awards will be subject to forfeiture or clawback on early departure.  
Notice period The notice period will be the same as the Company’s ordinary policy of 12 months.  
Relocation costs Where necessary, the Company will pay appropriate relocation costs. The Remuneration Committee will seek 
to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary.  
Retirement benefits The maximum contribution of 15% of salary referred to in the policy table on page 79 will apply to any new 
executive Director. However, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to pay the contribution into any 
pension arrangement or to pay the amount as a supplement to base salary in lieu of a pension arrangement.

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Governance Under the new reporting regulations, the Company is required 
to set out the maximum level of variable remuneration that may 
be granted when agreeing the components of a remuneration 
package for the appointment of Directors, excluding any 
remuneration constituting compensation for the forfeiture of any 
variable remuneration award with a previous employer. In order to 
provide sufficient flexibility in recruitment scenarios and to reflect 
the fact that the value of participation in the 2012 Incentive Plan 
depends on shareholder value created and so cannot be 
expressed as a multiple of salary, the Remuneration Committee 
has set this level as maximum variable remuneration of:
•  If the Director participates in the 2012 Incentive Plan:
 • one times salary; plus
 •  an award of options over a number of 2012 Incentive Shares 
equal to the number of such shares over which an existing 
executive Director was granted an option in April 2012, as 
reduced to take into account the proportion of the 2012 
Incentive Plan’s life that has elapsed at the time of the new 
executive Director’s appointment; and
•  If the Director does not participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan, 
three times salary.
While long-term incentive awards and “buy-out” awards may be 
granted under the 2012 Incentive Plan, if necessary and subject, 
where relevant, to the limits referred to above, awards may be 
granted outside this plan as permitted under the Listing Rules, 
which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual 
circumstances, the recruitment of a Director. 
Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration 
obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed 
to continue according to their subsisting terms. 
The remuneration package for a newly appointed non-executive 
Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the 
policy table for non-executive Directors. 
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s policy is for executive Directors to be employed 
on the terms of service agreements, which may be terminated by 
either the Director or the Company on the giving of not less than 
12 months’ written notice (subject to certain exceptions). 
Each of the executive Directors had entered into a service 
agreement with Melrose PLC which was novated on exactly the 
same terms to the Company with effect from 27 November 2012 
when the Company became the new parent company of the 
Group. Details of the executive Directors’ original appointment 
dates and notice periods are set out below. 
Each of the non-executive Directors (other than Liz Hewitt) entered into new letters of appointment with the Company with effect from 
8 October 2012. Liz Hewitt entered into a letter of appointment with the Company with effect from 8 October 2013. Details of the 
non-executive Directors’ appointment dates and duration are shown below.

The principles on which the determination of payments for loss of office will be approached are summarised below:
On a change of control or winding-up of the Company the 2012 
Incentive Shares will crystallise early. In the event of a change of 
control, the date of the change of control shall be the “trigger 
date” for the purposes of determining the number of Ordinary 
Shares into which the 2012 Incentive Shares shall convert or the 
dividend amount to be paid. In the event of a winding up, the 
2012 Incentive Shares shall be treated as if they had converted 
into Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the winding-up and the 
holders of the 2012 Incentive Shares shall be entitled to a sum 
equal to the amount to which they would have been entitled  
on a return of capital on a winding-up if they had held those 
Ordinary Shares. 
Statement of consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
Salary, benefits and performance-related rewards provided 
to employees are taken into account when setting policy for 
executive Directors’ remuneration. There is no consultation 
with employees on Directors’ remuneration. 
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Company is committed to ongoing engagement and seeks 
the views of major shareholders in advance of amending its 
remuneration policies. The policies are set to reflect the 
Company’s commercial strategy and the 2012 Incentive Plan 
was approved by shareholders in 2012.
Payments outside the policy in this report
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make any 
remuneration payments and payments for loss of office outside 
the policy in this report:
•  where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy 
came into effect;
•  where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when 
the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, 
in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration of the individual becoming a Director 
of the Company; or
•  to satisfy contractual commitments under legacy remuneration 
arrangements.
For these purposes, “payments” includes the satisfaction of awards 
of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the 
terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award is granted. 
This report was approved by the Board on 5 March 2014 and 
signed on its behalf by:

Provision Treatment upon loss of office
Payment in lieu  
of notice
If the Company terminates an executive Director’s employment with immediate effect, a payment in lieu of notice may be made.  
This may include base salary, pension contributions and benefits. 
Annual bonus This will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an individual basis and the decision whether or not to award 
a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors including the circumstances of the executive Director’s 
departure and their contribution to the business during the bonus period in question. Typically, bonus amounts will be pro-rated for 
time in service to termination. 
2012 Incentive 
Plan
If an executive Director holding 2012 Incentive Shares ceases employment in circumstances in which he is a “good leaver”, the 
Remuneration Committee may (other than if he is a good leaver as a result of his resignation in connection with a change of 
control of the Company) require that he transfer some or all of the “unvested proportion” of his 2012 Incentive Shares for their 
nominal value. An executive Director who is a good leaver will be entitled to retain any 2012 Incentive Shares which he is not 
required to transfer. For these purposes the “unvested proportion” shall be the proportion of his 2012 Incentive Shares equal to 
the unexpired proportion of the period from 11 April 2012 to 31 May 2017 calculated on a full month basis. 
If an executive Director holding an option over 2012 Incentive Shares ceases employment in circumstances in which he is a 
“good leaver”, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee some or all of his unexercised options shall lapse. The number of 
options which shall lapse shall not exceed the number equal to the “unvested portion” of the executive Director’s 2012 Incentive 
Shares had the executive Director’s options been exercised immediately before the executive Director became a good leaver.  
The executive Director will be entitled to retain any options which do not lapse.
For these purposes, an executive Director shall be a “good leaver” if he leaves because of death, permanent ill health, permanent 
disability, resignation in connection with a change of control or termination by the Company without cause. 
Other payments The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith 
in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement or 
compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Director’s office or employment. 
In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of legal fees.
The overall amount of any payment made in respect of a loss of office will not exceed the aggregate of any payment in lieu of 
notice and any payment made in respect of annual bonus, as referred to above. Entitlements under the 2012 Incentive Plan will 
be dealt with in accordance with the terms of that plan and were the Company to make an award on recruitment of an executive 
Director to buy out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer then the leaver provisions for that award 
would be determined at the time of grant.

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Governance Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company  
law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
•  properly select and apply accounting policies;
•  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
•  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
•  make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
•  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
 •  the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements of Melrose Industries PLC
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2013 and of the Group’s Profit and the parent Company’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated and the Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the related notes 1 to 30 to the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 1 to 9 to the 
Company financial statements. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial 
statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement on page 47 that the Group is a going concern.  
We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial 
statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Provisions
The judgement involved in the 
recognition and valuation of 
the expected outcome of legal, 
environmental, restructuring 
and warranty provisions 
which require the exercise of 
management judgement and 
the use of estimates giving 
rise to inherent subjectivity in 
the amounts recorded in the 
financial statements. 
We challenged the assumptions underlying the recognition and valuation of provisions through checking 
and verifying the inputs used to calculate the provisions, including review of the nature and timings of formal 
restructuring plans, review of third party correspondence, discussion with the Group’s lawyers and review 
of agreements. 
Further we assessed the level of historical warranty claims and obtained the specific warranty terms and 
conditions provided in order to ascertain whether the warranty provisions held were sufficient to cover all 
obligations in existence at the year-end in light of known claims and standard warranty periods provided.  
We also considered the adequacy of disclosures made in Note 20 to the financial statements.
Exceptional Items
The presentation and consistency 
of costs and income within 
exceptional items is a key 
determinant in the assessment 
of the quality of the Group’s 
underlying earnings. 
A sample of exceptional items (including all material items) has been agreed to source documentation and 
evaluated by the local and Group audit teams as to their nature in order to assess whether they are in line 
with the Group’s accounting policy and also to ensure consistency of management’s application of the 
policy with previous accounting periods. In particular we ensure the reversal of any items originally booked 
as exceptional and the reversal of any fair value items recorded on acquisition are appropriately classified as 
exceptional items.
We also assessed whether the disclosures within the financial statements in Note 6 provide sufficient detail 
for the reader to understand the nature of these items.

Industries PLC continued
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Goodwill and Intangibles
The key assumptions used in the 
assessment of the carrying value 
of goodwill and intangible assets 
are determined with reference to 
judgemental factors such as future 
projected cash flows and the 
appropriate discount rate. 
We assessed the assumptions used in the impairment model for goodwill and intangible assets, described 
in Note 12, specifically including the cash flow projections, discount rates, perpetuity growth rates and the 
sensitivities applied.
Our procedures included reviewing forecast cash flows with reference to historical trading performance, 
consulting with our valuation specialists and benchmarking assumptions such as the perpetual growth rate 
and discount rate to external macro-economic and market data. Having ascertained the extent of change in 
those assumptions that either individually or collectively would be required for the assets to be impaired by 
performing sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions, we considered the likelihood of such a movement in 
those assumptions arising and the adequacy of the disclosures made in Note 12 to the financial statements. 
Recognition of deferred tax 
assets and accounting for 
uncertain tax positions
Recognition of deferred tax 
assets is based on management’s 
judgements of the availability of 
future taxable profits.
The value of the tax provisions 
recorded in respect of a number 
of uncertain tax positions which 
require judgements in respect of 
the likely outcome of negotiations 
with and enquiries from various 
tax authorities. 
 
 
We tested the appropriateness of the assumptions and estimates in relation to the likelihood of generating 
future taxable profits to support the recognition of deferred tax assets as described in Note 21 to the 
financial statements. We considered those assumptions (including the expected timing of disposals) and 
supporting forecasts and estimates as well as the appropriateness of the tax disclosures.
We worked with our tax audit specialists in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets and to appraise 
the likely outcome of technical tax treatments, including the review of correspondence with the revenue 
authorities to assess the reasonableness of the provisions made.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 67. 
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with 
respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
88
 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Financials Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined planning materiality for the Group to be £13 million, which is approximately 5.7% of headline profit before tax, and 
less than 1% of equity. We use headline profit before tax to provide a stable basis for materiality that reflects the focus of the users 
of the financial statements. This excludes the effect of separately disclosed exceptional items, as these can be volatile, and the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, as excluding the relatively high amortisation charge, given the acquisitive nature of the Group, 
provides a more comparable measure with similar organisations and is consistent with the profit measure most relevant to analysts 
and investors. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £250,000, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting to them on qualitative grounds.
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Group’s 72 locations are organised into the five continuing divisions described in the Divisional Review on pages 22 to 31 
of this Annual Report. Our Group audit scope focused primarily on audit work at 25 locations. 18 of these were subject to a full 
audit, whilst the remaining seven were subject to specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement and on the materiality of the Group’s business operations at those locations. 
The 18 locations subject to full audit represent business units within the each of the Group’s continuing reportable segments and 
accounted for 63% of the continuing Group’s revenue, 70% of the total operating segments’ continuing headline operating profit 
(i.e. before central costs). The seven locations subject to specified audit procedures account for 24% of the continuing Group’s 
revenue and 21% of the continuing Group’s headline operating profit. Full audit or audit procedures undertaken at the 25 locations 
or performed centrally by the Group audit team accounted for 94% of the Group’s net assets. The locations subject to full audit or 
specified audit procedures were selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material 
misstatement identified above. 
Our audit work and specified audit procedures at the 25 locations were executed at levels of materiality applicable to each 
individual entity which were much lower than Group materiality and appropriate to the relative scale of the business concerned. 
The senior statutory auditor or other senior members of the Group audit team visited 12 of the largest locations for the audit, which 
include some locations where specified audit procedures were performed. The Group audit team met with the Management teams 
including Managing Directors and Finance Directors of all the continuing businesses during the year end audit. The senior statutory 
auditor also held audit close meetings with all of the five continuing businesses, which cover all locations. In years when we do not 
visit a component within our Group Audit scope; we will include the component audit team in our team briefing, discuss their risk 
assessment, and review documentation of the findings from their work.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out review procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not 
subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during 
the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the 
Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should 
have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.

Financials Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards 
review team, strategically focused second partner reviews and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.

Financials Notes to the  
financial statements
1. Corporate information
Melrose Industries PLC (“the Company”) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The 
address of the registered office is given on page 152. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in 
note 5 and in the Business review sections on pages 22 to 31.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2013 were authorised in accordance with a 
resolution of the Directors of Melrose Industries PLC on 5 March 2014.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the Company is based. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
The comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2012 in these financial statements has been restated to include the 
results and cash flows of Truth, Marelli, Crosby, Acco and Harris within discontinued operations and exclude them from continuing 
operations. Truth and Harris were previously disclosed within the Other Industrial segment, Marelli within the Energy segment and 
Crosby and Acco within the Lifting segment. The comparative information has also been restated in accordance with the adoption 
of IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits”. The Balance Sheet at 31 December 2012 has been restated to reflect the completion of 
the acquisition accounting of Elster.
1.1 New Standards and Interpretations affecting amounts, presentation or disclosure reported in the current period
In the current financial year, the Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 1 (amended): “Presentation of items of other 
comprehensive income”, IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits” and IFRS 13: “Fair value measurement”.
The amendments to IAS 1 require items of other comprehensive income to be grouped by those items that may be reclassified 
subsequently to the Income Statement and those that will not be reclassified to the Income Statement, together with their 
associated income tax. The amendments have been applied retrospectively, and hence the presentation of items of comprehensive 
income have been restated to reflect the change. The effect of these changes is evident from the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
The adoption of IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits” impacts the measurement of the various components representing 
movements in the defined benefit pension obligation and associated disclosures but not the total obligation itself. The impact on 
the current year in adopting the revised standard has been to increase headline operating expenses by £2.8 million and finance 
costs by £5.1 million whilst reducing taxation expense by £2.1 million and increasing other comprehensive income by £5.8 million. 
In accordance with IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits”, the comparative periods have been restated as if the new standard had 
been effective from 1 January 2012. The impact has been to increase headline operating expenses in 2012 by £2.1 million, increase 
finance costs in 2012 by £2.7 million whilst reducing taxation expense by £1.4 million and increasing other comprehensive income 
in 2012 by £3.4 million.
The adoption of IFRS 13: “Fair value measurement” has introduced new disclosures, as set out in note 24.
The Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2009-2011 Cycle incorporated necessary, but non-urgent, amendments to five International 
Financial Reporting Standards. The amendments most relevant to the Group are:
IAS 1: “Presentation of financial statements” 
The amendments clarify the requirement for additional comparative information and have not had a material impact on these 
financial statements.
IAS 34: “Interim financial reporting” 
The amendments clarify the disclosure requirements for segment information and fair value of financial instruments. The interim 
financial statements as at 30 June 2013 reflected these amendments, where applicable.
The remaining three amendments in the Improvements to IFRSs 2009-2011 Cycle do not currently impact these 
financial statements.
1.2  New Standards and Interpretations adopted with no significant effect on financial statements
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had 
any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements, but may impact the accounting for future transactions 
and arrangements.

1. Corporate information continued
Early adoption of IAS 36 (amended): Impairment of assets
The amendment to IAS 36 removes a requirement to disclose the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit whether or not an 
impairment loss has been recognised in respect of that unit in the current period. The amendment instead requires the disclosure 
of the determined recoverable amount only where an impairment loss has been recognised during the reporting period. The Group 
has elected to early adopt this amendment for the current year.
IFRS 7 (amended): Disclosures – Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
1.3  New Standards and Interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations are in issue but not yet 
effective (and in some cases have not been adopted by the EU):
IAS 32 (amended): Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
IAS 27 (revised): Separate financial statements
IAS 28 (revised): Investments in associates and joint ventures
IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 (amended): Investment entities

IFRS 10: Consolidated financial statements
IFRS 11: Joint arrangements
IFRS 12: Disclosure of interest in other entities
Transition guidance (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12)
IAS 36 (amended): Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets
IAS 39 (amended): Novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting
IAS 19 (amended): Employee contributions
Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2010-12 Cycle
Annual Improvements to IFRSs: 2011-13 Cycle
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements in the period of initial application.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”). The consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the 
European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments which are recognised at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair 
value of the consideration given in exchange for assets. The principal accounting policies adopted are consistent with the prior year 
and are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of the parent undertaking and all of its subsidiary undertakings. The results 
of businesses acquired during the period are included from the effective date of acquisition and for those sold during the period 
to the effective date of disposal. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group balances and transactions, including unrealised 
profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. The interest of non-controlling 
shareholders is initially measured at the non-controlling interests proportion of the share of the fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests 
at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is 
attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained on page 47 of the Finance 
Director’s review.
98
 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Financials Business combinations and goodwill
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of acquisition is measured at the fair value 
of assets transferred, the liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange of control and equity instruments issued by the 
Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Costs directly attributable to business 
combinations are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred. 
The acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition except those where 
specific guidance is provided by IFRSs. Non-current assets and directly attributable liabilities that are classified as held for sale in 
accordance with IFRS 5: “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations”, are recognised and measured at fair value 
less costs to sell. Also, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12: “Income taxes”, 
liabilities and assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 19 (revised): 
“Employee benefits” and liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based 
payments awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2: “Share-based payment”. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over 
the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts where appropriate. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts 
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum period of one year.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree over 
the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, 
goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously 
held equity interest in the acquiree, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units acquired. Impairment is 
determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill relates. Where the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement 
and is not subsequently reversed. When there is a disposal of a cash-generating unit, goodwill relating to the operation disposed 
of is taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of that operation. The amount of goodwill allocated to a partial 
disposal is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the operation retained.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity which is not a subsidiary undertaking but the interest of the Group is that of a partner in a business 
over which the Group exercises joint control. The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method of accounting.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales related taxes. Revenue is reduced for 
estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. The nature of agreements into which the Group enters means that:
•  the contracts usually contain discrete elements, each of which transfers risks and rewards to the customer. Where such discrete 
elements are present, revenue is recognised on each element in accordance with the policy on the sale of goods. 
•  the service element of the contract is usually insignificant in relation to the total contract value and is often provided on a short-
term or one-off basis. Where this is the case, revenue is recognised when the service is complete. 
•  aftermarket activities generally relate to the provision of spare parts, repairs and the rebuild of equipment. Revenue on the 
provision of parts is recognised in accordance with the policy on the sale of goods and revenue for repairs and rebuild is 
recognised upon completion of the activity.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The significant majority of the Group’s revenue is recognised on a sale of goods basis. 
The specific methods used to recognise the different forms of revenue earned by the Group are as follows: 
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
• the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;
•  the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective 
control over the goods;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Transfers of risks and rewards vary depending on the nature of the products sold and the individual terms of the contract of sale. 
Sales made under internationally accepted trade terms are recognised as revenue when the Group has completed the primary 
duties required to transfer risks as stipulated in those terms. Sales made outside of such terms are generally recognised on delivery 
to the customer. No revenue is recognised where recovery of the consideration is not probable or there are significant uncertainties 
regarding associated costs or the possible return of goods. 
Provision of services
As noted above, because revenue from the rendering of services is usually insignificant in relation to the total contract value and is 
generally provided on a short-term or one-off basis, revenue is usually recognised when the service is complete. 
Construction contracts
As noted above, customer contracts usually contain discrete elements separately transferring risks and rewards to the customer. 
Where such discrete elements are present, revenue is recognised on each element in accordance with the policy on the sale 
of goods. 
Where such discrete elements are not in place, revenue from significant contracts is recognised in proportion to the stage of 
completion of the contract by reference to the specific contract terms and the costs incurred on the contract at the Balance Sheet 
date in comparison to the total forecast costs of the contract. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs 
incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of 
the stage of completion.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included in revenue from construction contracts when the amount 
can be measured reliably and its receipt is considered probable. Variations are included when the customer has agreed to the 
variation or acknowledged liability for the variation in principle. Claims are included when negotiations with the customer have 
reached an advanced stage such that it is probable that the customer will accept the claim. Incentive payments are included when 
a contract is sufficiently advanced that it is probable that the performance standards triggering the incentive will be achieved.
Profit attributable to contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed. Where this is not 
the case contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recovered. When it 
is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can 
be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest 
rate applicable.
Exceptional costs/income
Exceptional costs/income are those costs/income of a significant and non-recurring nature or those associated with significant 
restructuring programmes, acquisitions or disposals, which warrant separate additional disclosure in the financial statements in 
order to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after exceptional operating costs and income, intangible asset amortisation and the Group’s share of 
results of joint ventures, but before finance income and finance costs.

Financials Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets 
is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Issue costs of loans
The finance cost recognised in the Income Statement in respect of the issue costs of borrowings is allocated to periods over 
the terms of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, and any costs directly attributable to bring the asset 
into operation. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration 
given to acquire the asset. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold land  nil 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property over expected economic life not exceeding 50 years
Short leasehold property  over the term of the lease
Plant and equipment  3-12 years
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful 
lives are accounted for prospectively.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists an impairment review is performed and, 
where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to 
arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds or costs and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the Income Statement in the year 
that the item is derecognised.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
On acquisition of businesses, separately identifiable intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Access to the use of patented technology and trade names are valued using a “relief from royalty” method which determines the 
net present value of future additional cash flows arising from the use of the intangible asset.
Customer relationships are valued on the basis of the net present value of the future additional cash flows arising from customer 
relationships with appropriate allowance for attrition of customers.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the asset as follows:
Customer relationships 20 years or less
Brand names 20 years or less
Computer software 5 years or less
Development costs 5 years or less

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Computer software is initially recorded at cost. Where these assets have been acquired through a business combination, this 
will be the fair value allocated in the acquisition accounting. Where these have been acquired other than through a business 
combination, the initial cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are measured on a similar basis to property, plant and equipment. 
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to clearly defined and identifiable development projects are capitalised when there is a technical degree of 
exploitation, adequacy of resources and a potential market or development possibility in the undertaking that are recognisable; and 
where it is the intention to produce, market or execute the project. A correlation must also exist between the costs incurred and 
future benefits and those costs can be measured reliably. Capitalised costs are expensed on a straight-line basis over their useful 
lives of five years or less. Costs not meeting such criteria are expensed as incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value and measured using a first in, first out basis. Cost includes all 
direct expenditure and appropriate production overhead expenditure incurred in bringing goods to their current state under normal 
operating conditions. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less costs expected to be incurred to completion and 
disposal. Provisions are made for obsolescence or other expected losses where necessary.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables and other receivables are measured and carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. The carrying amount of other receivables is reduced by the impairment loss directly and a charge is recorded in the 
Income Statement. For trade receivables, the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. Subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account and changes in the carrying amount of the 
allowance account are recognised in the Income Statement.
Trade receivables that are assessed not to be impaired individually are also assessed for impairment on a collective basis. 
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past experience of collecting receipts, an 
increase in the number of delayed receipts in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national 
or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash in hand, current balances with banks and similar institutions and 
short-term deposits which are readily convertible to cash which are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as 
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with 
the borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the 
amortisation process.
Leases
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, 
are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments 
are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are charged directly against income. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated 
useful life of the asset or the lease term.
102
 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Financials Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The 
effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over 
the relevant periods. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments throughout the expected 
life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. The Group 
derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity 
risks, arising from operating and financing activities. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading 
purposes. Details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 24 of the financial statements.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. Their fair value is recalculated at each reporting date. 
The accounting treatment for the resulting gain or loss will depend on whether the derivative meets the criteria to qualify for 
hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on the revaluation to fair value at 
the period end are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Where derivatives do meet the criteria to qualify for hedge 
accounting, recognition of any resulting gain or loss on revaluation depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item 
being hedged.
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of less than one year from the period end date are classified as current in the 
Balance Sheet. 
Hedge accounting
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being 
hedged and the hedging instrument and to show that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness 
testing is performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedge instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations.
Fair value hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the 
fair value of a recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value 
hedges are recorded in the Income Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is 
attributable to the hedged risk. 
Cash flow hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to the variability in cash 
flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted 
cash flow. 
The effective portion of any gain or loss from revaluing the derivative financial instrument is recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the Income Statement. 
Amounts previously recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are recycled to the Income 
Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Income Statement or when the forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset 
or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial 
measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Derivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the Group’s net investment in 
foreign operations. The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from revaluing the derivative at a reporting 
period end is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the 
Income Statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recognised immediately in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is 
disposed of or when the hedge is no longer expected to occur.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash flows at a rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a finance cost.
Restructurings
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a 
valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by either starting to implement the plan or by announcing 
its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising 
from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the 
ongoing activities of the entity.
Warranties
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations under local sale of goods legislation are recognised at the date of sale of 
the relevant products, at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligation.
Onerous contracts
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is 
considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the 
contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Environmental liabilities
Liabilities for environmental costs are recognised when environmental assessments or clean-ups are probable and the associated 
costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of 
action. The amount recognised is the best estimate of the expenditure required. Where the liability will not be settled for a number 
of years, the amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the year in which the 
associated services are rendered by employees of the Group. The accounting policy for pensions and other retirement benefits is 
described below.
The Group also operates long term incentive plans (LTIPs) for Directors and certain employees. The expected settlement costs of 
these plans are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the plans.
Pensions and other retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans, some of which require contributions to be made 
to administered funds separate from the Group.
For the defined benefit pension and retirement benefit plans, plan assets are measured at fair value and plan liabilities are 
measured on an actuarial basis and discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate 
bond of equivalent currency and term to the plan liabilities. Any assets resulting from this calculation are limited to past service 
cost plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The service cost of providing pension and other retirement benefits to employees for the period is charged to the 
Income Statement.
104
 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Financials Net interest expense on net defined benefit obligations is determined by applying discount rates used to measure defined benefit 
obligations at the beginning of the year to net defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the year. Net interest expense is 
recognised within finance costs.
Remeasurement gains and losses comprise actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return 
on plan assets (excluding interest). Remeasurement gains and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognised in full in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently recycled.
Actuarial gains and losses may result from differences between the actuarial assumptions underlying the plan obligations and 
actual experience during the period; or changes in the actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the plan obligations. 
For defined contribution plans, contributions payable are charged to the Income Statement as an operating expense when 
employees have rendered services entitling them to the contributions.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial 
position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the 
presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each Balance 
Sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
Balance Sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates 
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the 
Income Statement for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are 
included in the Income Statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect 
of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or 
loss is also recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at 
the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate). Such translation differences are recognised as 
income or as expenses in the period in which the related operation is disposed of. Any exchange differences that have previously 
been attributed to non-controlling interests are derecognised but they are not reclassified to the Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the rate prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Taxation
The tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the period and represents the sum of the tax paid or currently payable and 
deferred tax.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:
• where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint 
ventures can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax 
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and 
carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
• where the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, 
deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the 
foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the relevant Balance Sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
and not in the Income Statement.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:
• where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case 
the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
• where receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in 
the Balance Sheet.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2: “Share-based payments”. The Group issues equity-settled share-based 
payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value of the equity instrument excluding 
the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-
settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based 
on the Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching 
to them and that the grants will be received.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit or loss over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned. 
Non-current assets and businesses held for sale
Non-current assets and businesses classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.
Non-current assets and businesses are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a 
sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset or business is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the 
sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as set out in note 2, management have made critical accounting judgements. These 
include the completion of the quantification of the fair value of assets and liabilities following the acquisition of Elster in 2012. In 
addition, the impairment of non-current assets, the quantification of provisions, the valuation of retirement benefit obligations 
and taxation require management judgements. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, 
106
 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Financials actual outcomes may differ from those assumptions and estimates. An analysis of the key sources of estimation uncertainty at 
the Balance Sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year is provided below.
Fair values at acquisition
As a result of the acquisition of Elster, management made judgements in the 2012 Annual Report regarding the fair value of assets 
and liabilities acquired particularly in relation to provisions and intangible assets. In 2013, in accordance with IFRS 3: “Business 
combinations”, this extensive review of assets and liabilities was completed by the half year and fair values have been restated from 
the provisional values recorded as at 31 December 2012. The measurement period is now closed. The finalised fair value of assets 
and liabilities acquired are shown in note 12.
Impairment of non-current assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might 
be impaired and at least annually. Such events and circumstances include the effects of restructuring initiated by management. 
To determine whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating 
units to which goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires management to 
estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the 
net present value. Such calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and long-term growth prevalent 
in a particular market as well as short and medium-term business plans. Management draw upon experience as well as external 
resources in making these judgements.
The carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets (including computer software and development costs) at the Balance 
Sheet date was £2,612.0 million (31 December 2012: £3,048.8 million). At 31 December 2013 and 2012, the Group recognised no 
impairment loss in respect of these assets. 
Provisions
The quantification of certain liabilities within provisions (environmental remediation obligations and future costs and settlements in 
relation to certain legal claims) have been estimated using the best information available. However, such liabilities depend on the 
actions of third parties and on the specific circumstances pertaining to each obligation, neither of which is controlled by the Group. 
Although provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted for management’s best current estimates, the judgemental nature 
of these items means that future amounts settled may be different from those provided. Further details are set out in note 20.
Retirement benefit obligations
Retirement benefits are accounted for under IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits”. For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured 
at the discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. Because of changing market and economic conditions, 
the expenses and liabilities actually arising under the plans in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis 
of these actuarial assumptions. Therefore, declining returns on equity markets and markets for fixed-income instruments could 
necessitate additional contributions to the plans in order to cover future pension obligations. Also, higher or lower withdrawal rates or 
longer or shorter life of participants may have an impact on the amount of pension income or expense recorded in the future.
The discount rate used to discount retirement benefit obligations to present value is derived from the yields of senior, high-quality 
corporate bonds at the Balance Sheet date. These generally include AA-rated securities. The discount rate is based on the market 
yield of a portfolio of bonds whose weighted residual maturities approximately correspond to the duration necessary to cover the 
entire benefit obligation.
Pension and other retirement benefits are inherently long-term and future experience may differ from the actuarial assumptions 
used to determine the net charge for retirement benefit obligations. Note 23 to these consolidated financial statements describes 
the principal discount rate, earnings increase and pension retirement benefit obligation assumptions that have been used to 
determine the net charge for retirement benefit obligations in accordance with IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits”. The calculation 
of any charge relating to retirement benefit obligations is clearly dependent on the assumptions used, which reflects the exercise of 
judgement. The assumptions adopted are based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries.
At 31 December 2013, the Group’s retirement benefit obligation deficit was £219.3 million (31 December 2012: £261.3 million). 
Taxation
The Group is subject to income tax in most of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Management is required to exercise judgement 
in determining the Group’s provision for income taxes. Management’s judgement is required in estimating tax provisions where 
additional current tax may become payable in the future following the audit by the tax authorities of previously filed tax returns. 
Management’s judgement is also required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of 
future taxable profits. While the Group aims to ensure that the estimates recorded are accurate, the actual amounts could be 
different from those expected.

5. Segment information
Segment information is presented in accordance with IFRS 8: “Operating segments” which requires operating segments to be 
identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reported to the Group’s Board in order 
to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance. The Group’s reportable operating segments under IFRS 8 are 
categorised as follows:
FKI segments
• Energy
• Lifting
Elster segments
• Gas
• Electricity
• Water
• Elster central 
The Energy segment consists of the Brush business, a specialist supplier of energy industrial products to the global market. 
The Lifting segment consists of the Bridon business, serving oil & gas production, mining, petrochemical, alternative energy 
and general construction markets. Elster comprises the Gas, Electricity and Water segments along with their associated central 
costs. These businesses serve residential and industrial metering and utilisation markets whilst providing related communications, 
networking and software solutions.
There are two central cost centres which are also separately reported to the Board:
• Central – corporate
• Central – LTIPs
(1)

 Long Term Incentive Plans.
The Central corporate cost centre contains the Melrose Group head office costs. The Central LTIPs cost centre contains the costs 
associated with the new five year Melrose Incentive Plan (granted on 11 April 2012), the previous Melrose Incentive Plan which 
crystallised on 22 March 2012 and the divisional management LTIPs that are in operation across the Group.
Following the disposal of Truth and Harris, the Other Industrial segment has ceased to exist and the results of these businesses 
have been included within discontinued operations.
The discontinued segment comprises Truth, Marelli, Crosby, Acco and Harris in both years. The discontinued segment in 2012 also 
contains the MPC business.

Following the successful resolution of certain warranty and legal issues in the second half of the year, and therefore outside of 
the fair value window, £28.9 million of provisions, inherited with the acquisition of Elster, have been released during the year as 
exceptional income.
During 2012, a number of amendments were made to Elster retirement medical benefits and retirement life insurance benefits in the 
US. These removed £7.0 million of liabilities resulting in a curtailment gain on these plans.

The reconciliation has been performed at a blended Group tax rate of 29.89% (2012: 28.33%) which represents the weighted 
average of the tax rates applying to taxable profits in the jurisdictions in which those profits arose. 
In addition to the amount charged to the Income Statement, a tax credit of £nil (2012: £1.3 million) has been recognised directly 
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. This represents a tax charge of £0.6 million (2012: £3.5 million credit) 
in respect of retirement benefit obligations, a tax credit of £0.6 million (2012: £1.6 million charge) in respect of movements on 
cash flow hedges and a tax charge of £nil (2012: £0.6 million) in respect of the use of losses on items taken directly to reserves in 
prior years.

Disposal of businesses
On 22 November 2013, the Group completed the disposal of Crosby and Acco, two businesses acquired as part of the FKI 
acquisition in 2008, for gross cash consideration of US $1,016.9 million (£632.6 million). The costs charged during the year 
associated with the disposal were £13.0 million. The profit on disposal in the year was £256.6 million after the recycling of 
cumulative translation differences of £6.6 million. The Crosby and Acco businesses were previously classified within the Lifting 
segment and are now shown within discontinued operations.
On 1 August 2013, the Group completed the disposal of Marelli (also acquired as part of FKI), for cash consideration of 
€207.2 million (£177.1 million). The costs charged during the year associated with the disposal were £7.3 million. The profit on 
disposal in the year was £70.4 million after the recycling of cumulative translation differences of £3.5 million. The Marelli business 
was previously classified within the Energy segment and is now shown within discontinued operations.
During the year, the Group also disposed of two other businesses; namely Truth disposed on 3 July 2013 and Harris disposed on 
31 December 2013, both previously shown within the Other Industrial segment. The combined cash consideration received for 
these businesses was US $215.4 million (£140.7 million) and the costs incurred were £4.7 million. The combined profit on disposal 
of these businesses was £73.7 million after the recycling of cumulative translation differences of £2.0 million.
During the year, up until the date of disposal, these businesses contributed £392.8 million of revenue and £79.5 million of headline 
operating profit.

Restated to reflect the completion of the acquisition accounting for Elster.
Included within customer relationships is an element in relation to the Gas segment which has a carrying amount as at 
31 December 2013 of £647.5 million (2012: £679.0 million) and a remaining amortisation period of 18 years and 8 months.
The goodwill generated as a result of acquisitions represents the premium paid in excess of the fair value of all assets, including 
intangible assets, identified at the point of acquisition and in the subsequent review period. This premium reflects the Directors’ 
view, at the date of acquisition and before any turnaround processes have been applied, of the future growth potential of the 
businesses acquired at that date. 
Furthermore, value is added to the businesses acquired through future improvements that are applied, achieved through a 
combination of revised strategic direction, operational improvements and investment. This is expected to result in improved 
profitability and cash flows of the acquired businesses during the period of ownership and is also expected to result in enhanced 
disposal proceeds when the acquired businesses are ultimately disposed. The combined value achieved from these improvements 
is expected to result in the businesses being valued in excess of the fair value of all assets and goodwill acquired.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Value 
in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to each group of cash-generating units 
(CGUs) and use the latest approved forecasts extrapolated to perpetuity using growth rates shown below, which do not exceed 
the long-term growth rate for the relevant market. No impairment was identified. The basis of these impairment tests and the key 
assumptions are set out in the table below:

(1) Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate specific to each CGU. Discount rates reflect the current market 
assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital of each CGU. In determining the cost 
of equity, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) has been used. Under CAPM, the cost of equity is determined by adding a 
risk premium to the risk free rate to reflect the additional risk associated with investing outside of lending to a country (e.g. the 
purchase of UK Gilts). The premium is based on an industry adjustment (‘Beta’) to the expected return of the equity market above 
the risk free return. The relative risk adjustment reflects the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors and geographies 
on average.

(2) Assumptions applied in financial forecasts
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from financial budgets and mid-term plans approved by management. The key 
assumptions used in forecasting pre-tax cash flows relate to future budgeted revenue and operating margins likely to be achieved 
and the likely rates of long-term growth by market sector. Underlying factors in determining the values assigned to each key 
assumption by CGU are shown below:
Revenue growth:
Revenue growth assumptions in the forecast period are based on financial budgets and mid-term plans approved by management, 
taking into account industry growth rates and management of each division’s historical experience in the context of wider industry 
and economic conditions. Projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories. They incorporate past 
performance, historical growth rates, projections of developments in key markets, secured orders and orders likely to be achieved 
in the short to medium-term, given trends in the relevant market sector.
FKI
Bridon designs and manufactures lifting and stabilising solutions for applications in wire rope, fibre rope, steel wire and strand. 
The business services global customers in the oil & gas, mining, industrial, marine and infrastructure sectors. The key drivers for 
revenues are i) oil & gas drilling and rig count which in turn is dependent upon oil & natural gas prices and storage levels ii) global 
mining activity, both operating and capital expenditures from mining companies which in turn is dependent upon demand for coal 
and metals iii) commercial construction iv) trade through seaports and demand from crane OEMs. Independent forecasts of growth 
in these served end markets have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. 
Brush is a supplier of turbogenerators for the power generation, industrial, oil & gas and offshore sectors and a leading supplier 
of switchgear, transformers and other power infrastructure equipment. The key drivers for revenues are i) original equipment 
investments in the global power market, both new capacity (mainly emerging markets) and replacement capacity (mainly in mature 
markets) ii) growth in service requirements of a growing installed base iii) new product introduction. Independent forecasts of 
growth in these power generation markets have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. 
Elster
Elster Gas designs and manufactures gas measurement, process heat control and gas safety control equipment. The key drivers 
for growth are i) global energy consumption and the growing share for natural gas ii) international legislation aimed at driving 
down emission levels and increasing efficiency which in turn stimulates demand for Smart meters and process heat applications. 
Independent forecasts of the growth in these end markets have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions as well as 
management’s best estimates of the impact of residential Smart meter rollouts in the EU.
Elster Electricity is an international metering solution provider supplying both traditional and Smart meter equipment, including 
applications for residential, commercial, industrial, transmission and distribution markets. The key drivers for revenues are i) global 
demand for electricity metering requirements, both traditional and Smart ii) market developments in meter data software solutions. 
Independent forecasts of the growth in the meter hardware and related meter software end markets have been used to derive 
revenue growth assumptions as well as management’s best estimates of the impact of residential Smart meter rollouts in the EU.
Elster Water designs and manufactures a comprehensive range of water metering solutions. The key driver for revenue growth is 
the global demand for water meters, both traditional and Smart. Revenue growth assumptions have been built up with reference to 
past performance, historical growth rates and projections of developments in key markets.
Operating margins:
Operating margins have been forecast based on historical levels considering the likely impact of changing economic environments 
and competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues and the impact of management actions on costs. Projected margins reflect 
the impact of all initiated projects to improve operational efficiency and leverage scale. The projections do not include the impact 
of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed. Forecasts for other overhead costs are based on inflation 
forecasts and supply and demand factors.
(3) Long-term growth rates
Long-term growth rates are based on long-term economic forecasts for growth in the manufacturing sector in the geography in 
which the CGU operates. Long-term growth rates are determined using a blend of publicly available historical data and a long-term 
growth rate forecast published by external analysts and further take into account the international presence and the markets in 
which each business operates.

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Financials Sensitivity analysis
A reasonable possible change in the assumptions applied would not result in any impairment. Base case forecasts show significant 
headroom above the carrying value for each group of CGUs. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each group of CGUs 
to assess the impact of any reasonable possible change in key assumptions. There is no reasonable possible change that would 
cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.
Acquisition of subsidiaries
During the year the non-controlling interest of a Gas subsidiary business was acquired for total consideration of £9.8 million.
In line with the Group’s strategy to acquire good manufacturing businesses with potential for improvements, on 23 August 2012 
the Group acquired 99.35% of the issued share capital and obtained control of Elster Group S.E. for cash consideration of 
£1,469.8 million. Subsequently a further 0.45% of the remaining 0.65% share capital was purchased on various dates in 2012 for 
total consideration of £6.4 million. The final 0.20% share capital was purchased during 2013 for total consideration of £3.0 million.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition of Elster were 
set out in the 2012 Annual Report. During the year, the Group has completed its review of the assets and liabilities acquired. As a 
result the Group recorded its final adjustments to the opening balance sheet of Elster at the half year. In accordance with IFRS 3: 
“Business combinations” the Balance Sheet at 31 December 2012 has been restated to reflect this. These adjustments increased 
provisions by £32.9 million, deferred tax assets by £5.2 million, other payables by £0.9 million and reduced inventory and property, 
plant and equipment by £0.6 million and £0.1 million respectively. The corresponding adjustment is to increase goodwill by 
£29.3 million. The measurement period was closed at 30 June 2013.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers and because they are unrelated to each other. 
Credit control procedures are implemented to ensure that sales are only made to organisations that are willing and able to pay for 
them. Such procedures include the establishment and review of customer credit limits and terms. The Group does not hold any 
collateral or any other credit enhancements over any of its trade receivables nor does it have a legal right of offset against any 
amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty.

As at 1 January 2013, the Group held a five year multi-currency facility split between a £0.5 billion term loan and a £1.0 billion 
revolving credit facility. These facilities are due to mature on 29 June 2017. 
As at 1 January 2013, the term loan was split into two tranches of £180 million and US $500 million. During the year, following the 
receipt of business disposal proceeds, US $210 million was repaid and cancelled against the US Dollar denominated term loan. 
At 31 December 2013, the £180 million and the remaining US $290 million term loan tranches remain drawn down. 
The Sterling denominated term loan is subject to mandatory repayments of 5% on June 2015, June 2016 and 31 December 2016, 
adjusted for any term loan repayments made prior to these dates. Following the repayments made against the US Dollar 
denominated tranche in the year no further mandatory repayments are due in respect of the US Dollar denominated term loan 
before 29 June 2017.
As at 1 January 2013, the revolving credit facility was split between a £760 million Sterling denominated multi-currency facility and 
a €300 million Euro denominated facility. These were both partially drawn at 1 January 2013. During the year, £18.5 million of the 
Sterling denominated facility was repaid and cancelled. The remaining revolving credit facilities of £741.5 million and €300 million 
were repaid, but not cancelled, during the year following the receipt of business disposals. There were no drawdowns against 
these facilities at 31 December 2013.
Throughout the year, the Group remained compliant with all covenants under the facilities disclosed above. A number of companies 
continue to be guarantors under the bank facilities. In addition, until Elster Group S.E. becomes converted into a German limited 
liability company, a pledge has been given over the shares of Elster Group S.E..
Drawdowns under the existing facility bear interest at interbank rates of interest plus a margin determined by reference to the 
Group’s performance under its debt cover covenant ratio and which ranges between 1.40% and 2.65%. The margin as at 
31 December 2013 was 2.25% (31 December 2012: 2.00%).

Financials Maturity of financial liabilities
The maturity profile of anticipated future cash flows including interest in relation to the Group’s financial liabilities, on an 
undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value is shown in the table below. Interest 
on floating rate debt is based on the relevant LIBOR curve for US Dollar and Sterling balances and the EURIBOR curve for Euro 
balances. Interest on hedging interest rate swaps is based on the relevant forward LIBOR curves for US Dollar and Sterling 
amounts and EURIBOR curve for Euro amounts and is illustrated as a net cash flow.

 As defined on the Income Statement.
The provision for surplus leasehold property costs represents the estimated net payments payable over the term of these leases 
together with any dilapidation costs. This is expected to result in cash expenditure over the next one to five years.
Environmental and legal costs provisions relate to the estimated remediation costs of pollution, soil and groundwater contamination 
at certain sites and estimated future costs and settlements in relation to legal claims. Due to their nature, it is not possible to 
predict precisely when these provisions will be utilised. 
Incentive plan related provisions are in respect of long term incentive plans for divisional senior management, expected to result in 
cash expenditure in the next four years.
The provision for warranty related costs represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligations. 
Warranty terms are, on average, between one and five years.
Other provisions relate primarily to costs that will be incurred in respect of restructuring programmes, usually resulting in cash 
spend within one year.
Where appropriate, provisions have been discounted using a discount rate of 3% (31 December 2012: 3%).

 Restated to reflect the completion of the acquisition accounting for Elster (note 12) and for the adoption of IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits” (note 1).
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had gross unused losses of £217.1 million (31 December 2012: £250.6 million) available for 
offset against future profits. At 31 December 2013, a £9.7 million deferred tax asset (31 December 2012: £9.1 million) in respect 
of £42.0 million (31 December 2012: £35.5 million) of these gross losses were recognised in the Balance Sheet. No asset was 
recognised in respect of the remaining losses due to the divisional and geographic split of anticipated future profit streams and 
the effect of possible disposals in future years. The majority of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely subject to certain 
continuity of business requirements. 
A deferred tax asset of £25.6 million (31 December 2012: £37.8 million) was recognised on Group retirement benefit obligations, 
being the extent to which they are expected to generate tax deductions against foreseeable taxable profits. 
The remaining asset of £35.0 million (31 December 2012: £103.4 million) relates to other temporary differences. 
As at 31 December 2013, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for 
which deferred tax liabilities had not been recognised was £3.3 million (31 December 2012: £6.6 million). No liability was recognised 
in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences 
and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
22. Share-based payments
Melrose Incentive Plans
The Company has 50,000 options (31 December 2012: 50,000 options) in issue which enable the holder of these options to 
subscribe for 2012 Incentive Shares. These options are held by Directors and senior employees. Further details of the 2012 Melrose 
Incentive Plan are provided in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 70 to 84.
The estimated value of the 2012 Incentive Shares at 31 December 2013 was £73.0 million (31 December 2012: £8.6 million). Using 
a Black Scholes option pricing model, the estimated fair value attributable to this plan in over three years time, at 31 May 2017, will 
be £101.7 million (31 December 2012: £60.2 million). 
The inputs into the Black Scholes model that were used to fair value the plan when it was originally established in 2012 were as follows:
Valuation 
assumptions
Weighted average share price £2.27
Weighted average exercise price £2.85
Expected volatility 30.0%
Expected life as at inception 5.0 yrs
Risk free interest 1.0%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price. 
The Group recognised an IFRS 2 charge of £4.0 million (2012: £3.5 million, of which £0.8 million related to the previous Melrose 
Incentive Plan) in the year ended 31 December 2013 in relation to the equity settled 2012 Melrose Incentive Plan.

Financials 23. Retirement benefit obligations
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution plans for qualifying employees across several jurisdictions. The assets of the plans are 
held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
The total costs charged in relation to the continuing businesses during the year of £12.2 million (2012: £9.9 million) represents 
contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit plans
The Group sponsors defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of certain subsidiaries. The funded defined benefit plans are 
administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group. The trustees of the funds are required by law to act 
in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the plans. The trustees of the pension funds are responsible for the 
investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.
During July 2013, the most significant defined benefit plan in the Group, being the FKI UK Pension Plan, was demerged into three 
separate independent plans. Two new plans, namely the Bridon Group (2013) Pension Plan and the Brush Group (2013) Pension 
Plan, were established. Throughout this note these three plans are collectively referred to as the FKI UK Pension Plans.
The most significant defined benefit pension plans are:
• The FKI UK Pension Plans which are defined benefit in type and are funded plans. The plans are closed to new members 
and the accrual of future benefits for existing members. 
• The McKechnie UK Pension Plan which is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan (other than £4.0 million of unfunded 
liabilities). The plan is closed to new members and the accrual of future benefits for existing members.
• The FKI US Pension Plan which is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan. The plan is closed to new members and the 
accrual of future benefits for existing members.
Other plans include a number of funded and unfunded defined benefit arrangements across Europe, North America and the rest 
of the world. The Group also operates unfunded retiree medical and welfare benefit plans, principally in the US. 
The cost of the Group’s defined benefit plans is determined in accordance with IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits” with the 
advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit 
method. In line with normal practice, these valuations are undertaken triennially in the UK and annually in the US.
Valuations of the FKI UK Pension Plans are based on full actuarial valuations as of 31 March 2013 and updated at 
31 December 2013 by independent actuaries. The McKechnie UK Pension Plan valuation is based on a full valuation at 
31 December 2011 updated at 31 December 2013 by independent actuaries. The FKI US Pension Plan valuation is based  
on the US full actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2012, updated at 31 December 2013 by independent actuaries. 
The Group contributed £20.0 million (2012: £18.5 million) to the FKI UK Pension Plans and £5.2 million (2012: £4.6 million) to the 
McKechnie UK Pension Plan in the year ended 31 December 2013. Similar contributions will be made to these plans in 2014.
In total, the Group expects to contribute approximately £33.4 million to its defined benefit plans in the year ended 31 December 2014.
In the year, the Group has adopted IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits” and restated prior year pension numbers as if the new 
standard had been effective from 1 January 2012. The impact of this new standard is disclosed in note 1.

Mortality
FKI UK Pension Plans 
Mortality assumptions for the most significant plans in the Group, the FKI UK Plans, as at 31 December 2013 are based on the 
Self Administered Pension Scheme (“SAPS”) “S1” base tables with scaling factors of 110% and 105% for deferred members and 
pensioners respectively, which reflect the results of a mortality analysis carried out on the plan’s membership. Future improvements 
are in line with the Continuous Mortality Investigation (“CMI”) improvement model with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% 
p.a. for both males and females. 
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 21.9 years (31 December 2012: 22.1 years) 
if they are male and for a further 24.1 years (31 December 2012: 24.2 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2033 
at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live for a further 23.3 years (31 December 2012: 23.5 years) after retirement if they are 
male and for a further 25.6 years (31 December 2012: 25.8 years) after retirement if they are female.
The mortality assumptions are in line with those adopted for the full valuation as at 31 March 2013.
Other plans
The mortality assumptions adopted as at 31 December 2013 have been set to reflect the Group’s best estimate view of life 
expectancies of members of each individual pension arrangement. These mortality assumptions vary by arrangement, each 
assumption reflecting the characteristics of the membership of that arrangement.

The assets are well diversified and the majority of plan assets have quoted prices in active markets. All government bonds are 
issued by reputable governments and are generally AA rated or higher. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to 
complement the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings for liability risk management.
The Trustees continually review whether the chosen investment strategy is appropriate with a view to providing the pension benefits 
and to ensure appropriate matching of risk and return profiles. The main strategic policies include maintaining an appropriate asset 
mix, managing interest rate sensitivity and maintaining an appropriate equity buffer. Investment results are regularly reviewed.
There is no self investment (other than in relevant tracker funds) either in the Group’s own financial instruments or property or other 
assets used by the Group.

Financials Risks and sensitivities 
The defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, salary risk, interest rate risk and 
market (investment) risk. The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or plan specific risks.
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure the plan liabilities at the year end is as follows:
Change in
assumption
Decrease/
(increase) to
plan liabilities
£m
Increase/
(decrease) to 
profit before tax
£m
Discount rate Increase by 0.10% 18.5 0.6 
Decrease by 0.10% (18.8) (0.6)
RPI inflation assumption

Assumed life expectancy at age 65 (rate of mortality) Increase by 1 year (34.5) n/a
Decrease by 1 year 33.6 n/a
(1) 
The RPI inflation sensitivity encompasses the impact on pension increases, where applicable.
The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on reasonable possible changes to the respective assumptions, 
while holding all other assumptions constant. There has been no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the 
sensitivity analysis from prior years.
The sensitivities are based on the relevant assumptions and membership profile as at 31 December 2013 and are applied to 
the obligations at the end of the reporting period. Whilst the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows 
expected, it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity of the assumptions shown. Extrapolation of these results beyond the 
sensitivity figures shown may not be appropriate and the sensitivity analysis presented may not be representative of the actual 
change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as 
some of the assumptions may be correlated.

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and derivative financial assets which 
represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial assets is limited because the counter-parties are 
banks with strong credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to 
its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, 
estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. 
Note 16 provides further details regarding the recovery of trade receivables.
Capital risk
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the Group’s net debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, after deducting cash 
and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising Issued share capital, Reserves and 
Retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy for managing liquidity rate risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review.
Fair values
The Directors consider that the financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values.

Hedge of net investments in foreign entities
At 31 December 2013 the Group held the following amounts which were designated as hedges of net investments in the Group’s 
subsidiaries in the USA and were being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risks. At 31 December 2013 there were 
no borrowings in Euros due to the disposal proceeds received in the year which were used to temporarily pay down debt prior to 
the return of capital in February 2014.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
A one percentage point rise in market interest rates for all currencies would increase/(decrease) profit before tax by the following 
amounts assuming the net debt as at the Balance Sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. At 31 December 2013 the Group 
temporarily held excess Sterling and Euro interest rate swaps as a result of paying down all of the debt relating to the revolving 
credit facilities with the proceeds received from the disposals that occurred in the year. This position was reversed following the 
return of capital on 28 February 2014. Adjusting for this excess position, the sensitivity for Sterling would decrease profit after tax 
by £0.1 million and by £0.2 million for Euros.

Interest rate risk management
The Group’s policy for managing interest rate risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review.
The Group entered 2013 protecting 79% of its gross debt from exposure to changes in interest rates by holding a number of 
interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate cost on US $560.0 million, £336.8 million and €292.0 million of debt. 
During the year the Group closed out several interest rate swap arrangements as a result of the reduction in gross debt following 
the receipt of proceeds from the business disposals. As at 31 December 2013 swap arrangements exist which will fix the finance 
cost on US $246.8 million, £336.8 million and €200.0 million.
Following the capital return on 28 February 2014, 78% of the Group’s gross debt is now fixed and the weighted blended fixed 
finance cost is 0.70% (31 December 2012: 0.84%) on US Dollar swaps, 0.72% (31 December 2012: 0.78%) on Euro swaps and 
0.91% (31 December 2012: 0.91%) on Sterling swaps, plus the bank margin which is 2.25%.
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and were highly effective throughout 2013. The fair value of the 
contracts at 31 December 2013 was a net asset of £5.6 million (31 December 2012: net liability of £8.1 million).
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s policy for managing foreign currency risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review on page 46. 
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
Currency risks are defined by IFRS 7: “Financial instruments: Disclosures” as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a 
financial asset or liability will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The following table details the transactional impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and 
liabilities at the Balance Sheet date, illustrating the (decrease)/increase in Group operating profit caused by a 10 cent strengthening 
of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Czech Koruna against Sterling compared to the year 
end spot rate. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. 
The Group operates in a range of different currencies, and those with a material impact are noted here:

Financials The following table details the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities at the 
Balance Sheet date, illustrating the increase/(decrease) in Group equity caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and 
Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Czech Koruna against Sterling. The analysis assumes that all other variables, 
in particular other foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The high sensitivity in relation to the Euro is because of a 
currency swap for €235.0 million that was put in place ahead of the year end to temporarily repay Euro debt using a proportion 
of the disposal proceeds received in the year. The Euro debt was redrawn ahead of the return of capital on 28 February 2014. 
Adjusting for the currency swap, the sensitivity on the Euro is £3.0 million. The Group operates in a range of different currencies, 
and those with a material impact are noted here:

Euro 20.8 1.7
Czech Koruna (0.1) –
In addition, the change in equity due to a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling for the translation 
of net investment hedging instruments would be a decrease of £9.3 million (31 December 2012: £20.2 million) and £nil 
(31 December 2012: £24.9 million) respectively. However, there would be no overall effect on equity because there would  
be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation.
Fair value measurements recognised in the Balance Sheet 
The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and 
yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined using yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.

The fair value of these financial instruments are derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset  
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) and they are therefore categorised within Level 2 of  
the fair value hierarchy set out in IFRS 13: “Fair value measurement”. The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and out  
of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer to occur. 
There have been no transfers between levels in the year.

29. Post Balance Sheet events
At a General Meeting of the Company held on 7 February 2014, shareholders approved a return of capital of 47 pence per 
Ordinary Share totalling £595.3 million.
‘B’ and ‘C’ shares with a total value of £595.3 million have been created resulting in a corresponding reduction in the merger 
reserve. As the capital return payments are made, either on 28 February 2014, 7 May 2014 or a combination of both, depending 
upon elections made by shareholders, the ‘B’ and ‘C’ shares will be redeemed and £595.3 million will be transferred to the capital 
redemption reserve.
As a result of the approval of the capital return, on 10 February 2014 the number of Ordinary Shares in issue was consolidated 
in a ratio of 11 for 13 in order to maintain comparability of the Company’s share price before and after the capital return. 
On 10 February 2014 the number of Ordinary Shares in issue became 1,071,761,339, each with a nominal value of 13/110 pence.
 
Further details of the capital return are provided on pages 58 and 59 in the Directors’ report.
30. Contingent liabilities
As a result of the acquisitions of the FKI and Elster businesses, certain contingent legal, environmental, warranty and tax liabilities 
were identified either at the time of acquisition or as part of the completion of the acquisition accounting. Whilst it is difficult to 
reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of these claims, the Directors’ best estimate has been included in the Balance Sheet 
when they existed at the time of acquisition and hence were recognised in accordance with IFRS 3: “Business combinations”. 
Where a provision has been recognised, information regarding the different categories of such liabilities and the amount and timing 
of outflows is included within note 20.
The Group has contingent liabilities representing guarantees and contract bonds given in the ordinary course of business on 
behalf of trading subsidiaries. No losses are anticipated to arise on these contingent liabilities. The Group does not have any other 
significant contingent liabilities.

Financials
Strategic Report Governance Financials Shareholder information 1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of Melrose Industries PLC (“the Company”) are presented as required by the Companies Act 
2006. They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”) and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and 
preceding period. 
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ statement of going concern on page 
47 of the Finance Director’s review.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration, including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is 
measured at the fair value of the consideration paid. Any premium is ignored.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20: “Share-based payment”. The Company issues equity-settled share-based 
payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-
market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the shares that will 
eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based 
on the Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Where equity-settled share-based payments are made available to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries, these are treated as 
increases in equity over the vesting period of the award with a corresponding increase in the Company’s investment in subsidiaries.
Cash Flow Statement
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a Cash Flow Statement under the terms of FRS 1 (revised): 
“Cash flow statements” because it prepares a consolidated Cash Flow Statement which is shown on page 94 of the Group 
financial statements.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred 
at the Balance Sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in 
the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which 
they are recognised in the financial statements.
2. Profit for the period
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own Profit and Loss Account 
for the year. Melrose Industries PLC reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2013 of £5.1 million (period ended 
31 December 2012: £0.6 million).
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services to the Company is disclosed in note 7 to the Group consolidated financial statements.

Explanatory notes to the proposed resolutions
Resolutions 1 to 15 (inclusive) are proposed as ordinary 
resolutions, which means that for each of those resolutions to  
be passed, more than half the votes cast must be cast in favour 
of the resolution. Resolutions 16 to 18 (inclusive) are proposed  
as special resolutions, which means that for each of those 
resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes  
cast must be cast in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 1 – Receipt of 2013 Annual Report and  
financial statements
The Directors are required to lay the Company’s financial 
statements and the Directors’ and auditor’s reports on those 
financial statements (collectively, the “Annual Report”) before 
shareholders each year at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). 
Resolutions 2 and 3 – Approval of Directors’ remuneration 
report and Directors’ remuneration policy
Following changes to the Act and in line with new regulations 
which came into effect on 1 October 2013, the Directors’ 
remuneration report (the “Directors’ Remuneration Report”) is 
now presented in three sections:
• the annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee; 
• the annual report on remuneration; and
• the Directors’ remuneration policy.
The annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, set out on pages 70 and 71 of the 2013 Annual 
Report, summarises, for the year ended 31 December 2013, 
the major decisions taken on Directors’ remuneration, any 
substantial changes relating to Directors’ remuneration made 
during the year and the context in which those changes 
occurred and decisions that have been taken.
The annual report on remuneration, set out on pages 72 to 77 
of the 2013 Annual Report, provides details of the remuneration 
paid to Directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 
2013, including base salary, taxable benefits, short-term 
incentives (including percentage deferred), long-term incentives 
vested in the year, pension-related benefits, any other items in 
the nature of remuneration and any sum(s) recovered or withheld 
during the year in respect of amounts paid in earlier years. 
The Directors’ remuneration policy, set out on pages 77 to 84 
of the 2013 Annual Report, provides details of the Company’s 
proposed policy on Directors’ remuneration (including the 
proposed policy on payments for loss of office). 
The Directors’ Remuneration Report (other than the part 
containing the Directors’ remuneration policy) is subject to  
an annual advisory shareholder vote by way of an ordinary 
resolution; Resolution 2 is to approve the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (other than the part containing  
the Directors’ remuneration policy).
The Directors’ remuneration policy is subject to a binding 
shareholder vote by way of an ordinary resolution, at least  
once every three years; Resolution 3 is to approve the Directors’ 
remuneration policy. The Directors’ remuneration policy will, 
subject to shareholder approval, take effect from the conclusion 
of the AGM. Payments (including payments for loss of office) 
will continue to be made to the current and any former Directors 
in line with existing contractual arrangements until this time.
Once the Directors’ remuneration policy takes effect, all 
remuneration payments and payments for loss of office made by 
the Company to the current and any former Directors must be 
consistent with the Directors’ remuneration policy or, if inconsistent 
with the Directors’ remuneration policy, must have been separately 
approved by way of an ordinary resolution of the shareholders in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act.
If the Directors’ remuneration policy is approved and remains 
unchanged, it will be valid for up to three years without a new 
shareholder approval. If the Company wishes to change the 
Directors’ remuneration policy, it must first seek the approval 
of the proposed revised Directors’ remuneration policy from 
the shareholders before it can implement the proposed new 
Directors’ remuneration policy.
If the Directors’ remuneration policy is not approved for any 
reason, the Company will, if and to the extent permitted by the 
Act, continue to make payments (including payments for loss  
of office) to the current and any former Directors in accordance 
with existing contractual arrangements and will seek the approval 
of a proposed revised Directors’ remuneration policy from the 
shareholders as soon as practicable.
Resolution 4 – Declaration of final dividend
The Board is recommending, and the shareholders are being 
asked to approve, the declaration of a final dividend of 5.0 pence 
per Ordinary Share for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
The final dividend will, subject to shareholder approval, be paid 
on 15 May 2014 to the holders of Ordinary Shares whose names 
are recorded on the register of members of the Company at the 
close of business on 22 April 2014. 
Resolutions 5 to 11 (inclusive) – Re-election of Directors 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
“Code”) and the Company’s articles of association (the “Articles”), 
every Director (other than Senior non-executive Director, 
Miles Templeman, who will retire at the conclusion of the AGM 
and will not stand for re-election and Liz Hewitt, who is standing 
for election) will stand for re-election at the AGM. Biographical 
details of each Director can be found on pages 56 and 57 of the 
2013 Annual Report. All of the non-executive Directors standing 
for re-election are considered independent under the Code.

 Melrose Industries PLC 
Annual Report 2013
Shareholder information Resolution 12 – Election of a Director
In accordance with the Articles, Liz Hewitt is standing for 
election as a Director of the Company following her appointment 
to the Board on 8 October 2013. She is currently a non-executive 
Director of Novo Nordisk A/S and Synergy Health plc and is 
an external member of the House of Lords Audit Committee. 
Biographical details for Liz Hewitt can be found on page 57 of 
the 2013 Annual Report. 
Resolution 13 – Re-appointment of auditor
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general 
meeting at which accounts are laid before shareholders, to hold 
office until the next such meeting. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness, 
performance, independence and objectivity of the existing 
external auditor, Deloitte LLP, on behalf of the Board, and 
concluded that the external auditor was in all respects effective.
This resolution proposes the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP until 
the conclusion of the next AGM.
Resolution 14 – Authority to agree auditor’s remuneration
This resolution authorises the Directors, in accordance with 
standard practice, to negotiate and agree the remuneration of 
the auditor. In practice, the Audit Committee will consider and 
approve the remuneration of the auditor on behalf of the Board.
Resolution 15 – Authority to allot shares
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to grant the Directors 
the authority to allot shares in the Company, or to grant rights to 
subscribe for or convert any securities into shares in the 
Company (“Rights”) pursuant to section 551 of the Act (the 
“Section 551 authority”). The authority contained in paragraph (A) 
of the resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £422,209, being approximately one-third of the Company’s 
issued Ordinary Share capital as at 4 April 2014. 
In line with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers, 
paragraph (B) of this resolution would give the Directors authority 
to allot shares in the Company or grant Rights in connection with 
a rights issue up to aggregate nominal amount of £844,418, 
representing approximately two-thirds of the Company’s issued 
Ordinary Share capital as at 4 April 2014, as reduced by the 
aggregate nominal amount of any allotments or grants under 
paragraph (A) of this resolution.
The Company does not hold any shares in treasury.
If approved, the Section 551 authority shall, unless renewed, 
revoked or varied by the Company, expire at the end of the 
Company’s next AGM after the resolution is passed or, if earlier, 
at the close of business on 30 June 2015. The exception to this is 
that the Directors may allot shares or grant Rights after the 
authority has expired in connection with an offer or agreement 
made or entered into before the authority expired. The Directors 
have no present intention to exercise the Section 551 authority.
Resolution 16 – Partial disapplication of pre-emption rights
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to grant the Directors 
the power to allot equity securities of the Company pursuant to 
sections 570 and 573 of the Act (the “Section 570 and 573 
power”) without first offering them to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their existing shareholdings.
The power is limited to allotments for cash in connection  
with pre-emptive offers, subject to any arrangements that  
the Directors consider appropriate to deal with fractions and 
overseas requirements and otherwise for cash up to a maximum 
nominal value of £63,331, representing approximately 5% of the 
Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital as at 4 April 2014, 
which is in accordance with the relevant guidelines for 
the Company.
If approved, the Section 570 and 573 power shall apply until the 
end of the Company’s next AGM after the resolution is passed  
or, if earlier, until the close of business on 30 June 2015. The 
exception to this is that the Directors may allot equity securities 
after the power has expired in connection with an offer or 
agreement made or entered into before the power expired.  
The Directors have no present intention to exercise the  
Section 570 and 573 power.
Resolution 17 – Authority to purchase own shares
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to grant the Company 
the authority to purchase its own shares pursuant to sections 
693 and 701 of the Act. 
This authority is limited to an aggregate maximum number of 
107,176,133 Ordinary Shares, representing 10% of the Company’s 
issued Ordinary Share capital as at 4 April 2014. 
The maximum price which may be paid for an Ordinary Share will 
be an amount which is not more than the higher of (i) 5% above 
the average of the middle market quotation for an Ordinary Share 
as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock 
Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the 
day on which the Ordinary Share is purchased; and (ii) the higher 
of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current 
independent bid on the trading venue where the purchase is 
carried out (in each case, exclusive of expenses). 
If approved, the authority shall, unless varied, revoked or renewed, 
expire at the end of the Company’s next AGM after the resolution 
is passed or, if earlier, at the close of business on 30 June 2015. 
The Directors have no present intention of exercising all or any of 
the powers conferred by this resolution and will only exercise their 
authority if it is in the interests of shareholders generally.

General Meeting
continued
Resolution 18 – Notice period for general meetings other 
than AGMs 
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to allow the Company 
to continue to call general meetings (other than AGMs) on 
14 clear days’ notice. In accordance with the Companies 
(Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009, the notice period 
required for general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless 
shareholders approve a shorter notice period (subject to a 
minimum period of 14 clear days). AGMs will continue to be held 
on at least 21 clear days’ notice.
The approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM, 
when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. In 
accordance with the Act, the Company must make a means of 
electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting in 
order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear 
days’ notice.
Explanatory notes as to the proxy, voting and attendance 
procedures at the Annual General Meeting
1.  The holders of Ordinary Shares in the Company are entitled 
to attend the Annual General Meeting and are entitled to vote. 
A member entitled to attend and vote may appoint a proxy to 
exercise all or any of their rights to attend, speak and vote at 
a general meeting of the Company. Such a member may 
appoint more than one proxy, provided that each proxy is 
appointed to exercise the rights attached to different shares. 
A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
2.  A form of proxy is enclosed with this notice. To be effective, a 
form of proxy must be completed and returned, together with 
any power of attorney or authority under which it is completed 
or a certified copy of such power or authority, so that it is 
received by the Company’s registrars at the address specified 
on the form of proxy not less than 48 hours (excluding any part 
of a day that is not a working day) before the stated time for 
holding the meeting. Returning a completed form of proxy will 
not preclude a member from attending the meeting and voting 
in person.
3.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person 
nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information 
rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement 
between him and the shareholder by whom he was 
nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone 
else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting.  
If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right 
or does not wish to exercise it, he may, under any such 
agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder 
as to the exercise of voting rights. The statement of the rights 
of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in 
paragraphs 1 and 2 above does not apply to Nominated 
Persons. The rights described in paragraphs 1 and 2 can 
only be exercised by ordinary shareholders of the Company.
4.   To be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General 
Meeting (and for the purposes of the determination by the 
Company of the number of votes they may cast), members 
must be entered on the Company’s register of members by 
6.00pm on 9 May 2014 (or, in the event of an adjournment, on 
the date which is two days before the time of the adjourned 
meeting). Changes to entries on the register of members after 
this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any 
person to attend or vote at the meeting.
5.  As at 4 April 2014, the Company’s issued share capital 
consists of 1,071,761,339 Ordinary Shares of 13/110 pence 
each, carrying one vote each, 15,759,880 B shares of 
47 pence each, with limited voting rights and 757 ,503,886 C 
Deferred shares of 0.00001 pence each, without voting rights. 
6.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 
through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may 
do so by using the procedures described in the CREST 
Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST 
sponsored members, and those CREST members who have 
appointed a service provider(s), should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take 
the appropriate action on their behalf.
7.  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the 
CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated 
in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s 
specifications, and must contain the information required for 
such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual (available 
via www.euroclear.com). The message, regardless of 
whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an 
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed 
proxy, must in order to be valid be transmitted so as to be 
received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) by 11.00am on 9 May 
2014. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be 
the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the 
message by the CREST Application Host) from which the 
issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to 
CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time 
any change of instructions to proxies appointed through 
CREST should be communicated to the appointee through 
other means.

Shareholder information 8.  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors, or voting service providers should note that Euroclear 
UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special 
procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal 
system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to 
the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of 
the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST 
member is a CREST Personal Member, or sponsored member, 
or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action 
as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted 
by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this 
connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their 
CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred, in 
particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
9.  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the 
Uncertified Securities Regulations 2001.
10.  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all 
of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in 
relation to the same shares.
11.  Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the 
threshold requirements set out in that section have the right 
to require the Company to publish on a website a statement 
setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the 
Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the 
conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual 
General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an 
auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the 
previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports were 
laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. The Company 
may not require the shareholders requesting any such 
website publication to pay its expenses in complying with 
sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is 
required to place a statement on a website under section 527 
of the Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s 
auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement 
available on the website. The business which may be dealt 
with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement 
that the Company has been required under section 527 of the 
Act to publish on a website.
12.  Any member holding Ordinary Shares attending the meeting 
has the right to ask questions. The Company must answer 
any such questions relating to the business being dealt with 
at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do 
so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting 
or involve the disclosure of confidential information; (b) the 
answer has already been given on a website in the form of an 
answer to a question; or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of 
the Company or the good order of the meeting that the 
question be answered.
13.  A copy of this notice, and other information required by 
section 311A of the Act, can be found at www.melroseplc.net.
14.  You may not use an electronic address provided in either this 
Notice of Annual General Meeting or any related documents 
(including the Proxy Form) to communicate with the Company 
for any purposes other than those expressly stated.
15.  The following documents will be available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office during normal business hours 
(Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) from  
the date of this notice until the date of the Annual General 
Meeting and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for 
15 minutes prior to and during the meeting:
  (A)   copies of all service agreements under which 
Directors of the Company are employed by the 
Company or any subsidiaries; and
  (B)   a copy of the terms of appointment of the non-
executive Directors of the Company.
16.  You may register your vote online by visiting Equiniti’s website 
at www.sharevote.co.uk. In order to register your vote online, 
you will need to enter the Task ID, together with your Voting ID 
and Shareholder Reference Number which are set out on the 
enclosed Proxy Form. The return of the Proxy Form by post or 
registering your vote online will not prevent you from attending 
the Annual General Meeting and voting in person, should you 
wish. Alternatively, shareholders who have already registered 
with Equiniti’s online portfolio service, Shareview, can appoint 
their proxy electronically by logging on to their portfolio  
at www.shareview.co.uk and click on the link to vote.  
The on-screen instructions give details on how to complete 
the appointment process. A proxy appointment made 
electronically will not be valid if sent to any address other than 
those provided or if received after 11.00 am on 9 May 2014.

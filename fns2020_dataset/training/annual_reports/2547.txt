Chairman’ s 
statement
I	am	pleased	to	report	another	excellent	year	for	 Broker	Network. 	 The	company	has	continued	to	 grow	strongly	both	by	acquisition	and	organically, 	 profitability	has	continued	to	improve, 	and	the	 reputation	of	the	company	within	the	insurance	 industry	has	been	significantly	enhanced.
The	results	for	the	financial	year	reflect	four	primary	 drivers.	First, 	there	are	full	year	contributions	from	 acquisitions	made	during	2005-06. 	Second, 	 acquisitions	made	during	2006-07	including	the	 major	step	of	acquiring	 TLRS	have	provided	a	 significant	contribution.		 Third,	the	company	has	 generated	growth	by	increasing	the	number	and	 size	of	network	Members. 	Finally, 	as	insurers	have	 recognised	the	increasing	size	and	quality	of	the	 company,	improved	insurer	terms	have	contributed	 significantly. 	 These	same	performance	drivers	will	 continue	to	influence	the	company	over	the	coming	 years,	although	with	the	company’s	greater	size, 	the	 rate	of	growth, 	which	has	been	dramatic	over	the	last	 couple	of	years, 	will	gradually	reduce.
The	rate	of	broker	acquisition	has	slowed	somewhat	 in	the	last	financial	year. 	 This	partly	reflects	the	 management	team’s	desire	to	 “draw	breath” 	following	 the	acquisition	of	 TLRS,	but	also	a	relative	absence	of	 attractive	opportunities. 	However, 	a	continuous	effort	 has	been	put	into	building	the	acquisitions	pipeline	 and	there	are	now	a	good	number	of	potential	 opportunities.	 We	remain	cognisant	of	the	need	not	 to	overpay	and	this	will	inevitably	influence	the	rate	at	 which	acquisitions	are	made.
TLRS	has	performed	in	line	with	our	expectations	 at	the	time	of	acquisition. 	 This	acquisition	was	a	 particularly	significant	step	because	of	its	size	and	it	is	 pleasing	that	the	integration	process	has	progressed	 smoothly.
The	core	network	business	has	performed	very	 strongly,	mainly	through	margin	enhancement. 	 We	 now	perceive	opportunities	for	further	organic	growth	 in	this	area	–	primarily	by	adding	new	members	 as	well	as	increasing	their	average	size	still	further. 		 Resources	have	been	added	to	the	new	member	 sales	team	to	enable	this	growth	to	follow.
04 Broker Network Holdings plc, Directors’ report and 
consolidated financial statements, 30 April 2007
As	the	company	has	grown	so	has	the	organisation	 and	we	now	employ	more	than	350	people	in	23	 locations	around	the	country. 	 These	results	have	only	 been	attained	through	their	hard	work, 	dedication	 and	energy. 		 The	management	team	has	developed	 along	with	the	size	of	the	organisation	and	it	is	 reassuring	that	there	is	now	strength	in	depth	which	 can	be	called	upon	as	the	company	grows	further. 	 My	thanks	are	extended	to	all	employees	for	the	effort	 that	has	gone	into	achieving	these	results.
We	are	pleased	to	announce	the	payment	of	a	 dividend	to	shareholders	for	the	year	ended	30	 April	 2007.	 This	will	be	payable	on	26	October	2007	to	all	 shareholders	on	the	register	at	28	September	2007. 	 This	is	subject	to	approval	at	the	annual	general	 meeting	of	the	Company	on	17	October	2007.
The	outlook	for	the	company	is	good. 	 We	can	see	the	 potential	to	further	consolidate	our	position	as	the	 leading	insurance	broking	network	in	the	country.

Chief Executive’ s 
review
I	am	delighted	to	be	reporting	another	year	of	 excellent	results	for	the	Broker	Network	Group. 	Despite	 extremely	tough	insurance	market	conditions, 	we	 continue	to	demonstrate	that	our	diverse	business	 model	allows	us	to	prosper	whatever	underlying	 market	conditions	prevail.
Broker Network Limited 
Our	Network	business	continues	to	thrive	with	turnover	 increasing	by	45%	from	£7.32	million	to	£10.65	million, 	 and	operating	profit	growing	from	£3.11	million	to	 £5.71	million	-	an	increase	of	84%. 		Economies	of	 scale	mean	we	have	been	able	to	increase	our	profit	 margin	in	this	business, 	and	there	remains	plenty	of	 headroom	to	grow	income	and	profitability	still	further.
Recruitment	of	new	Members	in	the	year	was	in	line	 with	our	forecast. 	 We	are	also	now	attracting	larger	 firms	alongside	our	traditional	broker	base, 	evidenced	 by	the	relative	size	of	new	recruits	which	were, 	on	 average,	64%	larger	than	our	existing	Members. 	Our	 service	infra-structure	and	proposition	is	sufficiently	 flexible	to	meet	all	our	wide	ranging	customer	 requirements	offering	real	benefit	to	brokerages	of	 most	sizes.
The	pipeline	of	prospective	new	Members	also	 remains	extremely	healthy.
Membership	numbers	have	fluctuated	throughout	 the	period	with	Members	merging	and	a	handful	 of	others	deciding	to	retire. 	 There	has	also	been	a	 small	number	leaving	at	our	behest	as	a	result	of	our	 performance	and	suitability	monitoring. 	 We	believe	 this	is	the	right	strategy	and	helps	to	reinforce	our	 commitment	to	quality	and	the	high	standards	we	 expect	in	return	for	Membership.
Our	ultimate	Membership	goal	is	to	have	a	Broker	 Network	Member	within	every	significant	community	 in	the	UK. 	Our	updated	target	is	250	firms	by	 2010	rising	to	500	by	2015. 		 To	put	this	ambition	 in	perspective, 	there	are	currently	around	4,500	 insurance	brokers	in	the	UK. 	 This	number	is	declining	 due	to	the	consolidation	that	is	taking	place, 	 although	some	of	the	decline	is	offset	by	new	start-up	 businesses.
06 Broker Network Holdings plc, Directors’ report and 
consolidated financial statements, 30 April 2007
The	insurance	market	accepts	that	membership	of	 a	network	is	a	growing	necessity	for	independent	 brokers	which	benefits	both	them	and	insurers. 		 As	market	leaders	we	profit	from	this	and	believe	 that	penetration	of	over	10%, 	whilst	a	challenge, 	is	 nevertheless	achievable.
As	part	of	a	Group	wide	re-brand	we	began	looking	 for	a	phrase	that	would	sum	up	the	essence	and	 values	of	our	network	business. 	 The	process	had	 us	consult	our	own	people, 	our	Members	and	 Partner	Insurers	and	eventually	led	us	to	the	phrase	 Enterprising Champion.	 We	have	also	taken	the	 opportunity	to	document	our	values	and	therefore	 what	behaviour	is	consistent	with	these. 	In	this	way	 we	should	be	able	to	ensure	that	as	the	business	 grows	we	do	not	lose	sight	of	what	has	made	us	so	 successful	to	date.
During	this	exercise	we	also	received	a	new	visual	 identity	and	have	re-written	our	service	proposition	to	 Members	to	ensure	it	is	consistent	with	the	new	brand.
The Retail Insurance Division (comprising TL Risk 
Solutions and Broker Network Insurance Brokers)
Our	retail	division	is	represented	across	the	country	 via	our	owned	brokers	–	those	Members	and	others	 acquired	since	the	formation	of	this	division	at	the	 beginning	of	2004. 	So	far	we	have	made	20	retail	 division	acquisitions, 	our	latest	one	being	completed	 on	31	 August	2007, 	and	we	now	trade	from	23	sites	 across	mainland	UK.
The	division	hit	sales	targets	for	2006/07	and	 customer	retention	remains	extremely	high. 	 This	 is	particularly	encouraging	in	the	 TLRS	business	 where	we	were	required	to	relocate	five	offices	into	 new	premises	during	the	period	with	the	inevitable	 disruption	that	this	entails. 	 Turnover	for	the	division	 grew	in	the	year	by	144%	to	£12.83	million, 	whilst	 operating	profit	before	amortisation	rose	385%	to	£	 2.13	million.
Whilst	only	completing	two	acquisitions	in	the	 current	period, 	we	continue	nonetheless	to	focus	 on	providing	an	exit	route	for	brokers	contemplating	 retirement	and	the	purchase	of	community	general	 insurance	brokers	remains	at	the	core	of	Group	 strategy.
However,	the	market	for	broker	purchases	is	fiercely	 competitive,	particularly	since	insurers	entered	 the	fray	last	year. 	 We	now	have	to	contend	with	 competitors	who	are	not	as	disciplined	as	we	are	 when	it	comes	to	the	financial	returns	they	expect	 from	their	acquisitions. 	Despite	this, 	we	still	firmly	 believe	that	there	are	those	who	find	our	proposition	 more	attractive	than	the	competition, 	borne	out	 by	the	fact	that	we	are	at	present	reviewing	a	 number	of	prospects	for	the	current	year. 	 We	remain	 confident	that	we	can	manage	expectations	and	 complete	several	transactions	which	will	all	be	value	 enhancing.
Other Developments
Broker	Network	London	Markets	(BNLM)	was	 established	to	provide	network	Members	with	access	 to	Lloyd’s	and	the	London	markets	for	insuring	 clients	involved	in	specialist	or	high-risk	activities. 	 The	 division	serves	us	well	as	an	investment	for	a	cyclical	 market	–	less	utilised	in	the	current	 ‘soft’	market	 where	premiums	are	low	and	traditional	insurers	 are	prepared	to	underwrite	to	a	wider	risk	profile, 	 but	indispensable	once	the	insurance	market	once	 again	hardens.
Despite	such	challenging	trading	conditions	turnover	 increased	by	2%	from	£0.27	million	to	£0.28	million	 although	the	business	continues	to	make	a	small	loss. 	 Insurance Market Conditions
It	has	been	a	tough	year	for	insurers	underwriting	 business	in	the	UK	following	the	storms	in	January	 2007	and	floods	in	June	and	July.
Only	days	after	we	announced	a	trading	update	 in	June	2007, 	where	we	commented	on	prevailing	 benign	weather	conditions, 	the	UK	experienced	 some	of	the	worst	flooding	in	its	history. 	Some	industry	 sources	are	even	suggesting	that	the	cost	to	insurers	 of	flood	damage	could	top	£5	billion.
07 Broker Network Holdings plc, Directors’ report and 
consolidated financial statements, 30 April 2007
The	impact	of	the	flooding	on	insurer	rating	is	unlikely	 to	filter	through	in	2007, 	although	clearly	it	will	be	 present	when	they	announce	their	results. 	 We	have	 already	seen	some	insurers	publicly	stating	their	 intention	to	increase	rates	to	recover	their	losses	 going	forwards. 		In	reality	the	floods	are	only	the	 catalyst	rather	than	the	root	cause	of	these	intentions. 	 	 Almost	all	major	insurers	were	reporting	deteriorating	 results	for	the	first	half	of	2007	before	the	impact	of	 the	floods	is	taken	into	account.
It	is	likely	therefore	that	the	current	action	being	 taken	by	insurers	will	stall	deflation	in	premiums	in	the	 remainder	of	2007	and	we	are	likely	to	see	rates	rise	 gradually	during	the	first	half	of	2008.
As	premiums	rise	our	earnings	across	the	Group	 will	increase	and	we	will	see	additional	organic	 growth	from	our	network	and	retail	divisions. 	 As	we	 mentioned	on	11	June	2007, 	we	have	worked	hard	 to	ensure	our	earnings	from	our	key	Partner	Insurers	 are	secure	for	the	longer	term, 	by	demonstrating	real	 value	in	the	service	we	provide	them. 	 As	the	market	 hardens,	with	inevitable	downward	pressure	on	broker	 margins,	we	will	begin	to	reap	the	benefits	of	these	 arrangements.
I	reiterate	that	the	diverse	nature	of	our	business	 means	the	Group	is	well	placed	to	trade	comfortably	 at	any	point	in	the	insurance	cycle. 	 We	remain	 confident	that	we	will	have	the	opportunity	to	 demonstrate	this	once	again	in	the	coming	year.
Outlook for 2007-08
I	am	delighted	to	have	maintained	our	market	 leading	position	and	intend	to	build	on	it.
There	are	still	abundant	opportunities	for	expansion	 within	this	fast	moving	industry	and	we	are	working	 hard	to	remain	at	the	forefront	in	our	areas	of	 expertise.	For	example	we	are	currently	evaluating	 the	opportunity	that	exists	to	expand	our	Healthcare	 business	following	the	successful	acquisition	and	 integration	of	 TLRS,	which	has	a	sizeable	Healthcare	 division	within	it. 	 We	remain	realistic	and	prudent	 in	our	acquisition	programme	and	we	continue	to	 evaluate	critically	our	offering	to	network	Members	 and	Partner	Insurers	to	ensure	we	retain	our	market	 leading	position	as	the	UK’s	number	one	network	for	 independent	insurance	brokers. 	 We	strongly	believe	that	the	Broker	Network	 business	model	remains	relevant	and	robust. 	 Whilst	 challenging	trading	conditions	lay	ahead	we	are	 looking	forward	with	confidence	to	another	year	 of	good	performance	and	enhanced	shareholder	 value.

review
Turnover
Turnover	for	the	year	was	£23.3m, 	including	£6.7m	 from	acquisitions	made	during	the	year. 	 This	is	an	 overall	increase	of	86%	from	£12.5m	in	2006, 	32%	 excluding	 acquisitions	 in	 the	 year.	 Turnover	 in	 the	 retail	 division	grew	strongly	to	£12.8m, 	an	increase	of	144%. 	 This	is	due	to	the	acquisition	of	two	further	brokers	 in	the	year	and	the	full	year	impact	of	previous	 acquisitions.	 The	Network	also	grew	strongly	with	the	 addition	of	a	net	16	new	Members	and	a	turnover	 increase	of	45%	from	£7.3m	to	£10.6m. 	 Administrative Expenses
Administrative	expenses, 	excluding	goodwill	 amortisation,	were	£16.4m, 	an	increase	of	71%	on	 the	prior	year. 	 Whilst	we	continue	to	invest	in	both	our	 head	office	and	retail	infrastructure	the	impact	of	the	 TLRS	acquisition	accounted	for	44%	of	this	increase.
Intangible	assets	are	being	amortised	over	between 	 5	and	20	years	resulting	in	a	goodwill	amortisation	 charge	of	£1.7m	for	the	year.

Profitability
Profit	before	tax	grew	strongly, 	from	£2.4m	to	£4.8m, 	an	increase	of	100%. 	 The	acquisition	of	a	further	2	brokers	 during	the	year, 	bringing	the	total	number	to	19, 	has	substantially	increased	the	headcount	of	the	group	 bringing	it	to	381	by	the	year	end. 	However, 	there	was	a	17%	increase	in	turnover	per	employee	and	a	55%	 increase	in	operating	profit	per	employee	as	shown	below:-

Turnover	per	employee	 63,901	 54,738	 17%
Operating	profit	per	employee	 14,148	 9,118	 55%
Services	to	our	network	Members	continue	to	be	 improved	and	the	infrastructure	to	support	a	larger	 retail	branch	structure	is	in	place	making	further	 acquisitions	a	priority	in	the	coming	year.
Taxation
The	group’s	tax	charge	for	the	year	is	£1.6m	which	 represents	an	effective	tax	rate	of	34%. 	 This	is	higher	 than	the	standard	rate	of	corporation	tax	of	30%	 due	to	expenses	not	deductible	for	tax	purposes	 which	is	predominantly	goodwill	amortisation	on	 consolidation.
Earnings per share
Basic	earnings	per	share	is	20.74p	compared	to	 10.56p	in	2006. 	 This	is	based	on	a	weighted	average	 15.36m	shares	in	2007	compared	to	15.06m	in	2006.
Capital expenditure
Capital	expenditure	for	the	group	continues	to	be	 predominantly	for	office	equipment, 	IT	hardware	 and	software. 	For	the	network	business	we	have	 invested	in	new	reconciliation	software	and	computer	 equipment	for	new	staff. 	In	both	the	Head	Office	 and	our	retail	branches	we	have	installed	a	new	 integrated	telephone	system	during	the	year	to	 ensure	that	we	can	benefit	from	economies	of	scale	 and	communication	between	sites. 	 We	also	relocated	 five	 TLRS	sites	following	the	acquisition
Total	capital	expenditure	was	£0.9m	compared	to	 £0.2m	in	2006.
Acquisitions
£12.5m	was	spent	on	the	initial	payments	and	 fees	for	the	acquisition	of	a	further	2	brokers	in	the	 year.		In	addition, 	£1.2m	was	paid	out	in	deferred	 consideration	payments	to	former	principals	for	 previous	acquisitions.
Intangibles	and	Goodwill	 Amortisation
Purchased	goodwill	(representing	the	excess	of	 the	fair	value	of	consideration	over	the	fair	value	 of	the	separable	net	assets	acquired)	in	respect	 of	acquisitions	is	capitalised	as	goodwill	which	is	 amortised	over	a	5	to	20	year	period	depending	on	 its	estimated	useful	life.
Cashflow 
Broker	Network	continues	to	be	strongly	cash	 generative	and	cash	inflow	from	operating	activities	 was	£4.7m	(2006: 	£3.0m). 		 10 Broker Network Holdings plc, Directors’ report and 
consolidated financial statements, 30 April 2007
Bank funding
During	the	year	the	£2.5m	facility	agreed	with	 Lloyds	 TSB	bank	(of	which	£1m	was	utilised	to	fund	 acquisitions	in	the	prior	year)	was	replaced	with	a	 £15.5m	facility, 	£13m	of	which	was	utilised	for	the	 purchase	of	 Towry	Law	Insurance	Brokers	Limited. 	 The	 remaining	funding	available	for	drawdown	therefore	 remains	at	£1.5m. 	 Risk Management
The	risk	management	process	established	in	2004/05, 	 through	which	the	major	risks	faced	by	the	group	 were	identified	and	evaluated, 	continues	to	operate. 	 Each	subsidiary	Board	of	Directors	reviews	the	risk	 register	formally	every	six	months	prior	to	review	by	the	 Group	Board. 	 This	is	then	followed	by	a	consideration	 at	the	next	 Audit	Committee	meeting. 	 Assurance	work	 on	the	retail	division	is	conducted	on	a	regular	basis.
Transition to International Accounting Standards
As	an	 AIM	listed	company	we	will	adopt	IAS	for	our	 financial	statements	for	the	year	ending	30	 April	2008.

Corporate 
Governance
Compliance Statement
The	group	is	not	required	to	comply	with	the	 provisions	of	the	Combined	Code	on	Corporate	 Governance	appended	to	the	Listing	Rules	of	the	 Financial	Services	 Authority	(“the	Code”). 	 The	Board	 of	Directors	recognises	the	importance	of, 	and	is	 committed	to, 	ensuring	that	effective	corporate	 governance	procedures	relevant	to	smaller	listed	 groups	are	in	place. 	 The	Board	agrees	with	the	 principals	of	the	Code	and	continues	to	work	 towards	obtaining	substantial	compliance	with	the	 Code.		 The	commentary	below	outlines	the	group’s	 achievements	during	the	year	ended	30	 April	2007.
Internal control and risk management process
The	Board	acknowledges	that	it	is	responsible	for	the	 group’s	system	of	internal	control	and	for	reviewing	 its	effectiveness. 	Internal	controls	are	designed	to	 manage	rather	than	eliminate	the	risk	of	failure	to	 achieve	business	objectives	and	can	only	provide	 reasonable	and	not	absolute	assurance	against	 material	misstatement	or	loss. 	 The	process	of	identifying, 	evaluating	and	managing	 the	risks	faced	by	the	group	continues	through	the	 operation	of	a	group	risk	register	which	encompasses	 an	assessment	of	the	internal	controls	in	place	to	 mitigate	the	identified	risks	and	their	effectiveness. 		 This	analysis	is	reviewed	regularly	by	the	group’s	 senior	management	and	Board	of	Directors	and	 every	six	months	by	the	 Audit	Committee.
An	internal	audit	function	is	established	with	the	focus	 being	on	the	controls	and	procedures	within	the	retail	 broking	division. 	In	addition	monitoring	of	compliance	 with	FSA	requirements	for	both	owned	brokers	and	 independent	Members	is	given	a	high	priority.
16 Broker Network Holdings plc, Directors’ report and 
consolidated financial statements, 30 April 2007
The Board
There	were	no	changes	in	directors	in	the	year. 	 At	 30	 April	2007	the	Board	comprised	four	executive	 directors,	three	non-executive	directors	and	one	 non-executive	Chairman. 	 Two	of	the	non-executive	 members	of	the	Board	are	considered	by	the	 Board	to	be	independent	of	the	company	and	the	 group.		Each	non-executive	possesses	considerable	 outside	expertise	and	is	able	to	exercise	detached		 judgement	in	dealing	with	matters	before	the	Board. 		 The	Board	considers	that	the	current	composition	 provides	a	reasonable	level	of	independence.
The	Board, 	which	met	seven	times	during	the	year, 	 is	responsible	for	the	overall	strategy	and	financial	 performance	of	the	group	and	has	a	formal	schedule	 of	matters	required	for	approval. 	Each	Board	meeting	 is	preceded	by	a	clear	agenda	and	any	relevant	 information	is	provided	to	directors	in	advance	of	the	 meeting.
All	directors	are	required	to	submit	themselves	for	 re-election	at	an	 Annual	General	Meeting	if	they	 were	not	elected	or	re-elected	at	either	of	the	two	 preceding	 Annual	General	Meetings. 	 Therefore	 directors	appointed	during	the	period	are	required	to	 seek	re-election	at	the	first	 Annual	General	Meeting	 following	their	appointment.
Auditor independence 
In	order	to	safeguard	the	objectivity	and	 independence	of	the	company’s	external	auditors, 	 the	 Audit	Committee	keeps	under	review	the	nature	 and	 extent	 of	 any	 non-audit	 services	 supplied	 in	 order	 to	balance	the	maintenance	of	objectivity	and	value	 for	money.
Principal Board committees
The	Board	has	established	the	following	committees:
•	Remuneration	Committee. 	 The	Committee	currently	 comprises	P	Bates	and	M	Pendle	and	is	chaired	 by	F	Rahmatallah. 	 The	Remuneration	Committee	is	 responsible	for	reviewing	and	recommending	all	 the	elements	of	policy	on	the	Board’s	and	senior	 executives’	remuneration	and	for	approving	all	 matters	relating	to	the	remuneration	of	executive	 directors.	It	meets	formally	at	least	quarterly. 	 The	 Remuneration	Committee	report	on	pages	18	to	 22	contains	a	detailed	description	of	remuneration	 and	applicable	policies	 •	Audit	Committee. 	 The	committee	comprises	P	Bates	 and	M	Pendle	and	is	chaired	by	F	Rahmatallah. 		 The	 Audit	Committee	assists	the	Board	in	fulfilling	its	 oversight	responsibilities, 	primarily	in	reviewing	and	 reporting	financial	and	non-financial	information	 communicated	to	shareholders, 	systems	of	internal	 control	and	risk	management	and	the	audit	 process.	It	has	the	power	to	call	for	information	 from	management	and	to	consult	directly	with	 the	auditors	or	other	advisors	as	considered	 appropriate.	 The	Committee	operates	under	written	 terms	of	reference	and	is	scheduled	to	meet	at	 least	twice	a	year	with	the	group’s	auditors. 	 The	 committee	is	responsible	for	the	independent	 monitoring	of	the	effectiveness	of	the	systems	of	 internal	control, 	compliance, 	accounting	policies	 and	published	financial	statements	on	behalf	of	the	 Board.		 This	is	achieved	primarily	through	a	review	 of	the	annual	financial	statements	and	a	review	 of	the	nature	and	scope	of	the	external	audit. 	 Any	 significant	findings	or	identified	risks	are	examined	 so	that	appropriate	action	may	be	taken. 	 The	 Committee	is	also	responsible	for	keeping	under	 review	the	independence	and	objectivity	of	the	 external	auditors, 	including	a	review	of	non-audit	 services	provided	to	the	group, 	consideration	of	 any	relationships	with	the	group	that	could	affect	 independence	and	seeking	written	confirmation	 from	auditors	that, 	in	their	professional	judgement, 	 they	are	independent.
Relations with shareholders
The	group	encourages	the	participation	of	both	 institutional	and	private	investors. 	Communication	 with	private	individuals	is	maintained	through	the	 Annual	General	Meeting, 	annual	and	interim	reports, 	 investor	newsletters	and	press	releases. 		 17 Broker Network Holdings plc, Directors’ report and

EMI Share Options
On	18	December	2001	and	on	13	November	2003, 	 The	Broker	Network	Limited	granted	options	the	 majority	of	which	are	expected	to	qualify	for	relief	 under	the	Enterprise	Management	Incentive	Scheme	 under	the	Income	 Tax	(Earning	and	Pensions)	 Act	 2003,	to	JK	Hale	and	MG	Collins	respectively.
Approximately	1,000	of	MG	Collins’ 	options	were	 granted	under	an	unapproved	scheme	as	the	limits	 for	the	Enterprise	Management	Incentive	Scheme	 were	exceeded.
The	options	were	granted	under	individual	option	 agreements	and	the	option	agreements	were	in	 similar	form. 	 The	following	paragraphs	summarise	the	 key	provisions	of	the	original	option	agreements:
1.	 Option	price	and	amount
	 Each	option	is	in	respect	of	6,000	B	ordinary	shares	 of	£1	each	in	 The	Broker	Network	Limited	at	an		 option	price	of	£10	per	share	for	JK	Hale	and	£20	 per	share	for	MG	Collins, 	subject	to	adjustment	in	 the		event	of	any	subsequent	variation	of	share	 capital.
2.	 Exercise	of	Option	Period
	 Subject	to	the	terms	of	the	option	agreement, 	the	 options	may	be	exercised	on	the	occurrence	of	 an	event	as	outlined	in	section	3	within	a	period	 commencing	with	the	date	of	grant	and	ending	 on	the	10th	anniversary	of	the	date	of	grant.
3.	 Exercise	of	Options
	 The	option	may	be	exercised	on	a	sale	or	listing, 	or	 within	40	days	of	the	occurrence	of	a	disqualifying	 	 event,	or	on	a	change	of	control	of	grantor	 company,	or	within	three	months	of	ceasing	to	 hold	office	or	employment	with	a	Group	company	 where	termination	of	employment	occurs	as	a	 result	of	ill-health, 	injury, 	disability	or	redundancy	 within	the	meaning	of	the	Employment	Rights	 Act	1996, 	or	within	six	months	of	the	death	of	the	 option	holder.
4.	 Cessation	of	employment
	 If	 a	 participant	 ceases	 to	 be	 employed	 by	 a	 Group	 company,	the	options	will	lapse	unless	the	grantor	 company	in	its	absolute	discretion	determines	 otherwise.	If	the	cessation	occurs	as	a	result	of	 ill-health,	injury, 	disability	or	redundancy, 	the	option	 may	be	exercised	within	3	months	of	the	date	of	 cessation	and, 	if	not	so	exercised, 	these	will	lapse. 		 Where	cessation	of	employment	occurs	as	a	result	 of	the	death	of	the	option	holder, 	the	options	may	 be	exercised	within	6	months	of	the	date	of	death	 and,	if	not	so	exercised, 	will	lapse.
5.	 Change	of	control
	 In	the	event	of	a	change	in	control	of	 grantor	company	as	a	result	of	a	take-over	or	 reconstruction,	then	(as	an	alternative	to	the	 exercise	of	the	options)	participants	may, 	if	the	 acquiring	 company	 agrees,	 release	 their	 options	 in	 exchange	for	options	over	shares	in	the	acquiring	 company.
6.	 Variation	of	share	capital
	 In	the	event	of	a	variation	of	the	ordinary	share	 capital	of	 The	Broker	Network	Limited, 	the	option	 price	of	the	shares	under	option	and/or	the	 number	of	such	shares	may	be	adjusted	with	the	 confirmation	in	writing	of	the	auditors	(except	 in	the	case	of	a	capitalisation	issue)	that	such	 adjustment	is	fair	and	reasonable.

7.	 EMI	Relief
	 Provided	the	Enterprise	Management	Initiative	 Scheme	options	retain	their	qualifying	status, 	no	 income	tax	or	national	insurance	contributions	 will	arise	when	the	options	are	exercised. 	On	 the	exercise	of	the	unapproved	options	granted	 to	Michael	Collins, 	income	tax	and	national	 insurance	contributions	will	arise	upon	the	 difference	between	the	market	value	of	the	shares	 at	the	date	of	exercise	and	the	price	paid	for	 those	shares.
Adjustment	to	option	agreements
The	company	agreed	at	the	time	of	the	acquisition	of	 The	Broker	Network	Limited	to	exchange	the	options	 referred	to	above	for	options	over	ordinary	shares	 in	Broker	Network	Holdings	plc	on	similar	terms	and	 conditions.	 All	references	in	the	option	agreements	to	 “The	Broker	Network	Limited” 	now	include	references	 to	Broker	Network	Holdings	plc. 	 The	number	of	shares	 under	option	and	the	option	price	were	adjusted	to	 reflect	the	new	share	capital	following	the	company’s	 listing	on	 AIM.	Following	this	adjustment	JK	Hale	 and	MG	Collins	each	had	options	in	respect	of	 £300,000	Class	B	Ordinary	shares	at	option	prices	of	 20p	and	40p	respectively. 	 The	option	period	remains	 unchanged.
On	6	June	2006, 	the	company	received	notice	from	 MG	Collins	of	the	exercise	of	300,000	share	options	 at	the	exercise	price	of	40p	each. 	 As	part	of	the	 exercise	of	these	options, 	on	2	June	2006	MG	Collins	 sold	60,000	ordinary	shares	of	2p	each	at	150p	per	 ordinary	share.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Members	of	senior	management	are	entitled	to	 participate	each	year	in	a	LTIP	scheme	without	 payment.
The	benefits	consist	of	cash	incentive	rewards	in	 addition	to	the	right	to	buy	shares	in	Broker	Network	 Holdings	plc	at	nil	cost. 	 Vesting	is	subject	to	service	 conditions.	 The	year	ended	30	 April	2007	is	the	first	 year	in	which	share	options	have	been	granted	 under	the	LTIP . 	 Details	of	cash	incentive	rewards	as	part	of	the	LTIP	 are	provided	below.

Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities in 
respect of the annual 
report and the 
financial statements
The	directors	are	responsible	for	preparing	the	 Annual	 Report	and	the	financial	statements	in	accordance	 with	applicable	law	and	regulations.
Company	law	requires	the	directors	to	prepare	 financial	statements	for	each	financial	year. 	Under	 that	law	they	have	elected	to	prepare	the	group	and	 parent	company	financial	statements	in	accordance	 with	UK	 Accounting	Standards	and	applicable	law	 (UK	Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	Practice).
The	group	and	parent	company	financial	statements	 are	required	by	law	to	give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	 state	of	affairs	of	the	group	and	the	parent	company	 and	of	the	profit	or	loss	for	that	period.
In	preparing	these	financial	statements, 	the	directors	 are	required	to:
•	 select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	 apply	them	consistently;
•	 make	judgments	and	estimates	that	are	 reasonable	and	prudent;
•	 state	whether	applicable	UK	accounting	 standards	have	been	followed, 	subject	to	any	 material	departures	disclosed	and	explained	in	 the	financial	statements; 	 •	 prepare	the	financial	statements	on	the	going	 concern	basis	unless	it	is	inappropriate	to	presume	 that	the	group	and	the	parent	company	will	 continue	in	business.
The	directors	are	responsible	for	keeping	proper	 accounting	records	that	disclose	with	reasonable	 accuracy	at	any	time	the	financial	position	of	the	 parent	company	and	enable	them	to	ensure	that	its	 financial	statements	comply	with	the	Companies	 Act	 1985.	 They	have	general	responsibility	for	taking	such	 steps	as	are	reasonably	open	to	them	to	safeguard	 the	assets	of	the	group	and	to	prevent	and	detect	 fraud	and	other	irregularities.
The	directors	are	responsible	for	the	maintenance	 and	integrity	of	the	corporate	and	financial	 information	included	on	the	company’s	website. 	 Legislation	in	the	UK	governing	the	preparation	and	 dissemination	of	financial	statements	may	differ	from	 legislation	in	other	jurisdictions.

Independent auditors’ 
report to the members 
of Broker Network 
Holdings Plc 
We	have	audited	the	group	and	parent	company	 financial	statements	(the	 ‘’financial	statements’ ’)	 of	Broker	Network	Holdings	Plc	for	the	year	ended	 30	 April	2007	which	comprise	the	Consolidated	 Profit	and	Loss	 Account,	the	Consolidated	and	 Company	Balance	Sheets, 	the	Consolidated	 Cash	Flow	Statement	and	the	related	notes. 	 These	 financial	statements	have	been	prepared	under	the	 accounting	policies	set	out	therein.
This	report	is	made	solely	to	the	company’s	members, 	 as	a	body, 	in	accordance	with	section	235	of	the	 Companies	 Act	1985. 	Our	audit	work	has	been	 undertaken	so	that	we	might	state	to	the	company’s	 members	those	matters	we	are	required	to	state	to	 them	in	an	auditor’s	report	and	for	no	other	purpose. 	 To	the	fullest	extent	permitted	by	law, 	we	do	not	 accept	or	assume	responsibility	to	anyone	other	 than	the	company	and	the	company’s	members	as	 a	body, 	for	our	audit	work, 	for	this	report, 	or	for	the	 opinions	we	have	formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The	directors’ 	responsibilities	for	preparing	the	 Annual	 Report	and	the	financial	statements	in	accordance	 with	applicable	law	and	UK	 Accounting	Standards	 (UK	Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	Practice)	are	set	 out	in	the	Statement	of	Directors’ 	Responsibilities	on	 page	23.
Our	responsibility	is	to	audit	the	financial	statements	 in	accordance	with	relevant	legal	and	regulatory	 requirements	and	International	Standards	on	 Auditing	 (UK	and	Ireland).
We	report	to	you	our	opinion	as	to	whether	the	 financial	statements	give	a	true	and	fair	view	and	 are	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	 Companies	 Act	1985. 	 We	also	report	to	you	whether	 in	our	opinion	the	information	given	in	the	Directors’ 	 Report	is	consistent	with	the	financial	statements. 	 The	 information	given	in	the	Directors’ 	Report	includes	that	 specific	information	presented	in	the	Chief	Executive’s	 Review	and	Finance	Director’s	Review	that	is	cross	 referenced	from	the	Business	Review	section	of	the	 Directors’	Report. 	 24 Broker Network Holdings plc, Directors’ report and 
consolidated financial statements, 30 April 2007
In	addition	we	report	to	you	if, 	in	our	opinion, 	the	 company	has	not	kept	proper	accounting	records, 	 if	we	have	not	received	all	the	information	and	 explanations	we	require	for	our	audit, 	or	if	information	 specified	by	law	regarding	directors’ 	remuneration	 and	other	transactions	is	not	disclosed.
We	read	the	other	information	contained	in	the	 Annual	Report	and	consider	whether	it	is	consistent	 with	 the	 audited	 financial	 statements.	 We	 consider	 the	 implications	for	our	report	if	we	become	aware	of	any	 apparent	misstatements	or	material	inconsistencies	 with	the	financial	statements. 	Our	responsibilities	do	 not	extend	to	any	other	information
Basis of audit opinion
We	conducted	our	audit	in	accordance	with	 International	Standards	on	 Auditing	(UK	and	Ireland)	 issued	by	the	 Auditing	Practices	Board. 	 An	audit	 includes	examination, 	on	a	test	basis, 	of	evidence	 relevant	to	the	amounts	and	disclosures	in	the	 financial	statements.	It	also	includes	an	assessment	 of	the	significant	estimates	and	judgments	made	 by	the	directors	in	the	preparation	of	the	financial	 statements,	and	of	whether	the	accounting	policies	 are	appropriate	to	the	group’s	and	company’s	 circumstances,	consistently	applied	and	adequately	 disclosed.
We	planned	and	performed	our	audit	so	as	to	 obtain	all	the	information	and	explanations	which	 we	considered	necessary	in	order	to	provide	us	with	 sufficient	evidence	to	give	reasonable	assurance	 that	the	financial	statements	are	free	from	material	 misstatement,	whether	caused	by	fraud	or	other	 irregularity	or	error. 	In	forming	our	opinion	we	also	 evaluated	the	overall	adequacy	of	the	presentation	 of	information	in	the	financial	statements.
Opinion
In	our	opinion:
•	 the	financial	statements	give	a	true	and	fair	 view,	in	accordance	with	UK	Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	Practice, 	of	the	state	of	the	group’s	 and	the	parent	company’s	affairs	as	at	30	 April	 2007	and	of	the	group’s	profit	for	the	year	then	 ended;
•	 the	financial	statements	have	been	properly	 prepared	in	accordance	with	the	Companies	 Act	 1985;	and
•	 the	information	given	in	the	Directors’ 	Report	is	 consistent	with	the	financial	statements

Notes
(forming part of the financial statements)
1. Accounting policies
Basis	of	accounting
The	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	in	 accordance	with	the	historical	cost	convention	and	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 accounting	 standards	 in	the	United	Kingdom. 		 The	following	accounting	policies	have	been	 applied	consistently	in	dealing	with	items	which	 are	considered	material	in	relation	to	the	financial	 statements,	except	as	noted	below.
In	these	financial	statements	the	following	new	 standards	have	been	adopted	for	the	first	time:
•	 FRS	20	 ‘Share	based	payments’
The	Company	has	adopted	FRS	20	 ‘Share	based	 payments’	with	effect	from	1	May	2006. 	Due	to	the	 timing	of	the	grant	of	share	options	the	adoption	of	 FRS	20	has	no	prior	year	adjustment.
Basis	of	consolidation
The	group	financial	statements	include	the	financial	 statements	of	the	company	and	its	subsidiary	 undertakings	made	up	to	30	 April	2007. 	 All	financial	 statements	are	prepared	on	a	uniform	basis	 throughout	the	group.
The	acquisition	method	of	accounting	has	been	 adopted,	unless	otherwise	stated. 	Merger	accounting	 has	been	adopted	in	relation	to	the	creation	of	a	 new	holding	company	in	2004. 	Under	the	acquisition	 method	of	accounting, 	the	results	of	subsidiary	 undertakings	acquired	and	disposed	of	in	the	year	 are	included	in	the	consolidated	profit	and	loss	 account	from	the	date	of	acquisition	or	up	to	the	 date	of	disposal.
Turnover
Turnover	represents	commissions	received	on	the	 arrangement	of	the	settlement	of	insurance	policies	 and	levies	made	on	satellite	operatives. 	 Turnover	is	 recognised	when	it	falls	due.
Interest	income	on	cash	flows	arising	from	insurance	 broking	debtors	and	creditors	is	recognised	as	 earned.
31 Broker Network Holdings plc, Directors’ report and 
consolidated financial statements, 30 April 2007
Insurance	transactions
Insurance	transactions	arise	from	the	settlement	of	 transactions	with	insurance	companies	on	behalf	of	 satellite	 insurance	 intermediaries	 who	 are	 members	 of	 the	network. 	 A	debtor	balance	representing	amounts	 owing	from	individual	customers	is	recognised	when	 the	member	arranges	a	policy, 	along	with	a	creditor	 balance	representing	amounts	due	to	the	ultimate	 insurance	provider	and	commissions	earned	by	the	 intermediary	and	the	Broker	Network. 		 Insurance	broking	debtors	and	creditors	are	reported	 in	accordance	with	the	requirements	of	Financial	 Reporting	Standard	5, 	 ‘Reporting	the	Substance	of	 Transactions’.	 The	standard	precludes	assets	and	 liabilities	being	offset	unless	net	settlement	is	legally	 enforceable	and	as	a	result	the	insurance	broking	 debtors	and	creditors	have	been	shown	as	the	 gross	amounts	due	in	respect	of	each	contract, 	 instead	of	the	net	amount	due	to	or	from	clients	and	 underwriters.
Interest	income
Interest	income	on	cash	flows	arising	from	insurance	 broking	debtors	and	creditors	is	recognised	as	 earned.
Goodwill	and	negative	goodwill
Purchased	goodwill	(representing	the	excess	of	 the	fair	value	of	the	consideration	given	over	the	 fair	value	of	the	separable	net	assets	acquired)	 arising	on	consolidation	and	business	combinations	 in	respect	of	acquisitions	since	1	January	1998	is	 capitalised.	Positive	goodwill	is	amortised	to	nil	by	 equal	annual	instalments	over	its	estimated	useful	life.
On	the	subsequent	disposal	or	termination	of	a	 business	acquired	since	January	1998, 	the	profit	or	 loss	on	disposal	or	termination	is	calculated	after	 charging	(crediting)	the	unamortised	amount	of	any	 related	goodwill	(negative	goodwill).
Fixed	asset	investments
Fixed	asset	investments	are	stated	at	cost	less	 provisions	for	impairment. 	 A	provision	for	impairment	 is	made	to	the	extent	that, 	in	the	directors’ 	view, 	the	 carrying	amount	exceeds	the	recoverable	amount	of	 the	fixed	asset	investment.
Fixed	assets
Tangible	fixed	assets	are	stated	at	cost.
Depreciation	is	provided	at	rates	calculated	to	write	 off	the	cost	less	estimated	residual	value	of	each	 asset	over	its	expected	useful	life, 	as	follows:
Office	equipment	 15%	-	20%	straight	line
Motor	vehicles	 	 25%	straight	line
Computer	equipment	 25%	straight	line
Taxation
The	charge	for	taxation	is	based	on	the	profit	for	the	 period	and	takes	into	account	taxation	deferred	 because	of	timing	differences	between	the	treatment	 of	certain	items	for	taxation	and	accounting	 purposes.		 Deferred	tax	is	recognised, 	without	discounting, 	 in	respect	of	all	timing	differences	between	 the	treatment	of	certain	items	for	taxation	and	 accounting	purposes	which	have	arisen	but	not	 reversed	by	the	balance	sheet	date, 	except	as	 otherwise	required	by	FRS	19.
Leasing
Assets	acquired	under	finance	leases	are	capitalised	 and	the	outstanding	future	lease	obligations	are	 shown	in	creditors. 	Operating	lease	rentals	are	 charged	to	the	profit	and	loss	account	on	a	straight	 line	basis	over	the	period	of	the	lease.
32 Broker Network Holdings plc, Directors’ report and 
consolidated financial statements, 30 April 2007
Pension	arrangements
The	company	operates	a	group	personal	pension	 plan,	a	defined	contribution	scheme. 		 The	pension	 cost	is	the	amount	of	contributions	payable	in	 respect	of	the	accounting	period. 		 The	company	 provides	no	further	post	retirement	benefits	to	its	 employees.
Cash	and	liquid	resources
Cash,	for	the	purpose	of	the	cash	flow	statement, 	 comprises	cash	in	hand	and	deposits	repayable	 on	demand, 	less	overdrafts	payable	on	demand. 		 Liquid	resources	are	current	asset	investments	which	 are	disposable	without	curtailing	or	disrupting	the	 business	and	are	either	readily	convertible	into	known	 amounts	of	cash	at	or	close	to	their	carrying	values	 or	traded	in	an	active	market.
Share	based	payments
Charges	for	employee	services	received	in	exchange	 for	share	based	payment	are	made	for	all	awards/
options	granted	after	7	November	2002	not	vested	 at	1	May	2006	to	spread	the	fair	value	of	the	grant	 over	the	vesting	period. 	 The	fair	value	of	options	has	 been	calculated	using	the	Black	Scholes	pricing	 methodology.	 33 Broker Network Holdings plc, Directors’ report and

Appendix	–	Summary	of	the	Broker	Network	Holdings	 plc	Savings	Related	Share	Option	Scheme	2007	(“the	 Scheme”)
The	Board	of	Directors	of	the	Company	 recommended	the	introduction	of	the	Scheme	on	21	 March	2007	and	approved	the	Rules	of	the	Scheme	 on	11	September	2007.
The	establishment	of	the	Scheme	is	subject	to	 approval	by	the	shareholders	of	the	Company	in	 general	meeting	(see	Notice	of	 AGM,	resolution	8)
The	Scheme	is	intended	to	enable	all	qualifying	 employees	of	companies	in	the	Broker	Network	Group	 to	acquire	ordinary	shares	in	Broker	Network	Holdings	 plc	through	regular	savings	from	their	net	pay. 	 The	 Board	believes	that	the	introduction	of	the	Scheme	 will	be	of	significant	benefit	to	the	Company	by	 linking	the	interests	of	the	employees	with	those	of	the	 shareholders.	 50 Broker Network Holdings plc, Directors’ report and 
consolidated financial statements, 30 April 2007
It	is	intended	that	the	Scheme	will	be	approved	by	H	 M	Revenue	&	Customs	(“HMRC”)	under	Schedule	3	 to	the	Income	 Tax	(Earning	and	Pensions)	 Act	2003	 (“the	 Act”).
The	Scheme	will	run	for	ten	years	and	the	principal	 features	of	the	Scheme	are	summarised	below.
Eligibility
Employees	of	companies	in	the	Broker	Network	 Group	(“the	Group”)	are	eligible	if	their	emoluments	 are	chargeable	to	UK	income	tax	under	sections	 15	or	21	of	the	 Act.	 The	directors	may	nominate	 other	employees	as	eligible. 	 The	directors	may	set	 a	minimum	service	requirement	not	exceeding	five	 years.	 Grant	of	options
Invitations	to	apply	for	options	may	be	issued	within	 42	days	after	the	announcement	by	the	Company	to	 the	market	of	its	results	for	any	period, 	and	at	other	 times	in	circumstances	considered	to	be	special	by	 the	directors. 	No	options	may	be	granted	more	than	 ten	years	after	the	approval	of	the	Scheme	by	the	 shareholders.	Options	granted	under	the	Scheme	 are	personal	to	the	option	holder	and, 	except	on	the	 death	of	an	option	holder, 	may	not	be	transferred. 		 No	consideration	is	payable	for	the	grant	of	an	option	 and	options	are	not	pensionable. 		 Savings	contracts
An	 eligible	 employee	 who	 applies	 for	 an	 option	 under	 the	Scheme	must	also	enter	into	a	related	HMRC-
approved	savings	contract	for	a	period	of	three	or	five	 years	(requiring	payments	of	currently	not	less	than	 £5	per	month	and	not	more	than	£250	per	month). 		 Ordinary	shares	may	only	be	acquired	under	the	 Scheme	using	these	savings. 	 Price
The	price	payable	for	each	ordinary	share	under	an	 option	shall	be	determined	by	the	directors, 	provided	 that	the	price	shall	not	be	less	than	80	per	cent	of	the	 middle	market	price	of	an	ordinary	share	averaged	 over	the	three	business	days	immediately	preceding	 that	on	which	an	invitation	to	apply	for	options	is	 made	or, 	in	the	case	of	an	option	to	subscribe	for	 ordinary	shares, 	the	nominal	value	of	such	ordinary	 shares,	if	greater. 	 Limits
No	option	shall	be	granted	under	the	Scheme, 	which	 would	cause	the	number	of	ordinary	shares	is	issued	 or	issuable	by	the	Company	under	the	Scheme	or	 any	other	share	scheme	adopted	by	the	Company	 to	exceed	ten	per	cent	of	the	Company’s	issued	 ordinary	share	capital	in	the	preceding	ten	years.
If	applications	are	received	for	options	in	excess	of	 these	limits	the	director	may	scale	the	applications	 down.	 Exercise
An	option	will	normally	be	exercisable	for	a	period	 of	six	months	after	the	third	or	fifth	anniversary	bonus	 (as	applicable)	is	paid	under	the	savings	contract, 	 provided	that	the	option	holder	has	remained	in	 employment	with	a	Group	company	throughout	that	 period.	 Options	normally	lapse	on	cessation	of	employment. 		 However,	exercise	is	permitted	if:
a)	the 	 option	 holder	 ceases	 to	 be	 employed	 (irrespective	 of	 the	 period	 for	 which	 the	 option	 has	 been	 held)	 by	 reason	 of	 death,	 injury,	 disability,	 redundancy,	 or	 retirement	 on	 reaching	 60	 or	 contractual	 retirement	 age;	 or	 where	 the	 company	 or	 business	 by	 which	 the	 option	 holder	 is	 employed	 ceases	 to	 be	 under	 the	 control	 of	 the	 Company	 or	 the	 business	 in	 which	 the	 option	 holder	 is	 employed	 is	 transferred	 out	 of	 the	 Group;	 or
b)	the	option	holder	ceases	to	be	employed	(where	 an	option	has	been	held	for	more	than	three	 years)	by	reason	of: 	(a)	taking	up	employment	 (with	the	approval	of	the	directors)	with	a	related	 undertaking;	or	(b)	not	taking	up	her	statutory	 contractual	right	to	return	to	work	where	she	has	 been	absent	from	work	because	of	pregnancy	or	 confinement;	or	(c)	the	option	holder	ceases	to	 be	employed	for	any	reason	other	than	summary	 dismissal.
If	an	option	holder	remains	employed	after	reaching	 60,	he	may	exercise	his	option	within	six	months	of	 that	date	or, 	if	not	so	exercised, 	during	the	normal	 exercise	period	set	out	above.
A	six	month	exercise	period	would	also	apply	in	the	 event	of	a	change	of	control	of	the	Company. 	.

Rights	attaching	to	shares
All	Ordinary	shares	allotted	or	transferred	under	the	 Scheme	will	rank	equally	with	all	other	Ordinary	 shares	of	the	Company	for	the	time	being	in	issue. 		 The	Company	will, 	at	its	expense, 	make	application	 to	the	London	Stock	Exchange	for	admission	to	the	 Offical	List	of	shares	allotted. 	 Adjustment	of	options
On	any	variation	of	the	Ordinary	share	capital	of	the	 Company,	the	directors, 	so	far	as	allowed	by	HMRC, 	 may	make	such	adjustments	as	they	consider	fair	 and	reasonable	to	the	number	of	Ordinary	shares	 comprised	in	each	option	and	the	price	payable	 on	exercise	of	each	option. 	No	adjustment	may	 be	made	which	would	result	in	the	increase	of	the	 aggregate	amount	payable	on	the	exercise	of	an	 option	or	any	reduction	in	the	exercise	price	for	an	 Ordinary	share	below	its	nominal	value. 	 Alterations	to	the	Scheme
The	directors	may	from	time	to	time	alter	the	Scheme	 provided	that	the	prior	approval	of	the	Company	 in	general	meeting	is	obtained	for	alterations	to	 the	advantage	of	option	holders. 	Such	approval	 is	not	required	if	the	alteration	is	necessary	or	 desirable	to	maintain	HMRC	approval, 	or	to	take	 advantage	of	provisions	of	any	existing	or	proposed	 legislation	relating	to	option	schemes, 	or	to	benefit	 the	administration	of	the	Scheme. 	No	amendment	 to	a	key	feature	of	the	Scheme	may	take	effect	until	 approved	by	HMRC. 	 Note
This	summary	sets	out	the	main	terms	of	the	Scheme. 		 However,	this	summary	does	not	form	part	of	the	 Scheme	and	shall	not	be	taken	as	affecting	the	 interpretation	of	its	detailed	rules. 	 The	directors	 reserve	the	right	up	to	the	time	of	the	 Annual	General	 Meeting	to	make	such	amendments	or	additions	 to	the	Scheme	as	they	may	consider	necessary	or	 appropriate	provided	that	such	amendments	or	 additions	do	not	conflict	in	any	material	respect	with	 this	summary	of	the	Scheme. 	 Documents	available	for	inspection
Copies	of	the	rules	of	 The	Broker	Network	Holdings	 plc	Savings	Related	Share	Option	Scheme	will	be	 available	for	inspection	at	the	Registered	Office	 of	the	Company, 	and	at	the	Company’s	Offices	at	 3rd	Floor, 	107	Fenchurch	Street, 	London, 	EC3M	5JF	 during	normal	business	hours	on	any	business	day	 (excluding	public	holidays)	from	this	date	of	this	 notice	until	the	close	of	the	 Annual	General	Meeting	 and	also	at	the	 Annual	General	Meeting	venue	for	at	 least	15	minutes	prior	to	and	during	the	meeting.

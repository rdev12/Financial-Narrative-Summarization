CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2009 
3 
 
As we report our ninth consecutive year of profitable trading, the financial results demonstrate that we have 
been resilient in the recession while positioning ourselves to benefit from our competitive advantage and any 
recovery in specific sectors.  
 
A year that saw the failure of a number of banks, a global financial crisis and the onset of recession was never 
going to be easy for business generally. 
 
Thanks in no small part to the diversity of our client base, we have remained profitable after successfully 
realigning our income towards robust sectors, such as transport, health and energy, where stakeholder 
communications is often a statutory requirement.  At the same time, we have worked to retain a presence in 
cyclical sectors, such as property and consumer, the revenues from which could grow as circumstances 
improve.   
 
We have lowered our cost base which will enable modest revenue increases to generate improved profitability, 
as we saw in the fourth quarter which was by far the best of the year. 
 
While our main focus has been on delivering profitable trading in the existing business, we were able to extend 
our geographical reach to Belfast and Dublin by acquiring Life Communications on 1 July 2009 using funds 
from a Placing, which raised £0.47m. 
 
Our trading has continued to generate cash and all the earn-out obligations from acquisitions made prior to the 
current year have been fully settled. 
 
Financial Review 
 
Though remaining profitable, the group saw its revenue decline by 11% in the year to £6.70m (2008: £7.51m). 
Apart from public affairs and the NHS-focused healthcare division, all parts of the business experienced lower 
revenues in the year. 
  
In the consumer, housing, technology, conference and training sectors, decreases in revenue were caused by 
the downturn in the economy generally. However, in the energy sector, lower-than-expected revenue was 
caused by operational delays to some substantial contracted projects that were due to start in the final quarter. 
These projects have now started and will help underpin trading in 2009-10. 
 
We are encouraged by a 20% increase in revenue in our creative and marketing services division in the 
second half, bringing it back – after a poor first half - to the trading levels achieved in 2007-08. This partly 
reflected greater cross-selling, particularly by the healthcare team, which secured a number of substantial 
projects for NHS clients. We have decided to retain the Merlin brand for this part of the business, both to 
distinguish it from Freshwater’s core PR and public affairs proposition and to take advantage of the name’s 
goodwill value in Wales. 
 
The group began to align costs with the new economic realities as soon as the scale of the economic 
downturn became clear. Staffing levels were reduced from 123 (117 full time equivalents, ‘fte’) in September 
2008 to 94 (85 fte) in August 2009 (excluding Life Communications). We also moved all London-based staff 
into one office in June 2009, deferred the annual salary review, reduced the size of the board from eight to five 
and cut discretionary spending. 
 
The cost reduction programme will deliver annualised savings of more than £1.4m, but the benefits have come 
through gradually and will not be fully felt until the second quarter of 2009-10. Further cost savings 
implemented recently will benefit the second half of the year. 
 
The reduction in revenue ahead of comparable cost savings led to a 56% decrease in EBITDA to £0.61m 
(2008: £1.40m) and a 79% decrease in net profit before income tax to £0.24m (2008: £1.17m). 
 
However, profitability was better in the second half than the first and the EBITDA margin reached 16% in the 
final quarter (2008: 19%).  Basic earnings per share were 1.53p (2008: 6.26p).

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2009 (CONTINUED) 
4
Financial Review (continued) 
 
The effective tax charge of 14% of profit before income tax (2008: 36%) was in line with our expectations and 
the result of the Group benefiting from a revision to its prior year tax charge and certain tax losses that 
previously were unable to be recognised under accounting rules.  
 
Total borrowings at the year end were £0.85m, down from £1.04m at the end of the previous financial year. 
We also achieved a positive operating cash flow of £0.41m through profitable trading and strong working 
capital control, which led to a substantial reduction in the relative level of debtors. We had no significant bad 
debt issues during the year. 
 
In addition, we have now consolidated our position on 34 supplier frameworks, including several COI and NHS 
rosters, and are seeing a steady flow of new business opportunities as a result.   
 
Dividend 
 
The board proposed a final dividend of 0.5p, which when added to the interim dividend of 0.75p, made a total 
dividend for the year of 1.25p (2008: 3.0p).  At this level, the total dividend is covered 1.1 times (2008: 2 
times). The dividend was paid on 5 January, 2010 to shareholders on the register on 27 November, 2009. 
 
Board and employees 
 
I would like to express my appreciation to my immediate predecessor, Baroness Cohen of Pimlico, who 
stepped down on 12 February 2009.  Lady Cohen served on the board for two years, contributing invaluable 
experience as we took Freshwater on to AIM and established ourselves as a listed company. 
 
Another former Chairman, Bart Haines, an early stage investor in the business and a non-executive director 
for five years, retired from the board on the same date.  We are grateful to Bart, who served as Chairman for 
two years, for the corporate experience he brought to the company as a former senior executive of Dow 
Corning. 
 
I would also like to thank David Howell, another private investor in the business, who stood down from the 
board on 11 June 2009 after five years. David served as Chairman prior to Bart and has played a key role in 
developing the group’s strategy, drawing on his own business experience in consultancy and commercial 
property. 
 
In June, Edward Carter switched from an executive to a non-executive director role, including the 
chairmanship of the Audit Committee.  Edward, who is a Chartered Accountant and former Ernst & Young 
partner, joined the board having been the managing director of one of the businesses that we acquired in 
2005.   
 
Finally, I would like to express my personal thanks to all our employees, who have worked tirelessly and 
effectively through the most challenging of circumstances.They have demonstrated their ability to cope with 
difficult economic times and I am convinced that they form an excellent team as we move forward in 2009-10. 
 
Outlook 
 
The recession has undoubtedly had an impact on Freshwater’s ability to deliver profitable growth and as a 
result of the impact of the economic climate on the Company’s trading performance, the Board has decided 
that it will undertake a strategic review that will include consideration of a number of options for the future 
development of the business.  
 
However, we have a sound platform for the future with strong revenue opportunities and an efficient cost 
structure.  After a slow start to 2009-10, we have seen continued strengthening of our order book both 
involving new clients and additional work from existing clients. With a combination of that improvement and the 
operational efficiencies that have been implemented, if there is no deterioration in the UK economy, I expect to 
be in a position to report further progress in respect of the current financial year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2009  
5 
 
The group has proved its strength and resilience by maintaining healthy revenue levels in most of its markets 
while implementing a comprehensive cost reduction programme. As a result, we achieved a significant 
improvement in profitability in the second half.  
 
We are pleased to report that 2008-09 also saw the successful completion and settlement of the earn-outs 
relating to acquisitions made in 2007-08, the delivery of positive operating cash flow, a reduction of borrowings 
from £1.04m to £0.85m, a Placing, which successfully raised £0.47m and the acquisition of Life 
Communications in Belfast and Dublin. 
 
Freshwater’s diverse client base, wide range of specialisms and extensive geographical reach continue to be a 
source of strength and competitive advantage, helping the group meet the challenge of difficult market 
conditions. 
 
During 2008-09, we made considerable progress in combining different elements of our regional-specialist 
offering to win additional business. Notable examples include: 
 
• Work for National Grid expanding from Leeds to Glasgow, Sheffield and Birmingham 
• PR support for John Lewis shop openings in Cardiff, Leicester, Poole and Stratford  
• Stakeholder communications activity for E.On in Bristol, Sheffield and County Durham 
• Our first public affairs brief in the health sector 
• Appointment by bed retailer Dreams to handle four store openings 
• PR and public affairs support for High Speed Rail, a consortium of eleven local authorities 
• The launch of the National Blood Service’s ‘blood buddies’ campaign 
• NHS new business wins in Wales and the North West 
• A multi-office PR campaign for Morgan Technical Ceramics 
 
We now have a model for creating combined regional-specialist teams that involves developing expertise 
across the regions linked to the relevant specialist division. These ‘extended specialist networks’ apply to work 
for energy, NHS and technology clients and are now being introduced in public affairs and consumer. The 
group has always had some specialists in the regions but this approach, incorporating training and 
placements, is expanding and deepening the skills base of the business. 
 
The group provided services to 345 clients in 2008-09. We continue to see growth from our larger clients as 
we focus on broadening our relationships with them.  At the same time, the recession has led to a reduction in 
the number of clients spending £5,000 or less annually with us, mainly because of a drop in demand for lower 
value services such as media training. While we expect to see an increase in the latter as the economy 
recovers, we view the former as an integral part of our strategy and are pleased the number of clients 
spending £100,000 or more with us has increased from nine to 12. The three largest clients were National Grid 
– 8.4% of revenue, QVC – 4.4% and Environment Agency – 3.8%. 
 
The revenue from each sector in 2008-09 was as follows (prior year in brackets): 
 
• Public sector     22% (17%) 
• Transport     20% (12%) 
• Consumer/retail    18% (23%) 
• Energy      11% (11%) 
• Professional and business services   9% (12%) 
• Housing and property        8% (12%) 
• Industry and technology       7% (7%) 
• Education         3% (3%) 
• Others          2% (3%) 
 
Public sector revenue grew 15% to £1.47m mainly due to an increase in work for the Environment Agency and 
in the NHS. Other public sector clients include the Welsh Assembly Government, the Welsh Local Government 
Association, the London Probation Service and a consortium of five district councils in Norfolk.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2009 (CONTINUED) 
6 
 
Transport was our second largest sector as a result of a full year contribution from Waterfront, the public 
affairs business acquired on 1 December, 2007. Now rebranded Freshwater Public Affairs, the division had a 
good year, contributing six of the group’s top 12 clients – Deutsches Bahn, Bristol Port Company, Mersey 
Travel, Port of Tilbury, the Association of Train Operating Companies and the Civil Aviation Authority. 
 
In the energy sector, stakeholder communications support provided to our largest client, National Grid, 
continues to develop across the group. Our Glasgow office successfully carried out its first community 
engagement project for National Grid, communicating with affected stakeholders about gas transmission 
infrastructure works at Drumshangie, near Airdrie.  Our Sheffield office is advising residents and businesses in 
the city about electricity transmission cable replacement. Our Birmingham office is helping to provide 
community relations support to National Grid Property, the division responsible for the remediation of former 
gas works. Meanwhile, our Leeds office has played a key role in informing and consulting affected 
communities in the North East about major overhead electricity line up-rating activity required to transfer to 
England renewable power generated in Scotland, which has now been approved by the relevant local 
authorities and the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The group has also embarked upon the first 
phase of challenging long-term consultation activity required in the north of England, to enable National Grid to 
build high-voltage electricity connections and infrastructure for the next generation of nuclear power stations. 
           
Though revenue from clients in the consumer, property and professional services sectors has decreased, we 
still see these as important markets with potential for recovery and growth. We also have a healthy client 
portfolio in industry and technology, shared mainly between a specialist PR team and Merlin Creative and 
Marketing. 
 
Education is another sector with potential for growth, building on specialist expertise we are developing 
through work for clients such as University of Wales Lampeter, Sheffield Hallam University, Neath Port Talbot 
College and Coleg Gwent.     
 
The acquisition of Life Communications, which contributed two months trading in the year under review, has 
brought into the group a number of new clients including Pepsico, Walkers Snacks and Gala stores. 
 
Waterfront Conference Company, which was acquired in December 2007, faced the same acute difficulties as 
other businesses in the conference market, which suffered from wholesale cuts in discretionary spending. 
After a thorough review, we decided to retain the Waterfront name, rather than rebrand to Freshwater, and 
build on its reputation for high quality policy conferences in areas such as transport, planning and energy. The 
division has entered into 2009-10 with a much lower fixed cost base, an attractive programme of events and a 
flow of bookings that gives us confidence there will be a return to profit in the first half. 
 
The reduction in staffing levels helped the group maintain a healthy level of revenue per fte of £68,001 (2008: 
£69,130). We expect to see an increase in revenue per head in 2009-10 as agreed cost savings take effect 
and through organic growth in some sectors. 
 
Strategy 
 
Freshwater is not basing its strategy on a belief that a recovery will come early. Though we are well-placed to 
benefit as and when the economy improves, our focus is on continuing to develop our integrated regional-
specialist model and build a modern communications business that will, through competitive advantage, 
achieve a larger market share, whatever the circumstances. 
 
We will also continue to leverage the potential of our broad client base and develop new business in those 
sectors and specialist disciplines with the best prospects for growth. This includes meeting the needs of clients 
for whom communication with stakeholders is a legal requirement, often funded from capital budgets. It also 
includes honing our offering in newer areas of activity such as digital media and social marketing.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2009 (CONTINUED) 
7
Outlook 
 
The economic environment remains challenging, but the action we have taken to reduce costs and increase 
our focus on relatively stable sectors has given us a robust platform.   
 
We believe our revenue from energy, transport and health sectors will continue to be strong through the next 
12 months, and we are well placed to benefit from any improvement in consumer, property and technology.  
 
Revenues this year will also be helped by a number of significant contracts that were delayed in the final 
quarter. These delays also affected the first quarter but the projects have now started and will help the rest of 
the year. 
 
This, together with the impact of costs savings, gives us cause to view the immediate and long term future of 
the Company with confidence. However in the light of the impact of the economic climate on the Company’s 
trading performance, the Board has decided that it will undertake a strategic review that will include 
consideration of a number of options for the future development of the business.

DIRECTORS' REPORT 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2009 
9 
 
The Directors present their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31
 
August 2009. 
 
Principal activities  
 
Freshwater Group (‘the Group’ or ‘Freshwater’) comprises Freshwater UK Plc (the ‘Company’) and its 
subsidiary undertakings. The Group’s principal activity is the provision of public relations and marketing 
services. The Company operates as a service company providing staff and administrative services to other 
Group members.  
 
Business Review  
 
A review of the Group’s business and the likely future developments therein is provided in the Chief 
Executive’s Review. Financial and other key performance indicators (‘KPI’) including revenue per full time 
employee have been used in the Chief Executive’s Review to facilitate the understanding of the development, 
performance and position of the Group’s business. The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group 
can be categorised as follows: 
 
Client loss 
 
Client losses hurt although some turnover over time is normal and to be expected. During the financial year 
Freshwater provided services to over 300 clients with only 3 accounting for more than 3% of revenue. A 
diverse and balanced client base mitigates the impact of any individual loss. 
 
Economic 
 
Our industry has not been immune to the recent economic downturn and at a macro level there is increased 
competition to satisfy reduced demand from a rapidly changing market place. We believe however that 
Freshwater is well placed to compete in these difficult times and is helped in this by its exposure to defensive 
sectors such as utilities, healthcare, transport and the public sector. 
 
Staff loss 
 
As a people based business our staff play a critical role in our client offering, and the loss of key staff could be 
a risk to our client relationships. To offset this risk, we have developed a team based approach to client 
service, so that no one member of staff is the sole point of contact with any given client. The Group 
additionally seeks to pursue employment practices that attract, retain and develop the talent it needs for its 
ongoing success.   
 
Results and dividends 
 
The Group’s results are on page 17. The Directors proposed the payment of a final ordinary dividend of 0.5p 
(2008:1.5p) per qualifying share. With the interim dividend of 0.75p per qualifying share (2008:1.5p) this 
produced a total ordinary dividend of 1.25p per qualifying share. The final ordinary dividend was paid on 5 
January 2010 to qualifying shareholders on the register on 27 November 2009. The financial statements do 
not reflect the final ordinary dividend which will be accounted for as an appropriation of retained earnings in 
the year ending 31 August 2010.  
 
Post balance sheet events  
 
In January 2010 the Group agreed a new overdraft facility and an amendment to the £1.2 million term loan it 
entered in February 2007. The Group’s borrowings have otherwise remained unchanged since 31 August 
2009. Further information on the new arrangements which have provided the Group with additional working 
capital is provided in notes 21 and 24 to the financial statements.

Creditor payment policy 
 
The Group agrees payment terms with its suppliers when it enters into binding purchase contracts. The Group 
seeks to abide by the payment terms agreed with suppliers whenever it is satisfied that the supplier has 
provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. The Group seeks to treat 
all of its suppliers fairly. At the end of the financial year creditor days were at 65 for the Company and the 
Group (2008: 60). 
 
Political and charitable donations 
 
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £1,000 (2008: £1,000). The Political Parties, Elections 
and Referendums Act 2000 (the ‘Act’) requires disclosure of any donations to an EU political organization 
(including a registered political party in the UK) or EU political expenditure in excess of £200. The terms 
‘donation’, ‘EU political organisation’ and ‘EU political expenditure’ are given broad definitions by the Act.  
Whilst the Group does not make donations to political parties or incur political expenditure within the normal 
meaning of those expressions, as part of its normal work on behalf of clients and as part of its own marketing, 
the Group can need to attend or sponsor events which are organised by political parties or other political 
organisations for which a charge is made. During the year the Group contributed an amount less than £2,000 
towards the catering costs of a commemorative event organised by the South African High Commission. 
 
Financial instruments 
 
A commentary on the financial instruments held by the Group and the Group’s exposure to credit, interest rate 
and liquidity risk is provided in note 18 to the financial statements. 
 
Corporate Governance 
 
The Company is not required to comply with the ‘Combined Code on Corporate Governance’ issued in June 
2008 by the Financial Reporting Council (‘the 2008 FRC Combined Code’) and does not report on how it has 
applied the principles therein or on the extent to which it has complied with the provisions therein throughout 
the year. The Company’s Directors are however committed to ensuring a high standard of corporate 
governance that reflects the 2008 FRC Combined Code in a manner proportionate to the Group’s size. An 
insight into the Company’s current corporate governance practice is provided below.  FRESHWATER UK PLC

Corporate Governance (continued) 
 
Board of Directors 
 
The members of the Company’s Board of Directors (‘the Board’) are listed above. The Board includes both 
Executive and Non-executive Directors. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by 
separate individuals. In the situation where Executive Directors take on Non-executive roles the Board 
considers that this does not necessarily affect their independence. In determining whether there are any such 
issues the Board takes into account the previous experience / background of the individual concerned. The 
Board meets regularly and its responsibilities include formulating, reviewing and approving strategy, budgets, 
acquisitions, capital expenditure and senior personnel appointments.   
 
Audit Committee 
 
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include monitoring the integrity of the Company’s and the Group’s 
financial statements, reviewing the external auditor’s independence, objectivity and effectiveness and making 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external 
auditor. The following individuals served as members of the Audit Committee during the year.  
 
 Appointed Resigned  
E G Carter 8 June 2009 - 
Baroness Cohen of Pimlico 16 July 2007 1 October 2008 
D Howell 16 July 2007 8 June 2009 
M-L Windeler 1 October 2008 -  
 
Other individuals including other Directors of the Company and the Company’s auditors may attend meetings 
of the Audit Committee at its request.   
 
Remuneration Committee 
 
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee include reviewing the performance of the Company’s 
Executive Directors and setting the scale and structure of their remuneration and the basis of their service 
agreements and appointment with due regard to the interests of shareholders. The Remuneration Committee 
also determines the bonuses to be paid to Executive Directors. The following Non-executive Directors served 
as members of the Remuneration Committee during the year:  
 
 Appointed Resigned  
Baroness Cohen of Pimlico 16 July 2007 1 October 2008 
E G Carter  8 June 2009  - 
D B Haines 16 July 2007 12 February 2009  
D Howell 16 July 2007 8 June 2009 
M-L Windeler 8 June 2009 - 
 
Other individuals including other Directors of the Company and the Company’s auditors may attend meetings 
of the Remuneration Committee at its request.   
 
The remuneration of Non-executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors who consider it 
essential, notwithstanding the size of the Company, to recruit and retain individuals of the highest calibre. The 
Executive Directors believe it is in the interests of shareholders that Non-executive Directors should be able to 
acquire shares and be provided with share options in addition to the fees they receive for their services.

Going concern 
 
The Directors, at the time of the approving the financial statements, have determined that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.  
 
In reaching this conclusion the Directors noted that the Company and the Group had net current liabilities on 
31 August 2009 and considered the Company’s and the Group’s recent and forecast financial performance. 
The current economic environment is difficult, however, after taking into account a range of variances in the 
Company’s and Group’s forecast financial performance and the arrangements in place with the Company’s 
and the Group’s bankers described in notes 21 and 24 to the financial statements, the Directors consider that 
the Company and the Group has, and should continue to have, adequate working capital to meet its 
requirements for the foreseeable future. For this reason the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. 
 
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors  
 
As far as the Directors are aware there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware and they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information. 
 
The auditors, PKF (UK) LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue in office, and a resolution that they be 
re-appointed will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. 
 
This report was approved by the Board on 2 February 2010 and signed on its behalf by:

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2009 
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the directors' report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.  
 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have, as required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange, elected to prepare the group 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union and have also elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with 
those standards. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group and of the profit 
or loss of the group for that period. In preparing these financial statements the directors are required to: 
 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company and the group will continue in business. 
 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
company and the group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of the financial statements and other information included in annual reports may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF FRESHWATER UK PLC 
15 
 
We have audited the financial statements of Freshwater UK Plc for the year ended 31 August 2009 which 
comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and company balance sheets, the consolidated 
and company statements of changes in equity, the consolidated and company cash flow statements and the 
related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards 
the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006.   
 
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with sections 495 and 496 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors' report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
 
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
 
Scope of the audit 
 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
 
Opinion on financial statements 
 
In our opinion; 
 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and the parent company’s 
affairs as at 31 August 2009 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; 
 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; 
and 
 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006. 
 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
 
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
 
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2009 
23 
 
1. FRESHWATER GROUP  
 
Freshwater Group (‘the Group’) comprises Freshwater UK Plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiary 
undertakings. The Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the United 
Kingdom. Its ordinary shares are traded on the Alternative Investment Market. The Company’s 
registered number is 4059741 (England and Wales) and its registered office is Raglan House, Cardiff 
Gate Business Park, Cardiff, CF23 8RB. 
 
2. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE   
 
The group and parent company financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 August 
2009 (‘the financial statements’) were authorised for issue by the Company’s Board on 2 February 2010 
and signed on the board’s behalf by S B Howell and J H Evans. The financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) adopted by the 
European Union (‘EU’) and in accordance with applicable provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
3. BASIS OF PREPARATION   
 
 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs and International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations issued and effective for the year ended 31 
August 2009.  
  
 The Directors, at the time of the approving the financial statements, have determined that there is a 
 reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
 operational existence for the foreseeable future. In reaching this conclusion the Directors noted that the 
 Company and the Group had net current liabilities on 31 August 2009 and considered the Company’s 
 and the Group’s recent and forecast financial performance. The current economic environment is 
 difficult, however, after taking into account a range of variances in the Company’s and Group’s forecast 
 financial performance and the arrangements in place with the Company’s and the Group’s bankers 
 described in notes 21 and 24 to the financial statements, the Directors consider that  the Company and 
 the Group has, and should continue to have, adequate working capital to meet its requirements for 
 the foreseeable future. For this reason Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing 
 the financial statements. 
 
4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out 
below. These policies were consistently applied. The functional currency and presentational currency of 
the Group is Sterling. 
 
a)  Basis of consolidation 
 
 The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and the entities 
that it controls (its subsidiaries) drawn up to 31 August each year. Control comprises the power to 
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries are incorporated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on 
which control passed to the Group, and continue to be included until the date that such control ceases. 
The effects of intra-group transactions and intra-group balances are eliminated in full. 
 
b) Revenue and turnover 
 
 Revenue comprises professional fees and mark-ups. Professional fees and mark-ups are recognised in 
proportion to the extent to which the service to be provided under the related contract has been 
performed. Revenue is stated exclusive of value added tax. Turnover (billings) is revenue stated gross 
of marginal costs such as print costs and the purchase of advertising space that are incurred in 
providing a service and that in accordance with industry practice are marked up and passed on to 
clients. Amounts billed to clients in advance are carried in the balance sheet as deferred income until 
the related service has been provided or the related cost incurred. Work carried out and costs incurred 
that are to be marked up and passed on to clients that have yet to be invoiced are included in accrued 
income.

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
 
c)  Segmental analysis  
 
 A geographical segment is a distinguishable component of an enterprise that provides products and 
services within a particular economic environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are 
different from those of components operating in other economic environments. A business segment is a 
distinguishable component of an enterprise that provides products or services and that is subject to 
risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. The Group’s significant 
operations are entirely within the UK and the Group is not considered to consist of differing geographical 
segments. All the Group’s significant operations are in the business of providing public relations and 
marketing services and the Group is not considered to comprise of differing business segments. In the 
absence of differing business and geographical segments segmental information is not provided. 
 
d) Dividends 
 
 Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are considered to have become no longer at the 
discretion of the Company. Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid. Final 
dividends are recognised in the period in which they are appropriately authorised.  
 
e) Property, plant and equipment 
 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses. The residual values of property, plant and equipment are reassessed annually and 
when there is an indication of a change in residual value. Freehold land is not depreciated. Property, 
plant and equipment is depreciated so as to write off cost less estimated residual value over its 
expected life on the following bases: 
 
• Freehold buildings – 3% straight line 
• Leasehold land and buildings– 33% straight line 
• Plant and Machinery – 25% reducing balance  
• Motor Vehicles – 25% on cost 
• Fittings and equipment – 10% - 25% reducing balance  
 
f)  Business combinations within the scope of IFRS 3 – Business Combinations 
 
Business combinations within the scope of IFRS 3 are accounted for under the purchase method. 
 
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business 
combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised. It comprises the excess of the 
cost of a business combination over the net value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed. The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and, in the case of a business 
combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in 
the acquiree. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Where the cost of a 
business combination is less than the net value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed the associated gain is recognised in the income statement in the period of acquisition.  
 
The terms of a business combination may require for purchase consideration to be provided subsequent 
to the acquisition date. The value of such deferred consideration may additionally be dependent upon 
future events. In such circumstances an estimate of the ultimate value of the deferred contingent 
consideration is recognised at the date of acquisition. Subsequent revisions are accounted for as a 
revision to the cost of the business combination and lead to a revision to the cost of goodwill associated 
with the combination. Such revisions are recognised prospectively in the accounting period that they are 
made. Deferred consideration is not discounted where the effect of such discounting is considered 
immaterial and is recognised as a liability or as a component of equity depending on its nature.

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
 
f)  Business combinations within the scope of IFRS 3 – Business Combinations (continued) 
 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated from the date of acquisition to the cash 
generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. In the event of the 
subsequent reorganisation of the cash generating units to which it has been allocated goodwill is 
correspondingly reallocated. Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. An impairment 
review consists of comparing the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill to its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less 
costs to sell and its value in use being an estimate of the present value of the future cash flows it is 
expected to generate. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount an impairment loss is 
recognised firstly by reducing the carrying amount of goodwill and then by reducing the carrying value of 
the other assets of the cash generating unit on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement. Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.  
 
g)  Business combinations outside the scope of IFRS 3 – Business Combinations  
 
Certain business combinations fall outside the scope of IFRS 3 including combinations that involve 
entities or businesses under common control (e.g. group restructurings). IFRS does not provide specific 
guidance on how to account for such combinations. In the absence of such guidance the Group refers to 
IFRS 3 and other elements of generally accepted accounting practice and explicitly discloses the 
accounting treatment it has followed.  
 
h)  Other intangible assets  
 
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. They are amortised to residual values on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may 
not be recoverable. Amortisation is included in administrative expenses in the income statement.  
 
i)  Trade receivables 
 
Trade receivables are stated at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful 
receivables. Provision is made where there is objective evidence that the group will be unable to recover 
balances in full. Trade receivables are not discounted as the effect would not be material.  
  
j)  Derivative financial instruments  
  
The Group has sought to manage its interest rate risk through entering an interest (base) rate swap. 
The contract is carried at fair value with any gains or losses being taken to the income statement.   
 
k)  Cash and cash equivalents 
 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of change in value. The group overdraft facility is an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management strategy and is considered to form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of 
the statement of cash flows. 
 
l)  Trade payables 
 
 Trade payables are stated at cost. They are not discounted as the effect would not be material.

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
 
m)  Borrowings 
 
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
calculated in accordance with the effective interest method.  
 
n)  Leases  
 
Where the use of an asset is funded by leasing arrangements that give rights over the asset 
approximating to ownership the asset is accounted for as if it has been purchased and recognised at the 
lower of fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The capital element of the 
obligations under the associated leasing arrangements is shown as obligations under finance leases 
and lease payments are apportioned between interest which is charged to the income statement and 
liability which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the 
outstanding lease obligations. All other leases are considered operating leases and payments 
thereunder are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the 
lease term.   
 
o)  Deferred taxation 
 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Exceptionally such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the recognition of goodwill or the initial 
recognition (other than a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither taxable profit or accounting profit. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is 
reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
    
p)  Share based payments  
 
The cost of equity settled share option contracts is measured as the fair value of the associated options 
at the date of their grant. Fair value is calculated using the recognised Black–Scholes–Merton 
methodology. This cost is expensed on a straight line basis over the associated vesting period in a 
manner that reflects the expectation of the number of options that will eventually vest.  More particularly 
at each balance sheet date before vesting the cumulative charge that should have been expensed in 
view of the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management’s then best estimate of the 
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest is calculated. The movement in the cumulative 
expense since the previous balance sheet date is then recognised as an expense in the income 
statement with a corresponding entry in equity.  
 
q)  Accounting estimates and judgements 
 
In applying the accounting polices detailed above decisions sometimes have to be made as to the likely 
 outcome of future events. Those judgements and estimates made in preparing the financial statements 
 are based on historical experience and assumptions that the Directors believed were reasonable in the 
circumstances.

4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
 
q)  Accounting estimates and judgements (continued) 
 
The Directors consider the key judgements and estimates made in preparing the financial statements to 
have been those relating to: 
 
• the recognition of revenue in relation to contracts which straddle the year end; 
• the valuation of deferred contingent consideration; and; 
• the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
  
 These judgements and estimates are discussed in more detail both above and in the relevant notes to 
 the financial statements.  
 
r)  Impact of standards not yet effective  
 
The Directors have considered standards and interpretations which have been issued but are not yet 
effective and have not been early adopted by the Group. 
 
IFRS 8 - Operating Segments. This is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2009 and replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting. It has been adopted by the EU. Adoption of the standard 
will have no effect on the Group’s reported profit or equity. The Directors have not yet completed their 
evaluation of the impact of adoption on the disclosures in the group financial statements. 
 
IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements Revised. This is effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2009. It has yet to be adopted by the EU. Adoption of the standard would have no 
effect on the Group’s reported profit or equity. The Directors have not yet completed their evaluation of 
the potential impact of adoption on the disclosures in the group financial statements. 
  
 IAS 23 – Borrowing Costs Revised. This is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2009. It has yet to be adopted by the EU. The revised standard eliminates the current option of 
expensing borrowing costs if they relate to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying 
asset. The Directors have not yet completed their evaluation of the potential impact of adoption.  
  
 IFRS 3 – Business Combinations Revised. This is applicable to business combinations occurring in 
accounting periods beginning or after 1 July 2009. It has yet to be adopted by the EU. The revised 
standard differs in a number of respects and inter alia requires all transaction costs as well as revisions 
to the valuation of deferred contingent consideration as a result of post acquisition events to be 
expensed through the income statement. Adoption of the revised standard would not require the 
restatement of the accounting for business combinations that were effected in the current or prior 
periods.   
 
 It is not expected that the adoption of those other standards or interpretations so far issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board that are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 September 2009 will have a material impact on the financial statements.  
 
5. RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVES  
 
 In prior year financial statements amounts accrued for work done and costs incurred that are to be 
marked up and passed on to clients were reported as inventories on the face of the Group and 
Company balance sheets and disclosed in the notes to the financial statements as work in progress and 
stocks. The Company consider that such amounts are more appropriately reported as trade and other 
receivables and disclosed in the notes to the financial statements as accrued income. In addition the 
Group and Company have disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet deferred consideration 
receivable and payable whereas in the prior year they were disclosed in trade and other receivables and 
trade and other payables respectively. Prior year information has been restated accordingly. 
Restatement has had a presentational impact only and has not resulted in the restatement of the 
Group’s prior year profits or equity.

 The Company is the sole employer within the Group. Bonuses dependent upon the achievement of 
certain financial and non-financial targets are payable to qualifying employees following the end of a 
financial year. Included in wages and salaries are bonuses of £nil (2008: £20,768). The Group’s holiday 
year runs from 1 January to 31 December and employees are entitled to accumulate holiday not taken 
within a leave cycle subject to a maximum of 5 days. This must be taken within 12 months of the end of 
the associated leave cycle. Unused accrued holiday benefits vest upon the termination of employment 
and provision is made to reflect this. The Group offers qualifying employees the opportunity to enter into 
a group personal pension contract that provides money purchase benefits. More generally at the 
request of a qualifying employee the Group will contribute an amount equal to 3% of their basic salary to 
a personal pension arrangement of their choice.

 Changes during the year 
 
 Goodwill in the Group and Company balance sheets increased by £1,475,001 during the year as a 
 result  of the acquisition of Life Communications and the finalisation of the amount payable under the 
 earn-out arrangements associated with the acquisition of the Waterfront Partnership. Goodwill in the 
 Company’s balance sheet also changed as a result of two of the Company’s subsidiaries, Freshwater 
 Northern Limited and Freshwater Midlands Limited, transferring their trades to other Group members.
 These transfers were done so as to help the Group rationalise its legal structure and reduce its 
 administrative overheads. The transfers constituted business combinations involving entities under 
 common control. IFRS does not provide specific guidance on how such combinations should be 
 accounted for. In accounting for the transfers the carrying value in the Company’s balance  sheet of its 
 investments in the subsidiaries was reduced by the goodwill carried in the Group’s consolidated 
 balance sheet in relation to these entities. Goodwill in the Company’s balance sheet was increased by a 
 corresponding amount. The accounting which served to reflect the transfers of value between the 
 Company’s subsidiaries had no impact on goodwill recognised in Group’s consolidated balance sheet.

Impairment testing of cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. 
 
The Group is considered to comprise of a single cash generating unit. In accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy the carrying value of this unit including the goodwill in the Group’s consolidated 
balance sheet has been tested for impairment. This was done in a similar manner to prior years with 
recoverable amount being taken as value in use. In calculating value in use the present value of the net 
cash flows expected to be generated over the next 10 years was considered (2008: 10 years). Expected 
future cash flows were based on the Group’s budget for the financial year ending 31 August 2010 and 
the assumption that cash flows will grow steadily thereafter at 2.5% per annum (2008: 2.5%). Present 
value was calculated using a pre-tax discount factor of 8% (2008: 7%). In determining the assumptions 
used in this year’s impairment review management considered a range of factors including the Group’s 
historic performance, the Group’s cost of capital and the approach adopted by other organisations 
within the industry. Different assumptions could have resulted in recoverable amount being calculated 
as less than carrying value and by way of example either a pre-tax discount factor of 11% or the 
assumption of a negative growth rate in subsequent year cash flows would have necessitated an 
impairment.

The Company acquired no new subsidiaries during the year. There were no disposals. During the year 
the Company received a dividend from a wholly owned subsidiary, Freshwater London Limited. To the 
extent that this comprised a distribution of pre-acquisition profits the Company did not recognise a gain 
but instead wrote down the carrying value of its investment in Freshwater London Limited by an amount 
equal to the dividend received.

vendors receiving a cash payment of £410,000 and being issued with 489,796 10p ordinary shares 
during the year ended 31 August 2009.  
 
The goodwill associated with this business combination is not potentially deductible for tax purposes.

Waterfront Conference Company’s financial performance in the 15 month earn out period did not 
warrant a further payment of cash or the issue of further ordinary shares in the Company.

period led to its vendors receiving a cash payment of £359,106 (after the deduction of the contingent net 
asset clawback of £215,894) and being issued with 561,098 ordinary shares during the year ended 31 
August 2009.   
 
The goodwill associated with this business combination is potentially deductible for tax purposes. 
 
d) Waterfront Public Affairs Limited 
 
On 2 December 2007 the Company transferred the business, assets and liabilities it had acquired from 
the Waterfront Partnership (see above) to a wholly owned subsidiary, Waterfront Public Affairs Limited. 
The goodwill that arose in the Company’s balance sheet as a result of the acquisition of the business 
and certain of the assets and liabilities of the Waterfront Partnership was not transferred. The transfer 
constituted a business combination involving entities under common control. IFRS does not provide 
specific guidance on how such combinations should be accounted for. In the absence of such guidance 
the assets and liabilities were transferred at book value and the trade for nil value.

The Company and the vendors agreed that the fair value of each of the 234,137 10p ordinary shares 
issued upon completion should be considered 85p after due regard to the quoted mid-market price of 
the Company's shares. The contingent net asset payment was agreed and settled in May 2008. The 
combined financial performance of Merlin Marketing and Public Relations Limited, Merlin Marketing and 
Creative Limited and Freshwater Wales Limited in the 12 month earn out period led to the vendors 
being issued 253,164 10p ordinary shares during the year ended 31 August 2009. 
 
The goodwill associated with this business combination is not potentially deductible for tax purposes.

17. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (CONTINUED)   
 
f) Merlin Marketing and Public Relations Limited / Merlin Marketing and Creative Limited (until 
   March 2009 Freshwater Creative Limited) / Freshwater Wales Limited 
 
On 31 August 2008 Merlin Marketing and Public Relations Limited transferred its marketing services 
business to Merlin Marketing and Creative Limited and its public relations business to Freshwater Wales 
Limited. All three companies are fellow wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. Merlin Marketing 
and Public Relations has not traded since 31 August 2008 and having collected outstanding debtors 
and settled outstanding creditors in an orderly manner will be dissolved. The transferred trades continue 
as going concerns. The transfers were done so as to help the Group rationalise its legal structure and 
reduce its administrative overheads. The transfers constituted business combinations involving 
businesses under common control. IFRS does not provide specific guidance on how such combinations 
should be accounted for. In the absence of such guidance the trades were transferred for nil value. In 
recognition of the transfers the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Merlin Marketing and 
Public Relations Limited in the Company’s balance sheet was reduced by £759,247 (being the carrying 
value of goodwill in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet in relation to Merlin Marketing and Public 
Relations Limited) and goodwill in the Company’s balance sheet increased by a corresponding amount.  
 
g) Freshwater Northern Limited / Freshwater Midlands Limited / Freshwater Wales Limited  
 
On 1 March 2009 Freshwater Northern Limited transferred its trade and certain assets to Freshwater 
(UK Regions) Limited (until May 2009 Lynx Public Relations Limited), a fellow wholly owned subsidiary 
of the Company. This was followed by Freshwater Midlands Limited and Freshwater Wales Limited both 
fellow wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company transferring their trades and certain assets to 
Freshwater (UK Regions) Limited on 1 June 2009. Freshwater Northern Limited, Freshwater Midlands 
Limited and Freshwater Wales Limited have not subsequently traded and having collected outstanding 
debtors and settled outstanding creditors in an orderly manner will be dissolved. The transferred trades 
continue as going concerns. The transfers were done so as to help the Group rationalise its legal 
structure and reduce its administrative overheads. Each constituted a business combination involving 
businesses under common control. IFRS does not provide specific guidance on how such combinations 
should be accounted for. In the absence of such guidance assets were transferred at book value and 
trades for nil value. In recognition of the transfers the carrying value of the Company’s investment in 
Freshwater Northern Limited was reduced by £86,878 (being the carrying value of goodwill in the 
Group’s consolidated balance sheet in relation to Freshwater Northern Limited) and goodwill in the 
Company’s balance sheet increased by a corresponding amount. In a similar manner the carrying value 
of the Company’s investment in Freshwater Midlands Limited was reduced by £512,294 and goodwill in 
the Company’s balance sheet increased by a corresponding amount.  
 
h) Life Communications  
 
On 1 July 2009 the Company acquired the business and certain of the fixed assets of a sole trader, 
 Life Communications, in exchange for a cash payment of £300,000, the issue of 263,505 10p ordinary 
 shares and certain contingent consideration. The contingent consideration provided included the 
 promise of a cash payment dependent on the agreed value of the fixed assets acquired at the comp-
 letion date. It also included the promise of a cash payment dependent on the financial performance 
 of the acquired business in the first year subsequent to completion and the promise of a further cash 
 payment dependent on the financial performance of the acquired business in the second year 
 subsequent  to completion. Up to 40% of the value of these cash payments may at the option of the 
 Company be settled by the issue of 10p ordinary shares at the average quoted mid-market price of the 
 Company’s shares in the last month of the respective earn out periods.

The Company and vendor agreed that the fair value of each of the 263,505 10p ordinary shares issued 
upon completion should be considered 37.9p after due regard to the quoted mid-market price of the 
Company’s shares. The contingent fixed asset payment was agreed and paid in September 2009. The 
estimates of the cash payments that will be made as a result of the earn out arrangements are on the 
expectation that the acquired business go through the top of its earn-out targets. Reduced amounts will 
be payable if this proves not to be the case. 
 
The goodwill associated with this business combination is potentially deductible for tax purposes. 
 
The acquired business contributed £152,841 to the Group’s revenue and £104,610 to the Group’s profit 
before income tax for the year ended 31 August 2009.  
 
i) Freshwater (UK Regions) Limited 
 
On 1 July 2009 the Company transferred the business and fixed assets it had acquired from Life 
Communications (see above) to a wholly owned subsidiary, Freshwater (UK Regions) Limited. The 
goodwill that arose in the Company’s balance sheet as a result of the acquisition of the business and 
certain of the fixed assets of Life Communications was not transferred. The transfer constituted a 
business combination involving entities under common control. IFRS does not provide specific guidance 
on how such combinations should be accounted for. In the absence of such guidance the fixed assets 
were transferred at book value and the trade for nil value.

18. FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (CONTINUED) 
 
During the year ended 31 August 2009 the Group and the Company faced credit risk, interest rate risk 
and liquidity risk as a result of their financial assets and liabilities. Neither faced significant currency risk 
being the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. There were no significant changes in the risks, the objectives, 
processes and policies for managing the risks or the methods used to measure the risks during the year 
ended 31 August 2009. 
 
Credit risk  
 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party 
by failing to discharge an obligation. The Group faces credit risk as a result of offering credit terms to its 
customers and holding cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions. The Company faces credit 
risk as a result of advancing funds to other Group members and as a result of holding cash and cash 
equivalents with financial institutions. The Group seeks to mitigate the risk that arises from offering 
credit terms by performing credit checks before terms are advanced and thereafter actively monitoring 
amounts receivable and denying additional credit when appropriate. Funds advanced by the Company 
to other Group members are repayable on demand. The Company looks to mitigate the risk that arises 
from advancing such funds by monitoring Group members’ financial position and performance on an 
ongoing basis and denying additional credit where appropriate. The risk that arises as a result of holding 
cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions is mitigated by both the Group and the Company 
holding the majority of such amounts with the same recognised UK high street bank that provides the 
Group’s overdraft facility and that provided the Company’s floating rate borrowings. Both the Group’s 
and the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the value of loans and receivables. 
 
 Interest rate risk  
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates. The Group and the Company primarily face interest rate 
risk as a result of the Company’s floating rate borrowings, a derivative contract entered into by the 
Company and through holding cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions. See notes 21, 23 
and 24. 
  
 Liquidity risk 
 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with 
 financial liabilities. The Group’s financial liabilities include its borrowings and trade and other payables. 
 See notes 22 and 24. Within the Group the responsibility for monitoring liquidity risk and for ensuring 
 that Group members are adequately funded has been centralised and lies with the ultimate parent 
 undertaking, Freshwater UK Plc, which leads all capital raising activities.

 Deferred consideration payable of £700,000 at 31 August 2009 is the Group’s best estimate of the value 
 it will have to pay as a result of the earn-out arrangements associated with the Company’s purchase 
 of the business and assets of Life Communications. See note 17. The Group had no other outstanding 
 earn-out related obligations.

Each group member’s primary current account is with the same recognised UK high street bank. On 31 
August 2009 a group overdraft facility was in place under which the aggregate of the balances on these 
accounts could be overdrawn by up to £400,000 subject to the aggregate of individual overdrawn 
balances not exceeding £2.3 million. Interest was payable at 1.75% above the counterparty bank’s base 
rate on any aggregate overdraft. Interest was receivable at 0% on any aggregate debtor balance. This 
facility was replaced in January 2010. The new facility allows the aggregate of the balances on group 
members’ primary current accounts to be overdrawn by up to £600,000 until 28 February 2010 and 
thereafter by up to £530,000 until 31 August 2010. Interest is payable at 4% above the counterparty 
bank’s base rate on any aggregate overdraft. Interest is receivable at 0% on any aggregate debtor 
balance. Any aggregate overdraft is secured by unlimited intercompany composite guarantees (under 
which Group members are jointly and severally liable for amounts outstanding) and various debentures 
by Group members in favour of the counterparty bank. The new facility is subject to the Group satisfying 
certain financial covenants and will be subject to review on at least an annual basis. Subsequent to 31 
August 2010 the maximum permitted overdraft will decline in monthly steps of £30,000 to £400,000.

In March 2007 the Company entered a free standing ten year sterling denominated amortising base rate 
swap to mitigate the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk as a result of the Company’s floating rate 
borrowings. Under the swap which had an initial nominal value of £900,000 the Company pays interest 
at a fixed rate of 5.6% in exchange for the counterparty bank's (floating) base rate. The swap is carried 
in the Company’s and the Group’s balance sheet at fair value as determined by the counterparty. It 
does not qualify for hedge accounting and associated gains or losses are recognised in the Group’s 
consolidated income statement under administrative expenses.

24. BORROWINGS (CONTINUED) 
 
The above amounts exclude interest. The Group’s borrowings on 31 August 2009 and 31 August 2008 
with the exception of ‘Various finance leases’ lay entirely within the Company. Carrying value is 
considered a fair proxy of fair value.  
 
The Group’s borrowings on 31 August 2009 with the exception of ‘Various finance leases’ were with a 
single counterparty bank and secured by unlimited intercompany composite guarantees (under which 
Group members are jointly and severally liable for amounts outstanding) and various debentures by 
Group members in favour of the counterparty bank. The amounts outstanding under the finance leases 
entered into during the year ended 31 August 2009 are additionally secured against certain of the 
Group’s fixed assets. The interest rates and repayment terms associated with the Group’s borrowings 
on 31 August 2009 were: 
 
   Interest rate   Repayment terms  
  Fixed rate    
  £76,000 finance lease  8%  Level monthly payments of capital and interest over 2.5 years 
  £95,000 finance lease   8%  Level monthly payments of capital and interest over 2.5 years 
  Various lease and HP   Various  Various 
       
  Floating rate      
  £1.2 million term loan  Base + 2.25%  Quarterly capital payments over 4 years 
  £180,000 term loan  Base + 2%  Level monthly payments of capital and interest over 5 years 
 
In January 2010 the Group agreed an amendment to the £1.2 million term loan it entered in February 
2007. At the date of the amendment £380,307 remained outstanding. This is now repayable in monthly 
instalments of £25,353 starting January 2011. The Group’s borrowings have otherwise remained 
unchanged since 31 August 2009.  
 
In March 2007 the Company entered a free standing ten year sterling denominated amortising base rate 
swap to mitigate the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk as a result of its floating rate borrowings. 
Since entering the swap the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk through its floating rate 
borrowings to the extent that they have exceeded the swap’s amortised nominal value. See note 23.

30. SHARE OPTIONS  
 
 The Company entered into share option contracts with employees of the Group under the umbrella of 
an Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme in February 2005, January 2006, July 2006, July 2007 
and June 2008. The contracts provide employees with the option to acquire ordinary shares in the 
Company at a fixed exercise price. An employee’s ability to exercise this option is not subject to any 
vesting criteria other than the passage of time and his or her continued employment by the Group. 
Exceptionally the occurrence of certain defined control events may cause the options under the 
contracts to fully vest immediately. All the contracts have a ten year term and lapse inter alia upon an 
employee either giving or receiving notice of the termination of his or her employment with the Group. 
Any obligations arising under the contracts are to be settled by the Company through the issue of new 
shares at the relevant exercise price.

 The Company determines the fair value of the share option contracts it enters on the grant date, adjusts 
this to reflect its expectation of the options that will ultimately vest and then expenses the calculated 
balance on a straight line basis through its income statement over the expected vesting period with a 
corresponding credit to its share option reserve. Subsequent changes to the expectation of the number 
of options that will ultimately vest are dealt with prospectively such that the cumulative amount charged 
to the income statement is consistent with latest expectations. Subsequent changes in what is 
considered to have been the fair value of options at the grant date do not impact the amount charged to 
the income statement. 
 
The Company determines the fair value of the share option contracts it enters using the recognised 
Black-Scholes-Merton methodology. In determining the fair value of the contracts it has entered into the 
Company made the following assumptions (ranges are provided in those instances where values differ 
across tranches). Expected volatility was determined with reference to historical experience.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjusting these amounts for the effects 
of dilutive potential ordinary shares. Contingent share consideration is taken into account from the 
earlier of the beginning of the period and the date of the related business combination to the extent that 
the relevant conditions have been met by the balance sheet date and the consideration is dilutive. In 
calculating diluted earnings per share for the year ended 31 August 2009 and the year ended 31 August 
2008 the share option contracts entered into by the Company in February 2005, January 2006, July 
2006, July 2007 and June 2008 were considered antidilutive due to the exercise price being greater 
than the Company’s recent share price.  
 
32  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
 
 Capital is defined as equity plus borrowings. The Group’s capital structure is driven by the parent 
company which leads all capital raising activities. The Group is not subject to any externally imposed 
capital requirements. In managing its capital structure the Group seeks inter alia to provide 
shareholders with returns commensurate with its stated strategy. The Group refers to a variety of ratios 
when considering its capital structure including the gearing ratio defined as borrowings divided by total 
capital and interest cover defined as operating profit divided by net interest expense. The table below 
identifies these ratios at the end of the current and prior financial year. It should be noted that these 
ratios are dynamic and that in the case of the Group which is growing and whose capital structure is 
constantly evolving are best considered over a period of time as opposed to at a given point in time.

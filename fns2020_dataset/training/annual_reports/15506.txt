OUR SERVICES 
Trading as the Utility Warehouse, Telecom Plus PLC provides a range of 
essential services to households and small to medium-sized businesses, 
giving customers the convenience of a single monthly bill, great value, 
and award-winning customer service. All customers become members of 
our Discount Club (‘Members’), giving them access to a wide range of 
additional benefits.
The Company avoids the need for expensive national advertising by 
working in partnership with over 44,000 part-time independent distributors 
(‘Partners’), who sign-up new customers by telling them about the 
advantages of joining the Club. 
In general, the more services a Member takes from us, the better value 
they receive, with our lowest prices available to those who have chosen 
our ‘Double Gold’ bundle (which includes all their energy and telephony 
services). Members can also benefit from using our exclusive CashBack 
card and online shopping tools.
Partners receive a small share of the revenues we receive from each new 
Member they introduce, which encourages them to focus on finding 
creditworthy customers who take multiple services from us. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 6
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
I am delighted to report another successful year for the Company 
in which we have laid solid foundations for the next phase of our 
development, whilst continuing to deliver strong levels of organic growth 
across all the core services we provide.
In particular, the negotiation of a new energy supply agreement with 
Npower during the autumn, which secures our access to the wholesale 
energy markets on improved commercial terms for a guaranteed period 
of 20 years, has already enabled us to improve the competitiveness of our 
retail energy tariffs compared with those offered by the ‘Big 6’ suppliers.
The ongoing improvement in the quality of our customer base,  
combined with the growth in the number of services we are providing, 
mean that revenue and profitability for the year have again both  
reached record levels.
RESULTS OVERVIEW
Adjusted pre-tax profits increased by over 25% to £44.6m (2013: £35.6m) on revenue up by 9.5% to 
£658.8m (2013: £601.5m); adjusted earnings per share for the year rose by 26.8% to 50.6p (2013: 
39.9p).
The relatively modest rise in revenue is due to continued strong organic growth in the number of customers 
using our services and industry wide increases in energy and telephony prices last autumn, partially offset 
by much lower average energy consumption by domestic households during an exceptionally mild winter.
Adjusted pre-tax profits and earnings per share grew at a substantially faster rate than revenue, reflecting 
the steadily increasing size of our customer base (which was on average 18% higher than during the 
preceding year), and an initial contribution from the new energy supply arrangements with Npower.
We remain encouraged by the strong growth in the number of services we are providing, which reached 
1,907,160 (2013: 1,602,060) by the year end – a record increase of over 305,000 services during the 
year and almost 40% higher than the growth achieved during the previous year. One of the highlights 
within this strong performance has been a doubling in the proportion of new Members taking all five 
of our core services (Gas, Electricity, Home Phone, Mobile and Broadband) since the introduction of 
our new bundled service structure in November 2013. The average number of services taken by each 
residential Club Member has increased to 3.64 (2013: 3.54); these figures have been adjusted to reflect 
the auto-enrolment into the Club for the first time of around 60,000 residential customers (generally those 
who had moved into a property where we were already the incumbent energy supplier, and who have 
never consciously bought into our core multi-utility brand proposition), following our decision to abolish 
membership fees for all residential customers in the autumn. 
‘‘
” Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 7
In line with previous guidance, we are proposing a final dividend of 19p (2013: 18p), bringing the total 
for the year to 35p (2013: 31p); this represents an increase of almost 13% compared with last year, but 
on a significantly larger number of shares in issue following the equity fundraising in December 2013. We 
remain committed to a progressive dividend policy, although the rate of increase will be tempered over the 
next few years as we service and repay the £100m of debt we borrowed in the autumn to part-fund the 
transaction with Npower.
We were delighted to receive a number of further endorsements from Which? during the year recognising 
both the value we offer and the quality of service provided by our UK based customer service team, 
including being ranked first in their most recent survey of Fixed Telephony and Broadband suppliers, and 
being nominated in two categories at their 2014 Annual Awards. This is a reflection of the continuing 
focus and significant ongoing resources invested into delivering the best possible service to our Members, 
consistent with securing our position as the Nation’s most trusted utility supplier. 
Our share of the profits from Opus Energy Group Limited (“Opus”), in which we maintain a 20% stake, 
increased during the year to £4.7m (2013: £3.4m). This is an excellent result and reflects the continuing 
strong trading performance of the business.
NEW ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS 
In December 2013 we completed a transformational deal with Npower, which secured our supply of 
wholesale energy for 20 years on improved commercial terms. This transaction involved us purchasing two 
of their subsidiaries, Gas Plus Supply Limited and Electricity Plus Supply Limited, for a total consideration 
of £218m (of which £21.5m is deferred for three years). The initial consideration was funded by a heavily 
oversubscribed equity fundraising which raised £130m before expenses, and new debt facilities provided 
by Barclays Bank.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
We restructured the way we present and sell our services during the autumn by introducing an attractive 
range of ‘Gold’ bundles (with enhanced benefits and lower pricing available for Members choosing to 
take all their utilities from us), making our unique multi-utility sales proposition simpler for new Members to 
understand and easier for our Partners to promote.
At the same time we reduced the number of energy tariffs we offer to comply with our new licence 
obligations, following Ofgem’s Retail Market Review, whilst taking advantage of the improved commercial 
terms of our new energy supply arrangements to make our retail prices even more competitive.
In March 2014, we launched a number of new tools designed to help our Partners promote our services 
and build their businesses more effectively. These included a new film (featuring Sir Terry Wogan) to help 
them explain our unique Discount Club and the benefits we offer to potential new Members, a simplified 
new online application process, an animated video to explain our part-time income opportunity, a new 
‘App’ which provides access in one place to all the main resources needed by our Partners, and an interest-
free hire purchase scheme to enable them to acquire a suitable Tablet to take best advantage of these new 
tools. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 8
We have continued to invest in providing customer service that is genuinely best in class; improving the 
clarity and transparency of the benefits we offer; and to consistently exceed our customers’ expectations. 
As a result, we have earned a higher level of trust amongst our customers than any other utility supplier, 
consistent endorsements from Which? in their regular surveys, and a Net Promoter Score that typically 
fluctuates between +40 and +45 on a monthly basis.
The steps we have taken over the last few years to improve our customer service and the quality of our 
customer base have led to a continuing progressive reduction in both our levels of churn and the proportion 
of Members who are delinquent (ie: have at least two outstanding bills). Our bad debt charge for the year 
remained at 1.5% of revenue (2013: 1.5%), even though a significant number of new Members joined 
during the year.
ROUTE TO MARKET
The number of new Partners joining the business during the year averaged around 1,300 per month (2013: 
1,002), taking the total number of registered Partners at the year end to a record high of over 44,000 
(2013: 39,848).
We believe the continuing high level of interest in joining our business is being driven by the combination 
of continuing pressure on household budgets, growing awareness of our brand, and the attractiveness of 
the secure part-time additional income opportunity we offer. We have enhanced the personal development 
programme we offer to help new Partners get started more quickly, promote our services more effectively, 
and build a growing long-term residual income. 
Confidence and morale amongst our partners is currently extremely high, following our recent annual sales 
conference in March which saw a record attendance. We are delighted with the positive reaction we have 
seen to the range of new tools we introduced, and the boost this has given to the strong momentum we 
were already seeing.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) encourages the Chairman to report personally on how 
the principles in the Code relating to the role and effectiveness of the Board have been applied.
As a Board we are responsible to the Company’s shareholders for delivering sustainable shareholder value 
over the long term through effective management and good governance. A key role of mine, as Executive 
Chairman, is to provide strong leadership to enable the Board to operate effectively. 
We believe that open and rigorous debate around key strategic issues and risks faced by the Company is 
important in achieving our objectives and the Company is fortunate to have non-executive directors with 
diverse and extensive business experience who actively contribute to these discussions. 
Further detail of the Company’s governance processes and compliance with the Code is set out in the 
Corporate Governance Statement.

OUTLOOK
Recent Trading
A record number of Partners attended our annual sales conference in March, where we launched a range 
of new tools to help them build their businesses more effectively. These resulted in an immediate uplift in 
activity by our Partners, as announced in our trading update on 4 April 2014; we are delighted that this 
momentum continued throughout April, taking the total number of new Partners recruited since our sales 
conference to over 5,000.
The combination of record numbers of new Partners requiring training for the first time, and existing 
Partners wanting to repeat their training so they could fully understand how to take advantage of the new 
tools we had announced means we have provided 8,000 training places since late March to cope with the 
increased demand – this is around four times the number of places usually required. 
The backlog this created has now been cleared, and customer gathering activity is starting to show an 
improvement over what were already extremely healthy levels. If current trends continue, the number of 
services we provide will show further significant net growth over the course of the year, with our customer 
base increasing to around 600,000 by the end of the year.
Energy Prices
Within the energy sector as a whole, significant investment is needed over the next decade to renew and 
extend the distribution network, replace nuclear and coal-fired generating plant that is approaching the 
end of its useful life, roll out smart meters, and encourage the take up of energy efficiency and renewable 
energy programmes. The costs associated with delivering these initiatives are likely to put continued upward 
pressure on retail energy prices over the medium term, irrespective of any movements in wholesale energy 
commodity costs, although these may be partially offset by the shifting of certain social and environmental 
costs from consumer bills into general taxation.
Regulatory
The proposals set out in Ofgem’s Retail Market Review have now been implemented. These include a 
provision requiring each supplier to inform their customers (on each bill they receive) of any cheaper tariffs 
available, which is intended to make it more difficult for suppliers to cross-subsidise attractive acquisition 
tariffs by overcharging their legacy customer base. We anticipate benefitting from these new disclosure 
requirements, as customers receive this additional information on future bills from our competitors over the 
course of the next 12 months. In the meantime, our tariffs, bills and marketing are all fully compliant with 
the new licence conditions.
The forthcoming review by the Competition and Markets Authority is focussed on the ‘Big 6’ energy 
suppliers, and in particular whether their vertically integrated structure is acting against the public interest. 
As such, we do not expect it to have any adverse impact on us as the leading independent supplier. It 
should be noted that our wholesale energy supply arrangements with Npower are expected to largely 
insulate us against any margin pressure from the proposed 20-month price freeze likely to be included in 
the Labour Party manifesto for the forthcoming election. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 10
Prospects
Our Partners continue to demonstrate their ability to gather high quality new Members in substantial 
volumes, and the high proportion of new Members taking all five of our core services (now running at 
around 25%) is particularly encouraging.
Having reached the 500,000 customer milestone a few months ago, our focus now is on doubling this 
to one million customers and beyond over the medium term; this would represent a UK market share of 
less than 4%, and seems eminently achievable given our track record of consistently delivering 15%-
20% annual growth in the number of services we supply over the last few years. Current high levels of 
confidence amongst our existing Partners, and the record numbers of new Partners who have joined the 
business since our sales conference in March, give us confidence that these strong rates of organic growth 
are sustainable going forward.
The steadily improving quality of our customer base gives us good visibility over future revenues and 
margins on the various services we provide, and our adjusted pre-tax profits for the current year will show 
a significant increase over last year’s reported numbers, reflecting both the strong organic customer growth 
we have achieved over the last 12 months, combined with the financial benefits of the transaction with 
Npower we completed in December. 
We remain comfortable with market expectations for adjusted pre-tax profits for the current year of £63m, 
an increase of almost 50% on last year. As a result, shareholders can look forward to progressive growth 
in the level of our dividends, notwithstanding that we will be repaying £20m of debt over the course of the 
current year.
It only remains for me to thank my boardroom colleagues for their support and all our staff and Partners for 
their loyalty and hard work during the past year, and to wish each and every one of them success in the 
years to come.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
MARKETS
We supply a wide range of essential utility services (Gas, Electricity, Landline, Broadband and Mobile) 
to both domestic and small business customers; these are all substantial markets and represent a vast 
opportunity for further organic growth.
The markets we operate in are dominated by a relatively small number of former monopoly suppliers and 
other owners of infrastructure assets, although in each there are also a number of independent suppliers 
carving out their own niches, generally based on price. 
BUSINESS MODEL
The Utility Warehouse has a fundamentally different business model to any other utility provider in the UK in 
three key respects:
•  firstly, we provide our services through the Utility Warehouse Discount Club, in which each customer 
becomes a Member;
•   secondly, we are the only fully integrated provider of both energy and communications services, with a 
single set of overheads that we can spread across our multiple revenue streams; and 
•  thirdly, we have a unique route to market, with an ‘army’ of over 44,000 part-time self-employed 
Partners. This means that instead of seeking to attract new Members through expensive advertising on 
television or in the national press, direct marketing, or price comparison sites, we instead benefit from 
genuine personal recommendations by both our Partners, and also by existing Members.
Partners can earn a small percentage of the monthly revenues generated by any Members gathered, either 
personally, or by someone in their team. On a similar basis, Members are directly rewarded with shopping 
vouchers when they introduce a new Member, and receive additional vouchers annually in December 
provided the Member(s) they have introduced are still using our services. 
We continue to invest heavily in our bespoke IT systems; these enable us to integrate all the services we 
supply into a single monthly bill, supported by just one set of central overheads (including all administrative 
and customer service functions). This highly efficient cost base is a key factor in enabling us to offer 
attractive pricing and a wide range of valuable benefits to our Members, a secure residual income to our 
Partners, and a growing dividend stream to shareholders.
Our business model requires us to provide exceptional customer service in order to convert our Members 
into fans, and ensure our Partners have the confidence to recommend us to their friends and family. We are 
extremely pleased with the further progress we have made this year towards achieving these goals, and in 
securing our position as the Nation’s most trusted utility provider.
STRATEGY
Our strategy is to build on the current strong levels of organic growth we are achieving, in order to 
progressively increase our share of the markets in which we operate. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 12
We will achieve this by maintaining our focus on delivering best-in-class customer service, investing in 
our systems and staff, simplifying and, where possible, improving the competitiveness of our services 
even further, encouraging existing Members to talk about the unique benefits we offer to their friends and 
acquaintances, and making it easier for our Partners to promote our services more effectively.
We continue to explore the possibility of expanding our current range of core services into areas where 
we can leverage our existing strong relationship with our Members to offer them improved service and 
better value on services they currently obtain from other suppliers, whilst also delivering a satisfactory return 
for our shareholders. Potential additional services include water, television and/or a range of insurance 
products (eg: home and motor policies).
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND NON-FINANCIAL KPIs
Our overall performance for the year has been extremely encouraging in a number of key respects:
•  continuing strong organic growth with service numbers up by 305,100 (2013: 221,037)
•  lower chur n
•  lower delinquency
•  growing proportion of Members taking all five of our core services
•  significant increase in the number of new Partners
•  positive reviews and recognition from Which? for both energy and telephony services
•  consistently high Net Promoter Scores 
Against the background of a broadly flat economy, and with household incomes remaining under pressure, 
our value-based consumer proposition and the part-time income opportunity we offer are extremely 
attractive to both Members and Partners respectively.
Our continuing strong organic growth is underpinned by high levels of confidence amongst our Partners 
in our brand and financial strength, the good value provided by our services, and our commitment to 
delivering best-in-class customer service.

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 13
Our customer base can be split into three groups as set out in the above table, each of which has different 
characteristics:
(i)  Residential customers who are Members of the Utility Warehouse Discount Club (93.3% of our 
customers) taking on average 3.64 services from us;
(ii)    Small businesses who are Members of the Utility Warehouse Discount Club for Business (5.5% of our 
customers) taking on average 2.74 services from us; and
(iii)  Other small businesses signed up through our wholly owned Telecommunications Management 
Limited (“TML”) subsidiary (1.2% of our customers) taking on average 3.56 services from us. These 
customers are no longer considered a core part of the business, and their contribution is becoming 
progressively less material in the context of the Group.
Within the residential Club, there is a further difference in quality (and therefore in the revenues and profits 
they will generate over the time they remain a Club Member) between Members, depending on whether 
they are a homeowner, and on the number of services we provide to them. We are therefore pleased 
that against the backdrop of an increasing national trend towards renting, the proportion of homeowners 
amongst new Members has remained broadly steady at around 75%, and the proportion of new Members 
taking all five of our core services has increased significantly compared with the previous year:
PERCENTAGE OF NEW RESIDENTIAL CLUB MEMBERS TAKING FIVE CORE SERVICES
24.4% Q4 FY14
16.3% Q3 FY14
13.2% Q2 FY14
13.3% Q1 FY14
Although on average a new Member taking all five of our core services requires a greater initial investment, 
these Members benefit from our most competitive prices, generate higher commission for our Partners, and 
provide the greatest lifetime value to the Company.
Overall churn within our customer base has continued to fall. This is best illustrated by analysing individual 
energy supply point churn, which declined to an average of just 0.8% per month during the final quarter, 
and demonstrates one of the key benefits from progressively improving the quality of our customer base: Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 14
ENERGY SUPPLY POINT CHURN
Average revenue per customer would have shown a further increase during the year due to the 
improvement in the quality of our customer base and slightly higher retail prices, but these positive factors 
were more than offset by lower energy consumption during an exceptionally mild winter this year, and the 
comparison with an exceptionally cold winter which inflated energy spend the previous year:

Net Promoter Score of around +40; to put this into context, any score above zero in the utility sector would 
be considered highly acceptable (E.ON has reported a score of -21 in its residential supply business, and 
the average in a 2013 Satmetrix industry report on internet service providers was +9).
Our innovative CashBack card continues to generate significant monthly savings for our Discount Club 
Members, with the total value of CashBack credited to Members since launching this programme now in 
excess of £18m. In addition, we have seen increasing numbers of Members using our online shopping 
portal and price comparison service to help them find the cheapest online supplier for a wide range of 
everyday household goods, and to earn additional CashBack.
Services
Our full range of services include Fixed Telephony (calls and line rental), Broadband, Mobile, Gas, 
Electricity, and CashBack card. At the year end, we supplied a total of 1,907,160 services (2013: 
1,602,060), representing a record net increase of 305,100 during the year.

We saw consistent quarterly growth throughout the year in all the core services we provide (Gas, Electricity, 
Mobile, Home Phone and Broadband), with a particularly pleasing 31.9% rise in the number of mobile 
services provided. This increase means penetration of Mobile within our residential Club has risen from 
12.5% to 23.7% over the last three years as a result of our continuing investment in making this service 
more attractive to Members. With around 35% of new Members taking this service, there remains 
significant scope for further improvement in this level of penetration over the next few years. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 16
CashBack card
Our exclusive CashBack card has proven itself as an important Member acquisition and retention tool. It 
gives our Members the opportunity to achieve additional savings of between 3% and 7% on their shopping 
at a wide range of participating retailers, which they receive as a credit on their next monthly bill from us.
We have seen a 19% increase during the year in the number of cards in issue to 139,769 (2013: 117,025), 
with a little under one third of new residential Club Members applying for a card. We believe this steady 
level of demand is a reflection of the continuing challenging economic climate, where many new Members 
find it difficult to fund the switch from paying in arrears on their credit card, to paying for their purchases in 
advance with a prepayment card.
We paid over £4.6m (2013: £4.4m) in CashBack to our Members during the year (funded entirely by the 
retailers in the programme), with many Members achieving a reduction of between 20% and 30% on the 
amount they pay for the utilities we are supplying to them each month, simply by using their CashBack card 
(instead of an alternative payment card) for most of their regular household shopping.
Customer Service
We pride ourselves on delivering first-class service to our Members through a single call centre based in the 
UK. We try to ensure where possible that the first person a Member speaks to is able to resolve any issues 
they may have with their multi-utility account.
We have a relentless focus on improving the service experience we deliver to our Members; we readily 
invest in technology that we believe will genuinely achieve this objective, and continually assess the 
numerous qualitative and quantitative performance measurement tools that we employ to monitor all aspects 
of our Members’ interactions with us in order to ensure the overall quality of their experience. 
We have been delighted at the consistently high customer service ratings we receive in Which? magazine, 
and the overwhelmingly positive feedback we receive from Members in our own surveys.
Partners
Our Partners are one of the key strengths of our business. In contrast to the routes to market adopted by 
other suppliers of essential household services, the alignment of financial interest provided by our revenue-
sharing model, the structure of our compensation plan, and the substantial number of Partners who hold 
equity or share options in the Company, incentivise them to focus their activities on finding creditworthy 
higher-spending customers who will reap the maximum savings from using our services, and will thus be 
least likely to churn; by doing so, they maximise their own long-term income. This ensures that cases of mis-
selling are generally both inadvertent and extremely rare.
We provide a variety of training and personal development courses both online and classroom based, 
designed to provide the skills and knowledge they need to gather Members and recruit other Partners 
effectively and successfully; all of these courses are free to attend. In addition, we have recently introduced 
an interest-free hire purchase scheme to allow our Partners access to a Tablet to help them present the 
benefits of our unique Discount Club.

Our Car Plan, which provides eligible Partners with a subsidised Utility Warehouse branded BMW Mini, 
remains extremely popular and around 575 vehicles are now in circulation (2013: 500). Owners inform 
us that they find these helpful in raising their local profile, resulting in enquiries from both potential new 
Members and Partners.
Premises and Systems 
We are making good progress with the refurbishment of our new headquarters office building which 
we purchased in February 2012. Once this project is completed towards the end of this year, it will 
provide sufficient space to support our growing business needs for the foreseeable future. From a systems 
perspective, we have the capacity to manage a substantial increase in our current customer and service 
numbers, without the need for any material further investment.

In order to provide a clearer presentation of the underlying performance of the Group, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted basic 
EPS exclude share incentive scheme charges and the amortisation of the intangible asset arising on entering into the new energy 
supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013.
SUMMARY
The increase in revenue during the year has been driven by continuing strong organic growth in the 
number of services we provide combined with modest price increases, partially offset by the swing from an 
extremely cold winter in 2013 to an unseasonably mild winter in 2014.
The improvement in adjusted pre-tax profits of 25.3% reflects the underlying increase in the average 
number of customers during the year, improving economies of scale, and an initial contribution from our 
new energy supply arrangements since December.
The increase in both the quantity and quality of new customers added over the course of the year has led to 
an increased loss from our Customer Acquisition operating segment of £12.1m (2013: £10.1m), although 
the average acquisition cost per customer fell during the second half following the introduction of our new 
‘Gold’ Bundle structure. 
Distribution expenses remained broadly flat as a proportion of revenue, reflecting the progressive 
implementation of the new distributor compensation plan we announced almost 18 months ago. In absolute 
terms they increased by £1.0m as a result of higher payments to Partners arising from our continuing strong 
organic growth and the higher revenue we achieved for the year. 
Administrative expenses increased during the year by £7.0m to £41.6m (2013: £34.6m) as a result of 
higher staff costs, an increase in bank charges relating to our new debt facilities with Barclays, greater 
telephony costs (following our decision to introduce a freephone 0800 number for customer services), and 
the one-off costs associated with the energy Retail Market Review.
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 26.8% to 50.6p (2013: 39.9p). In accordance with previous 
guidance and our strong cash position, the Company is proposing to pay a final dividend of 19p (2013: 
18p) per share, making a total dividend of 35p (2013: 31p) per share for the year.
MARGINS
Our overall gross margin for the year was slightly above previous guidance at 15.2% (2013: 13.9%) 
as a direct consequence of our new energy supply arrangements with Npower which were completed in  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 19
December 2013. We are therefore updating our guidance on gross profit margins, and now expect them to 
be within a range of 15% to 17% (previously 13% to 15%) for the foreseeable future. 
CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT BUSINESS
Our customer management business delivered record growth of over 300,000 services during the year, 
making eleven consecutive quarters in which we have delivered net growth of over 50,000 services: 
NET GROWTH IN SERVICES 
57,957 Q4 FY14

58,855 Q4 FY12
51,529 Q3 FY12
61,363 Q2 FY12
38,140 Q1 FY12
The consistency of these numbers reflects our continuing focus on making it easier for our Partners to gather 
new members by simplifying our processes, improving membership benefits, making our services more 
competitive, and improving our customer service. As a result, all our core services are now seeing strong 
monthly growth.
The particularly high growth in service numbers during Q2 and Q3 last year was due to exceptionally 
favourable market conditions and strong promotional activity, and should not be interpreted as a precedent 
for similar seasonal outperformance in these periods in future years.
The progressive improvement in the quality of our customer base, with lower levels of delinquency and 
a steady increase in the average number of services being taken by each customer, has resulted in a 
progressive reduction in both churn and bad debts over the last four years. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 20
Revenues increased across all our services during the year, however the exceptionally mild winter resulted 
in significantly lower gas consumption than expected.

TOTAL 642.5 592.2 
CUSTOMER ACQUISITION
Our net investment in acquiring new customers increased during the year to £12.1m (2013: £10.1m), 
reflecting the strong organic growth we achieved in the number of services being provided. 
Although the initial cost of acquiring a customer who takes one of our ‘Gold Bundles’ can be considerably 
higher than for a household taking fewer services, our experience shows that the lifetime value of such 
customers more than compensates for the higher upfront costs we incur.
DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Distribution expenses, which primarily represent the share of our revenues that we pay as commission 
to Partners, increased by £1.0m to £18.6m (2013: £17.6m); this reflects an increase in the amount of 
residual income we paid, combined with higher bonus and incentive payments resulting from the significant 
increase in our organic growth compared with the previous year.
Within administrative expenses, the bad debt charge for the year remained constant at 1.5% of revenues 
(2013: 1.5%), but increased slightly in absolute terms to £9.9m (2013: £9.0m), partly due to an increase 
in the number of fraudulent applications for premium mobile phones during the first half of the year which 
triggered an immediate tightening of our credit checking procedures.
Whilst remaining sympathetic to the financial difficulties some households are experiencing in paying 
for their energy, we continue to manage our bad debt risk by installing prepayment meters at properties 
where the occupiers are unwilling to pay for the energy they are using by any other means. We installed 
8,958 of them during the year (2013: 6,584), many of them at the customer’s own request, which 
helped grow our base of prepayment meters to 50,095 (2013: 33,563) representing approximately 
5.8% of the energy services we supply. This remains significantly below the average level of prepayment 
meters within the industry of around 15%.

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 21
Looking to the future, the further reduction we have seen in the proportion of delinquent customers across the 
year is, we believe, a useful forward indicator to the level of bad debts we can expect over the medium term.

The average number of employees increased from 604 to 696, most of which took place in the second half 
of the year; this increase in headcount of 15% is below the increase we saw during the year in the number 
of services we are providing, as we continue to enhance our systems to manage our growing customer 
base more effectively. Personnel expenses (excluding the non-cash accounting cost of share incentive 
schemes) increased by 20.8% during the year to £23.8m (2013: £19.7m), as we continue to strengthen 
our management team. 
Other year-on-year adverse movements in administrative expenses included an increase in bank charges 
relating to our new debt facilities with Barclays, greater telephony costs (following our decision to introduce 
a freephone 0800 number for customer services), and the one-off costs associated with the energy Retail 
Market Review. 
Overall, administrative expenses represented 6.3% of revenue for the year (2013: 5.8%), mainly due to 
substantially lower spend by Members on their energy during an exceptionally mild winter. We continue to 
look for efficiency savings throughout the business to maximise economies of scale as we continue to grow. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 22
OPUS 
Our share of the profits from Opus Energy Group Limited (“Opus”), in which we maintain a 20% stake, 
increased during the year to £4.7m (2013: £3.4m). This excellent result reflects a continuing strong trading 
performance, and the further steady progress they have made in supplying gas alongside electricity into the 
small business and corporate sector, for which they are now buying renewable energy from over 500 small 
UK generators. Opus revenues increased by 17.6% to just over £434m (2013: £369m) and profit before 
tax increased from £22.4m to £30.2m.
We remain encouraged by the resilience of the business model and the strength and experience of the Opus 
management team, and expect to receive a dividend of approximately £4.1m in July 2014. Our shareholding 
in Opus is valued on our balance sheet at £8.8m in line with standard accounting policy, notwithstanding the 
likelihood that its market value is substantially in excess of this figure; we are extremely pleased to have such 
significant exposure to this rapidly growing, profitable and highly cash generative business.
NEW ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS 
In December 2013 we improved the commercial terms of our energy supply arrangements with Npower by 
acquiring Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited for a total consideration of £218m (of 
which £21.5m is deferred for three years).
To fund this transaction and other working capital requirements associated with our recent rapid organic 
growth, we raised £130m of equity from shareholders and £100m of debt from Barclays Bank. The debt is 
due to be repaid over three years, as set out in note 12 to the financial statements on page 100.
This transaction has given rise to the creation of a significant intangible asset in the balance sheet of the 
Group. In accordance with the relevant accounting standards, we will be amortising it on a straight-line 
basis over the 20 year life of the new energy supply arrangements. As this amortisation is a non-cash item, 
and unrelated to the underlying trading performance of the business, the financial results on which we will 
be focussing each year will exclude any impact from this amortisation. 
CASH, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL
Our cash balances at the year-end increased to £45.4m (2013: £3.4m). This reflects continuing strong 
underlying operational cash generation, combined with advance funding from Npower to cover various industry 
related costs which they were paying directly prior to the new energy supply agreement coming into effect.
Cash outflows are expected to be significantly higher this year, as we complete the £20m refurbishment 
of our new headquarters office building, support our distribution channel with branded BMW Minis and 
Tablets, and fund growing demand from customers for ‘free’ Smartphones. Facilities have been arranged 
with Barclays Bank to enable us to fund these costs without affecting our progressive dividend policy.
We anticipate a modest rise in our working capital requirements over the next two years due to a number 
of factors: (i) the costs associated with funding the growth in our mobile business (where increasing 
numbers of customers are choosing to be provided with a premium mobile handset, which they can obtain 
from us with no upfront cost on a 24 month contract; (ii) an increase in the number of BMW Minis supplied 
to Partners on hire purchase agreements; and (iii) the cost of providing them with Tablets (on 30 months 
interest-free credit) to help them build their businesses more effectively. 
Under the terms of the new energy supply arrangements Npower remains responsible for funding the 
working capital requirements associated with our energy budget plan customers.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 23
BORROWINGS 
Our balance sheet at the year end shows a net debt position of £53.6m (2013: net cash £0.8m) which 
principally reflects the impact of the £100m we borrowed from Barclays to help fund the recent transaction 
with Npower. 
DIVIDEND 
The final dividend of 19p per share (2013: 18p) will be paid on 1 August 2014 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 18 July 2014 and is subject to approval by shareholders at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting which will be held on 15 July 2014. This makes a total dividend 
payable for the year of 35p (2013: 31p).
We remain firmly committed to a progressive dividend policy, but the level of distributions to shareholders 
for the current year will need to reflect the impact of starting to repay the borrowings we arranged in 
December to part-fund our recent transaction with Npower. Our current expectation is that the total 
dividend for the current year will therefore increase by around 15%, and thereafter that further growth 
in earnings from the level we achieve this year should be reflected in a corresponding rise in the level of 
distributions to shareholders.
SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEME CHARGES
Operating profit is stated after share incentive scheme charges of £4.2m (2013: £0.9m). These expenses 
relate to an accounting charge under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments (“IFRS 2”). 
As a result of the increasing relative importance of share incentive scheme charges as a proportion 
of our pre-tax profits, we are separately disclosing this amount within the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the period (and excluding these charges from our calculation of adjusted profits 
and earnings). The increase in this charge mainly reflects the strong rise in the Company’s share price 
during the financial year, and therefore separate disclosure is considered appropriate so that the underlying 
performance of the business can be clearly identified. 
In accordance with IFRS 2, awards made under the Company’s JSOP share incentive scheme are deemed 
to be cash-settled. However, whilst approximately £3.4m (2013: £0.4m) of the share incentive scheme 
charges during the year relate to JSOP awards, and could therefore be settled in cash, in practice it is 
expected that any settlement of awards under the JSOP will be made in equity. Our current earnings per 
share have therefore been adjusted to eliminate these share incentive scheme charges.
TAXATION
A full analysis of the taxation charge for the year is set out in note 4 to the financial statements. The tax 
charge for the year is £7.7m (2013: £7.6m). 
The effective tax rate for the year was 20.9% (2013: 21.8%).

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
BACKGROUND
The Group faces various risk factors, both internal and external, which could have a material impact on 
long-term performance. However, the Group’s underlying business model is considered relatively low-
risk, with no need for management to take any disproportionate risks in order to preserve or generate 
shareholder value.
The Group continues to develop and operate a consistent and systematic risk management process, which 
involves risk ranking, prioritisation and subsequent evaluation, with a view to ensuring all significant risks 
have been identified, prioritised and (where possible) eliminated, and that systems of control are in place to 
manage any remaining risks. 
A formal document is prepared by the executive directors and senior management team on a regular basis 
detailing the key risks faced by the Group and the operational controls in place to mitigate those risks; this 
document is then reviewed by the Audit Committee.
BUSINESS MODEL
The principal risks outlined below should be viewed in the context of the Group’s business model as a 
reseller of utility services (gas, electricity, fixed line telephony, mobile telephony and broadband internet) 
under the Utility Warehouse and TML brands. As a reseller, the Group does not own any of the network 
infrastructure required to deliver its services to customers. This means that while the Group is heavily reliant 
on third party providers, it is insulated from all the direct risks associated with owning and/or operating 
such capital intensive infrastructure itself.  
The Group’s services are promoted using ‘word of mouth’ by a large network of independent Partners, who 
are paid solely on a commission basis. This means that the Group has minimal fixed costs associated with 
acquiring new customers.
The principal specific risks arising from the Group’s business model, and the measures taken to mitigate 
those risks, are set out below:
REPUTATIONAL RISK
The Group’s reputation amongst its customers, suppliers and Partners is believed to be fundamental to the 
future success of the Group. Failure to meet expectations in terms of the services provided by the Group, 
the way the Group does business or in the Group’s financial performance could have a material negative 
impact on the Group’s performance.
In relation to customer service, reputational risk is principally mitigated through the Group’s recruitment 
processes, a focus on closely monitoring staff performance, including the use of direct customer feedback 
surveys (Net Promoter Score), and through the provision of rigorous staff training. 
Responsibility for maintaining effective relationships with suppliers and Partners rests primarily with the 
appropriate member of the Group’s senior management team with responsibility for the relevant area. Any 
material changes to supplier agreements and Partner commission arrangements which could impact the Group’s 
relationships are generally negotiated by the executive Directors and ultimately approved by the full Board. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
 
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 25
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISK
The Group is dependent on its proprietary billing and customer management software for the  
successful operation of its business model. This software is developed and maintained in accordance with 
the changing needs of the business by a team of highly skilled, long-standing, motivated and experienced 
individuals.
All significant changes which are made to the billing and customer management software are tested as 
extensively as reasonably practical before launch and are ultimately approved by the heads of the IT and 
Billing departments in consultation with the Chief Executive as appropriate. 
Back-ups of both the software and underlying billing and customer data are made on a regular basis  
and securely stored off-site. The Group also has extensive back-up information technology infrastructure in 
the event of a failure of the main system, designed to ensure that a near-seamless service to customers can 
be maintained.
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY RISK
The Group is subject to varying laws and regulations, including possible adverse effects from European 
regulatory intervention. The energy markets in the UK and Continental Europe are subject to comprehensive 
operating requirements as defined by the relevant sector regulators and/or government departments. 
Amendments to the regulatory regime could have an impact on the Group’s ability to achieve its financial 
goals. Furthermore, the Group is obliged to comply with retail supply procedures, amendments to which 
could have an impact on operating costs.
The Group is a licensed gas and electricity supplier, and therefore has a direct regulatory relationship 
with Ofgem. If the Group fails to maintain an effective relationship with Ofgem and comply with its licence 
obligations, it could be subject to fines or to the removal of its respective licences.
Recent regulatory changes such as the new requirements in relation to smart energy meters (with the 
potential for additional costs if existing meters must be replaced prior to the end of their planned lives) and 
social tariffs, and changes to the current decommissioning regime could all have a potentially significant 
impact on the sector, although any additional costs associated with smart metering are not expected to 
affect the net margins earned by energy suppliers (as any such extra costs are likely to be reflected in 
higher retail charges). 
In general, the majority of the Group’s services are supplied into highly regulated markets, and this 
could restrict the operational flexibility of the Group’s business. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group 
maintains an appropriate relationship with both Ofgem and Ofcom (the UK regulators for the energy and 
communications markets respectively) and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (“DECC”). The 
Group engages with officials from all these organisations on a periodic basis to ensure they are aware of 
the Group’s views when they are consulting on proposed regulatory changes or if there are competition 
issues the Group needs to raise with them.
However, it should be noted that the regulatory environment for the various markets in which the Group 
operates is generally focussed on promoting competition. As one of the new entrants, it seems reasonable 
to expect that most such changes will broadly be beneficial to the Group, given the Group’s relatively  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 26
small size compared to the former monopoly incumbents with whom it competes, although these changes, 
and their actual impact, remain uncertain at present. Furthermore, the governmental focus on reform of 
the energy market and the recently announced investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority, 
appears to be targeted at the large vertically integrated suppliers, with consideration being given to the 
desirability of breaking the link between energy generation and retail supply.
Political and consumer concern over rising energy prices and fuel poverty may lead to further reviews of the 
energy market which could result in further consumer protection legislation being introduced through energy 
supply licences. The Government could also choose to introduce adverse measures such as a windfall 
tax on the Group or price controls for certain customer segments. In addition, political and regulatory 
developments affecting the energy markets within which the Group operates may have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s business, results of operations and overall financial condition, although the proposed 
Labour Party energy price freeze for 20 months following the forthcoming election is not expected to put 
pressure on the margins of the Group if implemented.
FINANCING RISK
As a result of the recent transaction with Npower, the Group has entered into new debt facilities leading 
to increased debt service obligations which may place operating and financial restrictions on the Group. 
This debt could have adverse consequences insofar as it: (a) requires the Group to dedicate a material 
proportion of its cash flows from operations to fund payments in respect of the debt, thereby reducing the 
flexibility of the Group to utilise its cash to invest in and/or grow the business; (b) increases the Group’s 
vulnerability to adverse general economic and/or industry conditions; (c) may limit the Group’s flexibility 
in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business or the industry in which it operates; (d) may limit the 
Group’s ability to raise additional debt in the long term; and (e) could restrict the Group from making larger 
strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities.
Each of these prospective adverse consequences (or a combination of some or all of them) could result in 
the potential growth of the Group being at a slower rate than may otherwise be achieved.
FRAUD AND BAD DEBT RISK 
The Group has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers. 
This means that although the Group is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from potential new customers 
who are not considered creditworthy, the Group is obliged to supply domestic energy to everyone who 
submits a properly completed application form. Where customers subsequently fail to pay for the energy 
they have used (“Delinquent Customers”), there is likely to be a considerable delay before the Group 
is able to control its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter or 
disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such Delinquent Customers from 
increasing their indebtedness are not always fully recovered.
Fraud within the telephony industry may arise from customers using the services without intending to pay 
their supplier. The amounts involved are generally relatively small as the Group has sophisticated call traffic 
monitoring systems to identify material occurrences of fraud. The Group is able to immediately eliminate 
any further bad debt exposure by disconnecting any telephony service that demonstrates a suspicious 
usage profile, or falls into arrears on payments.

More generally, the Group is also exposed to payment card fraud, where customers use stolen cards to obtain 
credit (e.g. on their CashBack card) or goods (e.g. Smartphones and Tablets) from the Group; the Group 
regularly reviews and refines its fraud protection systems to reduce its potential exposure to such risks.
WHOLESALE PRICES RISK
The Group does not own or operate any utility network infrastructure itself, choosing instead to purchase 
the capacity needed from third parties. The advantage of this approach is that the Group is protected from 
technological risk, capacity risk or the risk of obsolescence, as it can purchase the amount of each service 
required to meet its customers’ needs. 
Whilst there is a theoretical risk that in some of the areas in which the Group operates it may be unable 
to secure access to the necessary infrastructure on commercially attractive terms, in practice the pricing of 
access to such infrastructure is either regulated (as in the energy market) or subject to significant competitive 
pressures (as in telephony and broadband). The profile of the Group’s customers, the significant quantities of 
each service they consume in aggregate, and its clearly differentiated route to market has historically proven 
attractive to potential partners, who compete aggressively to secure a share of the Group’s growing business.
The supply of energy, which accounts for an increasing proportion of sales each year, has different  
risks associated with it. The wholesale price can be extremely volatile, and customer demand can be 
subject to considerable short term fluctuations depending on the weather. The Group has a long-standing 
supply relationship with Npower under which the latter assumes the substantive risks and rewards of 
hedging and buying energy for the Group’s customers. If the Group did not have the benefit of this long 
term supply agreement it would be exposed to the pricing risk of securing access to the necessary energy 
on the open market.
COMPETITIVE RISK
The Group operates in highly competitive markets and significant service innovations or increased price 
competition could impact future profit margins. In order to maintain its competitive position, there is a 
consistent focus on ways of improving operational efficiency and keeping the cost base as low as possible. 
New service innovations are monitored closely by senior management and the Group is typically able to 
respond rapidly by offering any new services using the infrastructure of its existing suppliers. The Group 
offers a unique multiservice proposition. The increasing proportion of customers who are benefiting from 
a genuine multi-utility solution, that is unavailable from any other known supplier, materially reduces any 
competitive threat.
The Directors anticipate that the Group will face continued competition in the future as the market grows, 
new companies enter the market and alternative technologies and services become available. The Group’s 
services and expertise may be rendered obsolete or uneconomic by technological advances or novel 
approaches developed by one or more of the Group’s competitors. The existing approaches of the Group’s 
competitors or new approaches or technologies developed by such competitors may be more effective 
or affordable than those supplied to the Group. There can be no assurance that the Group’s competitors 
will not develop more effective or more affordable technologies or services, thus rendering the Group’s 
technologies and/or services obsolete, uncompetitive or uneconomical. There can be no assurance that the 
Group will be able to compete successfully with existing or potential competitors or that competitive factors  Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 28
will not have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
However, as the Group’s customer base continues to rise, competition amongst suppliers of services to 
the Group is expected to increase. This has already been evidenced by various volume-related growth 
incentives which have been agreed with the Group’s three largest wholesale suppliers. This should ensure 
that the Group has direct access to new technologies and services available to the market. 
INFRASTRUCTURE RISK
The provision of services to the Group’s customers is reliant on the efficient operation of third party physical 
infrastructure. There is a risk of disruption to the supply of services to customers through any failure in 
the infrastructure e.g. gas shortages, power cuts or damage to communications networks. However, 
as the infrastructure is generally shared with other suppliers, any material disruption to the supply of 
services is likely to impact a large part of the market as a whole and it is unlikely that the Group would 
be disproportionately affected. In the event of any prolonged disruption isolated to the Group’s principal 
supplier within a particular market, services required by customers could be sourced from another provider.

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 29
PEOPLE AND ORGANISATION
EMPLOYEES
We rely on the combined efforts of around 740 employees to manage relationships with both our Members 
and Partners, and deliver a consistently high quality of service at all times. We pay considerable attention 
to recruiting, developing and retaining people with appropriate skills.
We continue to recruit new members of staff through our own Assessment Centre designed to give the 
Company greater control over the recruitment process and to ensure we select the very best candidates for 
our positions. Once they have joined, new starters go through a structured training programme to ensure 
that they are fully equipped to resolve any customer queries and to provide the high level of customer 
service that we demand. Everyone who successfully completes this programme celebrates their achievement 
at a quarterly graduation ceremony, where they are presented with a certificate and champagne by the 
Chief Executive.
The combination of valuing and developing our staff, our service-oriented culture and the day-to-day 
reinforcement of our core values are key competitive advantages in enabling us to attract and retain a 
motivated, talented and diverse workforce. 
We continue to invest in our people, and have comprehensive Manager and Supervisor development 
programmes, which are accompanied by selective executive coaching. We have introduced an online 
learning portal to assist in the development of all our employees, and make available a wide range of 
‘Skills Builder Courses’ in addition to e-learning modules. We promote from within where possible into both 
specialist and managerial roles. 
Our monthly Employee Recognition Awards enable the Company to celebrate and reward employees who 
have gone ‘over and above’ in the performance of their role. 
We actively seek to engage all our employees in changes that may concern them, rather than just a 
representative few on a committee. An example of this was while we were rolling out a workforce 
management system recently, when all members of staff were engaged in group discussions. Also, when we 
introduced our Mission Statement to become the Nation’s most trusted utility company, we collaborated with 
each department in dialogue groups to help them frame their own personal mission statements. We monitor 
employee engagement with an internal Staff Survey, which shows high levels of satisfaction; this year 
90% of employees who responded stated that they enjoy working for the Company. We keep employees 
informed on a regular basis of the financial performance of the business and other matters of potential 
concern to them, through the Company intranet, ad hoc emails, the monthly Company newsletter and 
quarterly breakfast forums with the Chief Executive.
We operate an ‘open-door’ policy throughout the business, provide employees with various mechanisms for 
providing feedback and making suggestions, and include open ended questions within the staff survey. 
We have an active staff social committee which organises a wide range of events, supported by the 
Company, including the annual summer and Christmas parties, poker evenings, quiz nights and many other 
ad hoc fun events. This year, to mark reaching half a million customers, a week of fun celebrations was 
organised for all our members of staff. We also have a ‘Fun Fund’ set aside for departmental social events. Telecom Plus PLC  Report and Accounts 2014 30
We promote staff wellbeing, through an employee assistance helpline, subsidised on-site fitness classes, 
periodic at-desk massages, healthy meal options in the staff restaurant and a cycle to work scheme. Each 
September we run our ‘Fit Pig Week’ to promote health and well-being within the Company with a range of 
fun events and incentives. This year we introduced a medical healthcare cash plan (‘Medicash’) allowing 
employees to obtain cover at a corporate rate.
We continue to invest in our premises as necessary, to ensure the working environment is as attractive as 
possible, consistent with the practical needs of running the business. With the exception of our logistics 
team, all our employees work together in Network HQ, our Head Office building in London. We operate a 
heavily subsidised staff restaurant, and provide a recreation room in both our Head Office and warehouse 
premises. We provide a wide range of other staff benefits including a significant discount on the services 
we provide, employee loans at preferential interest rates, a generous Christmas bonus scheme and 
recognition for five and 10 years’ service.
We are pleased to report that average levels of staff absence this year remained below six days per year, 
in line with the encouragingly low level we achieved during the preceding year.
The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved employee share option plan, under which 
employees are granted options to purchase shares in the Company which are exercisable between three 
and ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price is the market price at the time of granting the 
option. Our policy is to issue options to all employees after the satisfactory completion of their probationary 
period, and additional options when 10 years’ service has been completed and in other appropriate 
circumstances (e.g. promotion). As at 31 March 2014 there were outstanding options over 1,418,833 
shares which had been granted to staff, representing approximately 1.8% of the issued share capital of the 
Company.
Employees returning from maternity leave with children less than 12 months old are able to benefit from a 
company contribution towards the cost of an external childcare service provider of their choice. We also 
provide facilities for staff to purchase childcare vouchers in a tax-efficient manner using a salary sacrifice 
scheme, in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs guidelines.
We encourage all employees to participate in a stakeholder pension scheme operated by Aviva. 
Participants can choose their own contribution level, which is matched by the Company within certain 
limits, depending on length of service. During the year we implemented pension auto-enrolment in 
accordance with legislation and the Company is therefore now contributing to the pension funds of virtually 
all employees, on a monthly basis.
We actively facilitate ‘Access to Work’ grants for employees who have a disability, health or mental health 
condition providing the practical support to enable them to continue working effectively.
DIVERSITY
Full and fair consideration is given to opportunities for employment, training, career progression and 
promotion on the basis of each individual’s ability, attitude and track record, irrespective of their gender, 
ethnic origin, nationality, age, religion, sexual orientation or disability.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
ENVIRONMENT
We are conscious of the role we have to play in minimising the environmental impact of our activities.
We operate an energy efficiency helpline to provide advice to customers on how they can reduce their 
energy usage; we enable qualifying customers to access free home insulation; we actively promote Feed-In 
Tariffs; and we encourage customers to monitor their energy usage by providing regular meter readings.
Since moving to an online customer application process, we have reduced the amount of printed marketing 
materials we are using, and seen a significant increase in the proportion of new members choosing not to 
receive a paper bill each month.
We participate in a waste paper recycling programme, with a certificated saving of 298 trees and 
39,370kg of CO2 during the year; we also recycle all of our cardboard, and use only fsc-certified paper; 
our office lighting is low-energy, and controlled by motion sensors, which automatically turn off lights in 
unused areas of the building; our air-conditioning is constantly monitored, and is zonal to small areas, 
allowing close management of heating and cooling.
We recycle both mobile phones and toner cartridges, within the scope of our annual Charity Partnership.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS STATEMENT
The greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions statement below provides a summary of the Company’s 
greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014. It gives a summary of emissions 
from fuel combustion and the operation of our facilities (which include our offices and company cars, scope 
1), and from our purchased electricity use during the year (scope 2).
We have adopted the operational control approach, as defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) 2004, therefore emissions associated with 
our customers’ energy usage, the activities of our independent distributors and the supply of energy from 
Npower are not included in this statement as they are outside the Company’s operational control.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Save in the limited instances explained below, the Board is pleased to report that during the year and as 
at the date of this Annual Report the Company has complied with the main principles and the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 
2012. Copies of the Code are available at www.frc.org.uk.
This report, together with the Director’s Report on pages 68 to 71 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 48 to 67, provides details of how the Company has applied the principles and complied with 
the provisions of the Code and where required explains the rationale for instances where the Company 
has not been compliant, namely: (i) the external facilitation of a Board evaluation exercise; (ii) putting 
the external audit out to tender; (iii) the specification of Board diversity targets; and (iv) the design of 
performance-related elements of remuneration, i.e. the requirement for awards to be phased rather than 
being granted in blocks.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board meets regularly to review the progress of the Company and to discuss the measures required for 
its future development. Directors are provided in advance with a formal agenda of matters to be discussed 
at each meeting, and with the detailed information needed to monitor the progress of the Company. 
Records of meetings and the decisions of the Board are maintained by the Company Secretary and are 
approved by the Board at the following meeting. All directors have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary and, if required, are able to take independent advice at the Company’s expense 
in the furtherance of their duties. Any question of the removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the 
Board as a whole. Whilst the members of the Board are all experienced and well qualified, the opportunity 
to receive further training at the Company’s expense is available to them at all times. The non-executive 
directors attended such formal, externally facilitated courses as they considered relevant to their roles and 
responsibilities during the year.
BOARD DUTIES
The matters specifically reserved for decision by the Board are fully documented and include the following 
principal areas:
•  Reviewing and agreeing the Company’s strategy and long term objectives.
•  Assessing performance in the light of the Company’s strategy and objectives.
•  Ensuring an effective system of risk management and internal controls is in place.
•   Approving changes to the structure, size and composition of the Board and reviewing its performance on 
an annual basis.
•  Reviewing the Company’s overall corporate governance arrangements.
•  Approval of the Company’s financial statements prior to publication.
Matters that are specifically delegated to the committees of the Board are documented in the various  
Terms of Reference of each committee which are available on the Company’s website (www.
utilitywarehouse.co.uk). Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

In accordance with provision A.4.2 of the Code, the non-executive directors also met without the executives 
present during the year.
BOARD EVALUATION
The directors recognise that the Code requires an external evaluation of the boards of FTSE 350 companies 
to be carried out at least every three years. However, the directors considered the position in relation to 
the current year and concluded that an external evaluation was not necessary. In reaching this conclusion 
the directors were mindful of the effective operation of the Board during the year and the continuing strong 
performance of the Company. 
An internal evaluation of the Board for the current year was conducted through the completion of formal 
detailed board, and board committee evaluation questionnaires by each director. In addition a review 
involving each director was carried out. This review was conducted by the Deputy Chairman and Company 
Secretary and principally covered the following areas: specific matters of concern arising from the board 
evaluation questionnaires, individual directors’ performances and key objectives for the coming year, and 
the identification of any specific training and development requirements.
The evaluation questionnaires were focussed on assessing effectiveness in the following key areas:
•  the size and balance of the Board;
•  the quality of board debates and its decision making processes;
•  the individual contributions made by each director;
•  the Chairman’s approach to leadership;
•  the non-executive directors’ challenge of the executive directors;
•  the Board’s approach to identifying and mitigating key business risks;
•  the quality of the Company’s communications with key stakeholders; 
•  the Board’s consideration of diversity and succession planning; and
•  the induction and training of board members. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 38
In accordance with provision B.6.3 of the Code and building on the results of the evaluation questionnaires, 
the Deputy Chairman led a separate evaluation of the performance of the Chairman. This evaluation 
principally comprised a review of the Chairman’s leadership style and tone in promoting effective decision-
making and ensuring constructive and sufficient debate took place around key issues. The results of this 
evaluation were entirely satisfactory.
The evaluation concluded that overall the Board and its Committees had operated well during the year, 
with all directors making an effective contribution to the Board commensurate with their experience and 
responsibilities. However, as was also the case in previous years, the evaluation identified that succession 
planning remained an area that needed to be given greater focus. 
Consistent with the requirement of the Code to ensure a progressive refreshing of the Board, the 
Nomination Committee has therefore been tasked with developing a firm plan for independent non-
executive director succession over the coming year, to reflect the long service of both Michael Pavia and 
Melvin Lawson since their appointment to the Board in late 2006. 
BOARD BALANCE AND DIVERSITY
The Board has remained unchanged during the year and consists of three executive directors and three 
independent non-executive directors. Julian Schild acts as the Company’s Deputy Chairman and Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director. 
Membership of each committee of the Board is set out in the table below:

The Board, in conjunction with the Nomination Committee, regularly reviews whether the composition of 
the Board and the diversity of its members remain appropriate in the light of the commercial challenges and 
risks facing the Company. 
The members of the Nomination Committee believe that the composition of the Board is currently 
appropriate for the size of the Company and the nature of its operations which have not materially 
changed in scope since the prior year. However, the Committee appreciates that should the Company’s 
situation change in future, then the appointment of new directors to the Board may be required.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 39
The main objective of the Nomination Committee in considering the appointment of new directors to the 
Board, remains to ensure that successful candidates are of the highest calibre and demonstrate the best 
possible combination of skills and experience. The Committee’s Terms of Reference further stipulate that 
candidates from a wide range of backgrounds shall be considered and that due regard will be given to the 
benefits of diversity on the Board.
Notwithstanding the Code requirement to set out measurable objectives in relation to Board diversity, it 
remains the Committee’s strong view that it is not appropriate to stipulate the characteristics of any future 
directors, including gender, ahead of a full assessment of the particular requirements of each role at the 
time a candidate is being sought. The Committee will continue to adhere to the principles set out above in 
identifying and recruiting the best candidates for any future Board roles in a non-discriminatory manner.
Further detail regarding the Company’s position in relation to encouraging diversity within all layers of the 
organisation is set out in the “People and Organisation” section of the Strategic Report on pages 29 to 31.
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the Company with the Executive Chairman 
responsible for developing the strategic direction of the business and ensuring the effective operation of 
the Board, including compliance with principles of good corporate governance, and the Chief Executive 
primarily responsible for implementing strategy and running the Group’s operations on a day to day 
basis. As appropriate, and in order to ensure good corporate governance, the Executive Chairman 
is assisted by the Company’s independent non-executive Deputy Chairman in ensuring the effective 
operation of the Board. 
The division of responsibilities between the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive has been set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board in accordance with the Code (provision A.2.1).
SUPPLY OF INFORMATION
Information is supplied to the Board in a timely manner with board papers and accounts being provided in 
advance of meetings. When the Board requests additional information it is provided.
RE-ELECTION
The Company’s Articles stipulate that one third of all directors are required to retire by rotation at each 
Annual General Meeting and all newly appointed directors are required to offer themselves for election by 
the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting. 
However, the Code requires that all directors of FTSE 350 companies be subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders. Therefore all the directors will be submitted for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting in July. Acknowledging the Code requirement for a particularly rigorous review in circumstances 
where non-executive directors’ terms are being extended beyond six years, the Board has determined that 
all directors continue to make a valuable contribution to the commercial success of the Company, with each 
bringing a complementary range of skills to the team.   Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 40
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Board has a Remuneration Committee whose responsibility is to ensure that the remuneration 
of executive directors is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate people of the highest calibre. The 
Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, namely Julian Schild 
(Chairman of the Committee), Melvin Lawson and Michael Pavia. The Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
giving the details of the emoluments of each director, may be found on pages 48 to 67.
The Remuneration Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Company’s website  
(www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk), which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it by 
the Board.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, Michael Pavia (Chairman of the 
Committee), Melvin Lawson and Julian Schild in compliance with the Code (provision C.3.1). The activities 
of the Audit Committee are set out on pages 44 to 47.
The Audit Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Company’s website  
(www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk), which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it by 
the Board.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR 
The Audit Committee is mindful of the Code’s requirement for FTSE 350 companies to put external audit 
contracts out to tender at least every ten years. In March 2013 the Company’s then auditor PKF (UK) LLP 
(“PKF”), which had been in place for over ten years, completed its merger with fellow accountancy firm 
BDO LLP (“BDO”). During PKF’s tenure, and in accordance with ethical procedures, audit partners rotated 
every five years. The prior year represented the fifth and final year for the Company’s then audit partner 
and the Committee would ordinarily have proposed that the external audit contract for the current year 
be put out to tender.
However, the Committee concluded that the merger of PKF and BDO increased the breadth of resources 
available to the Company for the conduct of the audit. The audit for the current year was led by a partner 
from the BDO side of the merger and therefore in practice the Committee felt that the audit was conducted 
by a new audit firm with few pre-conceptions and a fresh perspective, and as such this marks the first year 
of a fresh ten year cycle. 
Nonetheless, and whilst the Committee is satisfied with the performance of BDO, it is conscious of the 
principles behind the requirement in the Code to tender the external audit and will therefore continue to 
closely monitor the performance, objectivity and independence of BDO. Should any concerns arise in these 
areas then it is likely the Committee will reconsider its position in relation to tendering the audit contract 
within the current ten year period as set out in the Code. 
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee comprises Michael Pavia (Chairman of Committee), Julian Schild and Charles 
Wigoder and therefore has a majority of independent non-executive directors in compliance with the Code

(provision B.2.1). The main purpose of the Nomination Committee is to make recommendations to the 
Board on the appointment of new directors.
The Nomination Committee has written terms of reference, available on the Company’s website  
(www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk), which describe the authority and duties which have been delegated to it 
by the Board. 
The activities of the Nomination Committee are set out on page 43.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
It is the policy of the Company to maintain a dialogue with institutional shareholders and to keep them 
informed about the objectives of the business. The Board considers that it is appropriate for the executive 
directors to discuss any relevant matters regarding company performance with major shareholders and this 
is undertaken primarily by the Chief Executive and Finance Director. The Chief Executive provides feedback 
from major shareholders to the other directors, in order to ensure that Board members, and in particular 
non-executive directors, develop a balanced understanding of the views of major investors. The executive 
directors met with a number of the Company’s main shareholders during the year.
The Executive Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director also have periodic discussions with the 
Company’s brokers and issues are fed back to the Board as appropriate. When reports are received 
from the Company’s brokers following investor presentations, these are submitted to the Board for 
review. Additionally the non-executive directors have at least one opportunity each year to meet with the 
Company’s brokers to discuss any issues.
Responsibility for communication with key shareholders in relation to corporate governance and Board 
remuneration matters lies primarily with the Deputy Chairman who is assisted in this regard by the 
Company Secretary. Individual invitations to engage with the Deputy Chairman were sent out to key 
shareholders during the year and, where requested, matters were discussed in more detail.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Notice of the Annual General Meeting and related papers are sent to all shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the meeting. Separate resolutions are proposed for each matter including the adoption of the 
Report and Accounts, the approval of the Company’s Remuneration Policy, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the appointment of the Group’s external auditor. Proxy votes are counted and the meeting 
is advised of the number of proxies lodged for and against each resolution. The Chairmen of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees and the remaining non-executive directors are available to 
answer questions. Shareholders who attend are invited to ask questions and take part in the meeting.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and risk management. 
However it recognises that any system can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 42
In conjunction with the Company’s senior management team, the executive directors regularly identify, 
review and evaluate the key risks faced by the Group and the effectiveness of the internal controls in 
place to mitigate these risks. The results of these reviews are recorded in a formal document which sets 
out a detailed evaluation of each risk and the associated internal control in place to mitigate that risk. The 
document is reported to the Audit Committee and the Company’s external auditor for review at least once 
per year.
The Board of directors has continued to review the internal controls of the Company (including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management) and the principal risks which the Company 
faces during the year. No material weaknesses in internal controls were identified during the year. The 
principal risks faced by the Company and the measures taken to address these risks are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 24 to 28.
The disclosures regarding internal controls do not encompass the Company’s investment in the associate 
Opus Energy Group Limited.
SHARE CAPITAL AND VOTING RIGHTS
Details of the Company’s share capital and substantial shareholdings can be found in the Directors’ Report 
under the capital structure and substantial shareholders sections on pages 69 and 70.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Nomination Committee comprises Michael Pavia (Chairman of the Committee), Julian Schild and 
Charles Wigoder and therefore has a majority of independent non-executive directors in compliance with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (provision B.2.1).
The key responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include:
•  making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of new non-executive and executive directors, 
including making recommendations as to the composition of the Board generally and the balance 
between executive and non-executive directors;
•  giving consideration to succession planning for directors and other senior executives;
•  reviewing on an annual basis the time required from non-executive directors and assessing whether the 
non-executive directors are spending enough time to fulfil their duties;
•  reviewing the re-election by shareholders of directors under the annual re-election provisions of the Code; 
and
•  evaluating any matters relating to the continuation in office of any director including the suspension or 
termination of service of an executive director.
Although no new directors were appointed to the Board during the year, other Committee matters 
were periodically discussed as part of full Board meetings. These discussions principally concerned the 
appropriateness of the composition of the Board in the light of the Company’s existing operations and 
medium-term strategic objectives, and succession planning for directors and senior management. 
No changes to the Board were deemed necessary during the year although consistent with the 
requirement of the Code to ensure a progressive refreshing of the Board, the Committee has been tasked 
with developing a firm plan for independent non-executive director succession over the coming year, to 
reflect the long service of both Michael Pavia and Melvin Lawson since their appointment to the Board in 
late 2006. 
The Committee’s position in relation to diversity and the Code requirement to specify measurable objectives 
in this regard is set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 39 of this document.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
INTRODUCTION
The Audit Committee (“the Committee”) comprises three independent non-executive directors, Michael 
Pavia (Chairman of the Committee), Julian Schild and Melvin Lawson in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) (provision C.3.1). Michael Pavia is also identified as having recent and 
relevant financial experience. 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Attendance at Committee meetings during the current year by Committee members is set out in the 
Corporate Governance Report on page 37 of this document. In accordance with best practice, the 
Committee has the opportunity, as required, to meet with the external auditor of the Company without the 
presence of any executive directors and has done so during the current year. 
The key responsibilities of the Committee include:
•  reviewing the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditor and the direction of the 
external auditor to investigate any matters of particular concern;
•  assessing the effectiveness of the Company’s external auditor, including considering the scope and results 
of the annual audit; 
•  reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external auditor and assessing any potential impact on 
objectivity resulting from the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor;
•  monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and any formal announcements 
relating to the Company’s performance; and
•  reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls and other internal control and risk management 
processes.
The senior management team and executive directors periodically review the effectiveness of key internal 
control and risk management processes within the Company and report any changes in such activities to 
the Audit Committee and the external auditor for consideration. The review covers all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls. 
THE COMMITTEE’S ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014
During the year the Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Company’s half year and annual financial 
statements. The Committee advised the Board that the annual report and accounts taken as a whole provided 
a fair, balanced and understandable picture of the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 45
The Committee’s review of the financial statements included a detailed evaluation of the significant 
accounting issues therein. The actions taken by the Committee in regard to these are described in the 
table below. 
ISSUE ACTION TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE
Operational accuracy of billing system Review of external auditor procedures which included 
Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (“CAATs”).
Monitoring of regulator communications (Ofgem, BABT) 
and monthly monitoring of detailed call centre statistics 
which would indicate significant billing issues.
Valuation and recoverability of trade receivables Review of key assumptions underlying the recoverability 
of trade receivables based on historical experience.
Revenue recognition and recoverability of unbilled  
energy revenues
Review of key assumptions underlying the recoverability 
of unbilled energy revenues based on industry reports 
and historical experience.
Accounting treatment for new energy supply  
arrangements
Review of key aspects of new energy supply 
arrangements to determine the most appropriate 
accounting treatment including whether the acquired 
entities fall within the scope of IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations.
Risk of management override of internal controls Review of significant accounting estimates and 
judgements in relation mainly to receivables balances.
Also, in conjunction with the Company’s external auditor, the Audit Committee has considered, amongst 
other matters, compliance with the provisions of the Code and accounting developments, the Company’s 
financial control environment and its risk management and control processes. As part of this process the 
Audit Committee has also considered the need for any special projects or internal investigations and 
concluded that no such projects or investigations have been required. 
In accordance with the Code (provision C.3.5), the Audit Committee has also considered the need for 
an internal audit function at the Company and has concluded that, in the light of its review of the internal 
controls in place and the report of the external auditor, no such function is currently required.  
EXTERNAL AUDITOR EFFECTIVENESS
The external auditor presents a detailed audit report to the Audit Committee following a review of the 
annual financial statements. Having regard to its review of the work performed by the external auditor 
during the year and its approach to key audit issues, the Audit Committee remained satisfied with the 
effectiveness of the external auditor.  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 46
In reaching this conclusion, the Committee reviewed:
•  the experience and expertise of the audit team;
•  the scope and eventual fulfilment of the detailed audit strategy;
•  the robustness and perceptiveness of the audit team in their handling of key accounting and audit 
judgements; and
•  the nature and quality of the content of the external auditor’s report.
The Committee has therefore recommended to the Board, for approval by shareholders at the AGM, the 
reappointment of BDO LLP (“BDO”) as the Company’s external auditor for the coming year. 
The Committee’s position in relation to BDO’s tenure and the audit tendering requirements of the Code are 
set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 40.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE 
In order to guard against the objectivity and independence of the external auditor being compromised, the 
provision of any significant additional services aside from audit and tax compliance remains subject to the 
prior approval of the Audit Committee. The Committee would normally be likely to prohibit the provision of 
the following types of non-audit related work by the Company’s external auditor:
•  book-keeping and work relating to the preparation of accounting records and financial statements that 
will ultimately be subject to external audit;
•  financial information system design and implementation; 
•  appraisal or valuation services in respect of material assets;
•  internal auditing;
•  investment advice or corporate broking; and
•  any other work where mutual interests exist that could compromise the independence of the  
external auditor.
During the year the Audit Committee pre-approved the provision of reporting accountant services to the 
Company by the external auditor relating to the new energy supply arrangements with Npower which 
included the acquisition of Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited from Npower 
Limited (“the Engagement”). The Committee reviewed the services to be provided under the terms of 
the Engagement and concluded that in the light of the nature of the work proposed, and the level of the 
associated fees (as set out in note 2 of the financial statements on page 90 of this document), the external 
auditor’s objectivity and independence would not be compromised. 
Furthermore the Committee concluded that the external auditor was best placed to provide the services 
given the tight timetable for the Engagement and the external auditor’s inherent understanding of the 
Company’s existing energy supply arrangements with Npower which were integral to the transaction. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 47
The Committee’s conclusion in relation to the external auditor’s objectivity and independence was based on 
the following key points against the background of the APB’s Ethical Standards: (i) the external auditor would 
not be undertaking any decisions on behalf of management, providing investment advice or acting as an 
advocate for the Company as a result of the Engagement; (ii) the fee for the Engagement was not contingent, 
was priced on a consistent basis to other similar projects and was not material to either the external auditor 
or the Company; (iii) the subject matter relating to the Engagement would not be incorporated into the 
Company’s financial statements and therefore no self-review threat existed; (iv) the Engagement was to be 
completed well before the commencement of the audit for the year ended 31 March 2014 and therefore 
could not conceivably unduly influence the conduct of the audit; and (v) the Engagement would not pose a 
threat to independence through increased familiarity of audit personnel with the Company as the main aspects 
of the Engagement were to be carried out by a completely separate department within the external auditor’s 
organisation.
REPORTING OF STAFF CONCERNS
The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Michael Pavia, is the primary point of contact for staff of the 
Company to raise, in confidence, concerns they may have over possible improprieties, financial or 
otherwise. All employees have been notified of this arrangement on the Company’s intranet website 
which sets out Michael Pavia’s contact details (Code provision C.3.4). No such matters were raised by 
employees during the current year.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder,
I am delighted to have the opportunity to provide an introduction to the Remuneration Committee report 
which appears on pages 49 to 67.
Telecom Plus has had a successful year’s trading (as detailed elsewhere in the Annual Report) and the new 
energy supply arrangements with Npower are a testament to the vision, enterprise and dedication of the 
executive team.
The Company’s remuneration policy is set in full on pages 49 to 57. We are totally aware that we operate 
within a competitive environment and aim to reward senior executives fairly - but not excessively. We would 
not expect total remuneration to fall within the upper quartile relative to comparable organisations over the 
long term. 
At present, executive directors are not paid bonuses in either cash or shares. The Committee’s view is that 
full alignment of interest between executives and shareholders is achieved through the grant of market price 
share incentives at periodic intervals. Thus, unless the share price increases the executive director receives 
nothing beyond his basic salary and fringe benefits.
As part of our remit, we have reviewed the performance of the Chief Executive and Finance Director. We 
felt it appropriate to increase Andrew Lindsay’s base salary by 8.3% particularly in view of the greater 
range of responsibilities undertaken by him during the year. Chris Houghton’s salary was judged to be 
below current market rates; he received an increase of 33.3% and a further award of share options. The 
Committee has acknowledged investor feedback and raised the performance conditions thresholds required 
for these options to vest.
Andrew Lindsay played an outstanding role in the successful negotiation of the new energy supply 
arrangements with Npower. Over the next few years he will be leading the team to ensure that Telecom 
Plus, its shareholders and customers derive maximum benefit from the exciting opportunities it brings. We 
anticipate granting further market value options to Andrew Lindsay later this year vesting over three, five 
and seven years reflecting the contribution that we expect him to make towards the achievement of the 
Company’s objectives.
Finally, I should like to thank our shareholders for their support and constructive engagement over the  
past year.

REMUNERATION POLICY
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations 
to the Board regarding the policy relating to the total remuneration paid to the executive directors and 
members of senior management of the Company. It meets regularly to review and set all elements of the 
remuneration paid to the executive directors of the Company, including pension rights, and monitors the 
level and structure of remuneration for other senior management of the Company. It also exercises all the 
powers of the Board in relation to the operation of the Company’s share incentive schemes, including the 
grant of options and the terms of those grants.
The Committee met formally four times during the year and details of attendance at this meeting are 
provided in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 37.
The Committee’s principal activities during the year included:
• Reviewing and approving executive remuneration packages;
• Monitoring senior management remuneration packages;
•  Reviewing and approving the issue of share options to the Finance Director, certain employees and 
independent distributors of the Company; and
• Determining the performance conditions attached to the issue of share options.
REMUNERATION POLICY INTRODUCTION
The Company’s overall remuneration policy remains to ensure that the executive directors and other senior 
managers are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their individual contribution to the overall long term 
performance of the Company, in a manner that ensures that the Company is able to attract, motivate, and 
retain executives of the quality necessary to ensure the successful management of the Company. 
The Company’s current remuneration policy is based on the principle that the fortunes of the directors 
and senior management should be directly aligned with those of external shareholders, and this is 
predominantly achieved through the use of share incentive plans. The Remuneration Committee currently 
believes that share incentive awards granted at market value provide a far more transparent method by 
which to directly align each director’s interests with all shareholders when compared to the payment of 
regular annual cash bonuses based on short-term performance measures and/or the granting of ‘free’ 
shares with little or no downside risk to the participant.
The outstanding awards made under share incentive schemes to date are broadly consistent with the future 
policy set out below and, for the avoidance of doubt, will remain in place until exercise.
The future remuneration policy described in this part of the report has been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium–sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended in August 2013), and is intended to apply for the three years 
beginning on the date of the forthcoming AGM, subject to shareholder approval at the meeting. The 
Committee will review the remuneration policy annually to ensure it remains appropriate for the Company’s 
requirements and consistent with market practice, however there is no current intention to revise the policy 
more frequently than every three years. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 50

CHOICE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Committee has chosen the performance measures described in the table above as these are deemed 
to directly align the executive directors’ interests with those of all shareholders in an easily understood and 
transparent manner. 
The performance measures comprise a combination of relative TSR, Adjusted EPS (excluding share incentive 
scheme charges and amortisation of intangible assets) and service number growth measures. Adjusted EPS 
is considered appropriate as a key strategic objective of the Company is to drive profitable growth in each 
year. It also provides a balance to relative TSR, which considers shareholder value creation and reflects 
market expectations of future performance, and absolute service number growth which, when achieved 
responsibly, will also drive long-term value creation. 
The use of relative TSR and Adjusted EPS growth measures provides a combined focus on the Company’s 
financial performance and shareholder value creation. Targets for Adjusted EPS are set by reference to 
internal budgeting plans and external market expectations. TSR targets are set on a standard practice, median 
to upper quartile ranking range. Only 30% of share incentive awards vest for threshold levels of performance.
The Committee wishes to retain the ability to change the composition of performance conditions for future 
grants to directors should this be required in order to appropriately reflect the strategic responsibilities of 
the particular director concerned.
ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY
The bar chart below seeks to illustrate the potential rewards available under the proposed remuneration 
policy for the coming financial year under varying levels of performance. For the purposes of the illustration 
the values assume the maximum grant of share incentive awards during the year and no annual cash 
bonuses are paid. However, as outlined in the above table, the Remuneration Committee reserves the 
right to bring or carry forward any unused annual share incentive scheme allowances. Therefore, share 
incentives might not be awarded during a particular year, and/or share incentive awards may be larger 
than 200% of base salary in any one year. 
The amounts included for share incentive awards are based on one third of the market value of the shares 
under option. The amounts for pensions and benefits included in the fixed remuneration figure have been 
calculated on the same basis as payments made for the year ended 31 March 2014.
The potential rewards available for ‘on–target’ performance under share incentive schemes have been 
based on 30% vesting of share incentive awards.  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 54

Treatment of unvested share 
incentive scheme awards 
under plan rules.
All awards lapse except 
for “good leavers”: i.e. 
death, injury, disability, 
redundancy, retirement 
or where the employing 
company or the company 
with which the office is held 
ceases to be a member of 
the Group or the transfer 
of employment out of the 
Group by reason of the 
Transfer of Undertakings 
(Protection of Employment) 
Regulations 2006.
A “good leaver” may exercise any 
subsisting share options within the 
period of 6 months from the date of 
cessation of employment.
If a participant ceases to be employed 
within the Group otherwise than as 
a “good leaver”, no unvested share 
options held shall be exercisable 
after the date of such cessation unless 
the Remuneration Committee in its 
absolute discretion (provided that 
such discretion must be exercised 
fairly and reasonably) so decides 
but for a period of not more than 12 
months from the date of cessation. The 
Committee considers it unlikely that 
such discretion would be used in the 
event of a participant ceasing to be 
employed by the Company as a “bad 
leaver”.
In relation to unvested awards made 
under the Joint Share Ownership 
Plan (“JSOP”) for a “good leaver”, 
the Remuneration Committee will 
specify the extent to which such 
awards should vest having regard 
to the length of time since the award 
was acquired and the director’s 
performance to that date. 
If a participant in the JSOP ceases 
to be employed within the Group 
otherwise than as a “good leaver”,

APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
The Committee’s approach to recruitment is to pay a sufficient amount necessary to attract the best 
candidates to the particular role. In determining these amounts the Committee will be mindful of, inter alia, 
prevailing market rates, the chosen candidate’s skills, knowledge and experience, and their existing location 
and position.
Where the candidate has variable remuneration arrangements with a previous employer that will be lost 
on leaving employment, the Company will consider offering a sign-on award in compensation for the 
value foregone, either as an award under an existing share incentive scheme or a bespoke award under 
the Listing Rules exemption available for this purpose. The face and/or expected values of the award(s) 
offered will not materially exceed the value ascribed to the award(s) foregone, and would normally follow 
the same vesting timing and form (i.e. cash or shares) save that the Committee may award the whole of 
the value in shares, at its discretion. The application of performance conditions would be considered and, 
where appropriate, the awards could be made subject to claw-back in certain circumstances. For material 
amounts the Committee would, where practicable, consult with key institutional shareholders ahead 
of committing to make any such sign-on awards, and in any event a full explanation of any amounts 
awarded, an explanation of why it was necessary and a breakdown of the awards to be made will be 
announced to the markets at the time of granting. For the avoidance of doubt, should a new director be 
internally promoted from the Company’s senior management team they will not be expected to give up 
or amend any element of remuneration granted to them prior to becoming a director which is inconsistent 
with the remuneration policy set out above.
Any new executive director’s remuneration package would include the same elements, and be subject to 
the same constraints, as those of the existing executive directors as outlined in the above policy table.

STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Chairman of the Committee engages with certain of the Company’s largest shareholders who have 
expressed an interest in being consulted in relation to remuneration matters to understand their expectations 
and monitor any changes in their views. This year, major shareholders who had previously indicated an 
interest in being consulted were contacted in relation to the setting of performance conditions for share 
incentive scheme awards. As a result of previous feedback received, and as described in the Remuneration 
Committee report for this year below, the Committee decided to reduce the threshold vesting level for share 
options and increase the level of challenge in the performance conditions set.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
The Committee considers pay levels across the organisation when setting remuneration for all directors 
(both executives and non-executives). However this review is undertaken against a background of ensuring 
that the prevailing market rates for all levels of employee in the organisation are taken into account in order 
to attract, retain and motivate the best employees at each level. In relation to directors, specific account 
is taken of any change in the level of responsibility of the director (whether through a change in role or 
the increased size of the Company) or an increase in experience and knowledge of the Company and its 
markets which may not be relevant to roles elsewhere in the Company. 
The Company does not deem it appropriate to formally consult with employees regarding the determination 
of the directors’ remuneration policy as the broad remuneration structure for directors mirrors that of all 
employees, i.e. the payment of a base salary, benefits and share incentive scheme awards at market price. 
However, employees have the opportunity to make comments on any aspect of the Company’s activities 
through an employee survey and any comments made which are relevant to directors’ remuneration would 
be considered by the Committee. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 58
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This report, which has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (“the Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012 and Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium–Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended 
in August 2013) (“the Regulations”), has been approved by the Board of directors for submission to 
shareholders for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The sections under the headings 
“Single Total Figure of Remuneration”, parts of “Share Incentive Schemes” and “Pension Schemes” have 
been subject to external audit.
SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION
The Committee recommended increases to the annual base salaries of each of the executive directors 
during the year. Mr Wigoder received an increase of 2.8% to £370,000 and Mr Lindsay an increase 
of 8.3% to £390,000. Mr Houghton received a larger percentage increase of approximately 33.3% to 
£300,000 in recognition of the increasing responsibility and complexity inherent in his role, his growing 
experience of the Company and its markets, and to reflect the fact that his previous salary was considerably 
below the market rate for Finance Directors of FTSE 250 companies of a similar size. However, given the 
recent increases made to his salary over the past two years, Mr Houghton is not expected to receive routine 
salary increases of this magnitude in future.
In addition, share options with performance conditions attached were issued to Mr Houghton during the 
year, details of which are set out below in this report.
The non-executive directors receive fees for their services, the details of which are described below. The 
level of these fees was unchanged during the year.

SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES 
The Company has two share option plans and a Joint Share Ownership Plan (the “JSOP”). The first share 
option plan and the JSOP are available to employees, and the second share option plan is available to the 
Company’s independent distributors.
The Employee Share Option Plan
Subject to serving the requisite probationary period, all employees are eligible to participate in the 
Company’s employee share option plan and be issued with market price options over shares in the 
Company, the number of shares being related to their seniority and length of service.
The Committee recognises that the collective contribution of all employees is critical to the success of the 
Company and continues to believe that the granting of share options at all levels within the organisation 
generates employee loyalty and helps to ensure that staff turnover is kept to a minimum and below the 
levels seen across the industry for employees passing their probationary periods.
The Joint Share Ownership Plan
Awards made through the JSOP provide participants with a joint interest in tranches of shares which are 
held until vesting by an independent employee benefit trust (the “JSOP Share Trust”). The trustee of the JSOP 
Share Trust is Barclays Wealth Trustees (Guernsey) Limited. The value to participants of awards made under 
the JSOP is based upon the growth in the value of the Company’s shares from the date of grant in a similar 
manner to the value achieved through participation in the conventional share option scheme. However, 
participants in the JSOP only receive value to the extent that the share price increase exceeds a compound 
annual growth rate of at least five per cent (the “Hurdle Rate”). On vesting, participants receive any gain  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 60
Hurdle Rate being retained by the JSOP Share Trust. In addition, awards made under the JSOP to executive 
directors will only vest to the extent applicable performance conditions relating to the financial and trading 
performance of the Company are met. It is currently considered unlikely by the Committee that further 
awards will be made under the JSOP.
The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan
The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives and rewards to those 
distributors who have been most successful in gathering new customers for the Company. These distributors, 
whilst not being employees of the Company, are nevertheless essential to its future growth, and it is the 
opinion of the Committee that this plan can in some cases be an important factor in their motivation. 
During the year options were issued in two tranches to 218 distributors under a share option promotion 
scheme which requires the participants to achieve performance conditions in order for the options to vest. 
These performance conditions will involve distributors consistently gathering customers throughout the three-
year vesting periods of the options.
Statement of Directors’ Shareholding and Share Interests (audited)
Details of the directors’ shareholdings are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 68. As set out in the 
Future Remuneration Policy Table above, a target level of share ownership is not stipulated for directors, 
however, subject to personal circumstances and existing shareholdings they are encouraged to retain a 
proportion of shares issued as a result of the exercise of share incentive awards.
Details of the share awards held by or granted to directors during the year are set out in the tables below 
(further details on the estimated cost of these awards are set out in note 18 to the financial statements):

CONTINUED Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 61
The share options granted to Andrew Lindsay on 12 June 2008 were fully exercised on 26 February 2014. 
In accordance with the rules of the Employee Share Option Plan, the Company elected to satisfy these 
options by transferring 179,115 shares to Mr Lindsay at nominal value, representing the value of the gain 
made on these options at the market price for Ordinary Shares on the day of exercise. 
Following the exercise of these options, Mr Lindsay sold 179,115 Ordinary Shares on 26 February 2014 
for an average price of 1,853.34 pence per Ordinary Share. Following the sale of these shares Mr Lindsay 
retained an interest in 132,312 Ordinary Shares, excluding his joint interest in the award made under the 
JSOP detailed below.
The award of a joint interest in 500,000 shares made to Mr Lindsay on 31 March 2011 under the JSOP 
(“the JSOP Share Award”) was made subject to performance conditions which were described in detail 
in the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2011. The interest Mr Lindsay holds in the JSOP Share 
Award allows him, subject to the achievement of the performance conditions summarised below, to receive 
any increase in the value of the 500,000 shares over the share price on the date of grant (£4.55) plus an 
annual compound growth rate of five per cent. This means that if Mr Lindsay were to exercise his award on 
the first date of vesting, 1 April 2015, he would receive any value over £5.53 per share. 
The table below sets out the compound annual growth rates required during the vesting period across 
the three performance conditions which will determine the percentage of the 500,000 shares that will be 
used to calculate the total gain attributable to Mr Lindsay, e.g. if the Company were to achieve compound 
annual EPS and TSR growth of exactly 5% over the vesting period the gain attributable to Mr Lindsay would 
be calculated based on the total value of 250,000 shares over the annual compound 5% Hurdle Rate. The 
number of shares used to calculate the gain which Mr Lindsay will be entitled to receive on vesting will 
depend on the average growth achieved across the two highest performance conditions.

The 50,000 options granted to Mr Houghton on 10 December 2008 were granted to him prior to his 
appointment to the Board on terms that performance conditions would not be imposed in respect of this 
grant. However, the 50,000 options granted to him on 26 June 2009 after his appointment to the Board 
were made subject to performance conditions which were described in detail in the annual report for the 
year ended 31 March 2010. The performance conditions in relation to these options were all met and the 
options have vested. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 62
The 50,000 options granted to Mr Houghton on 26 June 2012 were also made subject to performance 
conditions which were described in detail in the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2013 and are

A further 50,000 options were awarded to Mr Houghton on 16 December 2013. These options will vest in 
two discrete tranches of 25,000 over three and five year vesting periods, each representing shares with a 
face value of £434,750 representing approximately 150% of Mr Houghton’s annual base salary. However, 
it should be noted that as market price options their value to Mr Houghton rests solely on the increase in 
the Company’s share price from the point of grant. In accordance with guidance in the FRC’s Lab Project 
Report: Reporting of pay and performance issued in March 2013, the value of market price share options 
can be measured as one third of the market value of the shares under option. The total value of these 
options granted to Mr Houghton under this measure would therefore represent approximately 96% of his 
annual base salary for the year.
These options were made subject to performance conditions as described in detail below. In determining 
the nature of these performance conditions, the Committee was mindful of views expressed by investors 
in relation to performance conditions previously used by the Company for share incentive awards. The 
Committee therefore decided to reduce the percentage level for threshold vesting to 30% and use a 
weighted average across the three performance conditions rather than allowing the flexibility of using the 
highest two of three measures.

The base year for the Adjusted EPS performance measure will be the Adjusted EPS for the year ended 
31 March 2013, but re-based to reflect the impact of the revised terms of the new energy supply 
agreement agreed with Npower in December 2013, as set out in the prospectus issued by the Company 
to shareholders on 20 November 2013. The prospectus confirmed that, had the revised energy supply 
agreement been in place during the whole year ended 31 March 2013 the incremental pre-tax profit would 
have been £9.3 million. This amount has therefore been used to re-base the Adjusted EPS for the year 
ended 31 March 2013.
At the year end the Company’s share price was 1,793p and the range during the financial year was 
1,035p to 1,914p. Details of all the directors’ interests in the shares of the Company are set out in the table 
in the Directors’ Report on page 68.
DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS OF SERVICE 
There are Service Contracts or Letters of Appointment for Charles Wigoder (5 May 2011), Andrew Lindsay 
(5 May 2011), Chris Houghton (16 February 2009), Julian Schild (25 May 2010), Melvin Lawson (27

on either side for the non-executive directors and the following notice periods for the executive directors: Mr 
Wigoder twelve months on either side and Mr Lindsay and Mr Houghton each with six months on either side. 
PENSION SCHEMES (AUDITED)
The Company makes no contributions to the pensions of any current directors except to Mr Wigoder, Mr

PERFORMANCE GRAPH SHOWING TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN 
The following graph shows the Company’s performance measured by total shareholder return compared 
with the performance of the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index and the FTSE 350 for the period 1 
April 2009 to 31 March 2014. As noted in previous years, the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index 
was initially selected at a time when a larger proportion of the Company’s revenues related to the supply 
of telephony services; only approximately 12.5% of the Company’s revenues are now generated from such 
telephony services. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 64
The FTSE 350 Index is included as a further comparator in the light of the fact that there are no sector 
specific indices containing directly comparable quoted companies supplying a broad range of services 
similar to that provided by the Company. 
TABLE OF HISTORICAL DATA
The following table shows the total remuneration, as defined by the Regulations, and the amount vesting 
under share incentive schemes as a percentage of the maximum that could have been achieved, in respect 
of the Chief Executive. The Chief Executive was Mr Andrew Lindsay in all years shown in the table except 
for the year ended 31 March 2010 which represented Mr Charles Wigoder’s final year as Chief Executive

The Company’s pay review for the year ended 31 March 2014 which took effect on 1 April 2013 
awarded average percentage increases in salaries to all employees of 2.75%. The size of the increase 
awarded to Mr Lindsay reflected the increased responsibility inherent in his role specifically as the size of 
the Company grew during the period. The increase also reflected the relative level of his salary compared 
to chief executives of other similarly-sized publicly listed companies. At other levels within the Company 
increases of a comparable size to Mr Lindsay’s were made where appropriate to similarly reflect increases 
in responsibility for certain individuals.

STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR
Base Salaries
Against the background of the Company’s future remuneration policy set out in this report, the Committee 
recommended that increases to the base salaries of the executive directors for the forthcoming year ended 
31 March 2015, with effect from 1 April 2014, be made as described below. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 66
Executive Chairman Charles Wigoder’s annual base salary was increased from £370,000 to £420,000. 
This increase primarily reflects the fact that the Company will no longer be making pension contributions on 
behalf of Mr Wigoder as he has reached the limit of the lifetime allowance for pension contributions under 
current HMRC rules. The contributions made by the Company to Mr Wigoder’s pension during the year 
ended 31 March 2014 amounted to £37,000, representing the majority of the salary increase for 2015, 
with the balance of the increase broadly reflecting inflation.
The annual base salary of Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay was increased from £390,000 to £455,000 
reflecting his strong personal performance and the incremental responsibility resulting from the significant 
increase in the size and profile of the Company during the year following the entering into of the new 
energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013.
The annual base salary of Finance Director Chris Houghton was held at £300,000 reflecting the large 
increase made to his salary last year.
Share Incentive Schemes
It is expected that a share option award will be made to Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay during the coming 
year. The award will comprise the granting of market value options over 300,000 shares which will vest in 
three discrete equal tranches after three, five and seven years. The award will fall within the limits set out 
in the Remuneration Policy above as Mr Lindsay has not received a share incentive scheme award since 
2011. The Committee will be mindful of the size of this award when considering any future awards to Mr 
Lindsay in future.
The performance measures to be applied to Mr Lindsay’s award will mirror those used for the award of 
options to Finance Director Chris Houghton in December 2013 as summarised below. It is expected that 
each performance measure will be given an equal weighting. The base year for measuring performance 
will be the year ended 31 March 2014.

the Company between 1 April 2014 and 20 May 2014. 
The powers of Directors are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association (the “Articles”). The Articles 
may be amended by way of a special resolution of the members of the Company. The Board may exercise 
all powers conferred on it by the Articles and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, and other 
applicable legislation. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 69
The Board has established a formal, rigorous and transparent process for the selection and subsequent 
appointment of new directors to the Board. The rules relating to the appointment and replacement of 
directors are contained within the Articles. The Articles provide that Directors may be appointed by an 
ordinary resolution of the members or by a resolution of the Directors, provided that, in the latter instance, 
a director appointed in that way retires at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment. In 
addition, Mr Wigoder, as he holds in excess of 20% of the Company’s shares, is entitled under the Articles 
to appoint a director and remove any such director appointed.
In accordance with current best practice, all Board directors will be retiring at the forthcoming AGM and 
will then offer themselves for re-election.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations where they have, or could have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the Company’s interests. The Companies Act 2006 and 
the Company’s Articles allow the Board to authorise such conflicts of interest should this be deemed to be 
appropriate.
The Board has put in place effective procedures for managing and, where appropriate, approving conflicts or 
potential conflicts of interest. Under these procedures, the Directors are required to declare all directorships or 
other appointments to companies which are not part of the Group, as well as other situations which could give 
rise to a potential conflict. The Board will, where appropriate, authorise a conflict or potential conflict, and 
will impose all necessary restrictions and/or conditions where it sees fit. The Company maintains a register of 
directors’ conflicts of interest which is reviewed regularly by the Board.
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY INSURANCE
The Company maintains appropriate insurance to cover directors’ and officers’ liability and has provided 
an indemnity, as permitted by the Companies Act 2006, in respect of all of the Company’s directors which 
was in force throughout the financial year and remains in force. Neither the insurance nor the indemnity 
provides cover where a director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
EMPLOYEES
The requirements of the Companies Act 2006 in respect of employees are set out in the Strategic Report on 
pages 29 to 31.
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDERS
As at 20 May 2014, in addition to the directors, the following have notified the Company of their 
substantial shareholdings as detailed below: 
SHAREHOLDER NUMBER OF SHARES PERCENTAGE OF ISSUED 
 SHARE CAPITAL
Standard Life Investments Ltd 7,207,174 9.0%
Schroder Investment Mgt 4,996,526 6.2%

BlackRock Investment Mgt (UK) 2,429,148 3.0% Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 70
CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Restrictions on the transfer of shares
The Company only has ordinary shares in issue. Other than as set out below, there are no restrictions 
on the transfer of the ordinary shares, except where a holder refuses to comply with a statutory notice 
requesting details of those who have an interest and the extent of their interest in a particular holding of 
shares. In such cases, where the identified shares make up 0.25% or more of the ordinary shares in issue, 
the directors may refuse to register a transfer of any of the identified shares in certificated form and, so far 
as permitted by the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, a transfer of any of the identified shares 
which are held in the electronic share dealing system CREST, unless the directors are satisfied that they  
have been sold outright to an independent third party.
Other than as set out below and so far as the directors are aware, there were no arrangements at 31 
March 2014 by which, with the Company’s co-operation, financial rights carried by securities are held 
by a person other than a holder of securities, or any arrangements between holders of securities that are 
known to the Company and which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Executive Chairman Charles Wigoder entered into an agreement to charge 325,000 of his shares in the 
Company as security for a loan from Barclays Bank on 3 December 2013. The loan enabled him to apply 
for 57,142 ordinary shares as part of his open offer entitlement which resulted from funding the Company’s 
entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower on 20 December 2013. Under the terms 
of the charge, title to the 325,000 shares can be transferred, sold or otherwise dealt with by Barclays 
following the occurrence of a failure to pay any amount due and payable under the loan. 
In addition, certain members of senior management have loans secured against some or all of their 
shareholdings in the Company which restrict their ability to transfer these shares prior to repayment of  
the loans.
The Company established a Joint Share Ownership Plan (“the JSOP”) on 30 March 2011. As part of the 
JSOP an employee benefit trust was established to jointly hold shares with the participants in the plan (“the 
JSOP Share Trust”). As at 31 March 2014 the JSOP Share Trust jointly held 500,000 shares with the Chief 
Executive, Mr Andrew Lindsay. Prior to vesting, all voting and dividend rights attached to these shares have 
been waived.
Takeovers
There are no significant arrangements to which the Company is party that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, save in relation to the arrangements 
with Npower and Everything Everywhere (formerly T-Mobile) for the supply of energy and mobile telephony 
respectively, or any agreements between the Company and its directors or employees providing for 
compensation for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or 
otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Authority for purchase of own shares
At the last AGM held on 17 July 2013, the Company obtained authority to purchase up to 7,062,061 
ordinary shares representing approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) as at 11 June 2013. The Company intends to renew this authority at this year’s AGM.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
Each of the directors has confirmed that so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditor is unaware, and that he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company’s position in relation to compliance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council is set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 
36 to 42.
GOING CONCERN 
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 3 to 33. The financial position 
of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial 
Review on pages 18 to 23 and within notes 12 and 19 to the financial statements. In addition, notes 15 
and 19 include the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower 
continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of 
energy to the Company’s customers. This includes funding the Budget Plans of customers who pay for their 
energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.
The Group has secured from Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) total working capital credit facilities of £25 
million for the period to 20 December 2016. In addition the Group has a transaction loan facility of £100 
million with Barclays which was fully drawn down at the year end. 
The Company has considerable financial resources together with a large and diverse retail and small 
business customer base and long term contracts with a number of key suppliers. As a consequence, the 
directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks.
On this basis the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The annual financial statements have therefore 
been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the FRC’s Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: 
Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009 issued in October 2009.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law the directors are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the group and company and of the profit or loss for the group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•  prepare a director’s report and directors’ remuneration report which comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
WEBSITE PUBLICATION
The directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made available 
on a website. Financial statements are published on the company’s website in accordance with legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may 
vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the company’s website is 
the responsibility of the directors. The directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the 
financial statements contained therein.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES PURSUANT TO DTR4
The directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:
•  The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Group.
•  The annual report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
financial position of the Group and the parent company, together with a description or the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers the report and accounts, taken as 
a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable and that it provides the information necessary for

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF TELECOM PLUS PLC
REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion: 
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
•  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
WHAT WE HAVE AUDITED
The financial statements, which are prepared by Telecom Plus PLC, comprise the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the consolidated and company balance sheets, the consolidated and company 
cash flow statements, the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity and the related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Materiality
We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.75m which is based on 7.5% of profit before tax 
normalised through adjusting for transactions not principally relating to trading operations and averaging 
over the current and previous two accounting periods. In normalising profit before tax we added back the 
annual share incentive scheme charges which are impacted by movements in the Group’s share price and 
the amortisation charge in respect of intangible assets. We consider this measure to be the most significant 
determinant of the Group’s financial performance and therefore an appropriate basis for materiality as it is 
one of the key performance indicators used by management.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all audit differences individually 
in excess of £50,000. We also agreed to report differences below these thresholds that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The audit work undertaken in relation to the significant components was executed at levels of materiality 
applicable to each entity and ranged from £1.5m to £1.65m.
Overview of the scope of our audit
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the FRC’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
In establishing our group audit approach we gained an understanding of the Group and the regulatory 
environment in which it operates and we subsequently focused on the three principal trading companies 
which account for 85% of the Group’s profit before tax. Additional audit procedures were performed on 
financial information from those components not considered to be significant to provide us with reasonable 
assurance that material error does not exist within those components. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 75
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on the 
audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We 
have discussed our assessment of the risks of material misstatement with the Audit Committee who have set 
out on pages 44 to 47 of their report consideration of these risks.
AREA OF RISK HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE RISK
ACCURACY OF THE BILLING SYSTEM
The billing system is central to the Group’s business and 
is responsible for generating several key balances which 
are reported in the Group financial statements.
We focused on this area as it is possible that any 
systematic errors in the billing system could result in 
processing errors causing material misstatement across 
multiple balances within the financial statements.  
The documentation and testing of the Group’s IT system, 
processes and controls is a core part of our audit scope 
and addresses the potential risks arising from the billing 
system with enhanced procedures being performed in 
relation to revenues and commissions payable.
We assessed and tested the key controls that surround the 
billing system as well as the integrity of the data being 
generated through the inclusion of Information System 
specialists on the audit team and through the application 
of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (“CAATs”). 
VALUATION AND RECOVERABILITY OF TRADE RECEIVABLES
The reported trade receivables balance is largely 
represented by customers who have debt assigned to 
their prepayment meter or have defaulted on a payment. 
As a result, recoverability of uncollected debt requires 
management to make significant judgements regarding 
expected future receipts from customers.
We evaluated the ageing analysis and composition of 
trade receivables and challenged the appropriateness 
of management’s key assumptions used in the provision 
calculations.
Our work involved reviewing assumptions applied in 
the context of the Group’s historical experience and 
performing sensitivity analysis on the critical assumptions 
to determine the extent of change in those assumptions  
that would be required for the provision to change 
materially.  
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND THE VALUATION AND RECOVERABILITY OF UNBILLED ENERGY SUPPLIED
Estimation is required in relation to revenue as a material 
element of unbilled energy supplied is measured by 
multiplying usage by an average rate per KwH. 
Moreover, whilst the Group makes every effort to 
measure customers’ energy usage through accurate meter 
reading and estimation, income is accrued in relation to 
energy supplied which is yet to be allocated to individual 
customer accounts. A degree of estimation is required in 
determining this accrued revenue.
In addition management have made certain valuation 
provisions against the receivable which requires 
estimation judgement.
We considered the rationale for recognising revenue 
based on energy supplied but not yet billed, and 
evaluated the processes and procedures surrounding 
customer meter reading. 
Specifically, we considered evidence that supports the 
propensity of customers to under-report energy usage, 
and usage levels which have not been independently 
verified.
Our work also involved reviewing the rationale and 
assumptions applied in identifying irrecoverable usage 
and the estimates and significant judgements adopted 
in determining recoverable amounts, identifying and 
challenging those assumptions that have the greatest 
impact on the receivable. Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 76
AREA OF RISK HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE RISK
ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF NEW ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS
As disclosed in notes 6 and 21 to the financial 
statements, during the year the Group acquired two 
entities in order to enter into a wholesale supply and 
services agreement with Npower. The directors do not 
consider that these acquisitions represented business 
combinations under IFRS 3 Business Combinations (“IFRS 
3”) and accordingly have treated the transaction as the 
purchase of assets under the framework set out in IAS 38 
Intangible Assets.
In determining the appropriate accounting treatment 
and disclosures required in the financial statements it 
was necessary for the directors to exercise judgement in 
applying IFRS to the circumstances of the transaction.
We reviewed the sale and purchase and wholesale 
supply and services agreements and have challenged 
management’s assessment that the acquired entities did not 
meet the definition of businesses under IFRS 3. 
We considered the factors outlined in note 21 and, in 
particular, the relationship between the company, Npower 
and the acquired entities both before and after the 
transaction date. 
RISK OF MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF INTERNAL CONTROLS
The financial statements include a number of balances 
including current receivables which require the directors 
to make estimates and exercise judgement in determining 
recoverable amounts. 
We examined the significant accounting estimates 
and judgements relevant to the financial statements for 
evidence of bias by the directors.
In particular, we tested key reconciliations, unbilled 
revenue, provisions surrounding delinquent customers, 
intangible asset amortisation and fair values.
We also tested manual journal entries.
 
OPINION ON MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006
In our opinion:
•  the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006;
•  the information given in the strategic report and directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
•  the information given in the corporate governance statement set out on pages 36 to 42 of the annual 
report with respect to internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting 
processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.
OTHER MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these 
matters or our review.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the corporate governance statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We 
have nothing to report arising from our review.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 71 that the group is a 
going concern. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the annual report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the annual report is:
•  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
•  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
•  is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between the 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that 
we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We have not 
identified any such inconsistencies, apparent misstatements or misleading statements.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, on page 72, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 83
GENERAL INFORMATION
Telecom Plus PLC (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2014 comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interest in associates. 
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 20 May 2014. 
PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As a result of the increasing relative size of the cash-settled share incentive scheme charges it has been 
decided to separately disclose the amount on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income for the period. The increase in this charge mainly reflects the strong rise in the Company’s share 
price over the last year and therefore separate disclosure was deemed appropriate in order to provide a 
clearer understanding of the underlying performance of the business. 
In view of the size and nature of the charge as a non-cash item, it has also been decided to separately disclose 
the amortisation of intangible assets on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for 
the period. More information regarding the intangible asset is set out in note 6 of these financial statements.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(a) Statement of compliance 
The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations as endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
(b) Basis of preparation 
The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis. 
Critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described below, the Directors have 
made judgements, estimations and assumptions regarding the future. The judgements, estimations, and 
assumptions that have the most significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are 
detailed below.
Estimates and judgements are evaluated based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In future, actual 
results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
(i) Trade receivables (notes 10 and 11)
Trade receivables largely represent customers who have energy debt assigned to a prepayment meter,  
or are in the process of having such a meter installed. This requires the Directors to make estimates  
and judgements as to the expected level of eventual debt recovery from these customers based on 
historical experience. 
(ii) Revenue recognition and unbilled energy debtors (note 11)
Accrued revenue includes balances for energy consumption which have yet to be allocated and billed 
on to individual customers. In the absence of meter readings, the level of this revenue relies on industry 
estimates of annual consumption by the Group’s customers. The Directors are required to make estimates 
and judgements as to the likelihood of this revenue being billed and recovered based on industry 
information and historical experience.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 84
(iii) Share incentive scheme charges (note 18)
The Group has a conventional share option scheme and a Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”) for 
employees and Directors. The fair value of share options and JSOP awards is estimated by using the 
Binomial valuation model on the date of grant based on certain assumptions. Those assumptions are 
described in note 18 and include, amongst others, the dividend yield, expected volatility, expected life of 
the options and number of options expected to vest. 
(iv) New energy supply arrangements (note 21)
The entering into of the new energy supply arrangements with Npower in December 2013 included 
the acquisition of two new subsidiaries from Npower. The Directors were therefore required to make a 
judgment in relation to the accounting treatment of the transaction under IFRS 3 Business Combinations. 
Further detail regarding the transaction and the associated accounting treatment are set out in note 21 
of these financial statements.
By virtue of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from presenting a statement of 
comprehensive income. The Company made a profit for the year of £18,811,000 (2013: £25,600,000).
The following standards and interpretations have become mandatory for the Company during the 
current accounting period, but where relevant to the Company they have not had a material impact on 
the financial statements:
• IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements;
• IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures;
• IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure;
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements;
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements; 
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities; and
• IFRS 13 Fair Value measurement.
(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries 
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Telecom Plus PLC and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control transfers to the Group and are included until 
the date on which the Group ceases to control them. Control is recognised where an investor is expected 
to receive, or has rights to, variable returns from its investment in the investee and has the ability to affect 
these returns through its power over the investee. Transactions between Group companies are eliminated on 
consolidation.
(ii) Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary 
nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the 
equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the 
consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of 
the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an 
associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate are not recognised.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 85
(d) Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for in accordance with the guidance set out in IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations (“IFRS 3”). An analysis of whether any subsidiaries acquired constitute businesses in their 
own right is initially undertaken with reference to the guidance in IFRS 3. 
Where an acquired subsidiary does not constitute a business under IFRS 3 (i.e. it does not have, inter alia, 
the inputs, processes and outputs to function on a standalone basis) the acquisition of the subsidiary is 
treated as an acquisition of assets. The assets acquired are recorded at cost and no goodwill is recognised. 
Transaction costs are capitalised as part of the cost of acquisition.
Where an acquired subsidiary constitutes a business under IFRS 3, the assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost 
of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is 
reviewed for impairment at least annually and any impairment is recognised immediately in the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income. 
(e) Revenue
Revenue is the value of goods and services supplied to external customers and independent distributors 
excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes. For each of the Company’s main income streams 
from the provision of fixed line telephony, broadband, mobile telephony, gas and electricity services, 
transactions are recorded as sales in the month when the provision of those services or the supply of goods 
takes place. The Company’s customers are invoiced in the month following that in which the services 
are provided. The Company also generates revenue as a result of providing bill payment protection and 
accidental death cover to customers for a monthly fee. The Company does not retain the insurance risk 
for these services. The recognition of revenue associated with the provision of gas and electricity services 
to customers by the Group relies on industry estimates of annual usage where meter readings are not 
available. These estimates are based on historical usage information as adjusted for known factors such as 
variations in weather.
(f) Interest income
Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues, using the effective 
interest rate method.
(g) Leases
Payments on operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line 
basis over the lease term.
(h) Hire purchase agreements
Hire purchase agreements relate to leases of assets where the Group has passed on substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership and are therefore classified as finance leases. When assets are leased out 
under finance leases, the present value of the minimum lease payments is recognised as a receivable.
(i) Taxation
The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 86
Deferred tax is recognised, based on the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for 
taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
(j) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less a provision for depreciation. Depreciation is calculated 
so as to write off the cost less estimated residual value of the assets in equal instalments over their expected 
useful lives. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Depreciation is provided on other assets at the 
following rates:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 15 years
Fixtures and fittings 7 years
Freehold and leasehold improvements 3 years
Computer and office equipment 3 to 5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when there is an 
indication that they may be impaired.
(k) Intangible assets
Intangible assets which arise (e.g. on the entering into of significant commercial contractual arrangements) 
are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, or the term of any contractual arrangement or, where 
appropriate and an indefinite life is chosen, made subject to an annual impairment review.
(l) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, representing the difference between the cost of acquisition 
and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired is capitalised and is subject to impairment review, both 
annually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
(m) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at 
each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication 
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit 
exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment 
loss had been recognised.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 87
(n) Investments
In the Company’s accounts, investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are initially stated 
at cost. Provision is made for any impairment in the value of these investments. In the Group accounts 
investments in associated undertakings are shown at cost plus accumulated profits less any dividends 
received from the associated undertakings.
(o) Inventories
Inventories principally include mobile telephones and other electronic equipment and are valued at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is measured on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution.
(p) Financial instruments
The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial 
asset, a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual 
arrangement.
Financial instruments are recognised on the trade date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of a 
financial instrument not at fair value through profit and loss, transactions costs that are directly attributable 
to the acquisition or issue of the financial instrument.
Financial instruments are derecognised on the trade date when the Group is no longer a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
(q) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. The interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash receipts over the 
short credit period is not considered to be material.
(r) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits with banks and, for the purposes of the 
Cash Flow Statement, revolving credit facilities.
(s) Borrowings
Short and long term borrowings comprise revolving credit facilities and bank loans. The fees associated 
with entering into borrowing facilities are capitalised and netted off against borrowings and amortised over 
the term of the borrowings.
(t) Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value, as the interest that would be recognised from discounting 
future cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material.
(u) Share based payments
The fair value at the date of grant of share based remuneration, principally share options, is calculated 
using a binomial pricing model and is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period of the award. The charge to the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
takes account of the estimated number of shares that will vest. All share option based remuneration is equity 
settled, except as set out below. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 88
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 
The Company established a Joint Share Ownership Plan (the “JSOP”) on 30 March 2011. On vesting, any 
gains made on awards granted under the JSOP may be settled either through: (i) a cash payment to the 
participant equal to the gain; or (ii) the transfer of legal and beneficial ownership to the participant of such 
number of shares as have full value equal to the gain. 
JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a 
binomial pricing model. The fair value is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period of the award. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, 
and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value 
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
(v) Segmental reporting
Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the 
chief operating decision maker, Chief Executive Mr Andrew Lindsay, is disclosed in note 1 to the accounts.
(w) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are 
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
(x) Pensions
The Group makes contributions to certain employees’ personal pension plans. These are charged to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they become payable.
(y) Dividends
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s 
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
(z) New standards issued but not yet effective
The Group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation 
dates. It is not expected that adoption of the majority of standards or interpretations which have been 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the EU, but have not been 
adopted, will have a material impact on the financial statements.  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

1. SEGMENT REPORTING 
The Group’s reportable segments reflect the two distinct activities around which the Group is organised:
• Customer Acquisition; and
• Customer Management.
Customer Acquisition revenues represent joining fees from the Group’s distributors, the sale of marketing 
materials and sales of equipment including mobile phone handsets and wireless internet routers. Customer 
Management revenues are principally derived from the supply of fixed telephony, mobile telephony, gas, 
electricity and internet services to residential and small business customers.
The Board measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and segment result, 
which is referred to as operating profit. The Group applies the same significant accounting policies across 
both operating segments.

The Company’s new head office building, Merit House, acquired in February 2012, has been classified as 
a fixed asset rather than an investment property as it is the Company’s intention to immediately occupy the 
building for its own purposes once refurbishment work has been completed. Included within freehold land 
and buildings is £7.9 million (2013: £7.9 million) of land which is not depreciated. Property, plant and 
equipment is not depreciated until the asset is brought into use.

The opening intangible asset of £2,969,000 (2013: £2,969,000) was attributable wholly to the Customer 
Management operating segment and related to the issue of 426,989 shares at nominal value to Npower 
in two tranches on 19 August 2011 and 9 January 2012 as part of the revisions to the Company’s energy 
supply agreement with Npower entered into on 24 May 2011. 
The intangible asset had previously been considered to have an indefinite life as the supply agreement 
with Npower entered into on 24 May 2011 did not have a finite term. However, the Company entered 
into a new energy supply agreement with Npower with effect from 1 December 2013. As the new supply 
agreement is in substance considered to be an extension of the supply agreement entered into in May 
2011, the opening intangible asset will be recognised on the Company’s balance sheet within the cost of 
investments in subsidiary undertakings (see note 8) and continue to be recognised as an intangible asset on 
the Group’s balance sheet. Given that the new energy supply agreement has a 20 year term, the opening 
intangible asset is no longer considered to have an indefinite life and will therefore be amortised evenly 
over the term of the new energy supply agreement in the Group financial statements. 
The additions to Group intangible assets during the year relate to the entering into of the new energy supply 
arrangements with Npower on improved commercial terms through the acquisition by the Company of 
Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited (“the Companies”) from Npower Limited having 
effect from 1 December 2013 (“the Transaction”). 
The total consideration for the Transaction comprised a payment to Npower of £196.5 million on 20 
December 2014, a deferred amount of £21.5 million payable on 20 December 2016 and a payment of 
£2.5 million made in January 2014 for the net assets acquired in the Companies which comprised cash 
and short term working capital balances.
The addition to intangible assets of £221.6 million therefore represents the total consideration paid 
and payable to Npower, excluding the payment for net assets acquired in the Companies, plus certain 
transaction costs of £3.6 million which in accordance with the relevant accounting standards have been 
recognised as a cost of acquisition. 
The intangible asset will be amortised evenly over the 20 year life of the new energy supply agreement 
reflecting the period over which the Company will benefit from the agreement.
Further information regarding the new energy supply arrangements is set out in note 21 of these  
financial statements.

Goodwill is attributable wholly to the Customer Management operating segment and comprises assets 
relating to the Company’s subsidiary Telecommunications Management Limited (“TML”). 
The Group regularly monitors the carrying amount of its goodwill. A review was undertaken at 31 March 
2014 to assess whether the carrying amount of assets was supported by their value in use determined by 
the net present value of the future cash flows derived from the assets using cash flow projections based on 
current levels of profitability. 
A pre-tax discount rate of 20% into perpetuity was used which was considered appropriate given the 
expectation that, for the foreseeable future, TML will continue to operate as a going concern. The result of 
the review undertaken at 31 March 2014 indicated that no impairment was necessary. No reasonably 
possible change in the assumptions used in the impairment calculation would give rise to an impairment  
of goodwill.

On 20 December 2013 the Company completed a placing and open offer for a total of 8,813,560 
ordinary shares at a price of 1,475p per share. 
Capital management
The Group’s overall objective when managing capital is to continue to provide attractive returns to 
shareholders. 
Total shareholder equity at 31 March 2014 was £206.0 million (2013: £70.7 million). 
The Group’s current capital management strategy is to retain sufficient working capital for day to day 
operating requirements. In addition, as a result of the entering the new energy supply arrangements with 
Npower, and the consequent drawdown of transaction debt facilities of £100 million, the Group’s capital 
management strategy is also to ensure that interest costs are minimised and that the schedule for repayment 
of the debt can be comfortably achieved.
Under the revised energy supply arrangements which were effective from 1 December 2013, Npower 
continues to be responsible for funding the principal working capital requirements relating to the supply of 
energy to the Company’s customers. This includes funding the Budget Plans of customers who pay for their 
energy in equal monthly instalments and pre-funding the payment of certain energy network charges.

Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share exclude share incentive scheme charges and the amortisation of the intangible asset 
recognised as a result of the new energy supply arrangements entered into with Npower in December 2013.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments (“IFRS 2”), awards made under the Company’s JSOP 
share incentive scheme are deemed to be cash-settled. However, whilst approximately £3,395,000 of the 
share incentive scheme charge during the year relate to JSOP awards, and could therefore be settled in 
cash, in practice it is expected that any settlement of awards under the JSOP will be made in equity. It has 
therefore been deemed appropriate to present the above analysis of earnings per share as adjusted for 
share incentive scheme charges. 
It has also been deemed appropriate to present the analysis of adjusted earnings per share excluding the 
amortisation of intangible assets arising from the new energy supply agreement with Npower in order to 
present a clearer picture of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

17. COMMITMENTS
Operating lease commitments
The Group is committed to make payments in respect of operating leases for land and buildings as follows:
Company and Group 
2014 2013 
£’000 £’000
Amounts payable: 
Less than one year 183 310
Between one and five years 251 251
434 561
The principal lease arrangements relate to office premises.
Capital commitments
At 31 March 2014 the Company had capital commitments of approximately £7,675,000 relating mainly 
to items in respect of the refurbishment of Merit House, the Group’s new head office building (2013: 
£364,000).
New energy supply arrangements
The Group entered into a new 20 year energy supply agreement with Npower (“the SSA”) on 20 
December 2013. 
In the event that the SSA is terminated by Npower in certain circumstances, including on a material breach 
by the Group or on the insolvency of the Company, additional consideration of up to £201 million may 
become payable by the Company to Npower. Full details of the termination provisions of the SSA were 
set out in paragraph 4 of Part VIII on page 38 of the prospectus issued to shareholders on 20 November 
2013. 
However, given the energy supply agreement termination rights are either, in the directors’ view, very 
unlikely to occur or entirely within the control of the Group, the directors believe the likelihood of this type 
of termination event is remote. 
The amount of the additional consideration reduces from £201 million to £11 million over the 20 year life 
of the supply agreement. Furthermore, depending on the circumstances giving rise to a termination event, 
the additional consideration (if payable) may be spread over the unexpired term of the supply agreement. 
Following any such termination event, the Group would have direct access to the wholesale energy markets 
and the opportunity to earn additional margin from sourcing energy directly for the Group’s customer base.

18. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS      
The Company has two share option plans, one of which is available to employees, the other to distributors 
of the Company.
All new employees who have passed the requisite probationary period are issued with market price options 
over shares in the Company, further options are also granted to existing employees depending on their 
seniority and length of service (“The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Employee Share Option Plan”). 
The distributor scheme (“The Telecom Plus PLC 2007 Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan”) exists 
to provide incentives to the people who are most successful in gathering new customers for the Company. 
As it is not possible to measure directly the benefit received from these activities, the fair value of the benefit 
received has been measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
On 30 March 2011 the Company established a new Joint Share Ownership Plan (“The Telecom Plus PLC 
Joint Share Ownership Plan 2011” or “the JSOP”). Under the terms of the JSOP 500,000 shares were 
issued to an Employee Benefit Trust (“the JSOP Share Trust”) administered by Barclays Wealth (Guernsey) 
Limited, which holds the shares jointly with the only current participant, Mr Lindsay. The JSOP Share Trust 
was provided with an interest free loan from the Company to subscribe for the 500,000 shares, and 
therefore the transaction was cash flow neutral for the Company. 
As set out in note (u) of the Significant Accounting Policies, JSOP awards are considered to be cash-settled 
and therefore a fair value liability is calculated using a binomial pricing model. The fair value liability is 
charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the 
award. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value 
of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the amortisation charge in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The following key assumptions were used to determine the fair value liability of the JSOP award of 
1,207.9p per share as at 31 March 2014: a strike price of 553p per share, a share price of 1,793p as 
at 31 March 2014, expected volatility of 39.6%, an expected remaining life of 1 year, a risk free rate of 
0.43% and an expected dividend yield of 1.95%. 
A reconciliation of movements in the numbers of share options for the Group can be summarised as follows:
2014 2013

19. DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Treasury activities take place under procedures and policies approved and monitored by the Board. They 
are designed to minimise the financial risks faced by the Group which primarily arise from credit, interest 
rate and liquidity risks.
Carrying amounts of financial instruments
All financial assets, which include cash, trade and other receivables and accrued income, are classified as 
loans and receivables with a total value for the Group of £213,536,000 (2013: £144,567,000) and for 
the Company of £63,811,000 (2013: £146,331,000). All financial liabilities, which include trade and 
other payables and accrued expenditure, are held at amortised cost with a total value for the Group of 
£251,858,000 (2013: £105,316,000) and for the Company £132,350,000 (2013: £108,193,000).
Credit risk 
All customers are invoiced monthly and approximately 90% pay by direct debit; accordingly credit risk 
in respect of trade receivables is considered low due to the large number of customers supplied, each of 
whom represents an insignificant proportion of total revenue. 
The Company has a universal supply obligation in relation to the provision of energy to domestic customers. 
This means that although the Company is entitled to request a reasonable deposit from a potential new 
customer who is not considered creditworthy, the Company is obliged to supply domestic energy to anyone 
who submits a properly completed application form. Where such customers subsequently fail to pay for 
the energy they have used (“delinquent customers”), there is likely to be a delay before the Company 
is able to eliminate its exposure to future bad debt from them by either installing a pre-payment meter 
or disconnecting their supply, and the costs associated with preventing such delinquent customers from 
increasing their indebtedness are not always fully recoverable. 
The maximum credit risk for the Group is £213,536,000 (2013: £144,567,000) and for the Company 
£63,811,000 (2013: £146,331,000).
Interest rate risk 
The Group finances its day to day operations primarily through cash generated within the business. Cash 
surpluses are placed on deposit with Barclays Bank PLC at money market rates to maximise returns. 
The Group’s profit and equity for the current year will not be significantly affected by changes in the UK 
base rate of +/- 1% from current levels despite the recent increase in the level of net borrowings resulting 
from the transaction with Npower in December 2013. 
Commodity price risk
The Group is not exposed to any fluctuations in commodity prices due to the nature of the agreements 
with wholesale providers of telephony and energy services and its ability to pass the effect of any such 
fluctuations through to its customers.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s treasury management policies are designed to ensure continuity of funding. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2014 112
19. DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
Foreign currency risk
The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities
All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling. Receivables due after one year include 
£4,242,000 (2013: £3,215,000) due from employees and distributors which earns interest at variable 
rates above Base Rate.
Borrowing facilities 
At 31 March 2014, the Group had total working capital facilities of £25,000,000 (2013: £20,000,000). 
These facilities are available to the Group until 20 December 2016. As at 31 March 2014 the Company 
had letters of credit in place relating to certain energy distribution charges with a total value covered of 
£11,787,500 (2013: £Nil).
At 31 March 2014, the Group had a transaction loan facility of £100,000,000 (2013: Nil) which was 
fully drawn down. 
The facilities are secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets of the Company and through a 
cross guarantee with the Company’s subsidiaries Electricity Plus Supply Limited, Gas Plus Supply Limited 
and Telecommunications Management Limited. Further details of the facilities are set out in note 12 of these 
financial statements.
Fair values
There is not considered to be any material difference between the fair value of any financial instruments 
and their net book amount due to the short term maturity of the instruments.
20. RELATED PARTIES 
Identity of related parties
The Company has related party relationships with its subsidiaries (see note 8), its associate (see note 8) and

owed by the Company to the subsidiary).
21. NEW ENERGY SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS AND ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS
The Company entered into new energy supply arrangements with Npower through the acquisition of 
Electricity Plus Supply Limited and Gas Plus Supply Limited (“the Companies”) from Npower Limited on 20 
December 2013 (“the Transaction”). The Transaction had economic effect from 1 December 2013. 
The accounting treatment for the Transaction was considered against the guidance set out in IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations (“IFRS 3”).
It was determined that the acquisition of the Companies did not represent business combinations under 
IFRS 3 as both Companies did not have the three key elements of a standalone business as set out in IFRS 3 
(i.e. inputs, processes and outputs). The principal factors behind this determination were as follows: (i) the 
Companies were originally set up solely as legal vehicles to facilitate the supply of energy to Telecom Plus 
customers by Npower; (ii) all customer relationships were acquired, held and managed by Telecom Plus; 
(iii) the Companies did not have any influence over the terms on which energy was supplied to them; (iv) 
the Companies were not able to influence who their customers were and had no pricing discretion for the 
onward supply of energy; (v) the Companies did not have any infrastructure, management or employees 
with all functions being carried out by either Telecom Plus or Npower; and (vi) given the unique nature of 
the Companies and the associated energy supply agreement between Telecom Plus and Npower, it was not 
considered feasible that another market participant could effectively acquire and operate the Companies on 
a standalone basis.
As a result of these factors the acquisition of the Companies has been accounted for as an acquisition of 
assets rather than as business combinations.

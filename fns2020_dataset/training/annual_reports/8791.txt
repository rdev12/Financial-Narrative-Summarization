Each of the regional markets in which we operate is 
a net consumer of oil and gas, (whilst overall as a 
country Russia is a net producer, the south west 
Russian regional market within which we operate is a 
net consumer). We believe that the opportunities open to 
us in these markets are likely to expand, as governments 
and relevant authorities recognise that investment by 
non-state companies is an attractive route towards 
increasing production regionally. We are well-positioned 
to exploit these opportunities.

Strategic priorities Objective Achievements 09 JKX Oil & Gas plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2010
… the progress we are making and the performance 
measures we use.
The Board considers the future production profile of the Group’s interests to 
underpin the value of its asset portfolio. Accordingly, the level of annual 
production is the measure by which management monitors delivery of portfolio 
development. The 11% fall in average combined oil and gas production is the 
result of the unscheduled delay in mobilisation of a second drilling rig to our 
PPC producing fields.
Capital expenditure is used by management to monitor levels of investment, on 
both a country specific and regional basis. Capital expenditure increased 
significantly on 2009 (up 66%) as the redevelopment of the Koshekhablskoye 
field in Russia accelerated in the period.
The Board believes a core skill of the Group to be the low cost development of 
onshore gas assets in and around Ukraine. A key measure used to monitor this 
is the level of production costs which remained materially consistent with 2009. 
The Board has pursued a strategy to maximise exposure to and deliver value 
from the Ukrainian and Russian gas markets. This is based on the belief that as 
occurred in Ukraine, the Russian domestic gas price will, after accounting for 
net-backed transportation costs, converge with gas prices in western Europe. 
In 2010 the 2% increase in Ukrainian gas realisations is evidence of the 
convergence that has occurred and from which the Group is benefitting. With the 
Group’s first Russian gas production expected in Autumn 2011, Russian gas 
realisations will be the realisations KPI going forward.
We are committed to continuously improving our health and safety performance. 
During 2010 we again maintained our progress, with a significant 59% decrease 
in our AIFR (All Injury Frequency Rate) figures. The AIFR represents the health 
and safety incidents per 200,000 man-hours. To put our achievement in to 
context, the industry benchmark for 2010 was 3.4.
The Board believes its strategic objective of returning value to shareholders is 
most appropriately measured by the return on average capital employed. It 
believes that this measure reflects the underlying ability to return value by a 
combination of dividends, share buy-backs and any capital appreciation in the 
Company’s equities as may be determined by the capital markets. The 26% 
decrease (excluding exceptional impairment) in 2010 reflects the continued 
significant investment programmes, particularly in Russia and the decreased 
net profit achieved in the period. 
The Board believes that a significant component of the Group’s ability to add 
shareholder value lies in its success in adding to its reserves base. Total 
reserves decreased by less than 5% in the period, following additions which 
accounted for a 3% replacement of the 3.7 MMboe reserves produced in the 
year . Reserves of 0.1 MMboe were added following performance driven 
reassessment of Hungarian reserves.

Employee proﬁ le Outcome
We develop strong local 
presences, drawing on extensive 
industry and country-specific 
knowledge to deal with the local 
operating environment. We have 
proven expertise in efficient oil 
and gas production – and also the 
practical, on-the-ground 
experience of working where 
there can be a significant 
bureaucratic element in how 
everyday business is conducted. 
Across the lifecycle of each 
project, from first exploration to 
abandonment, we focus on having 
the right people with the right 
skills in the right place at the right 
time. Although we use expatriate 
teams during the formative stages 
of a project, over time their 
numbers will reduce significantly 
and the operation will ultimately 
rely on a high percentage of local 
employees. The training of local 
staff underpins our strategy and is 
an important aspect of how we do 
business.

In the short time I have been working 
with the senior team at JKX, I have 
been impressed by the management 
skills and operational potential in 
evidence. When I was approached to 
consider the role of Chairman of JKX 
following some 12 years on the 
Board at BP, I was attracted to the 
position because the company 
operates in a challenging area of the 
oil and gas sector, and one where I 
feel I can use my own experience 
and expertise to good effect. In 
addition to my time at BP, I have also 
established in the FTSE 250 index. 
I know from conversations with 
senior management what a 
tremendous contribution Lord 
Fraser made, chairing the JKX 
Board with intelligence and great 
commitment. On behalf of the 
Board I thank him unreservedly.
Dividend
In a period of heavy investment, the 
Board recognises that increased 
taxation in Ukraine and delay in 
start-up of the Russian project 
inevitably impacts available cash flow. 
Consequently, the Board is 
recommending a final dividend of 2.6 
pence per share, giving an unchanged 
total dividend for the year of 5.0 pence 
per share. The dividend will be paid 
on 24th June 2011 to shareholders on 
the Company’s Register of Members 
on 6th May 2011. 
Outlook
The Company is budgeting a strong 
increase in production volumes for 
2011 with higher oil realisations and 
continued increases in gas 
realisations in Ukraine. Despite 
these benefits, the Company is 
absorbing substantially increased 
production related taxes in Ukraine 
which it did not bear in 2010 and this 
will impact 2011 earnings. 
Turning to our prospects for 2011, 
first gas in Russia in the autumn will 
be an important landmark for the 
Company. Ukraine will continue to 
provide the backbone of our cash 
flow and, together with Hungary, also 
provide us with exploration upside. In 
addition, we look forward to entering 
the fast-growing Ukrainian LPG 
market at mid-year and adding value 
to our existing gas business.
Finally, I wish to thank our people for 
their commitment and expertise over 
the last 12 months, as well as our 
shareholders for their continuing 
support.
served on the Boards of several 
other major companies, such as 
GlaxoSmithKline, and believe that 
this background can aid JKX in its 
plans for growth.
Having been in my position for only 
one month at the date of this 
release, it is too soon for me to 
comment on achievements with 
which I have had no involvement. 
Clearly, we benefit from a very 
strong production base in Ukraine, 
complemented by the development 
prospects in Russia and, albeit to a 
lesser extent, in Hungary.
Although considerable progress 
was made in 2010 on the large 
redevelopment project in Russia, 
the Company has experienced delays 
and capital cost increases; the 
commencement date for production 
in Russia is now expected in the 
autumn of 2011. More significantly, 
a delayed convergence of Russian 
domestic gas prices to European 
net-back levels is impacting our 
overall project economics and 
consequently we are making an 
impairment provision of $74.6m. 
Commitment to HSEC
My predecessor commented 
on the importance of protecting 
and nurturing our people, their 
communities and the environment, 
and this is a view which I share 
wholeheartedly. As a resource-based 
company, JKX rightly places great 
value on health, safety, 
environmental matters and 
community liaison (HSEC).
I note that the AIFR (All Injury 
Frequency Rate) figures decreased 
in 2010 and are well below the 
industry benchmark. Furthermore, 
we were successful in our attempt 
to achieve ISO 14001 Environmental 
Accreditation during the year.
Your Board
My appointment has been the only 
change to the composition of the 
Board. I would like to place on record 
my thanks to Lord Fraser, whose 
sterling service of over 13 years saw 
JKX grow into an established 
operator in eastern and central 
Europe, and also become 
 
Clearly, we benefit from a very 
strong production base in 
Ukraine, complemented by the 
development prospects in 
Russia and, albeit to a lesser 
extent, in Hungary.

Our performance
2010 was a challenging year for 
JKX with drilling delays in Ukraine 
and construction delays on our 
Russian project. Notwithstanding 
these setbacks, the Company made 
significant progress on its key 
projects.
Average oil and gas production for 
the year decreased by 11% to 10,324 
boepd (2009: 11,665 boepd) due 
primarily to the unscheduled delay 
in mobilisation of a second drilling 
rig to our development licences in 
Poltava, Ukraine. The effect of this 
production shortfall was essentially 
offset by the rise in both oil and 
gas realisations, leaving revenues 
broadly flat for the year at $192.9m 
(2009: $196.5m). Operating profit 
(before deduction of an exceptional 
impairment provision) declined 20% 
to $95.0m (2009: $119.6m).
The exceptional impairment 
provision of $74.6m to the carrying 
value of our Russian project 
is largely the result of delayed 
net-back convergence of Russian 
domestic gas prices to those of 
European gas markets and its 
impact on overall project economics. 
We are now forecasting European 
net-back parity for 2017. 
Milestones and progress
In last year’s Annual Report, I laid 
out two key goals by which we would 
measure our performance. These 
were to:
• Reach in excess of 20,000 barrels 
of oil equivalent per day production 
during 2011.
• Increase production at 
Rudenkovskoye from 2% of JKX’s 
Ukrainian production in 2009 to 
25% in 2012.
We remain on target to achieve the 
first milestone but have moved the 
second milestone to 2013 to reflect 
the current schedule for the 
multi-frac operations planned for 
the Rudenkovskoye field.
We remain confident in our long-
term prospects and are committed 
to our strategy, including the four 
near-term objectives outlined in last 
year’s Annual Report:
• Accelerate the appraisal and 
development of non-producing 
fields and reserves in our existing 
portfolio, specifically at 
Rudenkovskoye in Ukraine and 
Koshekhablskoye in Russia.
• Continue to optimise production 
from the producing fields in 
Ukraine.
• Increase activity on our existing 
exploration and appraisal portfolio 
in central Europe.
• Maintain flexibility to acquire 
additional interests in our focus 
area, to increase production and 
diversify geographically.
The fundamentals of our business 
and our markets are sound although 
we are experiencing some delay in 
turning upside into reality. 
The installation and hook-up of the 
gas facility at Koshekhablskoye is 
now proceeding at pace. Despite 
on-schedule delivery of the key 
components of the plant from 
Sharjah to Russia in January, we are 
experiencing some slippage in the 
hook-up and commissioning 
schedule. Consequently, we are 
revising our target for first gas to 
this autumn. We continue to see 
excellent forward value in the 
Russian gas market and, once 
production is underway at 
Koshekhablskoye, we will turn our 
focus to extending our Russian 
operations to exploit opportunities 
elsewhere in what we regard as a 
region rich in potential.
In Ukraine, we drilled well R-103 on 
the deep Rudenkovskoye tight gas 
field as planned, and the 
encouraging initial results support 
our plans for the multi-frac 
stimulation of the well later in the 
year. Hook-up and commissioning of 
our LPG plant is underway at 
Poltava and we are currently 
scheduling to start initial deliveries 
by mid-year. LPG continues to be an 
increasingly important energy 
source in Ukraine and 2010 again 
saw a sharp rise in the number of 
vehicles powered by LPG.
Our operations in Hungary, where 
we are a non-operator, have 
 
We continue to focus on the 
proven strengths that form 
the backbone of JKX: an 
established presence in eastern 
and central Europe; extensive 
experience of local operating 
conditions; production 
and sales in buoyant local 
marketplaces; and locally-
based and managed operating 
subsidiaries led by skilled and 
committed teams.

progressed well with production 
increasing in Hajdunanas supported 
by the tie-in of the Gorbehaza-1 
discovery. Gas has been tested in the 
Tizsavasvari-6 and Nyekpuszta-2 
exploration wells and further 
appraisal is planned in 2011. The 
farm-in to the Turkeve licence has 
had mixed results with only one 
discovery to date.
Managing our risks
Risk is intrinsic to our industry and 
we expend considerable resources 
and expertise in managing it. During 
2010, we ensured that robust risk 
management processes were in 
place, with oversight at Board level. 
Outlook
We have the people, the strategy and 
the resources to deliver a step-
change in performance during the 
coming 12 months.
We are confident that we will 
commence production in Russia this 
autumn and I look forward to this 
operation becoming an important 
contributor to net cash inflow. 
We are working hard to increase 
production in Ukraine and this will 
play an important role in helping us 
reach our key objective of producing 
20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per 
day during this year. Start-up of our 
Ukrainian LPG facility by mid-year 
will also contribute an important 
value-added cash flow stream to 
our operations at Poltava.
Our people will once again be at 
the heart of our ambitions. In the 
countries where we operate we have 
teams of highly skilled individuals, 
most of them drawn from local 
communities and many of them 
trained by JKX. In the UK, we have 
an experienced senior team that 
has been complemented in recent 
weeks by the appointment of Sir 
Ian Prosser as Chairman. A former 
Deputy Chairman of BP, Sir Ian has 
in-depth knowledge and experience 
of international business, 
particularly in the oil and gas sector. 
At JKX, we are committed to grow as 
a Company and our ability to attract 
somebody of Sir Ian’s calibre 
speaks volumes about our capability 
and intent. 
I welcome Sir Ian to the Company 
and am looking forward to working 
alongside him during what I believe 
will be an exciting, productive and 
ultimately rewarding year. I must 
also express my appreciation to our 
outgoing chairman, Peter Fraser, 
who for the last 13 years has chaired 
this Company and supported me 
through every challenge we have 
faced.

Ukraine update
Completed:
We carried out appraisal drilling 
in the Rudenkovskoye licence 
and completed the R-103 
horizontal well. A second rig 
was mobilised, albeit later than 
scheduled.
Planned:
Drilling and workover activity 
will continue and we expect to 
reassess the reserves in the 
Ignatovskoye, Molchanovskoye 
and Novo-Nikolaevskoye fields 
towards the end of the year . 
Completion of the LPG plant 
at Poltava is on target for 
June 2011. 
The year saw an extension of 
our Ukrainian development 
programme, with the focus on 
appraisal drilling in the 
Rudenkovskoye licence together 
with important progress on 
recompletions and stimulations.
During 2010, we carried out a range 
of activities to drive value from our 
production licences. The key focus of 
the work programme was appraisal 
drilling in the Rudenkovskoye 
licence with the completion of the 
R-103 horizontal well in the fourth 
quarter. A second rig was contracted 
to maintain the development 
impetus in the second half of the 
period on the ongoing drilling 
programmes in the Ignatovskoye, 
Molchanovskoye and Novo-
Nikolaevskoye fields. Delays in 
mobilisation resulted in the second 
rig completing only one additional 
well during the fourth quarter.
The programme of recompletions 
and stimulations continued 
throughout the period to maintain 
production levels in the Ignatovskoye 
and Molchanovskoye North. 
Poltava Petroleum Company (‘PPC’), 
a wholly owned subsidiary of JKX, 
holds four production licences 
covering 127sq.km in the Poltava 
region of Ukraine. Each production 
licence contains a number of fields 
which together form the Novo-
Nikolaevskoye Complex. PPC also 
holds the Zaplavskoye and 
Elizavetovskoye exploration licences 
comprising a total exploration area 
of 208sq.km.
In summary, PPC:
• Drilled, tested and/or completed 
a total of six appraisal and 
development wells.
• Carried out an acid frac and 
a propped acid frac on two 
carbonate wells.
• Carried out 20 workover 
operations, including 12 
recompletions, three well repairs, 
three fishing operations and two 
well abandonments.
• Commenced installation of the 
LPG recovery plant.
• Continued to upgrade and 
de-bottleneck the production 
facility.
• Installed additional generating 
and compression facilities.
Ukrainian Reserves
No reserves reassessments took 
place in 2010. Drilling and workover 
activity will continue in 2011 and it is 
envisaged that a reassessment of 
the Ignatovskoye, Molchanovskoye 
and Novo-Nikolaevskoye fields will 
be completed towards the end of the 
year, although it will be 2012 before 
this can be concluded in the 
Rudenkovskoye field areas.
The Ignatovskoye production 
licence is located in the centre of 
the Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex 
and contains the first field to be 
developed by the Company. 
Evaluation of two additional 
structural trends continues, one to 
the west, and one to the southwest 
of the main field.
The main field is an uplifted fault 
block containing Devonian sand-
stone and overlying Carboniferous 
Tournasian sandstone and

2 Ukraine – continued
carbonate reef build up of Visean 
age. There is also a series of thin 
sandstone channels on the flank of 
the structure, also of Visean age. 
Black oil is found in the Devonian 
sandstone and the lower parts of the 
Tournasian and Visean reservoirs. 
The oil is overlain by a rich 
condensate-bearing gas cap and the 
Visean channels can therefore be oil 
or gas bearing. Reservoir quality in 
the Devonian sandstone and Visean 
reef is generally good whilst both 
the Tournasian sandstone and 
limestone are variable and often 
dependent on local depositional and 
tectonic influences. Stimulation in 
these reservoirs is usually 
necessary and, although this can 
give high initial flow rates, the rates 
often decline to more modest levels.
No additional wells were drilled or 
recompleted on the main structure 
of the field during the period. The 
focus of activity in 2010 was in 
recompleting and stimulating the 
wells in the west of the structure:
• Development well I-137 was 
drilled as a Visean carbonate oil 
producer in the southeast of the 
field but was suspended in late 
2008 with a fish in the hole below 
the 7-inch casing. A sidetrack was 
drilled in the period but 
encountered problems setting 
the casing. A re-designed 
replacement well is planned for 
2011 in preference to further 
sidetracking.
• Well I-105 was successfully 
worked-over with the recovery of 
broken downhole pump rods. 
A surface pump will replace the 
existing unit at a convenient time 
in 2011.
• The workover rig successfully 
recompleted well I-133 from the 
Tournasian sandstone to a Visean 
sandstone oil producer. Reservoir 
pressure was insufficient to 
maintain flow and a beam pump 
has been installed with the well 
now supporting intermittent, but 
regular production.
• Work began in well I-106 to carry 
out a water shut-off operation in 
the Devonian sandstone and 
recompletion as a Tournasian 
sandstone producer. Problems 
recovering the tubing resulted in 
work being suspended until 2011. 
• Well I-110 was recompleted from 
the depleted Tournasian 
sandstone to the Tournasian 
carbonate. A similar re-
completion was performed on 
well I-158, but with only a small 
amount of gas being produced. 
The well is now a candidate for 
abandonment.
• Wells I-131 and I-150 were 
abandoned in the period and 
their completion and well-head 
equipment recovered.
In addition to re-drilling well I-137, 
plans for 2011 include a well on the 
western flank of the main structure 
to appraise the potential in the 
down-dip fault blocks. Success on 
the flanks of the field would lead to a 
further re-appraisal of the field 
reserves which otherwise have 
remained relatively stable.
The Molchanovskoye production 
licence is located approximately 
8km to the south of the 
Ignatovskoye Field and contains 
the southernmost producing field 
within the complex. The licence 
now comprises two distinct field 
areas: Molchanovskoye North and 
Molchanovskoye Main.
Molchanovskoye North is a black 
oil reservoir with a gas cap in the 
Devonian sandstone and an 
overlying Tournasian sandstone 
gas condensate reservoir. There 
are also newly appraised overlying 
Tournasian carbonate and 
sandstone gas condensate 
reservoirs that extend over the 
Ignatovskoye licence boundary.
Work in 2010 addressed both the 
Devonian sandstone and the 
Tournasian carbonate reservoirs and 
also confirmed the presence of 
productive Visean sandstones within 
the licence area:
• Development well M-167 was 
drilled as a high angle Tournasian 
carbonate infill well across the 
main natural fracture system in 
the Molchanovskoye North field. 
Drilling was suspended in 2009 
due to a stuck drill pipe in the

overlying swelling shale. The 
sidetrack was drilled successfully 
to a measured depth of 3,000m 
with a 400m section of Tournasian 
carbonate. Following a controlled 
acid squeeze on the low porosity 
formation, the well settled to a 
stabilised flow rate of 2.3 MMcfd 
of gas with 26 bpd of condensate 
through a 36/64" choke with a 
FWHP of 626 psi. Other areas of 
the extensive low porosity 
carbonate in the area are being 
evaluated for potential application 
of this development technique.
• In mid-year, well M-166, a long 
horizontal well in the Devonian 
reservoir, showed a sharp 
increase in water production and 
a commensurate decline in oil and 
gas production. The TW-100 rig 
was mobilised to the location and 
gas lift installed to restore 
production. The re-drilling of a 
new horizontal section at a higher 
level is scheduled for 2011.
• Devonian horizontal wells M-151 
and M-152 watered out in the 
period and re-perforations higher 
in the well bores were 
unsuccessful. The wells are now 
candidates for abandonment. 
• Well M-169 was spudded in 2010 
and was completed in March 2011 
as a 600m long horizontal well in 
the Devonian reservoir. It is 
designed to replace both wells 
M-151 and M-152 and has been 
set higher in the reservoir. Initial 
test production was 5.25 MMcfd 
with 634 bopd oil at a FWHP of 
594 psi through a 2" choke. Testing 
is ongoing at different choke sizes 
to assess the most effective 
production rate.
• Well M-28, a long serving 
Devonian oil producer, was 
recompleted to the T2 sandstone 
and settled to a flow rate of 
3.5 MMcfd with 90 bcpd.
• The surprise of the year was the 
speculative perforation of the 
unlogged V16 sandstone reservoir 
in well M-161. This had initial flow 
rates in excess of 1,000 bopd with 
a high gas cut, but has been 
choked back to around 400 bopd 
for reservoir management 
purposes. 
Activity planned for 2011 will include 
further in-fill drilling in the Devonian 
reservoir and further mapping of the 
Visean sands to seek analogies to 
the M-161 discovery. Reserves are 
not expected to change significantly.
Molchanovskoye Main produces gas 
condensate in the Devonian 
sandstone and is being evaluated for 
additional reserves in the overlying 
Tournasian carbonate and Visean 
sandstone reservoirs. Two wells 
were treated in 2010:
• Development well M-206 was 
identified in 2009 as a suitable 
candidate for a propped acid 
frac of the Tournasian carbonate. 
The 2010 frac operation was 
successful but post-frac analysis 
indicates lack of reservoir 
connectivity.
• Well M-205 was recompleted in 
the Visean sandstone where it 
flowed at an initial rate of 
1.1 MMcfd of gas, despite 
more encouraging log results. 
Production enhancement by 
coiled tubing conveyed jet 
perforating was attempted but 
there was no noticeable 
improvement in flow rate.
The results of both treatments were 
disappointing and further work in 
this area has been assigned a low 
priority; this may affect the reserves 
recognised in this field area going 
forward.
A downthrown tilted fault block 
referred to as the “Wedge Zone” 
separates the Molchanovskoye 
North and Molchanovskoye Main 
fields. An exploration well M-170 is 
currently drilling ahead towards its 
planned TD of 3,100m in the 
Devonian sandstone to evaluate the 
potential of this 1sq.km block. 
A second well in the block is 
tentatively planned for later in 2011. 
No reserves are currently attributed 
to this area of the field complex.
The Novo-Nikolaevskoye 
production licence lies 3km to the 
west of the Ignatovskoye Field. 
Following successful drilling in 
2009, remapping and additional 
drilling was carried out in 2010 
with plans for more wells in 2011.
• Development well N-73 was 
drilled as a Visean sandstone gas 
producer and flowed at a stabilised 
rate of 1.97 MMcfd of gas, 27 bcpd 
and 110 bwpd with a FWHP of 
189 psi. A well intervention was 
subsequently carried out to isolate 
the water producing zone.
• Well N-74 was spudded in the 
fourth quarter and encountered 
gas in two Visean sandstone 
horizons; it is currently flowing 
at 3.5 MMcfd with 114 bcpd.
The success of wells N-73, N-74 
and M-161 will contribute to an 
increase in reserves in both the 
Novo-Nikolaevskoye and the 
Molchanovskoye licences when they 
are reassessed later in 2011. Three 
further wells are planned for 2011 
with the first well (N75) scheduled 
to spud in the third quarter.

LICENCE AREA 7.8 km
2 Ukraine – continued
The Rudenkovskoye production 
licence is the most northern of the 
four production licences. 
Reservoirs in the licence are the 
Tournasian and Devonian 
sandstones at depths of between 
3,000m and 5,000m with further 
potential in the overlying Visean 
sandstones. Productive areas have 
been identified in the northern and 
southern areas of the licence and, 
after the modest success of the 
2009 propped frac programme, an 
initial three well horizontal drilling 
programme was planned for 
2010-2012:
• Well R-103, in the southern part 
of the field, was drilled to a 
measured depth TD of 4,641m 
using the Skytop N-75 rig with 
1,026m of the well drilled 
horizontally in the Devonian 
reservoir. On test, the well flowed 
at a stabilised rate of 8.1 MMcfd of 
gas and 18 bpd of condensate 
through a 85/64" choke with a 
flowing wellhead pressure of 
930 psi over the final 8 hour period 
of a multi-rate test. The well has 
been tied back to the main field 
processing facility with an 8km 
flow line and placed on production. 
Since then production has 
declined, compounded by an 
inability to lift the remaining 
drilling and completion fluids, 
despite changing the tubing to a 
smaller size. Rates are currently 
around 650 Mcfd with 1-2 bcpd 
and intermittent water. Geological 
and engineering studies are 
underway for a multi-stage frac 
in the long horizontal wellbore.
• Well R-102, was drilled in early 
2007 in the southern area of the 
field. It found two main gas-
bearing zones in the Devonian 
sandstone but the presence of 
water precluded any fracture 
stimulation testing in the lower 
interval. The well was plugged 
back to a higher, and much 
thinner, interval in the Devonian. 
The propped frac operation was 
relatively successful and the well 
flow rate increased four-fold to 
0.5 MMcfd of gas. In 2010, the 
perforated zone was extended and 
this resulted in an increase in 
production to 1.6 MMcfd.
• The sites for the R-104 well in the 
north of the Rudenkovskoye area 
has been prepared and the 
programme for this 4,300m 
horizontal well to the Visean 
sandstone reservoir is ready, as is 
the programme for well R-105, a 
further well in the area of well 
R-103. Both wells R-104 and 
R-105 have been deferred until the 
results and prospects for well 
R-103 have been fully evaluated.
Reserves reassessment in the 
Rudenkovskoye field areas will await 
the results of the R-103 multi-frac 
and the subsequent drilling 
programme.
Poltava production facilities
2010 saw continued improvements 
to the Central Production Facility, 
including:
• Commissioning of the 
replacement compressor K220 
early in the year to provide greater 
support for gas-lift and production 
optimisation – an increasingly 
important aspect of field 
management.
• Commencement of a review into 
the efficiency of the surface 
facilities to identify potential 
operating improvements.
• Implementation of the 
recommendations of an 
independent specialist team to 
debottleneck the plant and 
enhance the process facilities. 
Initial steps included replacement 
or duplication of some flowlines to 
reduce back pressure on the wells. 
Notably, the results for well I-125 
were significant with gas 
production increasing from 
1.9 MMcfd to 2.4 MMcfd and oil 
production from 31 bopd to 
220 bopd. Further work will be 
undertaken during the annual field 
shut-down.
Improvements to the sewage 
treatment facility at the production 
site are planned for 2011 and there 
will be minor improvements to the 
roads and walkways throughout the 
facility.
LPG Plant
Fabrication and construction of the 
LPG plant commenced during the 
year. All the LPG process equipment 
is now onsite and installation has 
commenced. Installation and 
construction of the storage and 
loading equipment is also in 
progress. Completion is now 
expected in June 2011.

addition, the area has been extended 
by 41.9sq.km and in-fills an area 
between the Novo-Nikolaevskoye 
and Ignatovskoye licences where 
existing seismic indicates potential 
drilling targets and extends the 
western flank of the Ignatovskoye 
field. The extension also includes 
the Shagarivske area to the east of 
the Ignatovskoye field where a 
100km 2-D seismic programme was 
shot in late 2010 ahead of 
exploration drilling planned for 2012. 
The first well in the new block is 
likely to be in the area to the 
northwest of the Novo-
Nikolaevskoye field and will target 
Visean sandstone reservoirs already 
encountered in drilling undertaken 
by the State in the 1980s. 
Chervonoyarske East
The Chervonoyarske East 
exploration licence was acquired in 
December 2005. The licence covers 
a total area of 5.5sq.km and is 
located about 75km from the PPC 
production licences on the northern 
margin of the Dnieper-Donets basin. 
Evaluation of the 42sq.km 3D 
seismic survey acquired in 2008 
supports the interpretation of 
potential hydrocarbons trapped 
against the flanks of a major salt 
wall. However, the cost of drilling to 
below the salt and the geological 
risks associated with the traps are 
high. Attempts to farm-out the 
licence during 2010 were 
unsuccessful and the licence was 
relinquished in December 2010.
Elizatovskoye
The Elizavetovskoye exploration 
licence is located in the central part 
of the Dnieper-Donets basin and 
covers an area of 70sq.km. It is 
approximately 45km from PPC’s 
existing production licences. 
Three shut-in production wells 
on the licence are owned by 
Ukrgasvydobuvannya, a subsidiary 
of Naftogaz of Ukraine, the state oil 
and gas company, and are tied into 
its production facility.
• Negotiations with 
Ukrgasvydobuvannya were 
concluded in 2010 and enabled 
PPC to start preparations for 
drilling its own production wells 
in the field.
• Plans have been prepared for the 
drilling of a single well and the 
installation of basic separator and 
dehydration equipment tied to the 
local branch gas line via a hot tap. 
The project is currently scheduled 
to commence in early 2012.
• The hot tap installation is 
scheduled to be carried out by 
Ukrainian specialists in the second 
quarter of 2011 as an essential 
pre-requisite of the rest of the 
programme. 1

JKX completed the purchase of 
Yuzhgazenergie LLC (‘YGE’) in 
November 2007. YGE holds the 
licence for the redevelopment of 
the Koshekhablskoye gas field 
which is located in the southern 
Russian autonomous Republic of 
Adygea. The licence covers an area 
of 32.7sq.km.
The field was discovered in 1972 and 
produced a total 89 Bcf of gas before 
operations were suspended in 
January 2006. In June 2006, YGE 
was granted a new 20 year licence 
to rehabilitate and further appraise 
and develop the field.
Following the acquisition, 
the detailed technical and 
environmental re-evaluation by 
JKX concluded that the existing 
production facility would have to 
be completely replaced because it 
could meet neither the new gas 
specification required for entry to 
the Gazprom transit system nor 
the environmental standard for 
emissions to the immediate 
environment.
The focus during 2010 was on 
continuing the workover of wells to 
ensure that the Gas Processing 
Facility (GPF) would be brought 
on-stream at full capacity and 
completing the construction of the 
processing plant to ensure that 
construction and commissioning of 
the complete facility could be 
completed for first gas in the 
Autumn of 2011, delayed from our 
previous mid-year target.
During the period, YGE:
• Completed the workover, 
sidetracking and successful 
testing of Well-20 at a final flow 
rate of 22.6 MMcfd of gas and 
25 bcpd through a 60/64" choke 
with a flowing wellhead pressure 
of 1,510 psi.
• Re-entered Well-25 on the north 
flank of the field using the 
Geostream KES-536 rig, and 
recovered the remainder of the 
tubing. Drilling of the 260m 
sidetrack into the limestone 
reservoir kicked-off at 5,490m 
with a targeted TD of 5,760m. 
Completion and testing is 
scheduled for the beginning 
of the second quarter.
• Initiated milling and fishing 
operations on Well-26 and 
suspended operations after 
recovering 314m of fish with 
1,375m remaining. It is planned 
to return with a smaller rig to 
complete fishing more 
economically.
• Completed fishing on Well-15, 
deep on the east flank of the field, 
and drilled a sidetrack to a depth 
of 5,755m with strong gas shows 
and encouraging logs. 
Disappointingly, the sidetracked 
well bore did not stay open during 
testing with an obstruction 
preventing deployment of the 
coiled tubing to TD in the open 
hole section. Due to the priority 
given to the other wells in the first 
phase programme, remedial 
action (which may include a new 
sidetrack to a more geologically 
prospective part of the field) will 
be undertaken as part of the 
second phase of well 
recompletions later in 2012.
• Recovered tubing from the 
Callovian appraisal Well-09 to a 
depth of 5,312m using the

Kremco-900 rig. Preparations are 
currently underway to sidetrack 
the well through the Callovian 
sandstone reservoirs to a TD of 
5,500m. Completion and testing of 
Well-09 is now scheduled for the 
fourth quarter of the year.
• Commenced fishing operations on 
Callovian exploration Well-22 
using a lightweight A-125 rig. 
The well has been suspended at 
4,885m awaiting mobilisation of 
the Geostream KES-536 rig to 
deepen the well to 5,570m in the 
Callovian sandstone reservoirs. 
Completion and testing of Well-22 
is scheduled for the fourth quarter 
of the year.
• Completed the laying of 
replacement flowlines for the 
whole field, installation of the 
export line and the tie-in to the 
local trunk line.
• Completed the construction and 
hook up of additional temporary 
field camps to house construction 
workers and drilling teams.
• Fabrication of key components of 
the GPF plant in Sharjah was 
completed during the last quarter 
of 2010 with the final shipment 
leaving port at the end of 
December, slightly ahead of 
schedule. All equipment has now 
been off-loaded and cleared 
through customs in the Russian 
port of Novorossiysk, some 300km 
from the field, and transported to 
the site. Foundations for the 
equipment are in place and the 
construction teams have begun 
installation.
• Installation and construction of 
locally sourced equipment and 
buildings is nearing completion 
with hook-up and commissioning 
of the plant scheduled to 
commence by the end of the 
first quarter.
• First commercial gas production 
is scheduled for autumn 2011.
The workover programme has 
encountered difficult conditions in 
some of the wells, and the 
programme has been revised to 
ensure that production will meet 
the targets for the GPF as 
commissioning begins in the second 
quarter. The goal is to have three 
wells in production at start-up with 
further wells being brought 
on-stream in the second phase of 
workovers in 2012.
Field exploration and appraisal
JKX inherited a YGE obligation to 
drill an exploration well to appraise 
the production potential of the 
underlying Callovian sandstone 
reservoir. YGE has subsequently 
undertaken a significant amount of 
exploration and appraisal activity on 
this reservoir including:
• Acquisition, processing and 
interpretation of the 3D seismic.
• Integration of the maps with a 
complete re-evaluation of the well 
logs and other geological data to 
determine reservoir distribution 
and the potential resources in the 
Callovian sandstone.
• Acquisition of the shut-in Callovian 
production Well-09 for early 
testing.
In recognition of YGE’s commitment 
to the exploration programme and 
the high cost of deep drilling, the 
Russian State Geological Institute 
responsible for the YGE ongoing 
exploration and appraisal 
programme accepted the Company’s 
proposal to deepen an existing dry 
Oxfordian appraisal well (Well-22) to 
the Callovian reservoir in order to 
reduce significantly the overall cost 
of the project. The testing of the 
Callovian V unit in Well-09 and the 
deepening and evaluation of 
Callovian zones I-V in Well-22 will be 
concluded later in 2011.
Russian Reserves
Following the results of the Well-27 
test, the production characteristics 
of the field were revised and 
the material balance reserves 
forecast reassessed. This resulted 
in a revision of the P+P reserves 
to 44.8 MMboe during 2009. 
The Oxfordian reserves will be 
reassessed (as a licence obligation) 
later this year once the results of the 
Well-25 testing can be incorporated. 
Callovian reserves are dependent on 
the results from Well-09 and 
Well-22, and will be revised in 2012.
In addition, YGE has received a letter 
of assurance from the Russian 
authorities confirming that any field 
reserves lying outside the licence 
boundary could be included in a 
revised licence area (provided this 
did not exceed 125% of the existing 
licence). This permits YGE to 
increase the field reserves by up 
to a further 40% when the licence 
has been formally extended and is 
scheduled to occur after first gas 
production.

JKX holds 50% equity in the 
northern Pannonian Basin Hernad 
licences in a joint venture with the 
operator, Hungarian Horizon 
Energy (‘HHE’). The Hernad I 
licence covers 2,903sq.km and 
the Hernad II licence covers 
2,507sq.km. The Pannonian Basin 
comprises numerous sub-basins 
developed across Hungary, 
Slovenia and Romania. It is 
prospective for gas and oil, and 
exploration risk can be reduced by 
the use of seismic data attributes 
(amplitude versus offset or AVO) 
and calibrated well log data. 
The post-rift sequence contains 
channelised and lobe turbidite 
sand reservoirs in combined 
structural/stratigraphic traps. 
Miocene age pro-delta shales 
provide the source for the gas 
and condensates.
Hajdunanas
The Hajdunanas Field was 
discovered in May 2008 with 
successful gas tests from three 
levels in well Hn-1. The discovery 
was confirmed by a second well 
Hn-2 which encountered a thicker 
sequence of Pannonian sands. The 
reservoirs include two Pannonian 
sand intervals and a Miocene 
fractured volcanoclastic sequence. 
Gas quality is excellent and requires 
minimal processing before export. 
The Gorbehaza discovery well Gh-1 
in the Nyirseg licence has been tied 
in the Hajdunanas facility.
• Following the successful workover 
of the Hn-2 well and recompletion 
of the Gh-1 well in the fourth 
quarter of 2010, current gross 
production is approximately 
7 MMcfd of gas and 180 bcpd.
• The field operator, HHE, and JKX 
are planning a 20% increase in 
production in the second quarter 
of the year.
• The local gas market remains 
strong with 2011 realisations to 
date in excess of $10 /Mcf.
Hajdunanas Reserves
No changes have been made to the 
Hajdunanas reserves in 2010. The 
effects of the minor water influx, 
now successfully shut-off, are being 
evaluated.
Further Hernad exploration activity 
• The Tiszavasvari-6 well was drilled 
in the second quarter of 2010 and 
tested during January 2011. The 
well encountered a 300m gross 
reservoir interval with excellent 
gas shows in the deeper 
secondary target below 2,580m. 
Three reservoir intervals were 
tested with a maximum rate of 
1.5 MMcfd being recorded. The 
well has been suspended in 
anticipation of a possible reservoir 
stimulation programme. 
• A larger tilted fault block structure 
with amplitude supported Lower 
Pannonian reservoir intervals lies 
updip from the first structure and 
is estimated to contain an initial 
gas in place of between 50 and 
150 BCF. Appraisal drilling is 
scheduled for the second quarter 
of 2011.

Nyirseg
JKX farmed-in for a 33.3% interest 
in 120sq.km of the adjacent Nyirseg 
licence operated by PetroHungaria 
in late 2008.
• JKX subsequently increased its 
holding to 50%, as did HHE, by 
buying out the minority partners.
• The first well Gorbehaza-1 tested 
3.74 MMcfd of gas and 20 bcpd 
and has been tied into the 
Hajdunanas gas production facility 
some 2.5km away.
• First gas was achieved in August 
2010. 
• The offset Gorbehaza-5 well, 
drilled in early 2010, was water 
bearing and has been completed 
as a potential water disposal well 
for the Hajdunanas facility.
Veszto
In March 2009, JKX farmed-in for a 
25% interest in a 15.6sq.km area of 
the Veszto exploration licence held 
by HHE in the eastern Pannonian 
Basin. A 3D seismic survey covering 
the entire 219sq.km licence has 
been completed and interpreted with 
two prospects identified.
Following abandonment of the 
Nyekpuszta-1 well because of 
unexpected high pressures 
(12,000psi) and temperatures 
(175ºC), the Nyekpuszta-2 appraisal 
well was successfully drilled to 
3,695m in late 2009. The well 
encountered a gross hydrocarbon 
column of 85m and was fracture 
stimulated and tested in 2010. 
Despite flow rates being constrained 
by the abrasion due to returning 
proppant, the rates were initially 
steady at 2.0 MMcfd and 600 bpd oil/
condensate with a FWHP of 
4,500 psi. However, this rate was 
not sustained through the two 
month test period. After a one 
month final shut-in, reservoir 
pressure built back to original levels. 
The slow build up indicates a low 
permeability connection of the main 
reservoir volume to the fracced 
interval. It has been concluded that 
this potentially very large (›200Bcf) 
structure will require additional 
appraisal drilling and formation 
stimulation.
JKX and HHE continue the 
evaluation of the prospect specific 
and regional structural model in the 
light of the extended test results 
from the Nyekpuszta-2 well. 
A further well is planned for the 
third quarter of 2011.
In addition to the testing and 
completion of the Nyekpuszta-2 
well, activity under consideration for 
2011 includes evaluation of a similar 
prospect within the Veszto Licence 
in which JKX has an option to 
participate.
Turkeve Acreage
JKX has entered into an agreement 
with HHE to farm-in to the drilling of 
up to seven wells located in the 
Turkeve area of north east Hungary. 
Under the terms of the agreement, 
JKX funds 66.67% of drilling and 
completion costs to earn 50% of 
future mining plots formed to 
develop discoveries, and also funds 
75% of pipeline connection costs. 
There has been one encouraging 
result out of the five wells drilled to 
date and a tie-back to existing 
facilities is planned for the second 
quarter. The remaining two wells 
will also be drilled in the second 
quarter.

REST OF WORLD
Bulgaria
JKX (40% and operator) operates 
two onshore exploration permits, 
B Golitza and B1 Golitza, covering a 
total of 3,355sq.km in eastern 
Bulgaria. The licences include the 
area of the Kamchia Trough, an 
onshore extension of the Tertiary 
age western Black Sea Basin, which 
is now the subject of renewed 
deepwater exploration activity.
The 2009 seismic data acquisition of 
250sq.km 3D was completed in the 
Kamchia Trough, south of the town 
of Varna. The initial interpretation 
revealed several prospects and a 
two well drilling campaign began in 
the third quarter of 2010.
• The Staro Oryahovo South R-01 
exploration well was drilled to a 
total depth of 1,875m. Gas shows 
were encountered during drilling 
of the target Avren Formation 
submarine fan sandstones, but 
subsequent log analysis 
demonstrated that the target was 
water wet. The well was plugged 
and abandoned.
• The Shkorpilovtci South West R-01 
exploration well was drilled to a 
total depth of 837m and was 
plugged and abandoned. 
Significant gas shows were 
observed during drilling of both 
the primary target Avren 
Formation channel sand complex 
and the underlying secondary 
target Dvoynitca Formation 
sandstones. However, wireline 
data in the Avren Formation 
indicated poor reservoir 
permeability, and consequently a 
well test was not performed. The 
well appeared to have encountered 
a channel margin in this location 
and the shallow depth to the 
primary target precluded a 
geological sidetrack. The highly 
laminated underlying secondary 
reservoir was determined to be 
water wet.
The lack of success of both recent 
Golitza wells was disappointing, 
but JKX and its co-venturers believe 
they can integrate the information 
from these wells with the 3D seismic 
to high-grade further exploration 
targets within the Avren Formation.
Slovakia
In 2008, the Company farmed-in for 
a 25% interest in the Svidnik, 
Medzilaborce and Snina exploration 
licences, covering a total area of 
2,278sq.km in the Carpathian Fold 
Belt in north east Slovakia. 
Acquisition of 346km of 2D seismic 
data in 2008/2009 provided basic 
regional information in the two 
eastern licences, as well as infill 
data in the western Svidnik licence.
In 2010, a further 150km of 2D 
seismic data were acquired to firm 
up leads identified in the 2008/2009 
surveys. A structure has been 
confirmed in the vicinity of the 
Smilno discovery well in the Svidnik 
licence, and plans are being made 
for drilling an exploration well, 
possibly in the latter part of 2011. 
Further regional seismic data 
acquisition is planned for the third 
quarter of 2011. Financial review

Profit for the year
The profit after tax for 2010 was 
$21.2m (2009: $85.3m) although, 
excluding the impact of the 
non-cash exceptional item of 
$74.6m and the resulting deferred 
tax credit of $14.5m, the profit after 
tax is $81.3m. The impact of the 
exceptional item is further discussed 
below. The basic earnings per share 
was 12.38 cents per share (2009: 
54.23 cents per share) or, excluding 
the impact of the impairment 
provision, was 47.56 cents per share.  
Revenue
Total revenues of $192.9m were 
down 2% (2009: $196.5m), a direct 
result of an 11% decrease in 
production offset by a 28% increase 
in oil price and 6% increase in gas 
price. The average oil price achieved 
was $69.15/bbl (2009: $53.90/bbl) 
with a gas price achieved of $7.59/
Mcf (2009: $7.19/Mcf).
Operating profit
The combined cost of sales and 
general administrative costs and 
loss on foreign exchange, before 
impairment, exceptional item and 
profit on sale of assets, were 13% 
higher at $84.2m (2009: $74.4m) 
comprising: 
• Depreciation, depletion and 
amortisation which increased 
slightly to $33.2m (2009: $32.8m) 
despite the 11% drop in 
production, a function of the 
greater production contribution in 
2010 from proportionally higher 
capital expenditure fields in 
Hungary and Rudenkovskoye 
in Ukraine.
• Production related taxes, which 
increased 30% in the period to 
$5.2m (2009: $4.0m), mainly 
because of a greater contribution 
from Hungary which accounted for 
7% of production and 45% of 
production related taxes.
• Underlying operating costs (cost 
of sales less DD&A, impairment, 
exceptional item and production 
based taxes) declined 13% on last 
year to $17.9m (2009: $20.6m), 
due to savings and ongoing 
efficiencies being achieved in 
operations. However, underlying 
operating costs combined with 
general and administrative 
expenses increased 22% during 
the period from $35.3m to $43.2m.  
This represents significant one off 
corporate costs in Ukraine along 
with increased expenditure 
associated with “staffing up” 
the Russian subsidiary 
Yuzhgazenergie, and a number of 
one off expenditures in our period 
of transition from project 
development towards an operating 
company. The net loss on foreign 
exchange of $2.6m was up 13% 
(2009: $2.3m).
Provisions for impairment of fixed 
assets and write-off of exploration 
costs of $13.7m (2009: $5.0m) 
recognises the write off of Ukrainian 
exploration well Zaplavskoye 3 
($6.2m) and licence costs for the 
recently relinquished 
Chervonoyarske licence ($1.0m).  
Additionally, the Group wrote off 
during the period its share of two 
exploration wells in Bulgaria ($1.7m) 
and one in Hungary ($1.9m). 
A provision was also made for 
an asset which was previously 
held for Russia of $2.9m. 
The exceptional item relates to an 
impairment provision taken on our 
Russia asset, the details of this are 
documented below and within note 
5(e) and 5(f) of the financial 
statements.
Impairment
A review was undertaken at the 
balance sheet date to determine 
whether there was any indication of 
triggers that may have led to any 
assets requiring an impairment 
review. Following this review, an 
impairment trigger was noted in 
relation to Yuzhgazenergie (YGE) in 
Russia and Poltava Petroleum 
Company (PPC) in Ukraine. Having 
undertaken the review, it was 
concluded that PPC’s Novo-
Nikolaevskoye complex was not 
impaired.
An impairment review was 
undertaken for YGE. 
        
2010 was a year of significant 
capital expenditure 
underpinned by continued solid 
operating cash flow, most 
importantly from our Ukrainian 
subsidiary Poltava Petroleum 
Company (“PPC”). Whilst 
production decreased as a 
consequence of delay in 
mobilising a second rig to 
Ukraine, increased 
international commodity prices, 
combined with effective 
operational cost control, 
resulted in the second highest 
operating cash flow generation 
in the Group’s history.

Financial review 36
The development plan and 
production profile have continued to 
be refined since the 2007 acquisition 
of YGE. First gas sales from the 
project are now expected autumn 
2011, three years later than planned, 
and the anticipated convergence of 
Adygean gas prices to net back 
European levels is now delayed to 
2017. The current level of gas prices 
in Russia are also lower than those 
anticipated in March 2010.
The key assumptions used in the 
impairment testing were:
• Production profiles based on 
latest information provided by 
independent reserve engineers, 
such information including 2P 
reserves (44.8 MMboe) and 3P and 
contingent resources.
• Economic life of field (expected to 
be around 2032).
• Gas prices based on the Russian 
Government’s intention to achieve 
net-back convergence with the 
European gas markets which the 
Group has assumed as occurring 
in 2017 (2009: 2015).
• Capital and operating costs: based 
on project estimates.
• Post tax Rouble discount rate of 
13.5% (2009: 15.9%).
The changes in the key assumptions 
used from previous periods have 
resulted in the asset being impaired 
by $74.6m. No value was attributed 
to 3P and contingent resources. 
The main driver of the impairment 
has been lower sales prices 
anticipated in the early years 
together with a longer period before 
net back European gas price parity 
is achieved. The Group has 
recognised the impairment charge 
as an exceptional provision within 
the accounts.
Taxation
The effective tax rate for the Group 
in 2010 was (1.8%) (2009: 28.5%). 
The significant reduction results 
from three main factors: deferred 
tax effect of $14.5m in relation to the 
$74.6m Russian asset exceptional 
item; the recognition of a deferred 
tax asset in the UK; and reduced 
current tax on core Ukrainian 
operations resulting from reduced 
taxable income. 
Dividend
The Board proposes a final dividend 
of 2.6 pence per share (2009: 
2.7 pence per share) giving a full 
year dividend of 5.0 pence per share 
(2009: 5.0 pence per share). The 
proposed dividend will be 
recognised when paid.
The Board has decided that not 
increasing the full year dividend is 
appropriate, following the continued 
extensive capital investment in the 
Group’s YGE redevelopment project 
in southern Russia, coupled with the 
cash impact of rental payments in 
Ukraine following the 1st January 
2011 introduction of Ukraine’s new 
tax code.

Cash flow/Net cash
Net cash from operating activities 
(after tax payments of $28.5m) was 
$117.7m, which is 7% lower than the 
previous year (2009: $126.5m). This 
reflects the lower PPC production in 
the period partially offset by higher 
commodity prices. There was an 
81% increase in total net cash used 
in investing activities to $175.1m 
(2009: $96.7m). This was due to the 
increased capital expenditures to 
$172.8m (2009: $108.7m) mainly on 
the continued development of PPC’s 
licences in Ukraine, the YGE 
redevelopment of the 
Koshekhablskoye field in south west 
Russia, and the Group’s growing 
Hungarian asset portfolio.

What’s the 
risk?
Definition Probability
Reservoir 
performance
The hydrocarbon reservoirs that generate production and cash flow to underpin 
the Group’s growth may not perform as expected, exposing the Group to lower 
profits and challenges in funding planned development. Accordingly, forecast 
reservoir performance is critical in deciding on development options for specific 
assets, as well as allocation of resources generally across the Group.
Capital 
expenditure
The Group operates in a capital intensive business requiring long lead time 
investment decisions. Deviations in forecasts of timing and quantum of exploration 
and development expenditures can expose the Group to funding challenges and to 
projects which may have diminished or negative economic return. Such deviations 
can result from a number of causes, including general economic and industry 
specific cost inflation, variations in foreign exchange rates, deficient project 
planning and monitoring of project spend.
The Group is exposed to international oil and gas price movements. 
The Group is a price taker and does not enter into hedge agreements unless 
required for borrowing purposes.
Inability to negotiate and manage purchases and contracts can increase costs to 
the Group and/or cause delays to project completions and operations, negatively 
impacting production, cash flow and value generation.

Risks we face and how we manage them
The Group’s business of oil and 
gas exploration and production 
and its chosen area of operation, 
central and eastern Europe, 
dictates that it is exposed to a 
broad range of risks. 
The Group’s approach to this 
spectrum of risk is to monitor and 
mitigate identified risks and then 
actively manage them to the extent 
possible to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s 
financial performance. 
Risk management is carried out 
by designated individuals under 
policies and procedures 
approved, reviewed and managed 
by the Board of Directors.

How we manage it Probability Potential 
impact
As it has evolved, the Group has continued to recruit specialist and industry recognised 
personnel and consultants to model, monitor and manage reservoir performance. Increased levels of 
local operating experience both within and external to the Group assist in further mitigating this risk. 
The Group manages its key activities in Ukraine and Russia via strong local operating companies that 
have been developed and staffed with skilled personnel. The interaction between local and London based 
specialists and third party consultants is key to operational risk management. The continued intra-
regional diversification of interests (highlighted by Russian and Hungarian development participations) 
has aided in spreading this risk away from the previous very high concentration in Ukraine. With the 
increased diversification in assets, the Group has also expanded its UK technical team to ensure 
knowledge transfer to and between operating companies and the consistent application of the Group’s 
strategic technical methodology.
The Group operates its key interests in Ukraine and Russia via strong local operating companies, who 
interact with London based Group specialists, as well as UK and locally based contracted specialists to 
maximise project management capability. For individual capital projects which are material to the Group, 
Project Management teams are created to oversee planning and implementation. Recent examples of 
such teams include those established at the Rudenkovskoye development in Ukraine, and at the 
Koshekhablskoye workover programme and gas processing facility construction in Russia. These project 
management teams report to stakeholder groups comprising senior management and other appropriate 
project related staff and contractors.
Most of the Group’s gas sold in Ukraine and its share of Hungarian gas sales is through market related 
contracts to significant and creditworthy customers. This is intended to minimise exposure to abrupt 
price movements, ensuring sales are as closely matched as possible, in terms of timing and volume, to 
production. The balance of oil and gas production in Ukraine is sold by way of auctions, conducted with a 
frequency aimed to achieve as close as practicable the aforementioned matching principle. The Group’s 
Russian gas production, scheduled to commence in autumn 2011, is intended to be sold on a similar 
basis to the bulk of Ukranian production, being to large credit worthy customers on contracts at market 
related prices.
The Group operates policies, procedures and controls intended to regularise procurement within strict 
levels of delegated authority. All significant purchases are tendered. Each operating entity manages a 
schedule of approved suppliers. All contracts are constructed specifically or in accordance with 
templates, targeted at the jurisdictions of supply and delivery, taking account of reviews of both internal 
lawyers and, where dictated by procedure, by third party legal advisors.

Capital management is monitored by the Finance Director in accordance with policies and procedures

paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, sell assets, or obtain borrowings 
from third parties. Two recent material examples of managing the Group’s capital structure have been the

exposure
The Company operates in a variety of emerging markets where the accounting, 
tax and legal environment and the application of laws and regulations are 
constantly evolving. New laws can come into effect at times which can conflict 
with others and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and changes 
which may be applied retrospectively. This can result in the Group being subject 
to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax as well as other liabilities. 
Management’s interpretation of tax legislation as applied to the transactions and 
activities of the Group may at times not coincide with that of the tax authorities. 
As a result, the tax authorities in the countries of operation may challenge 
transactions and the Group may be assessed for additional taxes, penalties and 
fines which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position 
and results of operations.
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange “FX” risk 
arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to Ukrainian Hryvna 
and the Russian Rouble. FX risk arises from future commercial transactions, 
recognised assets/liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Group’s income and operating cash flows are subject to changes in market 
interest rates.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and 
financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including 
outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
Reduction in liquidity and working capital could result in delay or cancellation of 
capital projects. In extreme circumstances, this could impact day to day operations 
and the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Failure to put in place and operate a rigorous HSEC regime can endanger and 
negatively affect stakeholders. Adverse publicity from any poor performance in 
this field could negatively affect the Group. The Group could be held responsible 
for addressing any contamination/damage to current or past licences and 
surrounding areas. The associated cost could be significant.
The Group operates in a region where title to licences can be challenged by state 
and non-state parties. If a licence title is challenged, production could be 
suspended or terminated depending on the outcome. Such challenges may 
emanate from licence provenance or compliance with licence commitments.

The Board and management recognise the constant need for expert advice to ensure full compliance 
with local and international regulations and laws. Our strategy is to employ skilled local staff in the 
countries of operation and provide them with ongoing training opportunities. In addition to such 
specialist staff employed in the Group’s operating entities, the Company has established legal, tax and 
accounting advisors. In Ukraine, PPC has at times since 1994 sought clarification of its status regarding 
a number of production related taxes and has been subject to a number of such taxes. Specifically, 
application of production related tax pre 2009 has attracted scrutiny. This risk is further described in 
note 21 of the accounts. On 1st January 2011 a new tax code became effective in Ukraine replacing most 
of the previous tax laws. The new tax code has removed uncertainty over the applicability of rental fee 
payment by PPC from 2011, and accordingly PPC has been liable to and is paying such fees.
By matching, as far as is practicable, receipts and payments in the same currency and by following a 
range of commercial policies to minimise exposure to the Hryvna denominated sales, which continued to 
account for more than 90% of Group revenues in 2010.
Interest rates are continually monitored by the Finance Director . The Treasury sub-committee of the 
Audit Committee also reviews rates on a regular basis, as well as the Group’s strategy with regards to 
cash deposits. This strategy, given the current banking environment, is focused on security of deposits 
(through bank selection and monitoring criteria) in preference to maximising interest rate return, 
a strategy which is regularly reviewed.
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is managed at a Group level through two Treasury Committees: 
one comprises management, which meets weekly, while the other is a sub-committee of the Audit 
Committee. These Committees evaluate the relative risks of banks and determine the appropriate 
allocation of Group funds across a range of banks in varying jurisdictions, with the aim of minimising 
credit risk associated with cash deposits. Local customers are managed at local level if there is no 
independent rating, the Group evaluates their financial position, past experience and other factors. 
Management does not expect any losses through non-performance by counterparties. The Company 
does not have any concentration of credit risk and management does not consider there to be any 
significant exposure to material loss.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity on the basis of expected cash flow to 
ensure any remedial action can be taken with as much lead time as possible. The table on 
page 36 analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining 
period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
The Group treats HSEC as a priority and has a London based HSEC manager who reports directly to the 
CEO. In addition, HSEC managers within local operations engender a safe operating environment. 
Significant expenditures are incurred to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to the extent 
reasonable practicable, create social and economic benefit in the surrounding area. Appropriate 
insurances are maintained to manage the Group’s financial exposure.
The Group conducts rigorous due diligence on licence title as part of any review of prospective interest 
acquisitions. For licences held, the Group ensures compliance with all commitments and where 
commitment adherence is for whatever reason likely to be out of time or scope, extensions/waivers as 
required are obtained from relevant authorities. Identification of any such potential infringement of 
commitments is ensured through rigorous project and company procedures and controls.

Targets 2010 Achievements 2010 Targets 2011 44
Employment
We are bringing valuable 
jobs to the region. The 
current number of YGE 
employees is 155, which 
is expected to peak at 
over 250. The project 
is also generating 
employment for 
contractors and supply 
chain vendors: the 
number varies but could 
be up to 600 support and 
associated personnel.
Community
We are keen to be good 
neighbours and to play 
our part in the local 
community whenever 
possible. In 2010, we 
were pleased to provide 
ﬁ nancial and practical 
support to the town 
of Maikop’s Harvest 
Festival celebration, 
which is an important 
event in the lives of the 
community.
Environment
Waste management 
is a challenge in an 
area that has limited 
infrastructure for safe 
waste disposal. In 
addition to introducing 
a ‘reduce, reuse, 
recycle’ scheme at the 
project, we are utilising 
temporary options such 
as storage while working 
with local industry to 
create a permanent 
solution to the issue 
of waste.
At Koshekhablskoye, some 
1,500km south of Moscow, we are 
building a gas plant which has 
major implications for our four CSR 
pillars: health and safety, 
employment, community and the 
environment. A top priority for us 
is to deliver the project to its full 
potential – while also ensuring that 
it provides benefits to the local 
people and their community.
The nearest town, Maikop, is the 
capital of the Adygea Republic and is 
recognised as one of the most 
attractive cities in the Northern 
Caucasus. However, it is also an 
area of above average unemploy-
ment. The local people need jobs – 
but they also need them to be good, 
long-term and well-paid jobs 
provided within an effective HSEC 
framework.
Our goal is to be a net contributor to 
the local community and to build a 
reputation as an important and 
positive influence. We can help drive 
social and economic development in 
local communities through the use 
of our resources and through our 
supply chain network. We used 
extensive consultation, which 
included hosting a public meeting, 
to gather opinions and provide the 
community with information on the 
project. In particular, we explained 
how we can contribute to initiatives 
and events which support local 
companies and employment, 
develop skills and encourage 
entrepreneurship.
We also carried out an 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) with the Volgograd Design 
Institute. Our activities will result in 
higher-risk environmental 
CSR case study – Koshekhablskoye, Russia
Health and safety
We will never 
compromise the safety 
of our people. The 
project poses signiﬁ cant 
challenges to our 
workforce, including the 
presence of Hydrogen 
Sulphide (H
2
S). We 
enhanced the level of 
protection from H
2
S 
during 2010 and worked 
more than 1 million 
man-hours without a 
Lost Time Injury.
Corporate Social Responsibility review 045 JKX Oil & Gas plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2010 45 JKX Oil & Gas plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2010 JKX Oil & Gas plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2010
challenges, particularly in terms of 
water use and waste management. 
To address this, we are 
implementing systems to ensure 
minimal water use, minimal waste 
generation and that we have a clear 
baseline against which to measure 
our performance. An Oil Spill 
Contingency Plan (OSCP) has been 
prepared to ensure rapid and 
appropriate action in the event of a 
spill. Oil spill contingency training is 
planned for 2011 for YGE employees.
Construction at Koshekhablskoye is 
continuing at pace, with first 
commercial gas production on 
target for 2011. YGE, our operating 
company, currently employs 155 
people, with this set to rise to over 
250. The number of contractors and 
supply chain vendors will vary but 
we expect it to peak at up to 600 
support and associated personnel.
Their health and safety at work 
is very important to us. The 
Koshekhablskoye project poses 
a number of HSEC challenges, 
notably through the presence 
of Hydrogen Sulphide (H
2
S), an 
extremely dangerous substance 
which can cause fatalities if not 
addressed correctly. Although H
2
S 
controls were already in place to 
meet legal requirements, the JKX 
Technical Director and the YGE 
Managing Director demanded 
greater protection for the workforce. 
We have now carried out a full 
review and introduced enhanced 
precautions covering such issues 
as training, additional H
2
S 
monitoring, enhanced drills and 
evacuation plans, and emergency 
response plans. Health and safety
We work on projects and in 
environments that can be 
challenging and sometimes 
hazardous by nature. Our priority 
is to ensure that all JKX, subsidiary 
and contractor employees work 
in a safe environment, where 
effective systems of work are 
maintained and appropriate 
procedures and processes are 
in place. 
Continuous improvement
We are committed to continuously 
improving our health and safety 
performance. During 2010 we again 
maintained our progress, with a 
significant decrease in our AIFR (All 
Injury Frequency Rate) figures from 
1.5 in 2009 to 0.62 in 2010. The AIFR 
figures represent the health and 
safety incidents per 200,000 
man-hours. To put our achievement 
into context, the industry benchmark 
for 2010 was 3.4. Although this is a 
good performance, we remain alert 
to potential issues at all times. 
Health and safety is a never-ending 
journey, not a destination.
We work hard to ensure that 
suppliers and others meet the high 
standards we set ourselves, and 
during the year our team completed 
the fabrication of the new Russian 
gas processing facility without a 
Lost Time Injury.
The last 12 months have seen us 
influence operating standards on our 
joint venture in Hungary, and also 
working with the Volgograd Design 
Institute to monitor the designs 
being produced for JKX plant.
In occupational health, the drug and 
alcohol policy which was success-
fully introduced in Bulgaria has been 
rolled-out right across the Group. 
Areas of focus Policies
Awareness, competence and 
behaviours.
Suppliers, contractors and partners in 
the supply chain.
Customers and products.
We select our people with care, train 
them in key safety-related skills and 
competences and regularly assess 
their performance. 
We rely on suppliers, contractors 
and partners to carry out our work 
safely and effectively. We ensure 
that they are aligned with our HSEC 
expectations and we monitor their 
performance against these 
expectations.
We assess, manage and communicate 
the hazards associated with our 
products, communicating topical 
information to help users handle 
them in a safe and environmentally-
responsible manner.

Risk management
We were proud to maintain our 
OHSAS 18001 Health & Safety 
accreditation during 2010. This is 
an internationally-recognised 
specification for occupational health 
and safety management systems, 
and our accreditation will help us 
meet our health and safety targets. 
The accreditation process demands 
regular and comprehensive 
management reviews, and we 
carried out such a review in 2010 
which gave us the assurance that we 
have the appropriate systems and 
processes in place.
As drilling operations can pose 
significant risk, we again improved 
the risk management aspects of 
these activities in 2010. We utilise 
the skills and knowledge of British 
supervisors, which has enabled us 
to define and manage risk more 
clearly. Our policy is to select these 
supervisors for their expertise as 
well as for their familiarity with the 
regions where we operate. They 
understand local working practices 
and their presence will significantly 
enhance our ability to educate and 
train our contract drillers.
In both Russia and Ukraine, we 
continued to carry out risk 
management studies using our 
proven Hazard and Operability 
(HAZOP), Hazard Identification 
(HAZID) and As Low as Reasonably 
Practical (ALARP) methodologies.
We have developed an integrated 
assessment process for the safety 
assurance of development 
proposals which are potentially 
hazardous. The integrated hazards-
related assessment process 
comprises:
• Preliminary hazard analysis to 
support the development 
application by demonstrating that 
risk levels do not preclude 
approval.
• A fire, safety and explosion study, 
emergency response plan and an 
updated hazard analysis 
undertaken during the design 
phase of the project.
• A construction safety study carried 
out to ensure facility safety during 
construction and commissioning, 
particularly when there is 
interaction with existing 
operations.
• Implementation of a safety 
management system to give safety 
assurance during ongoing 
operation. 
• Regular independent hazard 
audits to verify the integrity of the 
safety systems and that the facility 
is being operated in accordance 
with its hazards-related conditions 
of consent. We have committed to reducing 
emissions by 12.5%, from 2008 to 
2012, in line with EU targets. 
Having initiated a reduction 
programme in 2009, we are well on 
our way to achieving this target. 
With significant construction 
planned for 2010, our risk 
assessment processes identified 
the possibility that emissions would 
increase during the year. In reality, 
despite the increase in production 
and construction activity, emissions 
remained within expected levels. 
We are confident that 2011 will see 
a controlled reduction.
Looking ahead, the LPG Plant which 
will soon be operational in the 
Ukraine will continue to help us 
reduce emissions.
Emissions reduction in 2010 was 
achieved through the procurement of 
more environmentally friendly 
compressors, new plant and the 
replacement of older equipment, 
together with more efficient methods 
of transport management including 
journey management and selection of 
vehicles. We continuously seek new 
initiatives to increase the use of trucks 
that use clean diesel or liquefied 
natural gas, and use best-in-class 
technology to optimise freight 
movements and make shorter trips. 
We have instituted a no-idle policy at 
all facilities to reduce air pollution, 
greenhouse gas emissions and 
improve fuel efficiency. While these 
programmes are a good start, we are 
committed to reducing our global 
carbon footprint. Continuously 
monitored.

Continuously monitored.
By following the same rules and 
working together towards consistent 
goals, we can have a more meaningful 
and quicker impact on greenhouse gas 
reductions and improve our 
communities.
We work hard to protect our 
people, their communities and also 
the environment, both close to our 
projects and in the wider world.
We were very proud to achieve ISO 
14001 Environmental accreditation 
in 2010. ISO 14001 is the principal 
management system standard 
which specifies the requirements for 
the formulation and maintenance of 
an Environmental Management 
System.
The environmental performance 
of our operations has implications 
for our relationships with our 
people, their communities, partner 
organisations, the media, 
governments, investors and other 
stakeholders.
In 2010, we again made good 
progress. In particular, we were 
pleased to continue the ongoing 
work with The Carbon Disclosure 
Project on our Carbon Management 
Plan. Although our performance 
was good for 2010, with an increase 
in production, we started a further, 
more detailed baseline study to 
identify those areas that could help 
us drive continuous improvement.

We want to be recognised as a 
Company where talented people of 
all disciplines, from managers and 
engineers to on-site operatives, 
can do their best work.
At the year-end, the total number of 
employees was 751. In Russia, YGE 
employs 155 people, although this 
number is expected to increase to 
over 250. In the Ukraine, we employ 
578 personnel in the Poltava Office 
and at the production site. The 
London office has a staff of 18. The 
number of contractors and supply 
chain vendors can vary from time to 
time and can peak at approximately 
600 support and associated 
personnel.
As we operate across a number of 
different countries, cultures and 
environments, we have a 
decentralised management 
structure, with employment policies 
designed to suit the needs of 
individual locations. However, each 
company complies with certain key 
principles, including:
• Providing safe and healthy working 
conditions for all employees.
• Creating an open, challenging, 
rewarding and participative 
environment through selection, 
development and training, the 
full talents, skills and abilities 
of all employees.
• Communicating the fullest 
possible understanding of the 
goals, directions and performance 
of the business.
• Providing compensation and 
benefits which reflect good current 
local practices and which reward 
collective and individual abilities 
and personal performance.
• Providing a working environment, 
development opportunities and 
incentives to promote team effort 
and commitment to the 
performance of JKX and 
subsidiary companies.
Our Group-wide values of Integrity, 
Teamwork, Excellence and Respect, 
are essential in helping to guide our 
employees in the way that they 
behave.
We are an integral part of the 
communities in which we operate 
and are determined to play our 
part through financial donations as 
well as practical support. All our 
operations are managed with local 
interests in mind, thereby 
increasing public confidence in the 
integrity of our assets and 
underlining our commitment to 
HSEC performance.
In 2009 we introduced a structured 
system for stakeholder dialogue and 
in 2010 we made further progress, 
engaging with stakeholders in key 
operational locations. The outcome 
of events such as the Town Hall 
meetings in Koshekhablskoye and 
Maikop, in Russia, has influenced 
the way in which we now manage 
carbon emissions. 
In practical terms, our community 
support frequently involves using 
the Company’s plant and machinery 
– as well as manpower – to provide 
much-needed assistance. For 
example, our plant and equipment 
was used to clear snow in 
Koshekhablskoye.
Human Rights
JKX supports and respects the 
protection of internationally 
recognised human rights in our 
areas of operation. The policy is 
applicable to all our operations. 
We uphold and promote human 
rights within our sphere of influence 
which includes, but is not limited to, 
employees, contractors, local 
communities, suppliers, and 
business partners. We also actively 
engage with key stakeholders to 
address the rights of the 
communities surrounding our 
operations. 
Charitable donations and 
volunteering
Each operation has a limited budget 
for good causes and we handle 
charitable donations at a local level. 
In 2010 our operations budget was  
$329,000. Locally, donations from 
the Group amounted to: Ukraine 
$99,000; Russia $188,000; 
UK $30,000; and Georgia $3,000.
Subject to management approval, 
staff may be given additional time off 
in order to join in certain charity-
related activities.

The Directors submit their report and the audited 
accounts for the year ended 31st December 2010.
Results and dividends
The result for the year is a profit before tax of $20.8m 
(2009: $119.3m). The profit for the year after tax is 
$21.2m (2009: $85.3m). Following payment of the interim 
dividend, details of which are set out in note 24 of the 
accounts, the Directors recommend a final dividend of 
2.6p per share for the year ended 31st December 2010 to 
be paid on 24th June 2011 to shareholders on the 
register on 6th May 2011. This payment will bring the 
total dividend in respect of 2010 to 5.0p per share. 
A review of major financial developments during the 
year is contained in the Financial Review. 
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s forecast 
cashflows for the next twelve months and through to the 
end of 2012. Capital and operating costs are based on 
approved budgets in the case of 2011 and current 
development plans in the case of 2012. Having 
considered the review, and the Group’s ability to change 
the timing and scale of capital expenditure if required, 
and to draw up to $15m on a credit facility in Ukraine, 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and Group have adequate resources to 
continue for the foreseeable future. The going concern 
basis for the accounts has therefore continued to be 
adopted.
Activities
The principal activities of the Group are oil and gas 
exploration, appraisal development and production, 
conducted through subsidiary undertakings.
Business Review
Details of the Company’s 2010 operations are included in 
the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s 
statement and Operational Review. 
A review of financial performance is included on pages 
34 to 37 and the key performance indicators for the 
business included on pages 8 and 9 and incorporated by 
reference into this report.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will be held 
at 11.00am on 7th June 2011 at the premises of the 
Institute of Directors, 116–123 Pall Mall, London SW1Y 
5ED.
The business for the meeting includes 10 resolutions as 
Ordinary Business and 3 special resolutions proposed as 
Special Business.
Included as Ordinary Business are resolutions to elect a 
new Chairman and re-elect four Directors.
After twelve years of distinguished service, Lord Fraser 
announced his intention in March 2010 to step down, and 
Sir Ian Prosser is proposed for election as Chairman to 
replace Lord Fraser and Lord Oxford is proposed for 
re-election given they have both served on the Board for 
more than nine years. [The Board has conducted a 
rigorous review and concluded that Rt Hon Lord Fraser 
of Carmyllie QC and Lord Oxford remain independent]. 
As was reported in the 2009 Report and Accounts, in the 
spirit of the principles of Corporate Governance 
contained in the Combined Code of Corporate 
Governance appended to the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, the Board believes it 
appropriate to seek annual re-election of all Non-
Executive Directors who serve on the Board for more 
than nine years. 
Nigel Moore, Martin Miller and Peter Dixon retire on 
rotation in accordance with the Articles of Association 
and are seeking re-election.
Included in Special Business there are three special 
resolutions:
(1)  Purchase of own shares: The Directors recommend 
that the Company seeks authorisation at the Annual 
General Meeting to renew the authority for the 
Company to make on-market purchases of ordinary 
shares in the capital of the Company, such authority 
to expire on the earlier of 15 months from the date of 
the passing of the resolution and the conclusion of 
the next Annual General Meeting (if sooner). 
  The minimum price payable per share under the

Directors will take into account all relevant factors 
including the effect on earnings per share and assets 
per share ratios and other benefits to Shareholders. 
Any shares purchased would be held as treasury 
shares.

15 months from the date of passing of the resolution 
unless previously revoked, varied or extended by the 
Company in General Meeting.

Corporate governance
Statement by the Directors on compliance with the 
Combined Code
The Company is committed to the principles of 
Corporate Governance contained in the Combined Code 
of Corporate Governance that is appended to the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and for which 
the Board is accountable to shareholders.
The Board
The Board, which is responsible to shareholders for 
leading, developing and protecting the interests of the 
Company, comprises five Non-Executive Directors and 
four Executive Directors. Details are provided on pages 
50 and 51.
A clear division of responsibilities at the head of the 
Company is demonstrated in the separation of positions 
of the Non-Executive Chairman, Sir Ian Prosser, and the 
Chief Executive Officer, Dr Paul Davies. The Non-
Executive Directors are of varied backgrounds and 
experience and the Board considers them to exercise 
independent and objective judgment.
Matters reserved specifically for the Board are clearly 
laid down. The Board: sets and monitors strategy; 
reviews business plans, trading performance and 
overhead costs; approves major capital investment 
projects; examines acquisition opportunities, divestment 
possibilities and significant financial and operational 
issues; and reviews and approves the Company’s 
financial statements and control and risk management 
systems. In executing these responsibilities the Board 
relies on the receipt of accurate, timely and clear 
information, the dissemination of which is the 
responsibility of the Chairman. All other authorities are 
delegated by the Board, supported by appropriate 
controls, to the Chief Executive Officer on behalf of 
senior management.
Evaluation of the performance of Directors, the Board 
and its committees is undertaken as follows: the 
Executive Directors are evaluated by the Non-Executive 
Directors in informal session; the Chairman is evaluated 
by the other Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director, taking into 
account the views of the Executive Directors; the 
Committees are evaluated by the senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director along with the Chief Executive, 
taking into account the views of the other Executive 
Directors; the Non-Executive Directors, excluding the 
Chairman, are evaluated by the Chairman and Chief 
Executive, taking into account the views of the other 
Executive Directors; and the Board as a whole evaluates 
its own performance by consolidating and discussing 
the reviews set out above.
Lord Oxford is the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and, at the Board’s request, maintains a special 
interest in the strategic issues in PPC, supporting the 
JKX Executive Directors and the PPC senior 
management as required.
All Directors have access to the services of the Company 
Secretary and may, if needed, obtain independent 
professional advice, at the Company’s expense, in the 
execution of their duties.
In addition to Board meetings, the Non-Executive 
Directors meet in private session, both as a group and 
without the Chairman, at least once annually.
It is confirmed that all the Non-Executive Directors have 
sufficient time to fulfil their commitments to the 
Company and that no Executive Director holds a 
Non-Executive Directorship, nor Chairmanship, in a 
FTSE 100 company.
Attendance at meetings
The attendance of Directors at Board Meetings and Audit 
and Remuneration meetings during 2010 was as detailed 
in the tables below and overleaf.

Compliance
Throughout the year ended 31st December 2010, the 
Company has maintained policies and procedures that 
ensured compliance with the code provisions set out in 
Section 1 of the Combined Code and the related 
Financial Services Authority Listing Rule disclosure 
requirements. The Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority require that companies report on the extent to 
which they comply with the Principles of Good 
Governance and Code of Best Practice.
The Board believes the Company has been in full 
compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the 
Combined Code with the following exception:
• A.7.2 The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors are set out in their service contracts, which 
for Sir Ian Prosser is dated 1st March 2011, for Lord 
Oxford is dated 1st January 2002, for Nigel Moore is 
dated 12th July 2007, and for Michel–Marc 
Delcommune and Dipesh Shah are dated 1st June 
2008 and include a termination notice of three months 
by either party. However, the service contracts are for 
an indefinite term, not a finite term, subject to 
re-election on an as required basis. The Board 
continues to believe this is appropriate given the 
company size, Non-Executive skill set, and evaluation 
of performance and independence on an ongoing basis 
with regards to Non-Executives. The Company 
continues to believe the unspecified term continues to 
be reasonable and the Non-Executive contracts 
remain unchanged in this regard. 
In considering that the Company is, other than as 
noted above, in full compliance, the Board notes that 
excluding the Chairman, independent Non-Executive 
Directors comprise 50% of the Board, given the Board 
also considers that the four other Non-Executive 
Directors are wholly independent. 
The Executive Directors have undertaken a review of 
the independence of each of the Non-Executive 
Directors and Chairman. The review addressed the 
matters highlighted at Section A.3.1 of the Code, which 
could appear to affect a Director’s judgment. One 
specific matter addressed was that Lord Fraser and 
Lord Oxford had served on the Board for more than 
nine years (the Executive Directors however noted Lord 
Fraser’s stated intention in March 2010 to step down 
as Chairman). Following the review, the Executive 
Directors do not consider that this matter in any way 
influences the independent judgment of Lord Fraser or 
Lord Oxford. Accordingly the Executive Directors 
believe each of the Non-Executive Directors and 
Chairman to be independent in accordance with 
Section A 3.1 of the Code both during the period under 
review when Lord Fraser was Chairman, and 
subsequently, following the appointment on 1st March 
2011 of Sir Ian Prosser as Chairman. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee currently comprises Nigel Moore, 
Dipesh Shah and Michel-Marc Delcommune. The 
Committee is chaired by Mr Moore, who as a former 
audit partner with Ernst & Young LLP possesses recent 
and relevant financial experience. He also chairs the 
Audit Committee of four other UK listed companies, and 
maintains a regular pattern of attendance at relevant 
seminars and courses.
The Audit Committee, which has Terms of Reference 
agreed by the Board and available to shareholders on 
request, aims to meet at least three times a year as a 
combination of formal meetings, site visits and audit 
closing meetings (attended by the Chairman) for 
operating subsidiaries. The Committee: reviews the 
Company’s accounting policies; monitors the integrity of 
the financial statements of the Company and any 
announcements relating to the Company’s financial 
performance, reviewing significant financial reporting 
judgements contained in them; reviews the Company’s 
internal financial controls; reviews internal control and 
risk management systems and compliance procedures; 
reports to the Board any matters upon which it considers 
actions or improvement are required, with associated

recommendations as to steps to be taken; and makes 
recommendations to the Board, for it to put to 
shareholders for their approval in general meeting, in 
relation to the appointment, re-appointment and 
removal of the external auditor and to approve the 
remuneration and terms of engagement of the external 
auditor. During 2010 the Committee met four times with 
each Committee member attending all meetings. 
Meetings are attended, by invitation, by the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Finance Director.
The Audit Committee reviews each of the Company’s 
subsidiaries, interests and activities at least once a year. 
Site visits to significant operations are also undertaken 
by Committee members on a frequent basis.
The Audit Committee maintains an objective and 
professional relationship with the Company’s auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who have been auditors 
to the Group since 2006, and meets in private session 
with them on a periodic basis. From time to time, the 
auditor is requested to perform non-audit engagements 
for the Group. In such instances the continued objectivity 
and independence of the auditors in their capacity of 
auditor is an objective of the Group. To meet this 
objective the Audit Committee is delegated the role of 
vetting the appointment of the auditor on specific 
engagements including considerations of materiality 
and, where necessary, requiring a competitive tender for 
such work.
The Company promotes a culture of openness and 
encourages staff to raise any concerns of possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other 
matters, if necessary in confidence. The Audit 
Committee has reviewed arrangements for such 
concerns to be raised, investigated and if necessary 
followed up.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, specifically Section C that addresses 
audit committee aspects, and considers that it complies 
with all the provisions identified apart from the provision 
concerning the need to have a dedicated internal audit 
function, which is not established for the reasons listed 
below. Areas of non-compliance in addition to Section C 
are listed above.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises the 
three Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by Dipesh 
Shah. The Chief Executive Officer attends meetings by 
invitation.
The Remuneration Committee, which has terms of 
reference agreed by the Board and available to 
shareholders on request, meets at least twice a year, to 
assist the Board in determining the remuneration 
arrangements and contracts of the Directors and senior 
employees.
During 2010 the Remuneration Committee met twice 
with three members attending the first meeting and the 
full four members attending the second.
The Remuneration Committee employs the services of 
Kepler as remuneration consultants on an as required 
basis. Kepler have no other connection with the 
Company.
No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The report of the Directors’ remuneration, which involves 
details of the Directors’ interest in options together with 
information on service contracts, is set out on pages 60 
to 68.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, specifically Section B that 
addresses the level, make up and procedural aspects of 
remuneration. The Remuneration Committee considers 
that it complies with all the provisions and practices 
identified.
Nomination Committee
The members of the Nomination Committee are Sir 
Ian Prosser as Chairman, (who replaced Lord Fraser 
who was Chairman during the period), Lord Oxford and 
Mr Nigel Moore. The Nomination Committee did not 
meet formally in 2010 although the Committee’s 
members had a number of informal discussions to 
discuss the search for a replacement Chairman 
following Lord Fraser’s announced intention on 30th 
March 2010 to stand down.
Separate to the Nomination Committee, the Board 
discusses the skill set and experience of the individual 
Board members, the need for additional appointments, 
succession planning and the need for progressive 
refreshing of the Board. The most recent comprehensive 
review was undertaken in 2005.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for identifying and evaluating 
the major business risks faced by the Company and for 
determining and monitoring the appropriate course of 
action to manage these risks. The Audit Committee 
monitors the integrity of the financial statements and 
announcements, reviews the Company’s internal control 
processes and risk management systems and reports its 
conclusions to the Board.
The Board regularly conducts reviews, and has reviewed, 
for the year under review and up to the date of approval 
of the 2010 Annual Report and Accounts, the 
effectiveness of the Company’s systems of internal 
control and risk management. 
It has concluded that the Company’s procedures, 
policies and systems are appropriate and suitable to 
enable the Board to safeguard shareholders’ investment 
and the Company’s assets, and comply with Turnbull 
Guidance. The Audit Committee annually reviews, and has reviewed 
for 2010, the need for a dedicated internal audit function. 
As noted above, it has recommended to the Board that, 
due to the scale and geographic distribution of the 
Company’s licences and operating interests, the Board 
continues to be best served by using external specialist 
assistance on dedicated business and financial risk 
areas to supplement the Company’s own risk analysis. 
The process and systems of internal control are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The key procedures, which the Directors have 
established with a view to providing effective internal 
control, are described below. In addition, the Company’s 
independent auditors present reports to the Audit 
Committee, which include any significant internal 
control matters that they have identified as part of their 
normal audit work.
Business risk
A process is in place to enable the Board to identify the 
major business, operational, financial and compliance 
risks faced by the Company and to determine the 
appropriate course of action to manage and monitor 
these risks. This process is regularly reviewed by the 
Audit Committee and reported to the Board as 
appropriate.
The Company identifies and distinguishes ‘High Profile 
Events’, i.e. those risks that could have material effect 
on the Company’s financial position or reputation, from 
other business risks that it assesses and considers to be 
acceptable for the Company to bear taking into account 
the industry and the markets in which it operates.
The Audit Committee reviews annually the Company’s 
subsidiaries and investments from a business, 
operational and financial risk perspective to ensure that 
the system of internal control and accountability is 
embedded in the operations of the Group. Members of 
the Audit Committee visit subsidiaries and operations on 
a regular basis.
The Audit Committee considers that managers are 
conscious of the need to identify and assess risks in 
their operations and the effect of changes in the 
business environment, to respond quickly and 
appropriately and to report immediately any significant 
control failings and weaknesses that are identified, 
together with details of corrective action.
Management structure
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group and 
there is a formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved for decision by the Board. Each executive has 
been given responsibility and is accountable for specific 
aspects of the Group’s affairs. 
Financial reporting
The Company maintains an effective and reliable 
accounting and management information system. The 
Board receives a monthly report that monitors: actual 
performance against budget and forecast for oil and gas 
production; sales and costs; and provides the Board with 
information on issues including debtors, the cash 
position, cashflow forecasting and the financial 
implications of key sensitivities including changes in 
commodity prices and exchange rates. The Company 
also maintains an effective and reliable suite of policies, 
procedures and controls in preparing consolidated 
accounts. These controls include rigorous review of the 
process and output, and full IT support and review to 
ensure accounting tools and systems are robust.
Budgetary process
Each year the Board approves the annual budget with 
key risk areas identified. Performance is monitored and 
relevant action taken throughout the year through the 
monthly reporting to the Board of variances from the 
budget, updated forecasts for the year together with 
information on the key risk areas.
Corporate accounting and procedures manual
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the 
Group as part of the corporate accounting and 
procedures manual. This sets out, inter alia, the general 
ethos of the Group, delegation of authority and 
authorisation levels, segregation of duties and control 
procedures together with accounting policies and 
procedures. The manual, which includes policies 
common to all Group companies along with company 
specific procedures and controls is reviewed regularly 
and updated as required.
The application of internal financial control and 
operational procedures are reviewed during visits to the 
overseas offices by Head Office staff.
Quality and integrity of personnel
The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured 
through high recruitment standards and subsequent 
training courses. High quality personnel are seen as an 
essential part of the control environment. The ethical 
standards expected of staff are communicated through 
the corporate accounting and procedures manual.
Investment appraisal
Capital investment is regulated by the budgetary process 
and authorisation levels. 
For expenditure beyond specified levels, detailed written 
proposals have to be submitted to the Board. Capital 
expenditures are reviewed with major overruns in terms 
of cost and time being investigated.
The internal financial control situation is reported to the 
Audit Committee, which has reviewed the effectiveness 
of the system of internal financial controls as it operated

during the year and reported its conclusions to the 
Board.
Communication with shareholders
Extensive information about the Group’s activities is 
provided in the Annual Report and Accounts and the 
Half-yearly Report which are sent to shareholders. There 
is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders for 
which the Board as a whole has responsibility. Enquiries 
from individuals on matters relating to their 
shareholding and the business of the Group are 
welcomed and are dealt with in an informative and timely 
manner. Shareholders are encouraged to attend the 
Annual General Meeting to discuss the progress of the 
Group.
Going concern
After making enquiries and taking into consideration the 
Ukrainian and Russian business environments, as 
detailed in note 29 of the accounts, together with 
reviewing the Group’s budget for 2011 and its medium 
term plans, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group and Company have adequate resources to 
continue operations for the foreseeable future. The going 
concern basis for the accounts has therefore continued 
to be adopted.
By order of the Board 
Sir Ian Prosser
Chairman
19th April 2011 This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
relevant requirements of Schedule 992 to the Companies 
Act 2006, the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the 
provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the “Combined Code”) and the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Services Authority. As required by 
the regulations the report is approved by the Board of 
the Company and signed by the chairman of the 
remuneration committee on behalf of the Board.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) 
operates under the delegated authority of the Board. 
The Committee’s primary role is to review, agree and 
approve, or as required under the Combined Code to 
make recommendations to the Board, on:
• the Company’s remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors and senior management;
• service contracts of the Executive Directors;
• remuneration of the Executive Directors;
• remuneration of senior management identified 
by the Committee; and
• participation in, and operation of, the Company’s 
long-term incentive plans.
The full terms of reference are available from the 
Company Secretary.

Lord Oxford  10th November 1997 to date
Mr Nigel Moore 26th June 2007 to date
Mr Michel-Marc Delcommune 1st March 2010 to date
None of the Committee has any personal financial 
interest (other than as a shareholder as detailed on page 
53, which given the level of holdings the Board accepts 
as not impairing independence), conflicts of interests 
arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day 
involvement in running JKX.
No Director plays a part in any discussion regarding his 
own remuneration. Committee meetings are attended by 
the Chief Executive by invitation but he is not able to vote 
and is not present when his own remuneration 
arrangements are discussed.
The Committee retains Kepler Associates (“Kepler”) as 
its independent executive remuneration advisers. Kepler 
provides no other services to the Group. During the year, 
Mercer Limited provided information on remuneration 
levels at comparator oil and gas companies. Mercer 
provides no other services to the Group. The Company’s 
legal advisers, Herbert Smith, provided assistance 
during the year with the formalisation of the revised 
long-term incentives schemes.
The Committee met formally on two occasions during 
2010 and the meeting attendance record is set out in 
the Corporate Governance report on page 56. The 
Committee also held a number of meetings with its 
advisers to finalise the changes to annual and long-term 
incentive schemes prior to submission to shareholders 
at the 2010 AGM.
Committee activities during 2010
The Committee’s activities during 2010 were as follows:
• review and approval of payments to be made under the 
2009 Annual Bonus Scheme;
• approval of executive salary levels for 2010;
• confirmation of lapse of share option awards made in 
2007 due to failure to achieve vesting criteria in 2010;
• implementation of changes to annual and long-term 
incentive schemes approved by shareholders at the 
2010 AGM, including award opportunities, 
performance conditions, targets and vesting 
schedules;
• review and approval of performance targets for the 
2010 Annual Bonus Scheme; and 
• review and approval of the allocation of and 
performance conditions applicable to performance 
shares and share option awards made in 2010.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s overall approach to pay and benefits is 
to reward employees competitively, taking into account 
Company and individual performance, market value and 
competitive pressures in the independent oil and gas 
sector. The Company does not seek to maintain any 
strict market position but aims to ensure that total 
remuneration is set at an appropriate level relative to 
peer group comparator companies.
The comparator companies are UK-based oil and gas 
companies which are primarily quoted on the London 
Stock Exchange or AIM. 
The Board believes that the performance-related 
elements of remuneration should form a significant 
proportion of the total remuneration package of 
Executive Directors. These are designed to align the 
interests of Executive Directors with those of 
shareholders and structured to provide significant 
incentives to perform at the highest level. The 
remuneration packages are prudently designed to 
attract, motivate and retain Directors of the calibre 
needed to maintain the Group’s position in the market

and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. 
The balance of remuneration for Executive Directors is 
such that the majority of overall remuneration is subject 
to achieving performance conditions over both the short 
and long term. The pay mix for the Chief Executive 
(“CEO”) and the Finance Director (“FD”) is shown in 
the charts below, with incentive awards valued 
on a fair value basis. Under the scenario shown of 
on-target performance, around 45% of the package 
is performance-related for the CEO and FD.
Figure 2: Illustration of CEO and FD pay mix
Internal relativity
The Committee is sensitive to the need to set Directors’ 
remuneration having regard to pay and conditions in the 
Group as a whole and is satisfied that the approach 
taken by the Company is fair and reasonable in light of 
current market practice and the best interests of 
shareholders. The Committee ensures that the incentive 
structure for Executive Directors does not raise 
environmental, social, governance or other operational 
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Basic salary
An Executive Director’s basic salary is determined by the 
Committee at the beginning of each year. In addition to 
basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain 
benefits-in-kind, principally health cover. The individual 
salaries and benefits of Executive Directors are reviewed 
and adjusted taking into account individual performance 
and market factors, with reference to independent and 
objective research that provides up-to-date information 
on a comparator group of UK companies operating in the 
independent oil and gas sector. 
During its annual review of Executive Directors’ pay for 
the year commencing 1st January 2011, the Committee 
decided to award basic salary increases of 3% for the 
Chief Executive and for the other Executive Directors.

The average salary increase for all other employees was

listed in Table 4 above. Details of the Executive 
Directors’ basic salary and benefits in 2010 are shown 
on page 67.
Annual Bonus Scheme 
The Annual Bonus Scheme, which is based on the 
achievement of relevant and stretching performance 
conditions determined by the Committee, was 
introduced in 2001 for Executive Directors and certain 
senior management including senior staff in Poltava 
Petroleum Company (PPC) and Yuzhgazenergie (YGE). 
The application of the scheme in any given year is 
discretionary and annual awards are not pensionable.
For the year ending 31st December 2010, maximum 
bonus opportunities were 100% of salary for the Chief 
Executive, 85% for the Finance Director, and 75% for the 
Technical and Commercial Directors. Other senior 
managers could earn an annual bonus payment of up to 
a maximum of between 30% and 60% of their basic 
salary.
The Committee establishes the performance conditions 
that must be met for each financial year. They are 
derived from the Company’s Annual Budget and 
Strategic Plan approved by the Board and, for the year 
ending 31st December 2010, were divided into four 
segments as shown in Table 5 above.
To earn the maximum level of bonus requires the 
maximum to be met or exceeded for each performance 
measure and all of the strategic objectives to be met. 
Bonus outcomes are determined on a formulaic basis.
For 2010, the weighting applied to each performance 
condition was identical for each Executive Director and 
for senior management. In 2010, the performance 
conditions established and the actual achievements for 
the financial and share price segments were as shown in 
Table 6 opposite.
Bonuses paid based on the 2010 results above and 
individual achievement against strategic objectives 
resulted in bonus payments of between 30% and 40% 
of Basic Salary for Executive Directors. Other senior 
management received bonus payments of between 
12% and 24% of Basic Salary.

Annual Bonus Scheme for 2011
For 2011 the Annual Bonus Scheme will operate on a 
similar basis to 2010. The Committee has set stretching 
financial, strategic and HSE objectives and relative TSR 
targets. The relative weightings of each element of the 
annual bonus are fixed for each of the Executive 
Directors, in the interests of simplicity and to encourage 
executive management to operate as a team. The 
relative weightings for 2011, as in 2010, will be as 
follows:
• Financial objectives: 40%
• Strategic objectives: 30%
• 1-year relative TSR: 20%
• HSE: 10%
Long-term incentive arrangements
The Company currently operates two long-term 
incentive plans, the 2010 Discretionary Share Option 
Scheme and the 2010 Performance Share Plan. The 
Committee feels that a balance of nil cost and market 
value options provides the most appropriate mix of pay 
for the most senior executives. The maximum market 
value of shares that may be granted in any financial year 
under the DSOS and under the JKX Oil & Gas 2010 
Performance Share Plan shall not exceed three times 
basic salary for any executive.
JKX Oil & Gas plc 2010 Discretionary Share Option 
Scheme (“DSOS”)
The normal maximum grant of Options in any financial 
year under the DSOS is 100% of basic salary. In 
exceptional circumstances the Committee has the 
discretion to grant options with a face value of up to 
200% of basic salary. Maximum award opportunities in 
2011 under the DSOS will be 100% of base salary for the 
CEO and FD and 80% of base salary for the Technical 
and Commercial Directors.
Options vest at the end of a 3-year performance period, 
subject to achievement of 3-year Earnings per Share 
(“EPS”) growth targets. The Committee considers EPS 
to be an appropriate measure, since it is the primary 
internal benchmark of long-term financial performance 
and promotes alignment between management and the 
Company’s shareholders.

* Pre-exceptional items  The performance targets for the 2010 and 2011 cycles 
require 3-year nominal EPS growth of 22.5% p.a. for 
maximum vesting with threshold vesting (25% of an 
award) at 7.5% p.a. (and on a straight-line basis in 
between these points). The performance targets are 
reviewed on an annual basis at the start of each 3-year 
performance cycle to ensure their continued 
appropriateness.
JKX Oil & Gas plc 2010 Performance Share Plan 
(“PSP”)
The normal maximum award of Nil-cost Options in any 
financial year under the PSP is 100% of a participant’s 
basic salary. In exceptional circumstances the 
Committee has the discretion to make awards of up to 
200% of a participant’s basic salary. Maximum award 
opportunities in 2011 will be 100% of salary for the CEO 
and FD and 80% of salary for the Technical and 
Commercial Directors.
PSP awards vest based on 3-year TSR performance 
relative to the FTSE 250 and FTSE All-Share Oil & Gas 
Producers indices (with half of the award being assessed 
against each index). Each part of the award will be based 
on performance relative to the relevant index, with 25% 
vesting for performance in line with the index. Vesting 
would increase on a straight-line basis between 25% 
and 100% for index out-performance of up to 10% p.a. 
Historically this has been broadly equivalent to upper 
quartile performance. In addition, the Committee must 
be satisfied that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection 
of the underlying performance of the Company over the 
performance period.
The Committee considers the use of TSR to be 
appropriate since it is dependent on the Company’s 
relative long-term share price performance and 
therefore provides strong alignment with the interests 
of the Company’s shareholders. TSR performance is 
measured using percentage out-performance rather 
than a ranking approach since it is less sensitive to the 
TSR of individual comparators, and uses a 12-month 
averaging period due to the volatility of the Company’s 
share price and the long-term nature of the Company’s 
investments. Whilst noting market practice is typically to 
use a shorter averaging period, the Committee feel that 
12-month averaging would give a fairer result for both 
management and shareholders. There is no re-testing of 
performance targets.
Legacy Share Option Schemes
At the time of implementation in 2001, the HM Revenue 
& Customs (“HMRC”) Approved JKX Oil & Gas plc 
Discretionary Share Option Scheme 2001 (“Approved 
Scheme”) and the Unapproved JKX Oil & Gas 
Discretionary Share Option Scheme 2001 (“Unapproved 
Scheme”) (together, the “2001 Share Option Schemes”) 
reflected the best practice aspects recommended by the 
ABI Guidelines at that time. Following the introduction of 
new plans in 2010, no further awards will be made under 
the 2001 Share Option Schemes.
The Committee has discretion as to the application of 
the Rules of the Share Option Schemes, and in the event 
of a change of control, the Committee retains discretion 
to determine the treatment of unvested options.
Options vest based on 3-year share price performance 
both in absolute terms and relative to external 
benchmarks. The Committee considers that comparison 
against the FTSE Index in which the Company is a 
constituent at the time of the grant and against the FTSE 
All-Share Oil & Gas Producers Index is the most 
appropriate external benchmark. 
For options granted between 2006 and 2009, the number 
of options that vest and therefore can be subsequently 
exercised is determined by two factors: (1) the actual 
increase in the Company’s share price; and (2) a 
comparison of the actual increase in the Company’s

share price to the higher of the change in the FTSE 
250 and the FTSE All-Share Oil & Gas Producers Index. 
The performance conditions are summarised in 
Table 9 above.
The Company’s share price and FTSE Index factors are 
multiplied together and the resultant figure is applied to 
the number of options granted to an individual to 
determine the number of options that vest.
The structure was designed to introduce a sliding scale 
as distinct from a specific individual benchmark. It 
requires the Company’s share price to double and for 
this increase to be in the top quartile of the growth in the 
higher of the FTSE 250 and FTSE All-Share Oil & Gas 
Producers Index for all of the options to vest. 
To encourage the retention of key staff, the Committee 
has determined that an option holder will be able to 
exercise up to 50% of vested options immediately 
following vesting and the remaining vested options only 
after a period of 12 months from vesting, unless 
otherwise determined by the Committee. 
100% of all share options awards made in 2006, 2007 
and 2008 lapsed in 2009, 2010, and 2011 respectively due 
to the failure to meet the above vesting conditions.
Dilution
In any ten year period, the number of Shares which 
may be placed under Option, or issued under any 
discretionary employees’ share scheme adopted by the 
Company, may not exceed five per cent; and under any 
other employees’ share scheme adopted by the 
Company, may not exceed ten per cent of the Company’s 
ordinary share capital in issue immediately prior to that 
date.
Share ownership guideline
In 2010, the Committee introduced executive share 
ownership guidelines of 1 times salary for Executive 
Directors. Details of the directors’ personal 
shareholdings are shown on page 53.
Historical TSR performance
Figure 10 overleaf shows the Total Shareholder Return 
for a holding in the Company’s shares for the period 
from 31st December 2005 to 31st December 2010 
relative to a holding of shares representing each of the 
FTSE 250 and FTSE All-Share Oil & Gas Producers 
indices, and was prepared by Kepler. The calculation of 
the return assumes dividends are reinvested to purchase 
additional equity. An investment of £100 in the Company 
on 31st December 2005 was worth £135.63 at 31st 
December 2010. 
Pension arrangements
The Company makes a contribution equivalent to 15% of 
basic salary to the pension scheme of the Director’s 
choice. All Executive Directors choose to participate in 
the Company’s defined contribution scheme.
Directors’ contracts
It is the Group’s policy that service contracts for the 
Executive Directors be unlimited in term and capable in 
normal circumstances of termination on 12 months’ 
notice. In the event of early termination, the Directors’ 
contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum 
level of basic salary for the notice period. The Directors’ 
contracts of service that include details of remuneration 
will be available for inspection at the Annual General 
Meeting. 
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments 
outside the Company providing that the Chairman’s 
permission is sought and granted.
External board appointments
The Committee considers that external directorships 
provide the Company’s senior executives with valuable

Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of 
engagement and their remuneration is determined by 
the Board within the limits set by the Articles of 
Association and based on independent surveys of fees 
paid to Non-Executive Directors of similar companies. 
The setting of the Chairman’s remuneration is the 
responsibility of the Board and not the Committee, 
as recommended by Section B.2.2 of the Combined 
Code. The Board believes this is appropriate given 
the Board size.
These service contracts are for an indefinite term, not a 
finite term as recommended by Section A.7.2 of the 
Combined Code, subject to re-election on an as required 
basis. The Board continues to believe these terms are 
appropriate given the Company size, the Non-Executive

Non-Executive Directors’ contracts provide for

The Non-Executive Directors’ contracts specify the 
powers and duties of the Non-Executive Directors, the 
time commitments anticipated and remuneration 
arrangements. The Non-Executive Directors are paid a 
base fee for carrying out their duties and responsibilities 
as Directors, and fees for membership and, where 
applicable, chairmanship of each of the remuneration 
and audit committees. The base fee is based on a per 
annum rate (in Sterling) that is compared to published 
material concerning Non-Executive Director fees in 
similar size companies and comparable companies in 
the sector.
In 2010, the total fees paid to each Non-Executive 
Director in the year are shown below. The fees include 
compensation for performing the additional roles in 
respect of the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the 
Company’s share schemes and are not eligible to join 
the Company’s pension scheme.
Sir Ian Prosser succeeded Lord Fraser as Chairman in

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report and the group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the directors have prepared the group 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the group and of the profit or loss of 
the group for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
•  prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the group and enable them to ensure that the group 
financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are 
listed in the Directors’ Report confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge:
•  the group financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the group; and
•  the directors’ report contained in the Annual Report 
includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the 
group, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.
The directors in office at the date of this report have 
each confirmed that:
•  so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
•  he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a director to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the members 
of JKX Oil & Gas plc
We have audited the group financial statements of JKX 
Oil & Gas plc for the year ended 31st December 2010 
which comprise the consolidated income statement, 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash 
flow statement and the related notes. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and 
auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on page 70, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
group financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared 
for and only for the company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in 
writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the group financial statements: 
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s 
affairs as at 31st December 2010 and of its profit and 
cash flows for the year then ended; 
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
•  have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the group 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit;
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
•  the directors’ statement, set out on page 59, in 
relation to going concern; 
•  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the June 2008 Combined Code specified 
for our review; and
•  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the 
Board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company 
financial statements of JKX Oil & Gas plc for the year 
ended 31st December 2010 and on the information in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described 
as having been audited.

Notes:
(a) The maintenance and integrity of the JKX Oil & Gas plc 
website is the responsibility of the directors; the work 
carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of 
these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no 
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the 
financial statements since they were initially presented on 
the website.
(b) Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 72 Group accounts

Consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement
for the year ended 31st December 76 Group accounts
1.  Authorisation of financial statements, 
statement of compliance with IFRS and basis of 
preparation
JKX Oil & Gas plc (the ultimate parent of the Group 
hereafter, “the Company”) is a public limited company 
listed on the London Stock Exchange which is 
domiciled and incorporated in England. The registered 
office is 6 Cavendish Square, London, W1G 0PD and 
the principal place of business is disclosed in the 
introduction to the Annual Report. The principal 
activities of the Company and its subsidiaries, (the 
“Group”), are the exploration for, appraisal and 
development of oil and gas reserves. The registered 
number of the Company is 03050645.
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable for Companies reporting under 
IFRS. The principal accounting policies adopted by the 
Group are set out below. The disclosed policies have 
been applied consistently by the Group for both the 
current and previous financial year with the exception 
of the new standards adopted.
The financial information has been prepared on a 
going concern basis following review by the directors 
of forecast cash flows for the next 12 months, 
including consideration of the ability of the Group to 
change the timing and scale of capital expenditure, 
if required. The going concern base case adopted 
by the Directors assumes first production in Russia 
in autumn 2011. In making their assessment the 
Directors have considered sensitivities to their 
forecast cash flows including reducing forecast oil and 
gas realizations, increasing costs and deferring the 
date of first production in Russia to early 2012. 
2.  Adoption of new and revised International 
Financial Reporting Standards
The following new standards and amendments to 
standards are mandatory for the first time for the 
financial year beginning 1st January 2010 and have 
been adopted by the Group:
 − IAS 7 (amendment), ‘Statement of cash flows’. The 
amendment clarifies that only expenditures that 
result in the recognition of an asset can be classified 
as a cash flow from investing activities.
 − IAS 36 (amendment), ‘Impairment of assets’, 
effective 1st January 2010. The amendment clarifies 
that the largest cash-generating unit (or group of 
units) to which goodwill should be allocated for the 
purposes of impairment testing is an operating 
segment, as defined by paragraph 5 of IFRS 8, ‘ 
Operating segments’ (that is, before the aggregation 
of segments with similar economic characteristics).”
The following new and amended standards, and 
interpretations are mandatory for the first time for 
the financial year beginning 1st January 2010 but not 
currently relevant to the Group.
 − IAS 1 (amendment), ‘Presentation of 
financial statements’
 − IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’, and 
consequential amendments to IAS 27 and IAS 38, 
‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’
 − IFRS 5 (amendment), ‘Non-current assets held for
 sale and discontinued operations’
 − IAS 17 (amendment), ‘Leases’
 − IAS 39 (amendment), ‘Financial instruments: 
recognition and measurement’
 − IFRS 1 (amendment), ‘Additional exemptions for 
first-time adopters’
 − IFRS 2 (amendment), ‘Group cash-settled share-
based payment transaction’
 − IFRS 6, ‘Exploration for and evaluation of 
mineral resources’
 − IFRS 8 (amendment), ‘Operating segments’
 − IFRIC 9, ‘Reassessment of embedded derivatives’
 − IFRIC 16, ‘Hedges of a net investment in a 
foreign operation’ 
 − IFRIC 17, ‘Distributions of non-cash assets 
to owners’
 − IFRIC 18, ‘Transfers of assets from customers’
 − Eligible Hedged Items (an amendment to 
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement)
The following new standards, amendments and 
interpretations are issued but not effective for the 
financial year beginning 1st January 2010 and the 
Group has not early adopted them.
 − IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’
 − IAS 24 (revised), ‘Related party disclosures’ 
 − IAS 32 (amendment), ‘Classification of rights issues’ 
 − IFRIC 14 (amendment), ‘Prepayments of a minimum 
funding requirement’
 − IFRIC 19, ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with 
equity instruments’
 − IFRS 1 (amendment), ‘First-time adoption of 
international financial reporting standards’ 
 − Improvements to International Financial Reporting 
Standards 2010 were issued in July 2010 and 
January 2011. The effective dates vary standard by 
standard but most are effective 1st January 2011
Notes to the accounts 77 JKX Oil & Gas plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2010
The Group is evaluating the impact of the above 
pronouncements. The above changes are not 
expected to be material to the Group’s earnings or to 
shareholders’ funds.
3.  Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate 
the financial statements of the Company and entities 
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up 
to 31st December each year. All intragroup balances, 
transactions, income and expenses and profits or 
losses, including unrealised profits arising from 
intragroup transactions, have been eliminated on 
consolidation. 
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies in 
order to obtain benefits from their activities. Control is 
presumed to exist where the Group owns more than one 
half of the voting rights (which does not always equate to 
percentage ownership) unless it can be demonstrated 
that ownership does not constitute control. Control 
does not exist where other parties hold veto rights 
over significant operating and financial decisions. 
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are taken into 
account. The consolidated financial statements include 
all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash 
flows of the Companies and their subsidiaries after 
eliminating intragroup transactions as noted above. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on 
which control is transferred to the group. They are de-
consolidated from the date that control ceases. Uniform 
accounting policies are applied across the group.
Jointly controlled entities (‘JCEs’) are a joint venture 
that involves the establishment of a corporation, 
partnership or other entity in which each venturer has 
a long term interest. JCEs are accounted for using 
the proportional consolidation method. The Group 
combines its share of the joint venture’s individual 
income and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash 
flows on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the 
Group’s financial statements.
Foreign currencies
The presentation currency of the Group is the US 
Dollar based on the fact that the Group’s primary 
transactions originate in, or are dictated by, the US 
Dollar, these being amongst others oil sales and 
procurement of rigs and drilling services.
Each entity in the group is measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). 
Foreign currency transactions are translated 
into functional currency using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation 
where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of 
such transactions and from translation at year-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in 
the income statement. 
On consolidation of subsidiaries and JCEs with a non 
US Dollar presentation currency, balance sheets 
are translated into US Dollar at the closing rate and 
income and expenses at the average monthly rate. All 
resulting exchange differences arising in the period 
are recognised in other comprehensive income, and 
cumulatively in the Group’s translation reserve. Such 
translation differences are reclassified to profit or loss 
in the period in which any such foreign operation is 
disposed of.
Subsidiaries within the Group hold monetary 
intercompany balances for which settlement is neither 
planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future 
and thus this is considered to be part of the Group’s 
net investment in the relevant subsidiary. An exchange 
difference arises on translation in the company income 
statement which on consolidation is recognised in 
equity, only being recognised in the income statement 
on the disposal of the net investment.
The major exchange rates used for the revaluation of 
the closing balance sheet at 31st December 2010 were 
1$/£0.6 (2009: 1$/£0.6), $1/UAH 8.1 (2009: $1/UAH 8.0), 
$1/RUB 31.2 (2009: $1/RUB 30.2), $1/HUF 204.8 (2009: 
1$/HUF 179.6), 1$/BGN 1.4 (2009: 1$/BGN 1.3).
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
acquisition are treated as assets/liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property plant and equipment comprises the Group’s 
tangible oil and gas assets together with computer 
equipment, motor vehicles and other equipment and 
are carried at cost, less any accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes 
purchase price and construction costs for qualifying 
assets, together with borrowing costs where 
applicable, in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policy. Depreciation of these assets commences when 
the assets are ready for their intended use.
Oil and gas assets
Exploration, appraisal and development expenditure is 
accounted for under the ‘successful efforts’ method. 
The successful efforts method means that only costs 
which relate directly to the discovery and development 
of specific oil and gas reserves are capitalised.
Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised 
within intangible assets. Development expenditure on 
producing assets is accounted for in accordance with 
IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’. Costs incurred 
prior to obtaining legal rights to explore are expensed 
immediately to the income statement. 78 Group accounts
All lease and licence acquisition costs, geological 
and geophysical costs and other direct costs 
of exploration, evaluation and development are 
capitalised as intangible assets or property plant 
and equipment according to their nature. Intangible 
assets comprise costs relating to the exploration and 
evaluation of properties which the directors consider 
to be unevaluated until reserves are appraised as 
commercial, at which time they are transferred to 
property plant and equipment following an impairment 
review and depreciated accordingly. Where properties 
are appraised to have no commercial value, the 
associated costs are treated as an impairment loss in 
the period in which the determination is made.
Costs are depreciated on a field by field unit of 
production method based on commercial proved plus 
probable reserves of the production licence, with the 
exception of compressors, which are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over their anticipated useful life of 
10 years.
The calculation of the ‘unit of production’ depreciation 
takes account of estimated future development costs 
and is based on current period end unescalated price 
levels. Changes in reserves and cost estimates are 
recognised prospectively.
Other assets
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less 
estimated residual value, over their estimated useful 
lives, using the straight-line method, for the following 
classes of assets;
Motor vehicles –  4 years
Computer equipment –  3 years
Other equipment  –  5 to 10 years
The estimated useful lives of property plant and 
equipment and their residual values are reviewed on 
an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful 
lives are accounted for prospectively.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement 
of an asset is determined as the difference between 
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognised in the income statement for 
the relevant period.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
purchase method.
Acquisition cost is measured as the fair value of 
the assets given, equity instruments issued and 
liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Acquisition costs are expensed. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is initially 
measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s share in the 
net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. 
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly 
controlled entity, the attributable amount of 
unamortised goodwill, which has not been subject to 
impairment, is included in the determination of the 
profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment of intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets 
have suffered an impairment loss. Individual assets 
are grouped together as a cash-generating unit for 
impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level 
at which their identifiable cash flows, that are largely 
independent of the cash flows of the other groups 
assets, can be determined. 
If any such indication of impairment exists the Group 
makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use. Where the carrying 
amount of an individual asset or a cash-generating 
unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset/cash-
generating unit is considered impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. Fair value less costs 
to sell is determined by discounting the post tax cash 
flows expected to be generated by the cash generating 
unit, net of associated selling costs, and takes into 
account assumptions, market participants would use 
in estimating fair value. In assessing the value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the 
risks specific to the asset/cash generating unit and 
are discounted to their present value that reflects the 
current market indicators.
Excluding goodwill, where an impairment loss 
subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the 
asset/cash-generating unit is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
(cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an 
impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Financial instruments
The Group may use derivative financial instruments 
(primarily foreign currency forward contracts) to 
hedge its risks associated with foreign currency 
Notes to the accounts – continued 79 JKX Oil & Gas plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2010
fluctuations relating to certain firm commitments 
and forecasted transactions. Any such derivatives 
are initially recorded at fair value on the date at which 
the contract is entered into and subsequently re-
measured at fair value on subsequent reporting dates.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, 
where applicable, direct labour costs plus attributable 
overheads based on a normal level of activity and 
other costs associated in bringing the inventories to 
their present location and condition. Cost is calculated 
using the weighted average method. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price less 
all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution and any 
provisions for obsolescence.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value 
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
reduced by any provision for impairment. A provision 
for impairment of trade receivables is established 
when there is objective evidence that the Group will 
not be able to collect all amounts due. Indicators of 
impairment would include financial difficulties of the 
debtor, likelihood of the debtor’s insolvency, default 
in payment or a significant deterioration in credit 
worthiness. Any impairment is recognised in the 
income statement within ‘net operating costs’.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand 
and current balances with banks and similar 
institutions, which are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash. Cash equivalents are short-term 
with an original maturity of less than 3 months, highly 
liquid investments that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
Treasury shares
JKX Oil & Gas plc treasury shares held by the 
Company are classified in shareholders’ equity. The 
consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable 
to the Company’s equity holders until the shares 
are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are 
subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration 
received, net of transaction costs, is included in equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders. No gain 
or loss is recognised in the financial statements on 
the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of treasury 
shares.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using 
the effective interest rate method if the time value of 
money is significant.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current 
tax payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit 
for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit 
as reported in the income statement because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s 
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or 
recoverable on differences between the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax base used in the 
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises 
from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries, and interests in joint ventures, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of 
the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to be recovered. Any such reduction shall be reversed 
to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
settled or the asset realised based on tax rates and 
laws substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in equity. 80 Group accounts
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when 
there exists a legal and enforceable right to offset and 
they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) 
held- for-sale 
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified 
as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is 
to be recovered principally through a sale transaction 
and a sale is considered highly probable. They are 
stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be 
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use. 
Segmental reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker. The Chief 
Operating Decision-Maker, who is responsible for 
allocating resources and assessing performance 
of the operating segments, has been identified as 
the executive directors of the Group that make the 
strategic decisions.
Share options
The Group issues equity-settled share-based 
payments to the directors and senior management. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of the 
employee services received in exchange for the grant 
of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest. At each subsequent 
balance sheet date the Group calculates the estimated 
cumulative charge for each award having regard to 
any change in the number of options that are expected 
to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. 
The change in this cumulative charge since the last 
balance sheet date is expensed. Once an option vests, 
no further adjustment is made to the aggregate 
amount expensed. The expected life of the options 
depends on the behaviour of the option holders, which 
is incorporated into the option model consistent with 
historic data. The fair values calculated are inherently 
subjective and uncertain due to the assumptions made 
and the limitations of the model used.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital 
(nominal value of 10p per share) and share premium 
when the options are exercised.
The rules regarding the scheme are described in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 63 to 66 and 
in note 20 on share-based payments.
Bonus scheme
The Group operates a bonus scheme for its Directors 
and employees. The scheme has four performance 
conditions: 1. financial objectives; 2. increase in 
share price; 3. key strategic objectives and 4. safety 
performance conditions. The bonus payments are 
made annually, normally in January of each year and 
the costs are accrued in the period to which they 
relate.
Pension costs
The Group contributes to the individual pension 
scheme of the qualifying employees’ choice. 
Contributions are charged to the income statement 
as they become payable. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have 
been paid.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a 
present obligation as a result of a past event, and it 
is probable that the Group will be required to settle 
that obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and 
are discounted to present value where the effect is 
material.
Decommissioning
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning 
assets at the time when the obligation to 
decommission arises. Such provision represents 
the estimated discounted liability (the discount rate 
used currently being at 10%, (2009: 10%)) for costs 
which are expected to be incurred in removing 
production facilities and site restoration at the end of 
the producing life of each field. A corresponding item 
of property plant and equipment is also created at an 
amount equal to the provision. This is subsequently 
depreciated as part of the capital costs of the 
production facilities. Any change in the present value 
of the estimated expenditure attributable to changes 
in the estimates of the cash flow or the current 
estimate of the discount rate used are reflected as 
an adjustment to the provision and the property plant 
and equipment. The unwinding of the discount is 
recognised as a finance cost.
Revenue recognition
Sales of oil and gas products are recognised when 
the significant risks and rewards of ownership have 
passed to the buyer and it can be reliably measured. 
Other services are recognised when the services have 
been performed. Revenue is measured at the fair value 
of the consideration received, excluding discounts, 
rebates, value added tax (“VAT”) and other sales taxes 
or duty.
Notes to the accounts – continued 81 JKX Oil & Gas plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2010
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, 
by reference to the net carrying amount at the effective 
interest rate applicable.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental 
costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary 
shares are recognised as a deduction from share 
premium, net of any tax effects. When share capital 
recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the 
consideration paid, which includes directly attributable 
costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a 
deduction from share premium. Repurchased shares 
are classified as treasury shares and are presented in 
the reserve for own shares. When treasury shares are 
sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is 
recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting 
surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in 
share premium.
Leasing
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the relevant lease. The group has no 
finance leases.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid 
to the Company’s shareholders. Final dividends are 
recognised when they are approved by shareholders. 
Interests in joint venture agreements
The Group is party to a number of joint venture 
contractual arrangements with other parties 
(venturers) which govern the operation of associated 
jointly controlled assets.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby 
the Group and other parties undertake an economic 
activity that is subject to joint control. Joint control 
exists only when the strategic financial and operating 
decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous 
consent of the venturers.
Where a group company undertakes its activities 
under joint venture arrangements, the Group’s share 
of any assets and liabilities incurred jointly with other 
ventures are recognised and classified according 
to their nature. Income from the sale or use of the 
Group’s share of the output of jointly controlled assets, 
and its share of joint venture expenses, are included in 
the consolidated financial statements in proportion to 
the Group’s interest.
Exceptional item 
Exceptional items comprise items of income and 
expense, including tax items, that are material in 
amount and unlikely to recur and which merit separate 
disclosure in order to provide an understanding of the 
Group’s underlying financial performance. Examples 
of events giving rise to the disclosure of material items 
of income and expense as exceptional items include, 
but are not limited to, impairment events, disposals 
of operations or individual assets, litigation claims 
by or against the Group and the restructuring of 
components of the Group’s operations. See note 5(e) 
for further details.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions 
concerning the future. The resulting accounting 
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related 
actual results. The estimates and assumptions that 
have a risk of causing material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year are discussed below.
(a) Recoverability of tangible and intangible oil and 
gas costs
Costs capitalised as tangible and intangible assets are 
assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest 
that the carrying value may exceed its recoverable 
value. This assessment involves judgement as to 
(i) the likely commerciality of the asset, (ii) future 
revenues and costs pertaining to the asset, (iii) the 
discount rate to be applied for the purposes of deriving 
a recoverable value and (iv) the value ascribed to 
contingent resources associated with the asset. 
Further disclosure is included in note 5.
(b) Decommissioning
The Group has decommissioning obligations in 
respect of its producing interests. The full extent to 
which the provision is required depends on the legal 
requirements at the time of decommissioning, the 
costs and timing of any decommissioning works and 
the discount rate applied to such costs. 
(c) Depreciation of oil and gas assets
Oil and gas assets held in property, plant and 
equipment are mainly depreciated on a unit of 
production basis at a rate calculated by reference to 
proved plus probable reserves and incorporating the 
estimated future cost of developing and extracting 
those reserves. Future development costs are 
estimated using assumptions as to the numbers of 
wells required to produce those reserves, the cost of 
the wells, future production facilities and operating 
costs; together with assumptions on oil and gas 
realisations. 
(d) Taxation
Tax provisions are recognised when it is considered 
probable that there will be a future outflow of funds 
to the tax authorities. In this case, provision is made 
for the amount that is expected to be settled. This 
requires judgements to be made on the outcome, 
which can change over time depending on facts and 
circumstances. A change in estimate of the likelihood  82 Group accounts
of a future outflow and/or in the expected amount to be 
settled would result in a charge or credit to income in 
the period in which the change occurs. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
it is considered probable that those assets will be 
recoverable. This involves an assessment of when 
those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a 
judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient 
taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when 
they do reverse. This requires assumptions regarding 
future profitability and is therefore inherently 
uncertain. To the extent assumptions regarding future 
profitability change, there can be an increase or 
decrease in the level of deferred tax assets recognised 
that can result in a charge or credit in the period in 
which the change occurs. Tax provisions are based on 
enacted or substantively enacted laws. To the extent 
that these change there would be a charge or credit 
to income both in the period of charge, which would 
include any impact on cumulative provisions, and in 
future periods. Further disclosure is included in 
note 22.
4.  Segmental analysis
Segmental information
Reportable operating segments are based on the 
internal reports provided to the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (“CODM”) to evaluate segment 
performance, decide how to allocate resources and 
make other operating decisions. The Group has one 
single class of business, being the exploration for, 
development and production of oil and gas reserves. 
Accordingly the reportable operating segments are 
determined by the geographical location of the asset.
There are five reportable operating segments. The 
Ukraine and Hungary are involved with production and 
exploration; Russia and the ‘Rest of World’ are involved 
in exploration and development and the UK is the 
home of the head office and purchases material capital 
assets and services on behalf of other segments. The 
‘Rest of the World’ segment comprises operations 
in Bulgaria, Georgia and Slovakia. Transfer prices 
between segments are set on an arms length basis in 
a manner similar to transactions with third parties. 
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment 
results include transfers between segments. Those 
transfers are eliminated on consolidation. 
Segment results and assets include items directly 
attributable to the segment. Segment assets consist 
primarily of property, plant and equipment, inventories 
and receivables. Capital expenditures comprise 
additions to property, plant and equipment.

5.(d)  Impairment test for property, plant and equipment and goodwill
A review was undertaken at the balance sheet date of the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and 
goodwill to determine whether there was any indication of triggers that may have led to these assets suffering 
an impairment loss. Following this review impairment triggers were noted in relation to Yuzhgazenergie (YGE) in 
Russia and Poltava Petroleum Company (PPC) in Ukraine. See note 5(e) and 5(f) for the results of the YGE test.
Ukraine
Following the implementation of a new Tax Code in Ukraine effective 1st January 2011, which has resulted in 
rental charges being levied on oil and gas production effective from 1st January 2011 (see note 21), the Group 
determined that this represented an impairment trigger for its Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex. The Novo-
Nikolaevskoye Complex consists of four production licences, Ignatovskoye, Molchanovskoye, Novo-Nikolaevskoye 
and Rudenkovskoye.
An impairment test was therefore undertaken. The test compared the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating 
Unit (CGU), being the Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex for the purpose of the review, to the carrying value of the CGU. 
The estimate of recoverable amount was based on fair value less costs to sell, derived by estimating discounted 
after tax cash flows for the CGU based on estimates that a typical market participant would use in valuing such 
assets. The impairment review has been undertaken in US Dollars. 
The key assumptions used in the impairment tests were:
•   Production profiles: these were based on the latest available 2P reserves (39.1 MMboe), provided by independent 
reserve engineers.
•  Gas prices: these were based on current prices being achieved, escalated for the remainder of 2011 only, in line 
with public statements made by Ukrainian Government officials. The gas price is assumed to increase in line with 
US Dollar inflation after 2011.
• Capital and operating costs: based on development programmes and previous experience.
• Post tax nominal discount rate: 12.2%.
Accordingly the impairment test is dependent upon judgment used in determining such assumptions. 
Having undertaken the review it was concluded that the Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex was not impaired. 
5.(e)  Exceptional item – impairment of Russian assets
Russia
Following the 2007 acquisition of YGE in Russia, a technical and environmental re-evaluation of YGE’s 
Koshekhablskoye gas field re-development was undertaken by the Group. The re-evaluation resulted in a revised 
development plan and production profile. The development plan and production profile have continued to be refined 
since that time. The anticipated cost of the development plan has further increased and first gas sales from the 
project are now expected in Autumn 2011, three years later than originally planned. Anticipated convergence of 
Adygean gas prices to net back European levels is now later than previously expected. The current level of gas 
prices in Russia is lower than those anticipated in March 2010 when an impairment review was last undertaken 
for YGE. The Company considers the reduced gas price and uncertainty about the future rates of increase as 
constituting an impairment trigger in accordance with IAS 36 and accordingly an impairment test was therefore 
undertaken. The test compared the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU), being YGE for the 
purpose of the review, to the carrying value of the CGU including goodwill. The estimate of recoverable amount 
was based on fair value less costs to sell, derived by estimating discounted after tax cash flows for the CGU based 
on estimates that a typical market participant would use in valuing such assets. In accordance with IAS 36, the 
impairment review has been undertaken in Russian Roubles. 
The key assumptions used in the impairment testing were:
•  Production profiles: these were based on the latest available information provided by independent reserve 
engineers, such information including 2P reserves (44.8 MMboe), 3P and contingent resources.
•  Economic life of field: it is assumed YGE will be successful in extending the licence term beyond its current 2026 
expiration to the economic life of the field (expected to be around 2032).
•  Gas prices: these were based on the Russian government’s intention to achieve net-back convergence with the 
European gas markets, which the Group has assumed as occurring in 2017 (2009: 2015), which is consistent with  90 Group accounts
views expressed by many market commentators. The gas price is assumed to increase in line with US Dollar 
inflation after 2017 (2009: 2015).
• Capital and operating costs: these were based on project estimates provided by third parties.
•  Post tax nominal Rouble discount rate of 13.5% (2009: 15.9%). This was based on a Capital Asset Pricing Model 
analysis consistent with that used in previous impairment reviews.
No value was attributed to 3P and contingent resources.
Accordingly the impairment test is dependent upon judgment used in determining such assumptions. 
The changes in the key assumptions used from previous periods has resulted in the asset being impaired by 
$74.6m consisting of goodwill of $2.0m and property, plant and equipment of $72.6m. The main driver of the 
impairment has been the lower sales prices anticipated in the early years together with a longer period before net 
back European gas price parity is achieved. The Group has recognised the impairment charge as an exceptional 
charge within the accounts. The associated tax effect on the exceptional charge is a deferred tax credit to the 
income statement of $14.5m.
The impact on the impairment calculation of applying different assumptions to production, gas prices, capital 
expenditure and post-tax discount rates based on 2P reserves, would be as set out below. No value was attributed 
to 3P and contingent resources.

5.(f)  Goodwill 
Goodwill was recognised in 2007 in relation to the Group’s acquisition of Yuzhgazenergie LLC (YGE). The goodwill 
arose after the application of IAS 12 “Income Taxes”, and was attributable principally to expanded growth 
opportunities in Russia. In accordance with IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”, and following the Group’s decision 
that an indication of potential impairment arose in relation to the property, plant and equipment (for reasons more 
fully disclosed in 5(e)) a review for impairment of the related goodwill was undertaken. The carrying amount of 
the goodwill was allocated to the YGE Cash Generating Unit (CGU) as described above. The test compared the 
recoverable amount of the CGU, being YGE for the purpose of the review, to the carrying value of the CGU including 
goodwill. The calculations use the same assumptions as used for property, plant and equipment as more fully 
described in 5(e).

20.  Share-based payments
Share options
Share options are granted to Executive Directors and Senior Management based on performance criteria. The 
scheme rules are described in the Directors Remuneration Report and repeated below. All share-based payments 
are equity settled.
At 31st December 2010, there were outstanding options under various employee share option schemes, exercisable 
during the years 2011 to 2020 (2009: 2010 to 2019), to acquire 2,593,724 (2009: 2,099,551) shares of the Company 
at prices ranging from £0.00 to £4.54 per share (2009: £0.68 to £4.54). The vesting period of the options is 3 years, 
with an exercise period of 7 years, making a 10 year maximum term.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share 
options during the year.

For the share options outstanding as at 31st December 2010, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 
2.8 years (2009: 1.75 years).
During the year share options were granted in accordance with the new share option schemes, the Discretionary 
Share Option Scheme (“DSOS”) and the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”), which were introduced in 2010. They 
reflect the best practice aspects recommended by the Association of British Insurers following the publication of 
their guidelines in March 2001 (the ‘ABI Guidelines’). 
2010 Share Option Schemes
DSOS
The DSOS is made up of two parts. Options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company granted under Part A are 
“Approved Options” and options to acquire Shares granted under Part B of the DSOS are “Unapproved Options”. 
No consideration shall be payable for the grant of an Option. 
675,500 options were granted under DSOS in 2010. The exercise price of options granted under DSOS is 241p. 
For these options to vest there has to be an increase in the Group’s Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) growth over the 
performance period measured over the 3 consecutive calendar years commencing 1st January 2010. The weighted 
average fair value of options granted during the year under the DSOS was 119.3p per option.
PSP
PSP are granted solely to Executive Directors. Subject to shareholder approval at the 2010 AGM, Executive 
Directors will receive awards under the 2010 Performance Share Plan in the form of nil cost options. 
No consideration is required to be paid for the grant or exercise of an Option. 
395,500 options were granted under PSP. The PSP options provide a conditional right to acquire shares at nil cost 
subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions and continued employment with the Group. For these 
options to vest a comparison is performed between the Group’s TSR against the FTSE 250 index (half the options) 
and the All-Share Oil & Gas Producers index (other half of options). The weighted average fair value of options 
granted during the year under the PSP was 130.9p per option.
Notes to the accounts – continued 99 JKX Oil & Gas plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2010
Pre 2010 Share Option Schemes
In 2009, share options were granted in accordance with The New Approved Share Option Scheme and the New 
Unapproved Share Option Scheme (collectively the “2001 Share Option Schemes”) that were introduced in 
2001. They reflect the best practice aspects recommended by the Association of British Insurers following the 
publication of their guidelines in March 2001 (the ‘ABI Guidelines’).
The weighted average fair value of options granted in 2009 under the New Approved Share Option Scheme and the 
New Unapproved Share Option Scheme was 56.90p per option.
Fair value of share options granted
The fair value of options granted under the DSOS is estimated as at the date of grant using a variance of the 
Binomial model, taking into account terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes 
the performance condition related to the Company’s earnings per share directly. No dividends are paid on shares 
under the scheme prior to exercise.
The fair value of options granted under the PSP is estimated as at the date of grant using a variant of the Monte 
Carlo model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes 
the performance condition related to the TSR directly. No dividends are paid on shares under the scheme prior to 
exercise.
The fair value of share options previously granted under the 2001 Share Option Schemes is estimated as at the date 
of grant using a variant of the standard binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the options are granted, which includes the performance condition related to the Company’s share price directly. 
The performance condition based on performance relative to other companies is modeled with a Monte Carlo 
model.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31st December 2010 and 31st December 
2009. The expected future volatility has been determined by reference to the historical volatility.

Bonus scheme
The performance criteria of the Directors and senior employees bonus payments includes a component that 
relates directly to JKX’s share performance over the vesting period and a component which relates to the 
performance of JKX share price in relation to the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index. The full details of the bonus 
performance criteria are explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 63. The bonus accrued 
for 2010 was $0.9m (2009: $1.4m) and was paid in January 2011. 100 Group accounts

Notes to the accounts – continued 101 JKX Oil & Gas plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2010
Factors that may affect future tax charges
A significant proportion of the Group’s income will be generated overseas. Profits made overseas will not be able to 
be offset by costs elsewhere in the Group. This could lead to a higher than expected tax rate for the Group.
Taxation in Ukraine
The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities. Ukrainian tax legislation and 
practice are in a state of continuous development, with new laws coming into effect at times which can conflict with 
others and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and changes which may be applied retrospectively. 
Management’s interpretation of tax legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group may at 
times not coincide with that of the tax authorities. As a result, the tax authorities may challenge transactions and 
the Group may be assessed for additional taxes, penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on 
the Group’s financial position and results of operations. 
Since PPC’s inception in 1994 the Company has operated in a regime where conflicting laws have often existed, 
including in relation to effective taxes on oil and gas production. Various laws and regulations have existed and 
have implied a number of variable rates. 
PPC has at times since 1994 sought clarification of their status regarding a number of production related taxes, 
and has been subject to a number of such taxes, at various rates, which have been paid and accounted for within 
Operating Costs within the Group Income Statement. In late 2009, coinciding with the lead up to the recent 
Presidential election in Ukraine, PPC was subjected to increased operational pressures in several areas, including 
broader taxation. Specifically, application of production related tax pre 2009 has attracted scrutiny.
On 1st January 2010 yet another law came into force in Ukraine in the area of production related tax, the Law of 
Ukraine on “On Rent Charges for Oil, Natural Gas and Gas Condensate” which had been suspended since 2004. 
During 2010 conflicting laws (most particularly the Law of Ukraine on “Amending Certain Legislative Acts of 
Ukraine”) which may be a basis for the Ukrainian Tax Authorities to assert that further production related taxes are 
due from various oil and gas companies, including PPC for periods through to 31st December 2010.
PPC will continue to seek clarification from advisors and the tax authorities concerning rules of calculation and 
payment of various production related taxes for periods through to 31st December 2010. The statutory period of 
limitation in Ukraine for such matters is three years. If PPC was subject to maximum production related taxes 
over the three year period to 31st December 2010, increased production related taxes could have been an amount 
equivalent to approximately twenty percent of Ukraine gross revenues (net of corporate tax savings). In particular, 
the Group considers that the likelihood of additional production related taxes for the period from January 2008 
to December 2008 is remote on the basis of tax audits completed, and the related legal position. The Group also 
believes the possibility of any penalties or interest for any period, to be remote. The Group would exhaustively 
challenge the payment of any further production related taxes (over and above those it has already paid) for 
the period through 31st December 2010. Given the lack of clarity over the legal position, in conjunction with the 
arguments the Group has to defend its position, the Group considers that no payments are likely to be made in the 
next 12 months. Further, the Group has flexibility in relation to capital and other expenditure to mitigate impact of 
any future additional production related payments on the Group’s financial position.
A new tax code became effective in Ukraine on 1st January 2011 replacing most of the previous tax laws. The new 
tax code has removed uncertainty over the applicability of rental fee payment by PPC from 2011 and accordingly 
PPC has been liable to and is paying such fees. The fees are levied on production volumes in accordance with 
a rates schedule which may change from time to time. Such payments will be recorded as a cost of sale and 
therefore be accounted for after revenue and before operating profit.
22.  Deferred tax
A deferred tax liability of $11.5m (2009: $18.4m) arises in respect of PPC’s activities, $nil (2009:$9.6m) in respect of 
Yuzhgaznergie LLC’s activities and $0.5m (2009: $1.4m) in respect of Hungarian activities.
A deferred tax asset of $5.7m (2009: $nil) has been recognised in respect of brought forward UK losses, $7.9m 
(2009: $nil) in respect of Yuzhgaznergie LLC comprising losses and temporary differences. 
No other deferred tax has been recognised. 102 Group accounts

There is no expiry date on the remaining losses. The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current 
tax legislation. 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the unprovided deferred taxation items because it is not 
probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise these deductible temporary differences.
In March 2011, a reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax was announced in the UK Budget. The main rate of 
corporation tax effective from 1st April 2011 will be reduced from 27% to 26%. The impact of the rate reduction is 
not expected to have a material impact on provided and unprovided UK deferred taxation.
In December 2010 a new Ukrainian tax rate was introduced. New tax rates in the Ukraine will be as follows: from 
1st January 2011 to 31st March 2011 – 25%; from 1st April 2011 to 31st December 2011– 23%; in 2012 – 21%; in 
2013 – 19%; after 31st December 2013 – 16%. The deferred tax asset has therefore been recognised with due 
consideration of the tax rate effective on the expected unwinding of those temporary differences.

The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to the ordinary equity holders is based on 
the following data:
 2010 2009 Earnings
 $000 $000
Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share 
(profit for the year attributable to equity holders):  
Before exceptional item 81,256 85,329

Share options 815,147 533,071
Weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share 171,680,730 157,874,862
Earnings before exceptional item of $81,256,000 is calculated from the 2010 earnings of $21,156,000 and adding 
back the exceptional item of $74,600,000 less the related deferred tax on the exceptional item of $14,500,000.
There were 2,593,724 (2009: 2,099,551) outstanding share options at 31st December 2010, of which 744,988 
(2009: 360,969) have a dilutive effect.

In respect of the full year 2010, the directors propose that a final dividend of 2.6 pence per share (2009: 2.7 pence 
per share) be paid to shareholders on 24th June 2011. The total estimated dividend to be paid is $7.2m (2009: $7.1m). 
This dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting .

28.  Joint ventures 
In 2010, the Group acquired 50% of the share capital of Horizon Nyirseg Kft (HNY), a Hungarian registered company 
set up for the purpose of holding the Nyirseg licence. JKX had previously funded the exploration and appraisal of its 
33.3% license interest through its contribution to joint venture assets since farming into the licence in 2008. During 
2010 the Group increased its effective interest from 33.3% to 50%. With the formation of the new joint venture entity 
in 2010, the Group’s accounting treatment changed from a jointly controlled asset to a jointly controlled entity. 
The results of HNY have been proportionally consolidated.
On 20th January 2009, the Group acquired 50% of the share capital of HHE North Kft (HHN), a Hungarian registered 
company set up for the purpose of holding the Hernad I and Hernad II licences. JKX had previously funded the 
exploration and appraisal of its 50% interest through their contribution to joint venture assets since farming into 
the licences in December 2007. With the formation of the new joint venture entity and JKX’s formal registration 
of shares in HHN in January 2009, the Group’s accounting treatment changed from a jointly controlled asset to a 
jointly controlled entity. The results of HHN have been proportionally consolidated.
The following amounts represent the Group’s 50 percent share of the revenue and expenses and assets and 
liabilities of HNY and HHN for the years ended 31st December 2009 and 2010.

29.  Ukrainian and Russian business environment
Ukraine and Russia display emerging market characteristics, and the legislation and business practices regarding 
banking operations, foreign currency transactions and taxation are constantly evolving as the governments 
attempt to manage the economies. Risks inherent in conducting business in an emerging market economy 
include, but are not limited to, volatility in the financial markets and the general economy. Uncertainties over the 
development of the tax and legal environment, as well as difficulties associated with the consistent interpretation 
and application of current laws and regulations, have continued. As at 31st December 2010, oil and gas assets 
based in Ukraine and Russia represent approximately 45% (2009: 54%) and 49% (2009: 36%) respectively of the 
Group’s oil and gas assets.
The Group’s operations and financial position may be affected by these uncertainties. The Group’s financial 
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability, and 
classification of assets or the amounts or classifications of liabilities that may result from these uncertainties.
30.  Post balance sheet events
On 31st March 2011, PPC entered into a reducing credit facility agreement with Credit Agricule CIB (France) 
secured by indemnity provided by the parent company, JKX Oil & Gas plc. The credit facility is for a maximum of 
Ukrainian Hryvnia equivalent of USD15.0m, reducing to USD5.0m which will be available until 31st December 
2011. All provisions contained in the credit facility documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial 
and customary terms for such finance arrangements. When drawn, interest will be calculated at prevailing Credit 
Agricule CIB (France) bank rate plus a margin. JKX Oil & Gas plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2010 107

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the directors have prepared the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). Under company law the directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss 
of the company and for that period.  In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards 
have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company financial statements;
•  prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The directors in office at the date of this report have 
each confirmed that:
•  so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
•  he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
as a director to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the members 
of JKX Oil & Gas plc
We have audited the parent company financial 
statements of JKX Oil & Gas plc for the year ended 
31st December 2010 which comprise Company balance 
sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and 
auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement set out on page 108, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
parent company financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared 
for and only for the company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in 
writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial 
statements: 
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s 
affairs as at 31st December 2010;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and 
•  have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and 
•  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the parent company financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept 
by the parent company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or 
•  the parent company financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or 
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the group financial 
statements of JKX Oil & Gas plc for the year ended 
31st December 2010.

(a) The maintenance and integrity of the JKX Oil & Gas plc 
website is the responsibility of the directors; the work 
carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of 
these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no 
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the 
financial statements since they were initially presented on 
the website.

Notes to the Company accounts
A.  Presentation of the financial statements
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable UK accounting standards 
and the UK Companies Act 2006. The Directors 
have reviewed the Company’s existing accounting 
policies and consider that they are consistent with the 
requirements of Financial Reporting Standard (‘FRS’) 
18 ‘Accounting Policies’. 
The Company’s accounting policies are consistent with 
last year.
The financial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis following a review by the directors 
of forecast cash flows for the next 12 months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements. In making 
their assessment the directors have considered 
sensitivities to their forecast cash flows from 
investments, including reducing forecast oil and gas 
realisations, increasing costs and deferring the date of 
first production in Russia.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially 
recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Exchange differences arising on the 
translation of monetary items are taken to the profit 
and loss account. Non-monetary items are measured 
in terms of historical cost in foreign currency and are 
translated using the exchange rates of the original 
transaction.
The presentation and functional currency of the 
Company is the US Dollar.
Investments
Investments are initially measured at historic cost, 
including transaction costs, and stated at cost 
less impairment losses. The Company assesses 
investments for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any 
such indication of impairment exists, the Company 
makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where 
the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the investment is considered 
impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based 
payments to the Directors and senior management. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value in the 
Group is determined at the grant date of the equity-
settled share-based payments and is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually 
vest. At each subsequent balance sheet date the 
Company calculates the estimated cumulative 
charge for each award having regard to any change 
in the number of options that are expected to vest 
and the expired portion of the vesting period. The 
movement in cumulative expense since the previous 
balance sheet date relating to awards for services 
to subsidiaries is expensed in the income statement 
of those subsidiaries. Once an option vests, no 
further adjustment is made to the aggregate amount 
expensed. The corresponding entry is shown in equity 
in the Company. The fair value which is calculated 
using the binomial model takes into account two 
performance criteria, being the actual increase in the 
Company’s share price and a comparison of the actual 
increase in the share price to the change in FTSE FI 
until the end of June 2004, the FTSE SI until the end 
of February 2006 and the higher of the FTSE 250I and 
the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index subsequent to 
that. The expected life of the options depends on the 
behaviour of the option holders, which is incorporated 
into the option model consistent with historic data.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid 
to the Company’s shareholders. Final dividends are 
recognised when they are approved by shareholders.
Treasury shares
The consideration paid for shares repurchased by the 
Company and held as treasury shares is recognised 
as a reduction in shareholders’ funds through the 
profit and loss account reserve. No gain or loss is 
recognised in the profit and loss account.
Related parties
The Company is exempt under the terms of Financial 
Reporting Standard 8, Related Party Transactions, 
from disclosing related party transactions with wholly 
owned entities of the JKX Group.
Cash flow statement
The Company accounts are included within the publicly 
available consolidated financial statements of the 
Group. Consequently, the Company has not prepared a 
cash flow statement under the terms of the Financial 
Reporting Standard 1 (revised 1996).
Debtors
Amounts receivable from subsidiary undertakings 
are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction 
costs and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. The Company 
assesses at the end of each reporting period 
whether there is objective evidence that the loans 
and receivables are impaired. Any impairment is 
recognised in the income statement. 112
Creditors
Amounts due to subsidiary undertakings are 
recognised initially at fair value net of transaction 
costs and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.

up and is not secured. Amounts owed by group undertakings falling due within one year includes a provision for 
impairment of $7.4m (2009: nil). The amounts determined as individually impaired were balances due from group 
subsidiary undertakings where the future cash flows from these companies were determined to be unlikely to be 
sufficient to repay the amounts owed.
D.  Deferred tax assets
A deferred tax asset of $5.7m (2009: $nil) was recognised, it is expected that future profits will enable these to 
be utilised. 114

appoint the Chairman of the meeting or another person as 
your proxy using the Form of Proxy are set out in the notes to

Member to give instructions to the Relevant Member as 
to the exercise of voting rights. 
(c) Your main point of contact in terms of your investment in 
the Company remains the Relevant Member (or, perhaps, 
your custodian or broker) and you should continue to 
contact them (and not the Company) regarding any 
changes or queries relating to your personal details and 
your interest in the Company (including any 
administrative matters). The only exception to this is 
where the Company expressly requests a response from 
you.

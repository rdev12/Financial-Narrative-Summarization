Dear Shareholder,
This has been another year of solid achievement, once again demonstrating 
the strength of the business. We continually strive to be a more efficient client 
focused business that is responsive to a changing market and client needs.
Overview 
Over the past two and a half years, management have 
successfully taken steps to strengthen and enable the Group 
to drive sustainable growth and to focus on creating value 
for shareholders. 
The Board views wealth management as an attractive part of 
the financial services sector. The sector continues to change 
in response to a variety of pressures, including consumer 
preferences, regulation, pricing and technology and it is therefore 
important that the business is capable of adapting to changing 
circumstances. The Board believes that, with a network of expert 
Investment Managers and Financial Planners, the Group is well 
positioned to prosper in the current emerging environment.
Progress
The Group has had a good year. Its performance and its 
resilience mean that it is well equipped to operate in the dynamic 
regulatory and competitive environment. Against a backdrop 
of market volatility and industry change, I believe that David 
Nicol and his team have made good progress in equipping the 
business for future growth.
This work is now substantially complete and the growth of 
the business is an important objective for the current year. 
Brewin Dolphin has many talented people working within the 
organisation and ensuring that we have the right skills and talent 
will be a critical part of this process.
Our strategy is to focus on the core business of discretionary 
wealth management. T o this end the Group’ s stake in 
Euroclear plc, the largest settlement system for securities 
transactions, was sold for £10.2 million during the year, and 
the sale of Stocktrade, the Group’ s Execution Only division, 
to Alliance Trust Savings Limited for £14.0 million, has been 
announced. It is expected that the sale of Stocktrade will 
complete in 2016.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Governance
The Board has the right balance of skills and experience to 
set the tone of the business and to challenge and support the 
Executive management team.
Kath Cates joined the Board in December 2014. She has 
brought with her a wealth of experience in risk and operational 
matters and has recently become the Chairman of the Board 
Risk Committee replacing Angela Knight, who has performed the 
task with dedication and skill in the past three years.
In addition to their principal role as an independent Director, each 
Non-Executive Director has a specific role within the Group. 
Angela Knight is the Senior Independent Director, Ian Dewar is 
Chairman of the Audit Committee, Paul Wilson is Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee, and Kath Cates is Chairman of 
the Board Risk Committee. Caroline T aylor is the Chairman of 
the new Corporate Responsibility Committee, which although 
not a committee of the Board, is of increasing importance. 
Their respective roles provide them and the Board with added 
insight into the workings of the business. The Committees they 
serve on undertake considerable work and are integral to the 
smooth running of the business.
Our people
Our success lies in the hands of around 1,900 individuals who 
work at Brewin Dolphin. On behalf of the Board I would like 
to thank them all for their hard work and commitment over 
the course of what has been a demanding year. The Board is 
conscious that these people are the Group’ s greatest asset and 
it must ensure that it focuses on retaining and developing a deep 
pool of diversified talent.
Our employees and our offices have long had a commitment to 
charitable activities. Being responsible and doing the right thing 
is an integral part of the Brewin Dolphin culture. In this context, 
during the course of the last 12 months, we have relaunched our 
corporate responsibility programme with the objective of building 
on the existing practices and further embedding them across 
the Group.
Shareholders
We aim to maintain an effective and regular dialogue with our 
shareholders. The views of our shareholders are welcome and 
help shape our decision making.
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 8.25p per share, to 
be paid on 11 March 2016 to shareholders on the register on 
19 February 2016. As a Board we aim to pay out between 60% 
and 80% of earnings and this year the figure amounts to 70%, 
an increase on the 62% we paid last year. This will bring the 
total dividend for the period to 12.0p per share (2014: 9.9p), 
demonstrating confidence in the Group’ s growth prospects 
and outlook.
This year’ s AGM will be held at 11.30am on 5 February 2016 at 
the Lincoln Centre, 18 Lincoln’ s Inn Fields, London WC2A 3ED. 
If you are unable to attend and wish to raise an issue, please do 
write to me and I will ensure you receive a timely answer.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW Investment rationale for shareholders
Who our clients are
We have two distinct categories of clients; those who have a 
direct relationship with the Group, and those who are introduced 
to us via financial intermediaries:
• Direct clients include private clients, charities and corporates, 
including their pension funds.
• Third party financial advisers, and other intermediaries, are 
also clients of the Group. The Group provides investment 
management services for the clients of the financial advisers; 
the underlying clients are typically private clients.
Private clients (whether direct or via intermediaries) account for 
£20.8 billion of discretionary funds under management, with 
their investment portfolios including Individual Savings Accounts, 
Self-Invested Personal Pensions and offshore bonds.
The average managed portfolio size is £498,000 
(2014: £478,000).
We manage £4.6 billion in pension related assets for individuals 
and corporates. 
Respected business providing investment 
expertise and trusted advice 
The Group has a long tradition as a respected retail financial 
services provider to private clients. Over time the Group has 
established a reputation for trust, integrity and client service.
For more information on how we do business, see our Business 
Model on page 10.
Trends for our markets are positive
Investment management and financial advisory services are 
growth markets with good long-term prospects. In particular, 
there is increasing demand as society becomes more self-reliant 
in specific areas such as retirement provision and long-term care 
as well as savings in general.
For more information, see Market Environment on page 12.
Opportunity to capitalise on our brand and scale 
As one of the largest providers of wealth management services 
in a fragmented sector, the Group is in a strong position to build 
on its brand and scale to grow the business, cementing its 
relationships with existing clients and winning new ones.
Chief Executive, David Nicol, discusses this further in his report 
on page 16.
Group positioned for even stronger growth
The Group is well positioned for further growth as we have 
strengthened our operations, putting us in a strong position to 
see further growth and increase our market share.

BUSINESS MODEL Access to our services
Our services can be accessed by clients either directly or via 
financial intermediaries. 
For more information, see who our clients are in the Business 
Overview on page 9.
The graph below shows the split of discretionary FUM at 
30 September 2015, between direct and intermediated clients.
Delivering our services
Our business model is based on providing a personal wealth 
management service delivered through our professional advisers 
(Investment Managers and Financial Planners).
Our Investment Managers are responsible for both the 
investment decisions taken on behalf of clients and for managing 
the relationship with their clients. Our Financial Planners help 
clients address their wider needs including advice on investment, 
protection or retirement requirements.
Our service to direct clients is built around the following 
key elements:
• A comprehensive assessment of the client’ s financial needs.
• Understanding the client’ s financial circumstances and 
objectives including: what does the client want to achieve with 
their investments, are they prepared for retirement, and are 
their family provided for in the event of death.
• Reviewing the client’ s investment risk profile – establishing 
how the client feels about investment risk, their willingness to 
accept it, and the financial capacity to withstand it.
• Providing a written client investment proposal – a proposed 
financial plan.
We then combine the output from the above assessment and 
advice process to create and manage for the client an investment 
portfolio and broader financial plan. 
The management of the client’ s investment portfolio is of 
paramount importance. As an independently owned business 
without in-house products we can look across a wide range of 
financial products. Our personal service is underpinned by both 
our award winning in-house research and a firm-wide asset 
allocation framework within which our Investment Managers have 
the flexibility to tailor portfolios to each client’ s individual needs, 
taking into account their risk profile and goals.
We offer a comprehensive service for private clients, including 
Self-Invested Personal Pensions, Individual Savings Accounts 
and Estate Planning, in addition to specialised investment 
services for Charities, Corporates and Pension Funds.
When clients come to us through a third party intermediary, the 
intermediary is responsible for providing the financial planning 
related advice, and our Investment Manager is responsible for 
managing the client’ s investments.
In addition to the tailored service described above, we have also 
established two model portfolio offerings: MPS and BPS – see 
the table opposite. 
• MPS is provided via the IFA market and is designed to provide 
fund management to clients for whom a bespoke service may 
not be necessary or cost-effective. 
• BPS is a non-advised product, available directly, made up 
of professionally designed portfolios for those with £10,000 
to £200,000 to invest. An individual selects the required 
portfolio based on their preference and long-term goals. 
The appropriate portfolio is made up of several funds without 
the need for financial advice.
How our business generates value 
Value for Brewin Dolphin: 
We earn income for services based on the amount of funds 
we manage or the investment business we transact on 
clients’ behalf.
We provide a personalised approach to client service, 
combined with the expertise of our professionally qualified 
staff to demonstrate the value of our services. By doing that 
well, we earn the trust of clients and create loyal, often long-
term client relationships, giving us a competitive advantage 
and adding value to the business through generation of new 
leads via referrals and brand enhancement.
Value for our clients:
We help clients to manage their money and to plan their 
finances to achieve their long-term goals. Each client is 
different and our approach is to assess their individual 
needs and develop a plan tailored to deliver their particular 
goals. Increasingly, clients want to talk to us about financial 
planning for key stages in their lives, such as saving for 
a pension or preparing for retirement, rather than simply 
investment performance.
We guide them through what is an ever more complex 
financial services system, helping them nurture their savings 
in a tax-efficient manner. In our industry, we have led the 
way when it comes to transparent charging and we will 
continue to look at ways in which we can make our charges 
simple and transparent. Increasingly, we will use our scale to 
achieve lower charges for our clients.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Overview Strategic

Additional 
Information Investment management and financial advisory services remain growth 
markets with good long-term prospects. In particular, there is increasing 
demand as society becomes more self-reliant in specific areas such as 
retirement provision and long-term care as well as savings in general.
• Legislation is accelerating a general shift towards self-
reliance. For instance, the new pension freedom rules that 
came into effect early this year allow individuals to leave their 
fund invested beyond retirement, with greater flexibility on 
withdrawing a lump sum and drawing down income.
• In a low interest rate environment, individuals require additional 
guidance in generating an adequate return on their savings. 
• How the industry addresses the specific needs of clients in an 
environment of increasing longevity is evolving.
These trends reinforce the need for advice, one of our strengths, 
in order to help clients achieve their goals in a more challenging 
and complicated environment. 
We have identified a number of additional market trends that are 
important to the long-term outlook of our industry:
Increased regulatory change 
Over the last few years, there has been significant change in the 
UK regulatory landscape, resulting in increased supervision in 
the sector. The regulatory environment has resulted in additional 
compliance costs throughout the industry, but we benefit from 
having sufficient scale to absorb these costs.
The broader financial services industry has been impacted 
by the Retail Distribution Review (‘RDR’), which changed the 
way intermediaries are compensated and has increased the 
regulatory costs of advice provision. 
Competitive environment 
Our industry is fragmented, serviced by a wide range of 
suppliers, from small firms to subsidiaries of international 
companies, offering diverse services to individual and 
institutional clients. We anticipate that the sector could see 
further consolidation. Although banks have to some extent 
withdrawn, recent acquisition appetite has come from life 
insurers and private equity firms making a concerted effort to 
enter the market. 
UK Private Banks and Wealth Managers
£732
bn
Assets under management or administration
Source: WMA Industry Statistics Quarter 2 2015.
There has been a steady shift towards private provision 
for pension and care costs, supplemented by savings and 
investment as society becomes more self-reliant.
The UK private bank and wealth management industry manages 
assets of £732 billion. The table opposite shows the FUM of 
Brewin Dolphin and its closest peers.
Wealth management as an industry remains highly fragmented 
and we are one of the few companies with significant scale.
Opportunities for our sector
There are both opportunities and challenges in our industry, 
driven by the following trends:
• Society is becoming more self-reliant in specific areas such 
as retirement provision, including the replacement of defined 
benefit or final salary pensions by defined contribution 
schemes, the need to plan for long-term care, as well as 
savings in general. 
• The UK has an ageing population, including many who have 
enjoyed relatively generous employer pension contributions 
and rising house prices, and are approaching retirement with 
higher life expectancy than previous generations. There is 
substantial personal wealth within this group from which a 
large number of our current and potential clients are drawn.

MARKET ENVIRONMENT Strategic

Additional 
Information
As a result, many Independent Financial Advisers (IFAs) have 
left the market and the resulting decline in provision of advice, 
despite growing demand, provides an opportunity for Wealth 
Managers to build relationships with individuals who no longer 
have a financial adviser. Furthermore, many IFAs are seeking 
the services of discretionary investment management so they 
can focus on advice for their client relationships. We expect this 
trend for IFAs to outsource investment management to provide 
a continuing source of discretionary assets to the industry and 
indeed, this has been an increasingly important source of new 
client funds. For more information please see the Results section 
on page 23.
Competition is faced from new services, such as consumer 
platforms that offer light touch guidance or self-directed 
solutions, rather than discretionary wealth management and 
financial planning.
Advice gap
One of the results of the RDR is that it has created an ‘advice 
gap’ for customers who are seeking to make investments but do 
not have access to advice for a variety of reasons such as cost, 
trust and knowledge. This issue has become so widely reported 
that the Government has announced the Financial Advice Market 
Review which will examine how financial advice, considered in its 
broadest sense, could work better for consumers.
The FCA is encouraging innovation to fill the advice gap and 
the resulting solutions will bring additional competition to the 
marketplace. For instance, new technology-driven services, such 
as ‘robo advice’, are being created. We have launched a direct to 
customer service, Brewin Portfolio Service, that specifically caters 
for clients who fall into the advice gap, offering them risk-rated 
portfolios, but without a full discretionary service.
We welcome the Financial Advice Market Review and look 
forward to making a contribution to help shape the Industry. 
Outlook
A combination of a changing marketplace, consumer trends, and 
shifting competitive environment creates opportunities for us to 
use our scale and reputation to grow our business and increase 
our market share.
Brand and scale have become more important as clients require 
reassurance on the security of their assets as well as comfort 
on the strength and stability of the organisation dealing with 
their money. As one of the market leaders with large scale and 
a strong financial position, we are well positioned to benefit from 
this trend.

Progress and opportunity
The Group has a number of core strengths which, collectively, 
provide a sound foundation for future growth. Our success lies in 
the quality of the advice we provide and the strength of our client 
relationships, which are mutually reinforcing. Both of these things 
are rooted in the skills and culture of our people, and as such 
are difficult to replicate. We benefit from our scale, and being a 
large business in a substantial but fragmented sector. This scale 
gives us the foundations and resources to pursue both our 
growth ambitions and absorb the impact of regulatory changes. 
The Group has great potential and is well placed to take 
advantage of available opportunities and create further value.
In September 2015, we hosted our first capital markets briefing 
at which we discussed in detail our plans to continue to grow 
the firm into the UK’ s leading discretionary wealth manager. 
I was delighted to welcome so many to the event, to share our 
vision and ambition about the future as well as introducing some 
members of our wider management team.
We operate in a dynamic market that presents both opportunities 
and challenges. We have traditionally served older, wealthier 
client groups, and there are opportunities to gain more of 
existing clients’ funds and to secure further clients in this group. 
We are seeing the market evolve as more people seek more 
advice to better understand the options available to them. 
These individuals, often younger, are saving and acquiring wealth, 
and need new approaches and ways of engaging. A constant, 
however, is the need for personally delivered advice, which has 
always been at the core of our approach. We also recognise that 
future clients currently have fewer assets today than a traditional 
wealth manager might usually address. We are developing 
different products to attract such high potential clients at an 
earlier stage in their lives, thereby seeding tomorrow’ s business 
and assets. Undoubtedly, the relationship will be supported 
by technology.
Wealth in the UK continues to grow in tandem with the economic 
recovery, and we are competing for a greater share of a growing 
market. Both regulatory and fiscal reforms are driving changes in 
behaviour, and the UK savings and pensions market is evolving 
rapidly. The changes under Pensions Freedoms; reduced 
Lifetime Allowances, and increased ISA allowances, have made 
the need for advice and guidance all the more pertinent and 
there is a growing number of people who are seeking wealth 
management services for the first time. Client behaviour is 
also changing; clients are more focused on finding solutions to

Information
achieve their goals, rather than focusing solely on investment 
performance. Our highly personalised approach to wealth and 
investment management is, we believe, well placed to meet 
these needs. We also recognise the ‘advice gap’ and are 
developing alternative delivery mechanisms to allow us to assist 
those with smaller portfolios.
Financial performance
Underlying financial performance continues to improve 
with adjusted profit before tax (‘PBT’) increasing by 7% to 
£62.2 million (2014: £58.4 million), reflecting both the growth 
in discretionary FUM, leading to revenue growth despite weak 
investment market conditions and the benefits of a more efficient 
business reflected in flat operating costs. The efficiency of 
the business continues to improve as we invest in our internal 
processes and systems, and the increased adjusted profit 
margin to 21.9% from 20.8% in the previous year, illustrates this. 
We also continue to meet our financial objectives for maintaining 
sufficient capital, with regulatory capital resources increasing by 
£4.2 million to £145.3 million, and growing our dividend, by 21% 
to 12.0p per share.
Progress against strategic objectives
Over the course of the year, the business has performed well and 
made good progress against the strategic objectives. 
1
  
Growing our revenue
We are making good progress through our focus on generating 
improved and sustainable organic growth. We understand our 
current and target clients and their needs, and are developing 
further services to meet those needs. This involves improving the 
awareness of our brand with specific target groups, and evolving 
the services we offer. We have the people, national presence 
and operating model to deliver effectively. We are focused 
on distribution and taking advantage of our scale in delivery, 
increasing the ability of our advisers to spend more time on 
client facing activities. 
Multiple initiatives are underway to attract new clients and to 
ensure that we can sustainably achieve the 5% discretionary 
net inflow target. These include a focus on sales and distribution 
further driving direct client organic growth, complementing 
the strong growth rates we are achieving in the intermediaries 
business. Other initiatives enable increased effort on sales; 
including a new redesigned sales training programme, the 
deployment of client relationship management tools, and 
adjustments to the compensation model to incentivise direct 
client growth. 
We focus on providing the best outcome for our clients by 
understanding their needs. Increasingly, a client sees good 
performance as their ability to reach their goals and it is our role 
to help them reach those goals. This relies on delivering the 
required investment performance and effective financial planning.
We are researching the needs of private clients in greater depth, 
identifying target client segments where we are well positioned 
to win business. We have a strong presence in our traditional 
client base, although there remains room to grow, particularly as 
wealth passes from generation to generation. We are developing 
specific approaches for those who are accumulating wealth, 
through their salaried success or business ownership, and are 
enhancing our services so that we are well positioned to attract 
these types of clients.
We continue to enhance the services that we provide to clients. 
2015 has seen the rollout and completion of an enhanced client 
advice process. This provides an impartial assessment of attitude 
to risk, and is needs, not investment, focused. This transparent 
process supports clients in trusting us on a broader range of 
issues. A survey conducted showed that clients responded 
positively to the process, with 85% of clients agreeing or 
strongly agreeing with the statement “the process of reassessing 
my financial goals was clearly explained and I understood 
the process”.
“ I am amazed how accurately the 
client service review reflects my 
needs and attitude to risk. Very 
perceptive. It has helped me to 
consider my financial position 
with a better perspective. ” 
 Client feedback 
17
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC   
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Overview High quality advice, provided by Financial Planners, is available 
in all our offices. They continue to work with a greater number of 
clients providing advice on investment protection and retirement 
requirements. This enables us to offer a full service to clients to 
ensure that they receive the right service for their needs, whether 
that is our full bespoke discretionary service or access to our 
model portfolios. Financial planning leads to the firm advising 
on a greater share of an individual’ s assets, accelerating the 
acquisition and retention of FUM.
We are investing in a solution to work with professional services 
firms as introducers. This segment is currently under-served 
by the wealth management industry and we aim to exploit this 
opportunity by strengthening links with lawyers and accountants, 
broadening the services we offer them. We already work 
with many law and accountancy firms, providing services 
to their clients, giving us a strong base from which to grow. 
Research suggests the market size in this area is considerable.
We have built a strong service for financial intermediaries, or 
agents, understanding the needs of these clients, and have 
achieved much success working with over 1,300 adviser 
firms. We have £5.6 billion of discretionary FUM sourced via 
intermediaries, and through a dedicated national sales force.
We are expanding our Managed Portfolio Service (‘MPS’) range 
and developing our technological capabilities for agents to make 
outsourcing more efficient. We are focused on increasing our 
market share of new business invested into model portfolios 
by advisers. 
In April 2015, we launched Brewins Portfolio Service (‘BPS’) 
on the BrewinsDirect platform, which widens our offering by 
providing a non-advisory investment service for clients with 
smaller sums to invest. This service will evolve, as it grows, and it 
will help in our offer to attract tomorrow’ s core clients.
Our national office network is a source of strength allowing us to 
deliver a personalised service, and providing a local presence, 
which is key to attracting new business. This is supported by 
both local and national activities, including the sponsorship of the 
Chelsea Flower Show and the Goodwood Revival. 
We led the way on transparency when the Retail Distribution 
Review (‘RDR’) was implemented and continue to do so 
by providing a clear explanation of fees. We believe that 
transparency is a clear point of differentiation and opportunity. 
In August 2015, The Sunday Times named the Group as one 
of only 11 of the top 100 financial advisers who publish their 
charges online. We will continue to lead on transparency for 
our clients.
In 2016, we will update our Client Portal and launch an App for 
tablets and smartphones, providing convenience and easier 
access for clients. We are planning to trial ‘Skype for business’ to 
provide advice at home for our clients. 
2 Maintaining an efficient operating model
The ‘measuring our performance’ section of this report shows 
the five KPIs that are used to measure the progress being made 
to improve the efficiency of our operating model. I am pleased 
that all five of the measures are trending in the right direction.
The adjusted PBT margin brings together the other efficiency 
measures, and confirms the efficiency improvements in both 
our client facing teams and corporate functions. Further detail is 
provided in the Results section on page 21.
The increase in discretionary income per CF30, discretionary 
FUM per CF30 and average client portfolio size all demonstrate 
the improvement in productivity of our Investment Managers and 
Financial Planners.
Operating model
We continue to simplify and strengthen our operating model 
with a view to increasing efficiency and improving client service. 
An increased focus on primary services, harnessing technology 
to lower costs and ongoing cost discipline is also a key focus for 
us in increasing efficiency.
During the year the Brighton office was merged into our Reigate 
office, and the Norwich office was merged into Ipswich, creating 
an enlarged East Anglia office. In November 2015, we merged 
the T aunton office into the Exeter office. We have 27 offices; 25 in 
the United Kingdom, and offices in Jersey and Dublin. We have 
created a network from which we can provide larger teams of 
Investment Managers integrated with Financial Planners, enabling 
us to offer clients a broader range of services.
Focus on primary services
In May 2015, we agreed the sale of Stocktrade, our Execution 
Only division, to Alliance Trust Savings Limited for £14 million in 
cash, payable in full on completion. The sale, which is expected 
to complete in 2016, is aligned with our strategy of focusing on 
our core wealth management business. 
Technology
The Group’ s approach to technology is to utilise recognised 
industry wide software on a modular basis with the appropriate 
functionality. We have adopted an incremental approach to our 
technology implementation strategy, seeking to avoid significant 
customisation, thereby reducing both risk and cost. 
Ongoing developments to our technology and infrastructure 
are key drivers of planned further improvements in efficiency. 
A strong technology platform will provide benefits internally 
and externally, freeing up the time of our Investment Managers 
and Financial Planners, and ensuring that we have the ability to 
support clients and ensure they get the best possible service.

Progress against financial objectives
I am also pleased to report the following progress against our 
financial objectives.
3
  
Maintaining sufficient capital
The Group has a target capital adequacy ratio of a minimum 
of 150%. The Group met its financial objective of maintaining 
sufficient capital, with a year end ratio of 248%, compared 
to 241% the previous year. The stronger ratio arises from 
a £4.2 million increase in regulatory capital resources from 
£141.1 million to £145.3 million.
The Group continually assesses the appropriate amount of 
capital resources, to ensure that it is both well placed to take 
advantage of opportunities that present themselves, and has an 
adequate capital buffer against potential risks.
4 Growing our dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 8.25p per share, 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 12.0p per share. 
The total dividend of 12.0p per share represents an increase 
of 21% on the prior year (2014: 9.9p per share). The payout 
ratio is 70% of adjusted diluted EPS, and is in line with the 
dividend policy announced two years ago; a target payout ratio 
of 60% to 80% of adjusted diluted EPS. The payout ratio of 
70% (2014: 62%) is reflective of the Board’ s confidence in the 
Group’ s prospects for further sustainable growth in earnings and 
ensures that shareholders benefit accordingly from the growth in 
underlying earnings.
People
We continue to invest in the development of the Group’ s 
employees. We are developing a culture which is ambitious and 
focused on growth, achieved through collaboration between our 
Investment Managers, Financial Planners and the strengthened 
corporate functions. We have an active programme of learning 
and development to ensure our people are equipped with the 
appropriate skills.
Our approach to employee reward recognises their importance 
to the success of the business; ensuring alignment with our 
strategy, and the appropriate risk and behavioural accountability. 
The aim is to ensure participation in the value created by 
the business.
As part of the drive to engage with employees and understand 
their needs, and ultimately improve performance, this summer 
we conducted our first employee engagement survey, called 
‘Your Future, Your Say’, covering a broad range of subjects. 
This is the beginning of what will be an ongoing project and 
engagement action plans are being put in place. 
Looking ahead
We have achieved a great deal and I am confident that our 
progress to date in refining our strategy and business model 
will further help us deliver our long-term goals. We are now 
in a position to capitalise on these achievements and pursue 
our strategy for strong growth. We are investing in our organic 
growth strategy, and have plans in place that will enable us to 
deliver this growth. The Group has great potential, a genuine 
desire to help clients achieve their goals, extensive advisory 
and investment management skills, and, together with the 
advantages of our scale and financial strength, means we are 
well placed to take advantage of the opportunities to grow the 
business and create value for all of our stakeholders. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues 
across the Group for their positive approach and their 
extraordinary commitment to our clients, particularly during the 
many internal changes over the past three years. I am extremely 
grateful for their skill and dedication, and am confident that we 
are all relishing our further growth prospects.

Changes to KPIs
The KPIs, detailed below, have been removed following 
an assessment of their ongoing suitability for measuring 
the success of implementing the strategy.
• Managed advisory service yield (bps) – this measure is 
no longer appropriate; the Group’ s focus is now on the 
provision of discretionary services. 
• Support staff to CF30 ratio – this measure has become 
less meaningful as efficiency has been achieved in part 
by reduction of client facing staff and cost control.
The target for the discretionary service yield KPI has been 
removed, as it was introduced to monitor the rollout of national 
pricing across the Group. This initiative was completed during 
the financial year ended 2014 and so the target has become less 
meaningful. The KPI, however remains relevant.

Results for the year 
Underlying financial performance for the period ended 
30 September 2015 was good. Adjusted profit before tax, 
from continuing operations, grew by 7% to £62.2 million 
(2014: £58.4 million) and adjusted EPS increased by 7% to 
17.1p per share (2014: 16.0p).
Adjusted profit growth was driven by increased income, 1% 
higher than the prior year, together with improving efficiency, 
reflected by fixed operating costs declining by 1%, and an 
increase in adjusted PBT margin to 21.9% from 20.8%.
Profit before tax, from continuing operations, increased 
substantially to £61.0 million (2014: £6.8 million). In addition 
to underlying profit growth, the large increase was primarily a 
result of a non‑recurring loss of £33.7 million in 2014 relating 
to the termination of the rollout of a new operating system, 
a £9.7 million gain in 2015 from the sale of the Group’ s 
holding in Euroclear plc, and a reduction in the amortisation of 
client relationships. 
In line with the Group’ s focus on its primary services, the Group 
announced the sale of Stocktrade, its Execution Only division, in 
May, with the sale expected to complete in 2016. The underlying 
operating results of Stocktrade, in both 2015 and 2014, together 
with the financial impact of separation and sale related costs, are 
reported as discontinued operations.
A loss before tax of £10.4 million in discontinued operations 
(2014: £1.6 million profit before tax), was a result of separation 
and sale related costs regarding the above Stocktrade 
transaction being recorded in this year’ s results (see note 13). 
The £14 million sale proceeds are expected to be recognised in 
the next financial year.

Explanation of adjusted profit before tax 
and reconciliation to financial statements 
Adjusted PBT and adjusted diluted EPS are used to measure 
and report on the underlying financial performance of the Group. 
T ogether with the adjusted PBT margin (being adjusted PBT 
as a percentage of total income), they are useful measures 
for investors and analysts. Additionally, they are used as key 
performance indicators for various incentive schemes, including 
the annual bonuses of Executive Directors and long‑term 
incentive plans (as set out in the Remuneration Report page 66).
These adjusted profit measures are calculated based on 
statutory PBT , as reported in the financial statements, adjusted to 
exclude various items of income or expense.
Items adjusted for are typically infrequent or unusual in nature. 
They include non‑recurring items. For example, a material one‑off 
gain, such as the sale of an available‑for ‑sale asset e.g. the sale 
of the Group’ s holding in Euroclear plc during the period and 
one‑off expenses such as the impairment charge suffered in 
2014 on the termination of a major software project. Other items 
of income or expense, adjusted for may recur from one period 
to the next, such as the redundancy costs and onerous contract 
charges, detailed below, which have occurred in recent financial 
years. Although they may recur over one or more periods, they 
do not represent long‑term expenses of the business and are 
generally the result of material restructuring decisions. 
Additionally, the amortisation expense of client relationships 
acquired is an expense which investors and financial analysts 
typically add back when considering profit before tax or earnings 
per share ratios and is therefore adjusted for.

During the year we continued to focus on growing our core 
discretionary service. Net inflows of £1.1 billion (2014: £1.4 billion) 
were achieved, in line with our target of 5% per annum 
(2014: 7%), and gross external inflows were £2.1 billion 
(2014: £2.3 billion).
Further successful development of our intermediaries business, 
including both bespoke and model solutions, resulted in strong 
gross inflows of £1.1 billion (2014: £0.9 billion) as we capitalised 
further on the trend for intermediaries to outsource their 
investment management needs.

£5.0bn Agent

Discretionary FUM  split (£bn)
Direct client inflows of £1.0 billion (2014: £1.4 billion) 
were achieved, helped by the inflows of integrated wealth 
management accounts (£0.2 billion). Over 10% of our direct 
private client discretionary FUM is now receiving financial 
planning advice, and as part of our growth initiatives for direct 
business, we aim to grow this to 30% over the course of the next 
five years. 
T aking into account the impact of negative investment returns 
from the market falls witnessed in the second half of the 
financial year; the WMA Balanced index fell by 7% from March 
2015 to September 2015, further successful conversion of 
advisory accounts (£0.3 billion) and outflows of £1.3 billion, total 
discretionary FUM grew by 3% to £24.8 billion from £24.0 billion 
in September 2014. 
T otal outflows across all service categories, including advisory 
which was withdrawn for new clients in 2014, declined slightly 
to £2.3 billion (2014: £2.4 billion), and we expect the rate of 
outflows to decline further over time, in particular, as the effects 
of the recent reduction in the number of offices, become 
less significant.
T otal advisory FUM fell by £1.9 billion, a 35% reduction 
(2014: 22%) principally as a result of net outflows of £1.7 billion 
and negative investment performance of £0.2 billion. This decline 
was anticipated given the withdrawal of this service to new 
clients and the focus on the discretionary service. However, 
we successfully retained a much higher proportion of the 
advisory outflow by converting to continuing discretionary or 
execution only services. £1.3 billion out of £1.7 billion (76%) was 
successfully converted, compared to a conversion rate of 63% 
in 2014. 
Execution only FUM was £3.7 billion (2014: £3.1 billion), including 
positive internal transfers of £1.0 billion. Execution only services 
are no longer offered on a standalone basis.
The FUM above excludes Stocktrade, the Group’ s Execution 
Only division, which is in the process of being sold. 
Stocktrade had assets under administration of £3.6 billion at 
30 September 2015.

Core income increased by 5% to £251.3 million 
(2014: £238.6 million).The continued focus on the core 
discretionary service led to income growth of 4% to £225.5 million 
(2014: £215.9 million), driven by an increase in the average FUM 
compared to the prior year, partially offset by a reduction in the 
income yield. 
Financial planning income increased by 21% to £15.7 million 
(2014: £13.0 million), as a result of increasing numbers of clients 
advised by our Financial Planners. 
Execution only income grew by 4% to £10.1 million, 
supported by the inward transfer of £1 billion of FUM from the 
advisory service. 
Advisory investment management income fell by 23% to 
£24.4 million (2014: £31.6 million), primarily as a result of advisory 
FUM reducing by 35% to £3.5 billion (2014: £5.4 billion).
Trail and interest income reduced by 13% and 35% respectively. 
Trail commission is expected to decline rapidly in advance of the 
introduction of MiFID II. Net interest income declined as a result 
of lower interest rates available from our banks.
Fees and commissions
T otal income from the discretionary, execution only and advisory 
services was £260.0 million (2014: £257.2 million). The split of

Income yield
Investment market conditions during the year were generally 
poor, with periods of elevated volatility combining with a lack of 
clear direction or momentum in the equity markets. The FTSE 
100 index was down by 9% over the course of the year, and the 
WMA Balanced index was 1% lower.
This resulted in generally lower transactional volumes across all 
service categories and the reduction in overall income yield, for 
investment management services, by 2bps, to 78bps. 
The yield on our core discretionary service further declined 
marginally as a result of an increasing proportion of agent related 
investment management business, which has a lower fee level 
than direct client business. 
Transfers of lower yielding advisory business to execution only led 
to the advisory yield increasing by 4bps to 57bps.

Costs
The continuing benefits of the efficiency initiatives of the last three 
years have resulted in a decline in total fixed operating costs of 
1% to £173.0 million (2014: £174.6 million). 
Fixed staff costs
Fixed staff costs rose by 6% to £104.0 million (2014: £98.5 million). 
The increase is primarily the result of temporary staff costs 
associated with the design, testing, implementation and quality 
assurance of the enhanced client advice process implemented 
during the year.
Other operating costs
Other operating costs decreased by 9% to £69.0 million 
(2014: £76.1 million). Lower property costs resulting from a 
smaller office network, lower professional fees and a decline in 
variable costs all contributed to the reduction.
Variable staff costs
Variable staff costs increased by 1% to £49.0 million 
(2014: £48.8 million), slightly lower than the rise in adjusted 
profit before variable staff costs (4%). The expense relates to a 
combination of cash awards and deferred equity linked awards, 
the cost of which is spread over the vesting period. 
Exceptional items
Net exceptional gains of £8.0 million in 2015 (2014: costs of 
£38.0 million), comprised of a number of elements: £9.7 million 
gain from the sale of the Group’ s investment in Euroclear plc; 
redundancy costs of £2.4 million (2014: £2.3 million) and 
£1.1 million income as a result of a levy rebate from the Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme (‘FSCS’) (see note 8).
In 2014, £33.7 million losses were recognised as a result of the 
decision to terminate the rollout of a new operating system, 
and £2.0 million (2015: £0.4 million) of additional provisions 
were made in respect of onerous contracts in relation to surplus 
property resulting from branch closures. 
Amortisation of client relationships
Amortisation of client relationships decreased to £9.2 million  
(2014: £13.6 million), as a result of previously acquired client 
relationships reaching the end of their amortisation periods.
Pension fund
The deficit on the final salary pension scheme reduced from 
£7.7 million to £2.9 million which contributed to an actuarial 
gain of £2.1 million (2014: £1.2 million loss). Under IAS 19, large 
annual fluctuations can occur. The Group has agreed to make 
additional payment contributions of £3 million per annum, as 
part of the recovery plan agreed with the trustees of the Group’ s 
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme (see note 27).
Capital resources and regulatory capital
The Group’ s financial position is strong with net assets of 
£219.2 million at 30 September 2015 (2014: £211.3 million). 
T angible net assets (net assets excluding intangibles and shares 
to be issued) are £141.5 million (2014: £136.2 million), and have 
grown by 4% in 2015. 
The Group’ s primary regulator is the Financial Conduct Authority 
(‘FCA’). The FCA rules determine the calculation of the Group’ s 
regulatory capital resources and regulatory capital requirements. 
Additionally, as required under FCA rules, we perform an Internal 
Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (‘ICAAP’) which includes 
performing a range of stress tests to determine the appropriate 
level of regulatory capital that the Group needs to hold. 
At 30 September 2015, the Group had regulatory capital 
resources of £145.3 million (2014: £141.1 million), see note 26 to 
the financial statements.
The Group’ s Pillar III disclosures are published annually on our 
website and provide further details about regulatory capital 
resources and requirements.

£1.1 million from the FSCS levy rebate, offset by £6.1 million 
outflows from redundancy payments, onerous lease settlements 
and the settlement of the 2014 licence provision.
Cash outflow for own share ‘matching’ purchases in the period

Profit Share Plan (‘DPSP’) and Equity Award Plan, including 
matching the awards made in 2014 and those made in 2012 
under the DPSP , all past awards are now fully matched. 
£0.2 million (2014: £0.2 million) of shares were purchased for the 
Share Incentive Plan (see note 31).
Shares issued for cash of £1.9 million is a result of the issue of 
shares in relation to Approved Share Options and Nil Paid Shares

Going concern
The Group’ s business activities, performance and position, 
together with the factors likely to affect its future development are 
set out in the Chairman’ s Statement, Strategic Report and Risk 
Committee Report. 
The Group’ s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity 
risk are described in note 26 to the financial statements.
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully. The Group’ s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of possible adverse changes in 
trading performance, show that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements. 
In forming their view, the Directors have considered the Group’ s 
prospects for a period exceeding twelve months from the date 
the financial statements are approved.
Viability Statement
The Directors have assessed the outlook of the Company over 
a longer period than the twelve months required by the ‘Going 
Concern’ statement in accordance with the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
The assessment relied on, the Medium T erm Plan (‘MTP’); 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (‘ICAAP’) and 
evaluation of the Group’ s principal risks and uncertainties, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance or solvency.
The Group prepares annually, a five year MTP as part of its 
corporate planning process, which is a financial articulation of the 
Group’ s strategy. The Group continually improves the quality of 
its financial forecasting model, which is predicated on a detailed 
year one budget and higher‑level forecasts for years two to five. 
As a matter of good practice and as part of the ICAAP required 
by the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’), the firm performs a 
variety of stress tests including reverse stress tests. Three stress 
tests are performed; a market wide stress, a Group specific 
(idiosyncratic) stress and a combined stress taking into account 
both market wide and Group specific events. The stress tests 
are derived through discussions with senior management, 
after considering the principal risks and uncertainties faced by 
the Group.
The stress tests enable:
• the Group to model a variety of external and internal events 
that impact the MTP , identifying the potential impact of stress 
events on income, costs, cash flow and capital; and
• the Board to assess the effectiveness of any management 
actions that may be taken to mitigate the impact of the 
stress events. 
The reverse stress tests allow the Board to assess scenarios and 
circumstances that would render its business model unviable, 
thereby identifying potential business vulnerabilities and ensuring 
the development of potential mitigating actions.
Following the assessment of the above, the Board concluded 
that the Viability Statement should cover a period of three years. 
Whilst the Directors have no reason to believe that the Group 
will not be viable over a longer period from its assessment of the 
MTP , this period has been chosen because a three year time 
horizon has a much greater degree of certainty and provides an 
appropriate longer term outlook. 
T aking account of the Group’ s current position and principal risks 
and the Board’ s assessment of the Company’ s prospects, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over a period of at least three years.
29
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC   
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Overview T o ensure a common understanding of risk in the context of the  
Group’s business, the Board have adopted the following risk definition: 
“Uncertainty of outcome of actions or events that will impact on the  
business  objectives, whether as an opportunity or a threat”.
T o assist a uniform understanding of risk across the Group, all 
risks are organised around one of three high level risk groups. 
These are: 
• Strategic and Business
• Financial
• Operational
Each high level risk group contains a series of specific risks 
to ensure that all risks can be reported clearly and accurately. 
This also ensures the Group can assess the financial resources 
it is required to hold against these.
Risk management
Whilst it is everyone’ s responsibility to manage risks within their 
domain, ultimate accountability for risk management resides 
with the Board, which is responsible for setting the Group’ s risk 
appetite and ensuring that there is an adequate and appropriate 
Risk Management Framework in place. The implementation 
and delivery of that framework is a collective responsibility 
across the Group, with senior management, the Group Risk 
and Compliance Director and the Head of Risk playing pivotal 
roles in achieving this. The Finance Director has responsibility for 
the oversight of the management of the Group’ s financial risks. 
The Executive Committee has the responsibility for oversight of 
strategic and business risks and has delegated responsibility to 
the Risk Management Committee for day-to-day oversight of 
financial and operational risk matters.
The Board understands that a clear Risk Management 
Framework is a fundamental requirement for effective 
governance. However, for a Risk Management Framework to 
be effective, it requires every employee within the organisation to 
adhere to and advocate the risk culture set by the Board.
In pursuit of that aim, the Group has followed industry good 
practice for risk management governance through the adoption 
of the ‘three lines of defence’ model. The Board believes 
this approach best serves the interests of Brewin Dolphin’ s 
clients and other stakeholders by ensuring accountability of 
management and the proportionate allocation of resource within 
the oversight and control functions.
The Board regularly assesses the effectiveness of the Group’ s 
internal controls through the review and challenge of reports 
from the Group’ s Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee, 
together with the appraisal of issues escalated from the business 
through the Group’ s Executive Committee. In addition, the 
Group’ s Risk and Compliance Department and Internal Audit 
independently carry out reviews and report to the Board Audit 
Committee, Board Risk Committee and the Board.
Objectives of risk management
The prime objectives of risk management in the Group are to 
ensure there is:
• A strong risk culture so that employees are able to identify, 
assess, manage and report against the key risks to the 
business and implement the Group’ s business strategy.
• An appropriate balance between risk and the cost of control.
• A defined risk appetite within which risks are managed.
• A swift and effective response to incidents in order to 
minimise impact.

Direction  
of change:
The level of business and strategic risk faced by the Group has increased over 2014/15, primarily driven by the 
degree of change in the regulatory and external environments. Internal changes included the launch of BPS 
on the Brewins Direct platform, which widens our offering by providing a non-advisory investment service for 
clients with smaller sums to invest, the sale of Stocktrade and changes to the Brewin Dolphin core proposition. 
These changes are intended to reduce business and strategic risk over the longer term and are critical in 
reaching the Group’s strategic and long-term objectives.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
“We take our responsibility as a corporate citizen seriously and have 
relaunched our corporate responsibility programme during the year to build 
on existing practices and embed them across the Group. ”
David Nicol
Chief Executive
Corporate responsibility strategy
Our objective is to continue to manage the business responsibly 
for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders.
During 2015, the Group began to implement the corporate 
responsibility strategy agreed by the Board in 2014 to establish 
a Corporate Responsibility Committee and leverage the existing 
work done by the Group and its employees to refine and 
enhance the Group’ s efforts in the field of corporate responsibility 
and philanthropy.
In April 2015, we became a member of Business in the 
Community, which is part of the Prince’ s Responsible Business 
Network. In September 2015 we announced our sponsorship of 
Enabling Enterprise, an organisation our employees have been 
working with for a number of years, which helps equip school 
pupils with workplace skills. We were proud to take part in the 
Lord Mayor’ s City Giving Day in London on 30 September 2015 
by holding a number of activities to celebrate and encourage 
charitable giving including the launch of our volunteering policy.

People and Culture
 
People
As a business built on personal relationships and service, we 
recognise that our people are our most important assets, vital to 
the Group’ s reputation and continued success. T o meet the high 
expectations we set for ourselves we need to attract, nurture 
and retain the best people, and we consider ourselves to be 
an employer of choice within the Wealth Management sector. 
This year we appointed a Group Director of Human Resources 
who is developing a more strategic approach for developing, 
retaining and rewarding employees.
Our culture
The Group has a rich heritage, reaching back 250 years, built on 
trust and integrity. These values remain crucial to the business 
and our employees in it as we adapt to the changing conditions 
in our marketplace and the evolving demands of our clients. 
T o attract, retain and nurture the best people it is important 
that we recognise hard work, and that behaviour is aligned to 
our values and demonstrates a commitment to the Group, its 
objectives and its clients.
Diversity and inclusion
The Board has a strong commitment to maintaining a working 
environment based on equality and diversity.
Brewin Dolphin is an inclusive employer and we have a number 
of initiatives in place to improve our diversity. We believe this will 
allow us to bring value to our clients and to create a rewarding 
environment for our employees. 
We have female representation on the Board of 33% and 17% 
on the Executive Committee (one in six). Across the Group we 
have an employee headcount of 1,693, of which 748 (44%) of 
our employees are women. We are keen to create opportunities 
for more women to be promoted to senior roles across the 
Group. During the year, we held a number of events on the 
subject of ‘Navigating your Career’, aimed at women across the 
organisation. These events provide the opportunity for female 
employees at all levels to meet Directors of Brewin Dolphin and 
ask questions about career progression. 
We recognise that we can broaden the diversity of our workforce 
and this is as an area that our Diversity Committee will be 
focusing on in 2016.
All employment decisions are made irrespective of colour, race, 
age, nationality, ethnic or national origin, sex, mental or physical 
disabilities, marital status or sexual preference. For employees 
who may have a disability, the Group ensures proper procedures 
and equipment are in place to aid them. When it comes to 
training, career development and promotion, all employees 
are treated equally and job applications are always judged 
on aptitude. 
Learning and development
We are proud of the suite of learning and development initiatives 
we offer to our employees to enable them to reach their potential.
By mapping out career paths, we can accelerate the development 
of those with high potential, ensuring our people have the right 
skills for the roles they are in and are preparing for the roles they 
aspire to.
Management skills are important to us. All our people managers 
are required to complete performance management training and 
we offer an in-house suite of leadership development training. 
Given the talent we have in the business, we believe that an 
important part of career development rests in established 
members of staff passing on the benefits of their knowledge 
and experience to newer colleagues. Although this is something 
we have always encouraged informally, we see a valuable 
opportunity to build on that experience and have developed and 
rolled out our ‘Aspire’ mentoring programme to accelerate the 
spread of best practice.
Employee engagement
The Board believes it is vital that staff play an active role in 
achieving the Group’ s corporate objectives. We seek to ensure 
employees are listened to and receive regular communications 
about Group strategy and financial performance. As part of the 
drive to engage with employees and understand their needs, 
and ultimately improve performance, this summer we conducted 
our first employee engagement survey, called ‘Your Future, Your 
Say’, covering a broad range of subjects.
A remarkable 84% of our employees responded. Our overall 
engagement score was 76%, two points above the benchmark 
for the financial services sector. The results showed that our 
employees enjoy their work, have the skills to do their job and are 
proud to work for Brewin Dolphin. Whilst we are pleased with the 
results of this survey we are not complacent, we have identified 
where we need to improve and engagement action plans are 
being put in place at team and corporate levels. We firmly believe 
that high employee engagement will be a driver of sustained 
high performance.
Health and safety
We are committed to making sure that the working environment 
is safe and conducive to the health of our employees, allowing 
them to balance work and family commitments. The Group’ s 
Health and Safety at Work policy is reviewed annually by the 
Board and the Director responsible for health and safety is 
David Nicol.
That commitment to health and safety extends to employees, 
clients, sub-contractors and others who may be affected 
by our activities and is underscored by our Health and 
Safety Management System which ensures compliance 
with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements and 
internal standards. 36

Clients and Governance
 
Business standards and clients
Everything we do is driven by our focus on our clients. 
Long-standing client relationships are a crucial part of what 
makes the Group what it is today.
We take an integrated approach to protecting and growing 
wealth, combining our expertise and experience in Investment 
Management and Financial Planning. 
Being single-minded about delivering a service to clients that 
is right for them draws on our heritage and many of our clients 
and their families have entrusted us to look after their wealth 
for generations.
Our aim is to be the trusted adviser of choice and serving and 
managing client relationships enables us to create a strong 
results-driven business which benefits all of our stakeholders.
The changes we have made, alongside innovation within the 
business allow us to deliver high quality services consistently.
However, we are not complacent and are constantly striving 
to work harder for our clients as we grow the business.
Brewin Dolphin takes its corporate responsibility seriously with 
respect to taxation and aims to be a good corporate citizen 
by bearing its fair share of the tax burden while at the same 
time safeguarding its reputation and relationships with clients, 
shareholders and tax authorities alike. While we are mindful 
of our obligations to shareholders to ensure tax efficiency, we 
use only legitimate tax reliefs for the purposes for which they 
were intended and do not partake in aggressive tax planning or 
condone tax avoidance as both would contravene our ethics and 
conservative culture.
A key driver of our tax strategy is to reduce risk as our appetite 
for tax risk is low. We also aim to promote tax awareness 
among our staff so that our processes and controls encompass 
best practice and keep pace with changing tax legislation and 
requirements. Good tax governance ensures that we are in 
compliance with tax law in all territories in which we operate. 
Stewardship
Brewin Dolphin established a Stewardship Committee to ensure 
that discretionary clients’ interests as holders of securities 
are protected and, where appropriate, to ensure proactive 
shareholder action is taken in the best interest of its discretionary 
clients. Following publication of companies’ resolutions, we 
give our clients the first opportunity to vote the shares for which 
they are the underlying beneficiary using our online facility, Vote 
Your Shares, which we introduced in 1998. In the closing days 
before each AGM, Brewin Dolphin votes the balance of each 
shareholding not voted by clients and over which we have 
discretion for the majority of the stocks held in our nominees. 
Brewin Dolphin publishes the aggregate voting record for these 
companies on our website after each AGM. 
Governance
The Corporate Governance Report on pages 48 to 52 explains 
how the Group applies the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.

Communities
Brewin Dolphin and our employees are committed to the 
communities in which we operate. Employees take great pride 
in the impact they make on their local communities and are 
actively encouraged to contribute, with efforts ranging from local 
sponsorships and volunteering, to offering work experience. 
Brewin Dolphin Foundation
In recognition of our 250th anniversary in 2012, the Brewin 
Dolphin Foundation was established to increase the positive 
contribution we make to the world. It coordinates our charitable 
activities under one umbrella in order to raise funds for worthy 
causes and generate a greater impact for beneficiaries. 
Following a review, the Foundation was further refined in 
September 2015 with support from Charities Aid Foundation 
(‘CAF’) to increase employee engagement and make it easier to 
take part in charitable activities. 
Small Grants Scheme
Staff are offered the opportunity to apply to the Foundation 
for grants for small charities that support the local community. 
During the year it donated grants to organisations including 
Nottinghamshire Hospice, Children’ s Hospice South West, 
MediCinema and West of Scotland Deaf Children’ s Society.
Payroll giving
Over the course of 2015, we were awarded the Payroll Giving 
Silver award by CAF in recognition of the Group’ s increased 
commitment to payroll giving. 37

Volunteering and education
We have always wholeheartedly embraced volunteering and 
many of our employees do so enthusiastically. T o build on past 
successes, we launched a volunteering policy in September, 
offering every member of staff one paid day off to volunteer every 
year. Not only can staff make a positive contribution to the wider 
community, but volunteering helps people in achieving their 
personal goals.
Having become a member of Business in the Community, we 
signed up for our first Give and Gain Day, a national employee 
volunteering day in May when a team took part in a mentoring 
project at an inner city London school.
In the past year we have supported local school children in 
conjunction with Enabling Enterprises and Career Ready UK 
and we are proud to help provide bursaries for underprivileged 
children at the Reed’ s School in Surrey. 
Local sponsorships and community support
We are proud to support many worthwhile local causes spanning 
the arts and sports. During the financial year we have supported 
events such as the Borders Book Festival, the Chalke Valley 
History Festival, Great Yorkshire Show, Marlborough Jazz and 
Literature Festivals, Moy Highland Field Sports Fair, Norfolk 
Show, the Scottish Schools Rugby T ournament, Shrewsbury 
Flower Show and the T aunton Flower Show. We have been a 
long-term supporter of Cheltenham Cricket Festival and the 
Durham County Cricket team.
During the year staff took part in a wide variety of fundraising 
events, both small and large, local and national, such as Race 
for Life for Cancer Research UK and staff hosting a Christmas 
Jumper Day for Age UK and Save the Children. Senior Regional 
Director Stephen Jones took part in the gruelling T our de France 
One Day Ahead challenge as part of a team raising money for 
Cure Leukaemia.
Case Study 
Brewin Dolphin is a sponsor of Enabling Enterprise.
Enabling Enterprise’ s primary aim is that one day all students 
will leave school equipped with the skills that make them 
employable, with workplace experience and an aspiration to 
succeed. These are aims we wholeheartedly endorse and 
support and with which we are very proud to be associated. 
Founded by a group of teachers in 2009, it now works with 
a growing number of students nationally – currently 45,000 
– and with over 2,000 teachers. Enabling Enterprise wants 
to make enterprise a core part of the school curriculum, with 
dedicated lessons in class and student work experience 
with businesses. 
We have been supporting Enabling Enterprise since 2013 
by hosting visits from students to our offices, supported by 
Brewin Dolphin staff volunteers.
These visits have proved enormously successful for everyone 
involved. We are keen to support Enabling Enterprise as it 
develops its programme in the Midlands, the South, the North 
East and the North West. 
During the year we staged Enabling Enterprise days at our 
London head office and our Birmingham office for pupils from 
a number of local schools. Other Group offices are planning 
to hold similar events in the coming year.
Students worked in teams, with a volunteer, to plan a sweet 
shop business, pitch for funding and make investment 
decisions, mimicking the financial decision making process 
in the real world.  38

Environmental Sustainability
The Group recognises its impact on the environment and strives to 
minimise it. As a financial services provider, our main environmental 
focus is on our network of offices and employee travel.
This is the Group’ s second year of reporting as a quoted 
company under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013.

Fugitive emissions – refrigerant losses 8.80 0
Mobile combustion –

Emissions per full time employee 1.5 1.39
Methodology and additional information
The table on this page reports the Group’ s annual GHG 
emissions from sources which fall within the consolidated 
financial statements. 
The data collection methodology has been strengthened 
significantly from the prior year, which was our first year of 
reporting under the new regulations. Emissions from the 
combustion of fuel and operation of facilities has increased 
significantly principally as a result of more sophisticated 
data collection methodology rather than an increase in 
underlying consumption. 
Included are most of the emission sources that the Group has 
responsibility for but some emission sources have been omitted 
based on a lack of data and allocation to Scope 3 which is not 
reported on. Details of the emissions which have been omitted 
are given in the ‘Emission sources not reported’ section below.
The Group has gathered energy use data (natural gas and 
electricity), refrigerants use as well as business travel mileage 
and applied emission factors from the UK Government’ s 
(Defra) GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2015. 
Note that Defra emission factors for 2015 have been updated 
from those available in 2013 and this should explain any 
discrepancies between figures in the current reporting year and 
the comparison year. 
Emission sources not reported
This section of the report details the emission sources that the 
Group have not reported on and the reasons for their exclusion. 
Buildings’ air conditioning refrigerants use
Space cooling requirements are inseparable from the general 
electrical consumption figures and it has not been possible 
to determine how much cooling energy can be allocated 
specifically to the Group and how much is already embedded in 
the overall electricity consumption values for buildings in which 
the Group mostly occupies under shared occupancy. We have 
had services carried out on all of the air conditioning units in our 
communications rooms which are under our direct control and 
have included refrigerant losses in the table above.  39

Information
Scope 3 emissions under shared occupancy
Following the guidelines of the European Public Real Estate 
Association (EPRA) set out in ‘Navigating through sustainability 
reporting standards, 2011’, we classify certain emissions as 
scope 3 and so do not report on them. The emissions arise 
for our shared occupancy tenancy status where we have no 
sub-meters for HVAC consumption and are recharged for 
this on an assumed basis via a service charge to the landlord. 
These scope 3 emissions include:
• electricity data for 3 offices where we are charged via the 
service charge to the landlord;
• gas consumption for 13 offices where we are also charged 
via the service to the landlord; and
• any heat and steam not captured via electricity and gas 
consumption where we are again charged via the service 
to the landlord.
Data quality
The Group’ s consumption data comes from two main sources:
• consumption bills from suppliers/reports from property agents 
(exact data); and
• approximations based on exact data (estimated data).
The Group has used estimated data in some cases due to the 
lack of complete data for electricity consumption. The section 
below details the approach the Group have taken to complete 
these data gaps.
• Where buildings had incomplete electricity consumption 
figures for certain months over the current reporting period, 
a conservative approach for estimating this data was chosen. 
The methodology used was to apply a daily consumption 
figure calculated by using the month in the dataset with 
the highest electricity consumption to the months that had 
missing data.
• In instances where no electricity data was held, the 
methodology was calculated using the buildings with 
exact and complete data to calculate average electricity 
consumption per square metre for each month in the current 
reporting period. The monthly average consumption per 
square metre was used to estimate the monthly electricity 
consumption of buildings with no electricity data, based on 
individual floor areas. 40

We also have key relationships with banks, custodians and 
asset managers, who enable the Group to manage client assets, 
the Group’ s cash and to invest in investment funds on behalf 
of clients.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNANCE
“ A company which is able to deliver value to customers  
is underpinned by  high governance standards set by the  
Board and implemented across the organisation. ”
Simon Miller
Chairman Dear Shareholder,
Good corporate governance is critical to the delivery of value to 
the Group’ s stakeholders and this section of the report describes 
how the Group is governed and managed. It also explains 
how the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(‘the Code’) have been applied throughout the year. The Board 
is responsible to shareholders for the overall management 
and oversight of the Group and for its long-term success. 
In particular, the Board is responsible for agreeing strategy, 
monitoring financial performance, setting and monitoring risk 
appetite and maintaining an effective system of internal controls. 
Following the 2014 Board evaluation, some changes have 
been implemented to improve the effectiveness of the Board. 
Agendas have been restructured to ensure that more time is 
devoted to strategy and other forward looking issues. There have 
been further improvements to the flow of management 
information which is critical in enabling good Board debate 
and challenge of management. The Board evaluation process 
was conducted internally this year and the open feedback from 
all Directors has been valuable in clarifying what is working 
well and what would benefit from change. The main issues 
raised included the growth of the business in the context of the 
Group’ s strategic objectives, the scope of internal audit and the 
connection between the Group’ s Board Risk and Remuneration 
Committees. Actions to improve the Board’ s effectiveness in 
these areas are being developed. 
Succession
Since I became Chairman in 2013, four new Non-Executive 
Directors have been appointed, bringing new skills and 
experience to the Board. Angela Knight will reach the ninth 
anniversary of her appointment in July 2016. The Board believes 
that it is in shareholders’ best interests for her to remain on the 
Board so that we can benefit from her extensive knowledge 
and experience of both the Group and the wealth management 
industry. The Board believes that she continues to make a 
valuable contribution, both as a Non-Executive Director and as 
the Senior Independent Director and remains independent in 
every respect. 
Diversity
In last year’ s Annual Report, the Board indicated that it wished 
to achieve the recommended diversity target of at least 25% 
female Directors on the Board by September 2015. This was 
achieved with the appointment of Kath Cates in December 
2014. She became Chairman of the Board Risk Committee on 
1 September 2015 as part of the planned changes to refresh 
committee membership. 
Annual General Meeting
I would like to encourage our shareholders to attend our 
Annual General Meeting which will be held at 11.30 am on 
5 February 2016, at The Lincoln Centre, 18 Lincoln’ s Inn Fields, 
London WC2A 3ED.

Information Board composition
At the year end the Board comprised the Chairman, three Executive Directors and five Non-Executive Directors. The names of the 
Directors serving at the end of the year and their biographies are set out on pages 46 to 47. 
Kath Cates was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 18 December 2014. Sir Stephen Lamport and Michael Williams both 
retired at the AGM on 20 February 2015.
Independence
The Chairman satisfied the independence criteria of the Code on his appointment as Chairman in March 2013 and all of the 
Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent in accordance with provision B.1.1 of the Code, and have 
been so throughout the year. The Non-Executive Directors provide a strong, independent element on the Board and are well placed 
to constructively challenge and scrutinise the performance of management. They bring robust opinions, knowledge and skill to 
Board discussions. 
Angela Knight will reach the ninth anniversary of her appointment in July 2016. The Board has concluded that it is in shareholders’ 
interests for her to remain on the Board. The Board is convinced that Angela continues to make a valuable contribution to the Board 
and that her experience provides balance to the more recently appointed members of the Board. 
Board evaluation
A formal evaluation of the Board and its Committees is carried out on an annual basis and at least every three years is facilitated by an 
independent third party. The last external evaluation was conducted in 2014 by Trust Associates Limited, who had no other links to 
the Group. 
For the 2015 Board evaluation, the Chairman held individual meetings with each Director to obtain their views on how well the Board 
was operating and to identify areas where improvements can be made. The result of these discussions was considered by the Board 
and actions to address improvement areas will be developed. These include the growth of the business in the context of the Group’ s 
strategic objectives, the scope of internal audit, and the connection between the Board Risk and Remuneration Committees.
Overall, the evaluation process confirmed that the Board was operating effectively within a culture that allowed open and challenging 
debate and that all Directors individually made valuable contributions and demonstrated commitment to the role.
Appointment of Directors
The Company’ s Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 and other applicable regulations and policies govern the appointment 
of the Directors. The Directors’ service agreements or letters of appointment (as applicable) are available for viewing via the Company 
Secretary. Directors may be elected by shareholders in a general meeting or appointed by the Board of Directors in accordance with 
the provisions of the Articles of Association. In accordance with the Code, all Directors will be subject to annual re-election at the Annual 
General Meeting. The Nomination Committee is responsible for managing the search process for new Directors and recommends 
to the Board the appointment of new Directors. Further details of this process are set out in the Nomination Committee Report on 
page 62.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED Development
All new Directors participate in a full induction programme, taking into account any previous experience they may already have as 
Directors of a public limited company or otherwise. The induction programme for new Directors will typically include meetings with the 
Executive Directors and members of the senior management team covering the Board, the business, finance, risk and compliance, 
operations and key change programmes as well as branch visits.
Training sessions are undertaken for the entire Board and individually as appropriate. The whole Board training programme for 
the year included briefings on the Directors’ duties in a regulated entity and changes which had developed in the last year, FCA 
enforcement actions and obligations under the Model Code as well as updates on the senior managers’ regime, risk management 
and internal control and detailed briefings from the business.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Board has a policy and effective procedures for managing and, where appropriate, approving conflicts or potential conflicts of 
interest. It is a recurring agenda item at all Board meetings and gives each Director the opportunity to raise any conflict of interest 
they may have, or to update the Board on any change to a previous conflict of interest already lodged. A Register of Conflicts is 
held by the Company Secretary and a log of all conflicts raised is maintained and updated accordingly. All Directors are aware that 
it is their responsibility to raise and update any conflicts of interest they may have. Whenever a Director takes on additional external 
responsibilities, the Chairman considers any potential conflicts that may arise, and whether the Director continues to have sufficient 
time to fulfil their duties as a Director. If a potential conflict exists, the Board is empowered to authorise potential conflicts and agree 
what measures, if any, are required to mitigate or manage the conflict of interest. 
Internal control and risk management
The Board recognises that its risk management strategy is essential for achieving good business governance to protect stakeholders 
and enhance shareholder value. The Board has adopted a risk-based approach to establish a system of internal control. It reviews its 
effectiveness periodically, by receiving ongoing reports on internal control from the Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee. 
The Board debates the key risks for the Group, following more detailed work by the Board Risk Committee, and sets the Group’ s Risk 
Appetite Statements.
An explanation of the Group’ s risk framework is given in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties disclosure on page 30.
The Directors are responsible for the system of internal control established by the Group, reviewing its effectiveness and reporting to 
the shareholders that they have done so.
They report as follows:
(i)  There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group as explained the 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties section on pages 30 to 33 and the report from the Board Risk Committee on pages 53 to 55. 
This has been in place for the period under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. It is reviewed 
by the Board and accords with the revised Turnbull guidance in the Code. Any system of internal control is designed to highlight 
and manage rather than to eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has implemented the ‘Three Lines of Defence’ model to 
ensure a robust and effective framework to manage internal controls and risks across the organisation. 
(ii)  The Directors have reviewed the Group’ s system of internal controls and compliance monitoring and believe that these provide 
assurance that problems have been identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately throughout the period under review 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. Both the Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee 
assist the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.
(iii)  There is a whistleblowing policy detailing the internal or external procedures through which employees are able to raise 
any concerns.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board on all Corporate Governance matters as well as working with the 
Chairman to ensure good information flows within the Board and its Committees. All Directors have access to the services of the 
Company Secretary and may take, if necessary, independent, professional advice at the Company’ s expense.

Relationship with shareholders
The Group places a great deal of importance on communication with shareholders and aims to keep shareholders informed 
through regular communication. The Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director meet regularly with the Group’ s institutional 
investors, analysts and financial press. Annual and interim reports are distributed to other parties who may have an interest in the 
Group’ s performance and the Group’ s website is kept up-to-date covering all corporate activity. The Board is provided with regular 
feedback following meetings with shareholders. The Board recognises the importance of ensuring effective communication with 
all of its shareholders and welcomes all shareholders to its AGM, with the opportunity to ask questions formally at the meeting or 
informally afterwards. 
Statement of compliance with the Code
The Group is subject to the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’), which was issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 
2010 and revised in September 2012 and September 2014. 
This Corporate Governance Statement, the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Audit Committee Report, the Board Risk Committee 
Report, the Nomination Committee Report and the Strategic Report explain how the provisions set out in the Code have been applied 
and detail the Group’ s compliance with the provisions of the Code for the year. The Directors consider that the Company has been in 
compliance with the provisions set out in the Code throughout the financial year ended 30 September 2015, except for the following:
• In designing schemes of performance related remuneration, the remuneration of Directors fully complies with the provisions in 
Section D to the Code, save for Michael Williams, who was an Executive Director until 20 February 2015, which did not fully 
comply with Section D.1.1 and Schedule A of the Code. Michael Williams’ variable remuneration is determined by reference to his 
own team’ s investment management performance in line with other Investment Managers within the Group. One-third of variable 
remuneration above £50,000 is compulsorily deferred into shares. The Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 64 to 79 provides 
details of the Remuneration Policy and implementation of that policy for all Directors.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED Board Risk Committee 
Chairman’s overview
Kath Cates succeeded Angela Knight as Chairman of the 
Committee on 1 September 2015. 
The identification, control, mitigation and reporting of risks 
is a fundamental aspect of operating in the financial sector. 
Good practice requires a sound understanding of the Group’ s 
risks, our appetite for risk taking and mitigations to limit 
downsides. This will continue to be the underlying focus of the 
Committee. A risk workshop was held in November 2015 to 
enable a more strategic review of the Group’ s key risks and to 
develop a forward agenda for the Committee for 2016. Areas of 
particular focus will include working with the Board on strategic 
and business risks, cyber risk, regulatory change, investment 
governance and economic environment.
Last year, the Committee focused on the development of a risk 
framework and much of this year has been spent implementing 
the changes that flowed from that work. The project to 
implement the Operational Risk Framework is nearing 
completion, and a new project to formalise the Conduct Risk 
Framework is underway. This, combined with continued work 
on the Investment Governance systems and processes during 
2015, has strengthened the way that the Group identifies and 
manages its key risks. The Committee’ s role has been to review 
and challenge this work and recommend outcomes for approval 
by the Board where appropriate.
Another key area of work undertaken by the Committee has 
been to oversee the progress of implementing the enhanced 
Client Advice Process. This project is continuing to improve client 
service and ensures that clients receive suitable advice.
As well as the regular cycle of agenda items and review of 
management information, the Committee has reviewed deep 
dives of key risks to the business throughout the year, providing 
oversight of the approved risk appetite so that it remains 
appropriate and that risk tolerance is set to a relevant level. 
This has resulted in further enhancements to the metrics used to 
monitor risk profile against the risk appetite.

BOARD RISK COMMITTEE REPORT Role and responsibilities of the Board Risk Committee
The Board Risk Committee is a standing Committee of the Board established to provide oversight of the Risk Management 
Framework and to assist the Board with its responsibilities for the integrity of the Group’ s internal control and risk management 
systems. It does this by: 
• Overseeing the Group’ s Risk Management Infrastructure in relation to all of the material risk areas faced by the firm, including but 
not limited to: business and strategic risk, operational risk, regulatory risk, financial risks, conduct risk and investment governance.
• Assisting the Board in establishing appropriate levels of risk appetite and tolerance as well as communicating and monitoring risk 
culture within the organisation.
• Measuring and monitoring the Group’ s material risk exposures and ensuring appropriate mitigation is in place to manage them.
• Overseeing and supporting the Group Risk and Compliance Director ensuring there is adequate resource and an appropriate level 
of independence.
• Assisting the Board in managing risks associated with the Group’ s strategy, in particular being vigilant and alert to changes in the 
external risk environment.
The Committee receives a report on operational and regulatory issues at every meeting and other key matters arising from the 
executive Risk Management Committee (‘RMC’). The purpose of the RMC, acting on behalf of the Group Executive Committee, is to 
implement the Risk Management Framework and monitor risk performance of the Group. It assists the Board Risk Committee with 
analysing the integrity of the Group’ s internal control environment and risk management systems and ensures that the necessary 
Group policies are created, the risk management frameworks are developed and understood within the organisation and has a role in 
considering the consolidated Group capital assessments from a risk perspective.
The Board Risk Committee reports on its proceedings to the Board and on any appropriate matters to the Audit Committee. It identifies 
issues where it considers action and improvements are needed and makes recommendations on the steps to be taken.
The Committee has reviewed its terms of reference during the year in conjunction with the Audit Committee to ensure that the 
roles and responsibilities of each are clear and areas of overlap are minimised. T erms of reference are then referred to the Board 
for approval.
Committee members
The Committee was chaired by Angela Knight until 1 September 2015 and since then has been chaired by Kath Cates, who was 
appointed as a member of the Committee on 23 March 2015. Angela remains a member of the Committee, along with a further two 
independent Non-Executive Directors, Ian Dewar and Paul Wilson. Standing attendees include the Chief Executive, Finance Director, 
Head of Wealth and Investment Management, and the Group Risk and Compliance Director. Representatives from internal and 
external audit are invited to attend meetings, where appropriate. 
Committee activities
The Committee has met five times during the year and attendance at those meetings is shown on page 52 of the Corporate 
Governance Report. The work of the Committee has followed an agreed annual work plan, which evolved during the year in response 
to changes in both the external and regulatory environments. 
During the year the Committee undertook the following activities:
Group risk framework
Reviewed and challenged key components of the Risk Management Framework which included risk evaluation matrices, risk 
appetite, risk policies, risk scenarios, stress testing and the ICAAP process. A new Conduct Risk project was launched during the 
year and the Committee approved the design of the Conduct Risk Framework and monitored the progress of the project against the 
approved plan.

appropriate and that there were no emerging risks that were not currently included.
Regulatory oversight
Maintained oversight of regulatory risks throughout the Group and discussed the specific management actions identified to address 
or mitigate issues which arose during the year. The Committee receives regular updates on upstream regulatory changes which may 
impact the Group’ s business, as well as industry regulatory enforcement notices which identify lessons relevant to the Group. 
Reporting
Reviewed regular reports from the Group Risk and Compliance Director covering regulatory engagement in the period, key 
operational risk findings, compliance monitoring activities, regulatory developments, complaints data, financial crime policy, key 
activities and progress against plans and resources.
ICAAP
Reviewed, challenged and approved key components of the ICAAP such as the Risk Appetite Statements and the Operational Risk 
Scenarios as well as stress testing and reverse stress testing the business. During November 2015, the Committee and the Audit 
Committee held a joint session to review and challenge the ICAAP , after which its approval was recommended to the Board.

The Group’ s Risk Management Framework describes the environment in which risks are identified, recorded, assigned clear 
ownership, analysed and measured, controlled, monitored, reported, and governed within risk appetite and tolerances set by the 
Board. It also includes the ICAAP which, amongst other things, assesses and monitors the amount of capital the Group should hold 
against its risks. A detailed description of the Group’ s Risk Management Framework is set out in the Strategic Report on page 31.
Risks and uncertainties
The Group’ s principal risks are assessed and reviewed by the RMC, subsequently reviewed by the Board Risk Committee and then 
considered by the Board. The register of principal risks is formally approved by the Board. A description of the Group’ s principal risks 
and uncertainties together with the key mitigants and controls is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 32 to 33.
The Group’ s principal risks are categorised as Business and Strategic Risks, Financial Risks and Operational Risks. The Group has 
deployed a range of preventative and detective controls which, together with insurance, mitigate its risks.
The Committee keeps these risks under regular review to ensure that the Group manages its risk profile within its appetite and 
capacity for risk.

Audit Committee Chairman’s overview
The Audit Committee reviews and reports to the Board on the 
Group’ s financial reporting, systems of internal control and the 
independence and effectiveness of the internal and the external 
auditor. It has a particular focus on the annual and half year 
financial statements and the areas of significant management 
judgement used in preparation. In addition to its regular activities 
the Committee explores in greater depth areas of particular 
interest and relevance to the Group, by means of a series of 
‘deep dives’. This year these included client assets, technology 
and the closure of management actions taken in response to 
internal audit findings. 
One of the Committee’ s new tasks at the end of the year was 
to review the Viability Statement and its underlying processes, in 
order to be able to recommend to the Board that the statement 
represents robust and realistic forecasting, taking into account 
the business, industry and macro-economic factors. The Viability 
Statement has been included in the Strategic Report on page 29. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) continued as the internal 
auditor during 2015. The Committee approves the Annual 
Internal Audit Plan and reviews regular reports from PwC on their 
audit findings. There has been a particular focus during the year 
on ensuring there is a consistent methodology for capturing, 
tracking and closing actions arising from both the internal and 
external auditors’ findings and those identified internally by 
management or as part of the Operational Risk Framework. 
The Committee is conscious of the Code requirements relating 
to tender of external audit and plans to conduct a formal external 
audit tender during the course of the current partner’ s five year 
term. The Committee has conducted a formal assessment of 
the effectiveness of the external auditor and is satisfied that they 
continue to provide an effective audit.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED Significant issues related to the financial statements
The Committee reviewed the following significant critical judgements and key estimates in connection with the Group Accounts for 
the year ended 30 September 2015. These issues were addressed with management at various stages during 2014/15 and during 
the preparation and finalisation of the Accounts. After reviewing the presentations and reports from management, the Committee is 
satisfied that the Accounts appropriately address the critical judgements and key estimates, both in respect of the amounts reported 
and the disclosures made. The Committee discussed these issues with the auditor during the audit planning process and during 
the completion of the year end audit and is satisfied that its conclusions are in line with those drawn by the auditor in relation to 
these issues.
Issue Key considerations Role of the Committee Conclusion
Treatment and disclosure 
of the disposal of 
Stocktrade (see note 
4.a.i.)
Appropriate application of accounting 
standards in relation to the disposal of 
Stocktrade, specifically: 
• the determination of the point at 
which control of the discontinued 
operation transfers to the acquirer, 
as set out in the terms of the sale 
and purchase agreement, and 
therefore the point at which the 
consideration for the sale should 
be recognised; 
• the identification of onerous 
contracts, relating to the 
discontinued operation, their 
measurement and the point at which 
they should be recognised; and
• appropriate disclosure of 
the transaction.
The Committee considered 
management’ s paper on 
the accounting treatment of 
the disposal of Stocktrade 
and challenged both the 
judgement and application of the 
accounting standards.
It was concluded that the application of 
accounting standards result in: 
• the non-recognition of the 
consideration for the disposal of 
Stocktrade in the Accounts for the 
year ended 30 September 2015. 
The consideration will only be 
recognised when control passes to 
the acquirer;
• the recognition of a provision for 
onerous contracts in relation to the 
discontinued operation in the current 
period, as there are contracts where 
future economic costs exceed the 
future economic benefits; and
• disclosure as set out in note 13.
Carrying value of goodwill 
and client relationships 
(see notes 4.a.ii. and 
4.b.i.)
The ongoing appropriateness of the 
policy concerning the assessment of 
acquisition expenses relating to client 
relationships to ensure continuing 
appropriate recognition as either an 
operating expense or a capital cost 
subject to amortisation.
Impairment review of goodwill and 
client relationships, including valuation 
assumptions used in the calculation 
of the fair value of the relevant 
cash-generating units.
Determination of the useful economic 
life of client relationships which 
establishes the quantum of the 
amortisation expense.
The Committee satisfied itself on 
the valuation assumptions used 
in the calculation of the fair value 
of the cash-generating units, and 
considered the paper prepared 
by management on the average 
client tenure and useful economic 
life expectations.
It reviewed management’ s paper 
on the judgements required for the 
recognition of expenses in relation 
to client relationships. 
It noted that the only additions to 
client relationships in the period 
related to revaluations of deferred 
consideration payments for 
acquisitions made in prior periods.
It was concluded that the assumptions 
and judgements used in determining 
the carrying value of goodwill and 
client relationships were appropriate 
and reasonable.
Assumptions underlying 
the calculation of the 
retirement benefit 
obligation (see note 4.b.ii.)
Determination of the actuarial 
assumptions such as discount rate, 
life expectancy of members of the 
scheme and inflation rate used in the 
calculation of the retirement benefit 
scheme deficit.
The Committee considered 
management’ s paper explaining 
the assumptions used in the 
calculation, the resulting impact on 
the deficit and the movement in the 
deficit during the period.
It was concluded that the assumptions 
and judgements used in determining 
the retirement benefit obligation were 
appropriate and reasonable.
Likelihood of meeting 
performance conditions 
for the Long T erm 
Incentive Plan (see note 
4.b.iii.)
Determination of the likelihood of 
meeting the performance conditions 
which impact the quantum of the 
expense in the period.
The Committee considered 
management’ s paper on the 
basis of the assumptions for 
the likelihood of meeting the 
performance conditions.
It was concluded that the assumptions 
used in the calculation of the expense 
were appropriate and reasonable.

Issue Key considerations Role of the Committee Conclusion
Assumptions underlying 
the estimation of 
provisions (see note 
4.b.iv.)
Appropriate application of 
accounting standards and underlying 
recognition principles.
Determination of the best estimate 
of the likely cash flows and other 
assumptions related to each type 
of provision.
The Committee reviewed 
management’ s paper explaining 
the assumptions and calculation 
methodologies applied in the 
determination of provisions, 
including ensuring that the 
provisions represent present 
obligations arising from past events. 
It also satisfied itself that the 
procedures performed by 
management to identify the 
requirement for provisions were 
robust and comprehensive.
It noted that there had been 
a refinement of the estimation 
methodology for the calculation 
of the leasehold dilapidations 
provision and satisfied itself that 
there was appropriate disclosure 
in the Accounts.
It was concluded that the provisions 
were appropriate and complete for 
obligations that existed at the year 
end and that there had been no new 
information following the year end 
that would result in an adjustment 
to provisions.
External auditor
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, implementation and monitoring of the Group’ s policy on external audit. 
The policy sets out the categories of any pre-approved non-audit services which the external auditor are authorised to undertake and 
provides an approval process for the provision of any other non-audit services. This policy is available to view on the Investor Relations 
section of the Group’ s website, under the Board Committees subsection.
The Board generally only uses the auditor for audit and related activities. If there is a business case to use the external auditor for the 
provision of non-audit services, prior permission is required from the Committee, which will review the proposal to ensure that it will 
not impact the auditor’ s objectivity and independence. The majority of tax advisory and similar work is carried out by another major 
accountancy firm. An analysis of auditor’ s remuneration is provided in note 9 to the Annual Report and Accounts.
The Committee assess the effectiveness of the external auditor on an annual basis, taking account of the following factors:
Factor Assessment
The audit partner The extent to which the partner demonstrates a strong understanding of the business and industry and the 
challenges faced by the business, and the length of time acting as the lead engagement partner. 
The audit team The extent to which the audit team understand the business and industry and are properly resourced 
and experienced.
The audit approach That the audit approach is discussed with management and targets the significant issues early, is communicated 
properly, is appropriate for the business and industry and includes an appropriate level of materiality.
The role of management That information provided by management is timely and correct with proper supporting papers, and that 
accounting systems and internal controls work effectively. 
The communications and formal 
reporting by the auditor
That management and the Committee are kept appropriately informed as the audit progresses and that the 
formal report is appropriate and contains all relevant material matters.
The independence and 
objectivity of the auditor
That the auditor complies with the Financial Reporting Council’ s ethical standards, has the required degree of 
objectivity including their arrangements to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest, and that the 
overall extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditor does not compromise independence.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED Following its review of the effectiveness of the 2014/15 audit, the Committee is satisfied that the external auditor, Deloitte, continues to 
provide an effective audit and recommended to the Board that reappointment of the auditor be proposed to shareholders at the 2016 
AGM. In accordance with UK regulations, the Group’ s auditor adheres to a rotation policy based on best practice and a new Group 
lead engagement partner is appointed in place of the previous lead engagement partner once he has completed a term of five years 
in that role. The lead audit partner was first appointed for the 2013/14 audit. 
The Committee has considered the UK Corporate Governance Code provision for companies to put the external audit contract out to 
tender at least every 10 years and also the Financial Reporting Council’ s guidance on aligning the timing of such re-tenders with audit 
engagement partner rotation. It has also noted the transitional arrangements with respect to audit tendering to fit the five-yearly cycle 
of partner rotation. The Committee’ s current intention is that it will initiate a re-tendering process before the end of the current audit 
partner’ s rotation (2017/2018). This will be kept under review and the Committee will use its regular reviews of auditor effectiveness to 
assess the most appropriate time for such a re-tender during that period.
The Committee has considered the likelihood of a withdrawal of the external auditor from the market and noted that there are no 
contractual obligations to restrict the choice of replacement external auditor.
The external auditor meets privately with the Committee at least twice a year without senior executive management being present.
Internal audit
The internal audit function for the financial year ended 30 September 2015 was conducted by PwC, who have provided internal 
audit services to the Group since January 2014. The Committee conducts a formal assessment of the effectiveness of the Internal 
Auditor annually.
Fair, balanced and understandable report and accounts
The Committee has performed a review of the report and accounts to ensure that it is fair, balanced and understandable. What is 
meant by these terms, and the questions that the Committee considers as part of this review, are shown below:
Term Description Questions
Fair • Not exhibiting any bias
• Reasonable or impartial
• Performed according to the rules
• Is the whole story being presented?
• Have any sensitive material areas been omitted?
Balanced • Even-handed
• T aking account of all sides on their merits 
without prejudice or favouritism
• Is there a good level of consistency between the front 
and back sections of the Annual Report?
• Does the reader get the same message from reading 
the two sections independently?
• Are the key judgements referred to in the narrative 
reports and the significant issues reported in the Audit 
Committee Report consistent with the disclosures of 
key estimates and uncertainties and critical judgements 
set out in the financial statements?
Understandable • Having a meaning or nature that can 
be understood
• Able to be accepted as normal
• Is there a clear and cohesive framework for the 
Annual Report?
• Is the report written in accessible language?
• Are the messages clearly drawn out?
Ensuring that this standard is met requires continuous assessment of the financial reporting issues affecting the Group on a year 
round basis, in addition to a focused review as part of the Annual Report and Accounts production process.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
“ An effective board is composed of a 
mix of skills while careful succession 
planning ensures it remains effective 
from period to period. ”
Simon Miller
Chairman
Nomination Committee 
Chairman’s overview 
The Committee’ s key objective is to support the Board in 
fulfilling its responsibilities to ensure there is a formal, rigorous 
and transparent process for the appointment of new Directors 
to the Board, and to ensure that effective succession planning 
processes are in place across the Group.
The Nomination Committee (the ‘Committee’) has continued 
to review the composition of the Board during the year and 
made recommendations to the Board on the appointment 
of Kath Cates as a new Non-Executive Director to refresh 
the Board. The Committee also reviewed the composition of 
the Board Committees and made recommendations to the 
Board for changes which utilised the experience of the newly 
appointed Director. 
In addition to the focus on Board and Committee composition, 
the Nomination Committee has reviewed the succession plans at 
both Board and senior management level.
Role and responsibilities
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the composition 
of the Board and Board Committees to ensure they are 
properly constituted and balanced in terms of skills, experience 
and diversity. It does this through a formal assessment of 
each Director’ s skills and experience to identify any skills 
gaps that need to be addressed and to assist with Board 
succession planning.
In addition to this, the Committee manages the search process 
for new Directors, recommends to the Board the appointment of 
new Directors and considers succession plans for the Board and 
other senior roles.
Committee members
The Committee comprises Simon Miller (Chairman), Angela 
Knight, Caroline T aylor and Paul Wilson. David Nicol was a 
member until 3 November 2015. Attendance at meetings during 
the year is set out on page 52.
Committee activities
The Committee identified the need to add an additional 
Non-Executive Director to the Board, to improve the Executive/
Non-Executive balance and to refresh the Chairmanship of the 
Board Risk Committee. Having previously used external search 
consultants Egon Zehnder to assist with the drawing up of role 
specifications and the identification of suitable candidates for 
the appointment of Paul Wilson and Ian Dewar, the Committee 
felt able to identify a suitable candidate for the role through its 
existing contact base. Accordingly, Kath Cates was identified, 
interviewed, referenced and appointed. 63

Additional 
Information
The Committee discusses succession on a continuing basis. 
It examines the requirements for Executive and Non-Executive 
Director roles and is kept informed of the work which is carried 
out on other senior roles within the Group. It considers the 
consequences of both short and long-term change within the 
Board and has plans to deal with both such eventualities. 
The Committee formally considered the continuing appointment 
of Angela Knight, the Senior Independent Director, who was 
appointed in July 2007, including considering whether there 
was any evidence that her independence has been impaired by 
the length of her service on the Board. It was concluded that it 
is in shareholders’ interests for Angela to remain on the Board 
and that there is no evidence that her independence has been 
impaired. Angela continues to make a valuable contribution to 
the Board and her experience provides balance to the more 
recently appointed members of the Board. 
The composition of the Committee was reviewed and David 
Nicol ceased to be a member on 3 November 2015, in 
accordance with the FCA’ s SYSC handbook which requires 
the Committee to comprise exclusively of Non-Executive 
Directors. David Nicol will be a standing attendee at the 
Committee’ s meetings. 
Diversity
The Board believes that appointments should be based on 
merit, compared against objective criteria, with the ultimate 
aim of ensuring the Board has the right skills, knowledge 
and experience to discharge its responsibilities properly. 
Consideration of the benefits of diversity on the Board in all its 
aspects, including gender, is an important part of this process 
but not the sole reason. The Board has 33% of women members 
which is in excess of the 25% aim reported last year. One in 
six of the Executive Committee are female. Further information 
on diversity within the Group can be found in the Corporate 
Responsibility section on page 35.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
“Remuneration policies and practices 
must drive behaviour that is in 
the long-term interests of clients 
and shareholders, and support the 
corporate strategy . ”
Paul Wilson
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Remuneration Committee 
Chairman’s overview
As always, the Committee has focused on executive 
remuneration to ensure that the levels of fixed remuneration 
are appropriate, and that variable remuneration is designed 
to incentivise action aligned to strategic goals in a way that 
promotes effective risk management. Shareholders approved 
the Remuneration Policy as set out in the 2013 Annual Report at 
the 2014 Annual General Meeting, and this policy will apply until 
replaced by a new or amended policy. The policy continues to 
remain appropriate and should therefore continue to operate for 
2015/16. Key features include:
–  A clear link to business strategy through performance 
metrics in both short and long-term incentive plans. Both the 
bonus and the Long T erm Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) targets 
are disclosed.
–  A significant proportion of the annual bonus is subject to 
compulsory deferral for three years.
–  The LTIP is delivered in shares, and there is a post-vesting 
holding period of two years during which shares cannot 
be sold.
–  Executives are required to build and retain a significant 
shareholding in the Company.
– Notice periods are six months from the Company.
The Annual Report on Remuneration describes the 
implementation of the policy during the year and will be subject 
to an advisory vote at the 2016 AGM.
No changes to the base salaries of Executive Directors have 
been made at the 1 October 2015 review date. However, the 
Committee is undertaking a review of the positioning of Executive 
Director base pay. Base pay has not been increased since the 
appointment of the current Executives in 2013, which, at that 
time, had been positioned conservatively. Market benchmarking 
indicates that current base pay has fallen further below a 
competitive level and also does not recognise the level of 
performance delivered by the Executive Directors. In addition, 
it is important to note that the Executive Directors do not receive 
any pension contribution from the Company and fringe benefits 
are limited to life cover only. We are currently undertaking 
consultations with shareholders regarding our approach to 
base pay. We shall report fully on the conclusions from this, and 
actions taken, in next year’ s Remuneration Report.
In addition to its focus on Executive Directors’ remuneration, 
the Committee has received reports from the Executive on 
progress against plans to strengthen the alignment of reward and 
performance throughout the Group. This includes improvements 
to the performance management process and year end 
compensation processes for the 2014/15 performance year. 
Performance for the annual bonus for the 2014/15 year was 
at, or close to, target level for the financial metrics despite the 
negative market performance experienced in the second half of 
the year. The Executive Directors performed well against their 
non-financial criteria which included strategic projects, client 
service, risk management and employees. Accordingly, the 
Committee awarded bonuses at the ‘on target’ level of 100% of 
base salary. This is a 17% reduction from the 2014 bonus award, 
reflecting the financial challenges faced by the Group during 
the year. Further details of the Committee’ s assessment of the 
Executive Directors’ performance and their 2015 bonus awards 
are included on page 66 of this report. There was no LTIP vesting 
this year, as the first award matures in 2016.
One of the focuses for next year will be the outcome of 
the European Banking Authority’ s consultation on sound 
remuneration policies, which may have significant implications 
for the Group’ s remuneration policy for senior executives. 
The Committee will engage with key institutional investors and 
shareholder representative bodies in advance of any significant 
changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

Note 1:   Executives can elect to use part of their total fixed remuneration to fund benefits including Permanent Health Insurance and Private Medical Insurance and these amounts are disclosed as part 
of the ‘salary and fees’ figure. Benefits relate to death in service insurance.
Note 2:  Executives can elect to sacrifice fixed remuneration into the Group defined contribution pension scheme. No Director received an employer’ s contribution during the year.
Note 3:  This relates to the payment of the annual bonus for the year ending 30 September 2015. Annual bonus is subject to a mandatory deferral policy as set out on page 76. Directors can elect to 
sacrifice part of their annual bonus into the Company defined contribution pension scheme but there are no matching employer contributions for any such sacrificed amount. Stephen Ford was 
the only Director to do this during the year (£40,000).
Note 4:  There are no long-term incentives vesting to Executive Directors during the relevant period. Awards granted under the Deferred Profit Share Plan are included in the bonus amount disclosed in 
the year awarded.
Note 5: The were no payments made to Directors who resigned in the year except that Michael Williams continues as an employee since his resignation from the Board on 20 February 2015.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 2015
Annual bonuses for the Chief Executive, Finance Director, and Head of Wealth and Investment Management are determined by the 
Committee based on an assessment of performance relative to criteria which are selected to achieve a direct relationship between 
progress towards the Group’ s strategic goals and the bonuses that are awarded. Michael Williams was a Director until his resignation 
from the Board on 20 February 2015 and his bonus award, as an Investment Manager, is primarily assessed in relation to the 
profitability of his Investment Management team.
Figure 2.1 below shows the performance criteria that were set by the Committee, their weightings and the Committee’ s assessment 
of performance for the year.

The reported adjusted profit before tax for the 2015 financial year is £62.2 million. This excludes £1.3 million of profit relating to Stocktrade which has been classified as discontinued operations. For the 
purposes of comparing achievement with the original PBT target set for Executive Directors in 2014, this £1.3 million has been added back to adjusted PBT . Additionally, a notional Euroclear plc dividend 
of £450,000 has been added back as the forecast used to set the PBT target for the year assumed Euroclear plc dividends which were not received due to the sale of the investment during the year, 
the proceeds from which have already been excluded. These two adjustments give an adjusted profit before tax for the year of £64.0 million which ensures that results and targets are compared on a 
like-for-like basis, and that the performance outcome is not disadvantaged by the sale of those businesses, which is in alignment with the strategic objective of focusing on the core discretionary business.

KPIs on page 21.
A technology strategy has been agreed and is being implemented.
The goal of divesting Stocktrade as part of the strategic focus on the 
core business of discretionary management was achieved in the year with 
completion due in 2016.
Net organic growth targets of 5% were achieved despite the distraction of

Employees Directors instigated a three-year plan to review all aspects of Culture and 
Engagement, Learning and Development, Performance and Reward, and 
Talent. This has resulted in initiatives to improve recruitment and retention of 
the best talent (attrition rates are within accepted risk parameters; employee 
engagement is above the financial services average at 76%), and the 
performance management process has been relaunched and supported

 Bonus is shown pro-rata for the period of the performance year Michael Williams was a Director (29 September 2014 to 20 February 2015).
With the exception of Michael Williams, the maximum annual bonus for each individual Executive Director is 150% of total fixed pay.
Annual bonus awards are delivered part in cash and part in deferred shares that vest after three years. Figure 2.3 shows how the split 
is calculated:

Portion of variable pay Fraction deferred
Up to £50,000 None
Between £50,000 and 1 x fixed remuneration One-third
Above 1 x fixed remuneration Two-thirds
In Michael Williams’ case, as he is an Investment Manager with significantly lower base pay, the first £50,000 is in cash, and the 
balance above £50,000 is two-thirds cash/one-third shares.
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the final outcome upwards or downwards in the event that an exceptional event outside 
of the Executive Directors’ control occurs which, in the Committee’ s opinion, materially affected the bonus out-turn. There were no 
such events during 2015.
Both the cash and share element of the bonus is subject to clawback. Please see the Directors’ Remuneration Policy table, starting 
on page 76, for further details. 68

Deferred bonus
The Executive Directors receive part of their annual variable pay under the DPSP as a deferred award in Brewin Dolphin Holdings 
PLC shares, normally in the form of options with a zero exercise price. These options are subject to service conditions and vest in one 
tranche three years from the date of grant.
Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’)
The Group has a Share Incentive Plan. Employees may use funds from their gross salary up to a maximum of 10% of their gross 
salary in regular monthly payments (being not less than £10 and not greater than £125) to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company 
(‘Partnership Shares’). Partnership Shares are acquired monthly. For every Partnership Share purchased, the employee receives one 
matching share up to a total value of £20 per month. All shares to date awarded under this scheme have been purchased in the 
market on a monthly basis; it is the intention of the Directors to continue this policy in the year to September 2016. 
Share schemes under which no awards were made in 2015
2004 Approved Share Option Plan (‘ASOP’)
Awards under the ASOP have been historically granted to Directors and other employees. These awards have been subject to a 
condition that the year-on-year growth in annual fee income charged on portfolios shall not be less than 10% p.a. compound or a 
33% increase in annual fee income over a three-year period. The performance criteria were set by the Remuneration Committee at 
the time of grant and selected to recognise that income growth is a key driver of shareholder value.
The options are exercisable from five to 10 years from grant. These options were only granted once an employee had been with the 
Group for two years. Awards have not been made under the ASOP since 2011. The Board does not intend to issue any options or 
shares under this scheme in 2016.
2002 Senior Employee Matching Purchase Share Scheme (‘SEMP’)
Awards have not been made under this scheme since 2009. The SEMP was additional to the above scheme and allowed a further 
5% issue of options over a ten-year period, provided that a similar number of shares were subscribed for by senior executives at the 
price the options are issued. The Board does not intend to issue any options or shares under this scheme in the future.
Dilution
By agreement with shareholders, the aggregate number of shares which may be issued at any date of grant, when aggregated with 
shares issued or issuable pursuant to options or awards granted in the preceding 10 years under any employee share plan operated 
by the Group other than the SEMP , shall not exceed 10% of the issued share capital.
The current cumulative dilution level over the ten-year period to 30 September 2015 is 2.45%. This includes 0.20% issued under 
the SEMP . 70

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Directors’ shareholding and share interests
T o align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders, Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding through 
the retention of shares vesting under the Group’ s share plans. The Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding 
equivalent to 100% of total base pay over a period of five years, excluding awards that have not yet vested or have vested but not 
yet been exercised. Andrew Westenberger and David Nicol have not yet met this requirement as they are still within a five-year period 
following their appointment to the Board in 2013. At the date of his last sale of Brewin Dolphin shares, Stephen Ford’ s remaining 
shareholding was in excess of the 100% target. His shareholding as a % of base pay at 30 September 2015 was 98% as a result 
of share price movements between the sale of shares and the year end share price. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are 
encouraged to hold shares in the Company but are not subject to a formal shareholding guideline. The interests of the Directors and 
their connected persons in the share capital of the Company are shown in the table below.

Material contracts with Directors
There were no material contracts between the Group and the Directors. The Directors undertake transactions in stocks and shares in 
the ordinary course of the Group’ s business for their own account. The transactions are not material to the Group in the context of its 
operations. £nil was outstanding in respect of these transactions at 30 September 2015 and 28 September 2014.
Total pension entitlements
Executive Directors may opt to waive part of their aggregate fixed pay amount and receive an equivalent pension contribution instead. 
They may also receive part of their annual bonus in the form of pension contribution.
Defined Contribution Scheme
Executive Directors may join the Group Defined Contribution Scheme. Andrew Westenberger and David Nicol have not made 
contributions to the scheme and do not receive any benefit from the Company under the scheme. Stephen Ford has elected to 
sacrifice a portion of his annual bonus into the scheme. 
Defined Benefit Scheme
Entry to the Group Defined Benefit Scheme was withdrawn in 2004 for new staff members. Stephen Ford remains a deferred 
member of this scheme. 
Details of the total pension entitlements at the year end are set out in Figure 5. 71

Death-in-service benefits
Executive Directors are eligible for death-in-service benefit cover which is equal to six times their individual fixed remuneration.
Chief Executive’s Remuneration
Figure 6 shows the movement in the salary and annual bonus for the Chief Executive between the current and previous financial 
year compared to that for the average UK employee. Rather than having separate base salary, pension and benefit components, 
Executive Directors and other senior staff receive a total fixed pay sum which they can receive part as a defined pension contribution 
and/or benefits such as car benefit, private medical insurance or long-term illness/disability insurance. More junior staff receive a fixed 
salary plus additional pension contributions. As such, an analysis of the movement in benefits for the Chief Executive and the average 
employee was not considered to be practical or meaningful and has not been included in Figure 6.

Figure 7: TSR performance
The chart below shows the Company’ s T otal Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance against the performance of the FTSE All 
Share Index – Financial Services from 30 September 2008 to 30 September 2015. The FTSE All Share – Financial Services index 
was chosen as a comparator because it is the index that encompasses most of our key competitors. TSR is calculated assuming 
dividends are re-invested on receipt.
Remuneration of the Chief Executive
Figure 8 shows the total remuneration figure for the Director undertaking the role of Chief Executive during each of those financial 
years. The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus which was awarded based on performance in those years. Where this 
bonus is subject to deferral, it is shown in the year in which it was awarded. The annual bonus is shown as a percentage of the 
maximum for 2013 to 2015 – there was no maximum amount for bonus in the preceding years. No long-term incentive awards have 
vested to the Chief Executive during the period.

Remuneration Committee governance
The Remuneration Committee is governed by formal terms of reference agreed by the Board. The terms of reference were reviewed 
during the year to ensure they continued to accurately reflect the remit of the Committee. The terms of reference of the Remuneration 
Committee can be viewed on the Group’ s website. The members of the Committee are Paul Wilson (Chair), Ian Dewar, Simon Miller 
and Caroline T aylor. All of these are independent Non-Executive Directors with the exception of the Company Chairman who was 
independent on his appointment.
The members of the Committee during the last financial year and their attendance at the meetings of the Committee are shown in the 
Corporate Governance Report on page 52.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interests (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from 
cross Directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Committee determines the individual remuneration 
packages of each Executive Director, members of the Executive Committee and any other employees designated as Code staff 
under the Remuneration Code. The Executive Directors, the Group Human Resources Director and the Group Risk and Compliance 
Director attend meetings by invitation and assist the Committee in its deliberations, except when issues relating to their own 
remuneration are discussed. No Directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration. The Committee can call for external 
reports and assistance, and independent legal advice may be sought by the Committee as required. The Company Secretary or their 
designate acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee approves the remuneration policy on pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group.
Committee activities
During the period the Committee met five times and undertook the following activities:
• Received regular updates from the Executive on progress against plans to strengthen the alignment of reward and performance 
throughout the Group. 
• Reviewed revised guidance issued by the FCA on the identification of Code Staff in accordance with the FCA’ s Remuneration 
Code, approved new criteria for identifying Code Staff and approved the list of Code Staff for the 2015/16 financial year. 
• Reviewed the Chairman’ s fee taking into account external benchmarking data. 
• Approved the grant of awards under the Deferred Profit Share Plan, Long T erm Incentive Plan and the Equity Award Plan.
• Approved the individual compensation packages of the Executive Directors, members of the Executive Committee and other staff 
designated as ‘Code Staff’. This includes the determination of the Executive Directors’ 2015 bonus award.
• Approved the 2015/16 performance criteria for the Executive Directors.
• Approved the Group Remuneration Policy.
• Approved the Remuneration Statement, which documents how the principles of the FCA Remuneration Code have 
been implemented. 
• Approved the Group’ s Pillar 3 Remuneration disclosures and the disclosures to be included in the Annual Report.
• Approved revised terms of the reference for the Committee to clarify its responsibilities in terms of conduct risk.  73

How the policy will be applied in 2016 onwards
(i) Base salary review
The Committee has reviewed the Executive Directors’ salaries against market data as base pay had not increased since the 
appointment of the current Executive Directors in 2013 and had, at that time, been positioned conservatively. This benchmarking 
exercise has shown that base pay had fallen further below competitive levels, particularly considering that there is no pension 
provision for Executive Directors, and also did not recognise the delivery of a high level of performance by the Executive Directors 
since appointment. The Committee is consulting with key institutions and shareholder representative bodies on this issue and will 
decide whether the Executive Directors’ base salaries should be adjusted during the 2016 performance year. The current salaries are 
shown in Figure 11:

(ii) Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, the Group’ s approach to setting the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is 
with reference to market levels in comparably sized FTSE companies, levels of responsibility and time commitments. The Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees were reviewed in November 2015 and Non-Executive Directors’ fees will remain unchanged for 2015/16. 
With regard to the Chairman, it was concluded that his fee should be increased to £180,000 with effect from 1 January 2016 to reflect 
significant additional time commitment to the Company. In order to fulfil this additional commitment, the Chairman had reduced his time 
committed to other appointments.

(iii) Performance targets for the 2015/16 annual bonus, and LTIP awards to be granted in 2015 
financial year
For the 2016 financial year, the annual bonus will be based on performance against a balanced scorecard comprising four Key 
Performance Areas: profit before tax (20% weighting); margin (20% weighting), net discretionary FUM inflows (20% weighting) and 
personal performance/non-financial targets (40%). Profit and margin will be adjusted to exclude the impact of exceptional items.
The LTIP awards granted in the 2016 financial year will be subject to two separate performance conditions, each accounting for 
one-half of the award. The metrics are aligned to the Group’ s strategic objectives. The performance conditions are as follows:

  The threshold performance requirement of 5% CAGR is measured from an adjusted EPS level of 16.1p for 2014/15, rather than 
the reported EPS of 17.1p. This adjustment takes into account the value of FUM at the year end 2014/15, which was lower than 
the average FUM for the 2014/15 year as a whole. As FUM is an important driver of EPS, using the adjusted figure recognises the 
actual starting point for growth at the end of 2014/15. The equivalent CAGR from the 2014/15 reported EPS of 17.1p is 3%.
2
  The stretch target of 13% CAGR is in excess of the market consensus of 10% CAGR over the three-year period and will be 
calculated from the starting point of 17.1p for 2014/15. Market consensus is calculated using the assumption that there will be 
positive investment performance of 5% per annum.

 Average annual net inflows in discretionary FUM expressed as a % of prior year discretionary FUM.
The adjusted profit before tax margin target used in previous years has been replaced for the 2015/16 performance year with a FUM 
growth target in support of the strategic focus on profitable growth. The annual bonus targets for Executive Directors include margin 
as one-third of the financial criteria, which ensures that directors remain incentivised to maintain margin improvements. The threshold 
vesting target requirement for FUM growth of 2.5% is set at 50% of the market consensus (5%) and full vesting is delivered at 150% 
of market consensus.
There is also a general underpin: the Committee will assess the overall health of the business and whether prudent risk management 
has been applied and may scale back the vesting level if it considers this to be appropriate having taken account of this 
general underpin.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy – approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM
This section of the Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with Part 4 of The Large and Medium–sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. It sets out the Directors’ Remuneration Policy for the Group. 
The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, executive remuneration 
guidelines produced by shareholder organisations, and the remuneration principles of the FCA’ s Remuneration Code so far as they 
apply to the Group.
Overview
The Committee has full delegated responsibility for determining individual total remuneration for the Board Chairman, Executive 
Directors, members of the Executive Committee and any other employees designated as Code Staff under the FCA Remuneration 
Code, with the exception of the Non-Executive Directors. The Committee’ s terms of reference are available on the Group’ s website.
In determining the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes into account the following objectives:
• T o attract, retain and motivate talented Directors and senior management of the calibre required to manage the business 
successfully, whilst seeking to avoid paying more than is necessary to meet this objective.
• T o motivate and reward good performance.
• T o meet relevant regulatory requirements, including the requirements of the FCA Remuneration Code so far as these apply to 
the Group.
The main principles of the policy are to:
• Ensure that total remuneration is set at a level that is market competitive by benchmarking against relevant external comparators, 
taking account of size, complexity, and sector, and to ensure that the overall package takes account of market practice.
• Maintain appropriate proportions of fixed and performance-related pay, to help to drive performance over the short and longer term, 
maintain a flexible cost base, and avoid creating incentives for excessive risk taking.
• Align incentive plans with the business strategy, prudent risk management, and shareholder interests.
• Achieve consistency with the general remuneration philosophy applied to the Group’ s employees as a whole. 
Details of the remuneration components are provided in Figure 15 – the Remuneration Policy table for Executive Directors.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account
The Committee will regularly compare the Group’ s Directors’ Remuneration Policy with shareholder guidelines and take account of the 
results of shareholder votes on remuneration.
If any material changes to the remuneration policy are contemplated, the Committee Chairman will consult with major shareholders 
about these in advance.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’ s Remuneration Report are provided in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Group applies a consistent remuneration philosophy for employees at all levels and the Committee takes account of the 
aggregate rate of base salary increase for all employees when determining increases in fixed pay for Directors.
All employees are eligible for performance-related annual bonus and the principle of bonus deferral applies to annual bonuses for 
employees whose bonuses exceed certain thresholds established by the Committee.
The Group does not operate formal employee consultation on remuneration. However, employees are able to provide direct feedback 
on the Group’ s remuneration policies to their managers or the Human Resources department and as part of an annual employee 
feedback survey. The Committee monitors the effectiveness of the Group’ s remuneration policies in recruiting, retaining, and 
motivating employees, and receives reports on how the Group’ s remuneration policies are viewed by employees and whether they are 
meeting business needs.
The Committee does not seek to apply fixed ratios between the total remuneration levels of different roles in the Group, as this would 
prevent it from recruiting and retaining the necessary talent in a highly competitive employment market. 76

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Benchmarking
The Committee takes account of market benchmark data when setting total remuneration packages for Executive Directors. 
Comparisons are made with other FTSE listed companies of similar size and business profile to the Group. Practices in the wealth 
management sector, and other related sectors, are also considered. Benchmark data is used by the Committee as a reference point, 
alongside other factors such as the individual’ s role and experience, and company and personal performance, rather than as a direct 
determinant of pay levels.

Total  
Fixed Pay
Provides a level of 
fixed remuneration 
sufficient to 
recruit and retain 
necessary talent, 
and to permit a 
zero variable pay 
award should that 
be appropriate.
Rather than having separate base salary, pension and benefits components, 
Executive Directors receive a Total Fixed Pay sum, which they can receive all in 
cash, or may choose to ‘sacrifice’ part of the cash and instead receive part as 
a defined pension contribution and/or fringe benefits such as private medical 
insurance, or long-term illness/disability insurance (known as ‘Permanent 
Health Insurance’). In addition to their Total Fixed Pay, Executive Directors can 
benefit from life insurance at a level of six times annual salary. Individual levels 
of Total Fixed Pay are reviewed annually, with any increases normally effective 
from 1 January, unless there are exceptional reasons for an increase at another 
time of the year. Any increases are generally targeted at around the general 
level of salary inflation in the Group, but may vary from this for exceptional 
reasons such as a change in the individual’s role or responsibilities, or a need 
to bring an individual’s remuneration to a market competitive level.
Total Fixed Pay is 
benchmarked against 
relevant market levels 
of aggregate fixed pay 
(i.e. base salary+pension 
contribution+benefits, 
paid in the market), 
and is targeted to 
be not more than 
around median of 
relevant comparators.

Executive Directors
1
 are considered each year for a discretionary annual 
variable pay award, which takes account of both Group and personal 
performance. The main weighting is on Group financial performance.
Group performance is assessed primarily by reference to a ‘balanced 
scorecard’ of Group financial key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) and 
targets, which are set each year by the Committee based on the priorities 
for the year. The KPIs may include, for example, profit before tax and 
operating profit margin. Non-financial KPIs may also be included in the 
scorecard, but non-financial performance has a lower weighting than financial 
performance. For each KPI, there is a threshold, target and ‘stretch’ (i.e. 
excellent) performance level; the maximum annual variable pay is paid for 
stretch performance.
In common with all other employees of the Group, a significant proportion 
of variable pay is compulsorily deferred under the Deferred Profit Share Plan 
(‘DPSP’) into Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC (‘BDH’) Ordinary Shares or nil-
priced options over shares, which vest in one tranche, normally after three 
years. The deferral policy for Executive Directors is shown in the table below:
Portion of variable pay What fraction is deferred?
Portion up to £50,000 None
Portion between £50,000 and 
1 x fixed remuneration
One-third
Portion above 1 x fixed remuneration Two-thirds
The Committee may seek to clawback annual variable pay in exceptional 
situations, such as misstatement of performance, failure of risk management 
or serious misconduct.

  Michael Williams was an Executive Director for part of the 2015 performance year but, as an Investment 
Manager, is remunerated based on the performance of his team. His base pay is set substantially lower 
than other Executive Directors and his annual bonus is dependent on the profits of his Investment 
Management team and is not subject to a cap. One-third of the portion of his bonus above £50k is 
deferred into Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC shares or nil-cost options over shares which vest in one 
tranche, normally after three years.
The maximum individual 
award of annual 
variable pay is currently 
1.5 x times the Total 
Fixed Pay (except for 
Michael Williams

Executive Directors will be eligible to be considered each year for a 
conditional award over BDH shares, which will vest in one tranche, normally 
no earlier than three years from the date of award. Vesting will be subject to 
performance conditions and targets set prior to each grant by the Committee. 
These performance conditions will be related to financial performance (e.g. 
EPS growth and profit margin percentage) and will be aligned to the business 
strategy. For each performance metric used, there will be a threshold level of 
performance at which no more than 25% of the portion of the award relating 
to that KPI will vest, and a stretch level of performance, at which 100% of the 
portion of the award relating to that KPI will vest.
Executive Directors will be required to hold net of tax vested shares for a period 
of two years following vesting.
The Committee may seek to clawback LTIP in exceptional situations, such as 
misstatement of performance, failure of risk management or serious misconduct.
The normal maximum 
annual award under 
the LTIP rules is up to 
100% of Total Fixed 
Pay (in face value 
of shares at grant), 
but may be up to 
150% in exceptional 
circumstances.
Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees
The approach to remuneration for the Executive Directors is generally consistent with that for employees across the Group as a 
whole. However, there are some differences which the Committee believes are necessary to reflect the different responsibilities 
of employees across the Group, and the need to recruit, retain and motivate employees in a variety of roles. For example, below 
Executive Director level, the portion of annual variable pay that is deferred is structured differently and is capped at one-third rather 
than the two-thirds deferral that applies to Executive Directors. Awards of market purchased shares are made to selected individuals 
from time to time, excluding Executive Directors, which vest subject to continued service, to recognise individuals’ value to the Group 
and to create further alignment with shareholders.
External Non-Executive Director positions
Executive Directors are permitted to serve as Non-Executive Directors of other companies, on the grounds that this can help to 
broaden the skills and experience of the Director, provided there is no competition with the Group’ s business activities and where 
these duties do not interfere with the individual’ s ability to perform their duties for the Group.
Where an outside appointment is accepted in furtherance of the Group’ s business, any fees received are remitted to the Group. 
If the appointment is not connected to the Group’ s business, the Executive Director is entitled to retain any fees received.
Approach to remuneration for new Executive Director appointments
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms and maximum levels of the 
Group’ s approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
The Committee may also offer additional cash and/or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests 
of the Group and shareholders, for the purpose of replacing awards or potential foreseeable earnings which are forgone by the 
individual on becoming an Executive Director. This includes the use of awards made under 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules. In considering 
any such payments the Committee would take account of the amount of remuneration foregone and the nature, vesting dates and 
any performance requirements attached to the remuneration foregone. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments and the 
rationale for these.
For an internal appointment, any deferred pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to 
its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to 
appointment may be permitted to continue where this is considered to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders.
For external and internal appointments, the Group may meet certain relocation expenses as appropriate. 78

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Service contracts and loss of office payments
Service contracts normally continue until the Executive Director’ s agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree. 
The service contracts contain provision for early termination. Notice periods are limited to six months by either party. If the Group 
terminates the employment of an Executive Director without giving the period of notice required under the contract, the Executive 
Director would be entitled to claim recompense for up to six months’ T otal Fixed Pay.
In cases of ‘good leavers’ the Committee may consider a discretionary award of annual variable pay, subject to performance, in 
respect of the portion of any financial year that the individual has been working with the Group, although not for the period of any 
payment in lieu of notice or ‘garden leave’.
In the event of a change of control of the Group there is no enhancement to these terms. 
In summary, the contractual provisions are as follows:
Figure 16: Contractual provisions
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period Six months.
Termination payment in the event 
of termination by the Company 
without due notice
Total Fixed Pay in respect of the unexpired period of contractual notice. In certain cases, the Committee may 
also consider a discretionary award of annual variable pay, subject to performance, in respect of the portion 
of any financial year that the individual has been working with the Group, although not for the period of any 
payment in lieu of notice or ‘garden leave’.
Change of control Same terms as above on termination.
Any outstanding share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Group’ s LTIP or other share plans will be 
determined based on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, redundancy, retirement or other circumstances at the 
discretion of the Committee (taking into account the individual’ s performance and the reasons for their departure), ‘good leaver’ 
status can be applied. In such cases, the normal practice, unless there are exceptional circumstances, is for any LTIP awards held 
to be pro-rated for the period of the performance period that has expired, and the performance conditions would continue to apply. 
Share awards under the Deferred Profit Share Plan (‘DPSP’) will vest in full on the original vesting schedule.
An Executive Director’ s service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except 
for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy includes authority for the Group to honour any commitments entered 
into with current or former Directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Remuneration Reports. Details of any 
payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration of this report as they arise.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union (‘EU’) and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent company Financial Statements 
under IFRSs as adopted by the EU. Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing these Financial Statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’ s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’ s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’ s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’ s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibility Statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’ s performance, business model and strategy.
This Responsibility Statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 1 December 2015 and is signed on its behalf by:

Information
Opinion on financial statements of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’ s and the parent company’ s affairs as at 30 September 2015 and of the group’ s 
profit for the period then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated and 
Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 37. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten 
the solvency or liquidity of the group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis 
of accounting contained within note 3 to the financial statements and the directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the group 
on page 29. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 29 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 31 to 33 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in note 3 to the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’ s ability to continue 
to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
• the directors’ explanation on page 29 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done 
so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including 
any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
group’ s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’ s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are 
independent of the group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also confirm 
we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.  84
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC   
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
Historically the group expanded through acquisitions leading 
to goodwill and client relationships, resulting in the recognition 
of £77.7m (2014: £87.0m) of capitalised client relationships 
and goodwill.
The impairment of these intangible assets represents a key area of 
judgment because the group assesses whether the ongoing benefits 
offered by the capitalised client relationship intangibles and goodwill 
are greater than the carrying value or whether there is an indication 
of impairment. This assessment is driven by estimates of future 
income flows from funds under management.
See Note 16 for disclosure and Note 1 for critical 
accounting policies.
In assessing the intangible assets, we have reviewed the calculations 
prepared by management to assess whether they meet the 
requirements of IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” and that the 
assumptions and judgements made are appropriate.
In doing this we have challenged the percentages management have 
applied to market values of funds under management to determine 
fair value, and validated these against percentages derived from 
recent public acquisitions of fund management businesses. 
We have also performed procedures to test the controls over the 
production of funds under management data used as the basis for 
the estimates of future revenue flow.
Additionally we have performed a recalculation on the sensitivity of the 
valuation of funds under management which is included in note 17.
The group has recognised a defined benefit pension deficit of £2.9m 
(2014: £7.7m), see Note 27. The valuation of the deficit, being the net of 
the assets (£81.9m) and liabilities (£84.8m), is significant as this balance 
impacts the company’ s distributable reserves and is estimated based on 
management judgement. 
Uncertainty arises as a result of estimates made in respect of long-
term trends and market conditions to determine the value based on 
the group’s expectations of the future. As a result, the final deficit 
realised by the group may be significantly different to that recognised 
on the balance sheet since small changes to the assumptions used 
materially affect the valuation.
See Note 27 for disclosure and Note 1 for critical 
accounting policies.
In order to evaluate the appropriateness of the assumptions 
used by management we have used our own actuarial experts to 
make direct enquiries of the Group’s actuary and review the key 
actuarial assumptions adopted for the IAS 19 (“Employee Benefits”) 
calculations for compliance with the requirements of the accounting 
standard, in particular, considering the discount rate, inflation rate 
and mortality assumptions against other available information and 
similar demographics.
We have circularised the custodian of the pension scheme assets 
and independently recalculated the value of the scheme’s portfolio 
of assets.
Sundry claims associated costs relate to estimated liabilities including 
costs related to litigation or client complaints of unsuitable or misleading 
advice occurring in the course of business. The amount of £2.4m 
(2014: £1.9m) recognised as a provision should be the group’ s best 
estimates of the expenditure required to settle these obligations and 
therefore is subject to management judgement particularly in relation to 
probability and quantum of the claim.
Recoveries from insurers related to such obligations should be 
recognised when it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be 
received and should be treated as separate assets.
See Note 34 for disclosure and Note 1 for critical accounting policies.
We have discussed outstanding legal cases and claims received with 
management, reviewed the associated legal correspondence and 
assessed whether the levels of provisions and associated insurance 
debtors are appropriate and that the debtor balances are likely to 
be recoverable. 
We also received confirmations from the group’s legal representatives 
and insurance broker in relation to the outstanding balances.

Additional 
Information
As at 30 September 2015, management recognised onerous lease 
provisions of £4.1m (2014: £5.8m) which arose due to properties 
leased by the Group in regards to the branches being vacant during 
all or part of the period. Assessments are made of the obligations 
in respect of vacant space, taking account in certain cases, of any 
potential income from subletting such space. Due to the number of 
leases held, the quantum of the lease charge, and the manual nature of 
the calculations there is a risk that errors could occur. 
In additions, there has been an increase of £1.2m in the estimate of 
the provision for dilapidations in relation to leases. This is as a result 
of management performing a review of the property portfolio after the 
termination and surrendering of a number of leases, such that a more 
reliable estimate can now be made for future costs.
See Note 34 for disclosure and Note 1 for critical accounting policies.
We discussed with management the estimation methodology used 
and key assumptions to determine the onerous lease and dilapidation 
provisions and independently confirmed these amounts to source 
documentation to assess whether they are appropriately calculated.
In visiting locations we established whether there was vacant 
space not provided for and discussed the use of premises with 
local management.
Onerous lease contracts and dilapidations
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
During the period, the group entered into a contract for the sale of its 
execution only division, Stocktrade and the associated balances have 
been disclosed as discontinued operations.
The sale of Stocktrade is unlikely to complete until the first half of 2016, 
however the transaction was only partially completing pre-the year end 
date and not all clients had been transferred across. The costs and 
related provisions are included in the financial statements, however the 
revenue for the sale of £14m is deferred until the following period, see 
Note 13.
The control and risks and rewards of the contracts had not been fully 
transferred and so there is a risk that the revenue and associated 
provisions are recorded incorrectly.
We have assessed the terms within the sale agreement and other 
associated contracts for the appropriate treatment under IFRS 
3 “Business Combinations” and IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets”. 
We have performed a detailed analysis of the progress of the 
transaction as at 30 September 2015 and challenged management’s 
approach to the treatment of revenue. Additionally, we tested the 
discontinued operations disclosure for the timing of the recognition 
of the consideration and the related costs and their completeness 
and accuracy.
Sale of the Stocktrade division
Last year, our report included two risks which are not included in our report this year: 
Software impairment and related contractual obligations.
This is in relation to capitalised software that management determined was substantially impaired in the year ended 2014. The risk 
relating to the remaining balance has been determined as not significant.
Estimations used in the calculation of shares to be issued.
The inputs in relation to the calculation of shares to be issued can be precisely determined in the current period and therefore do not 
require management estimate. 
Additionally, we have split out the risk disclosed in 2014 as estimations for provisions for sundry claims and associated costs 
and onerous lease contracts into two separate risks as the nature of the risk has diverged. 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed 
on pages 59 and 60.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 86
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC   
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be £3.0m (2014: £2.8m), which is 5% (2014: 7%) of pre-tax profit from 
continuing operations.
This is a change of rate from 2014, where we used 7% of profit before tax. We have changed the percentage applied to align more 
closely with comparable companies. Additionally, in 2014 we used adjusted pre-tax profit by taking into account the exceptional 
impairment charge of £31.7m which was a significant and non-recurring expense.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £61,000 
(2014: £54,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level.
The group consists of the main trading subsidiary, Brewin Dolphin Limited along with Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited, Brewin Dolphin 
MP Limited, Brewin Dolphin Nominees (Ireland) Limited and 8 nominee companies that are in the scope of our audit.
Brewin Dolphin Limited and Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited make up 99% of the group revenue. For these two entities we use 
component materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements in the group financial statements exceeds materiality for the group financial statements as a whole. The component 
materialities are £2.6m and £1.5m respectively. 
The majority of the operations of the Group are based in the United Kingdom and are audited by Deloitte LLP . The only exception to 
this is Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited, an Irish Company, which represents less than 5% of revenue and which is audited by a Deloitte 
affiliate. We have supervised their work on the figures included in the Group’ s financial statements for this entity through the issuance 
of instructions, receipt of summaries of work performed and ongoing dialogue and a visit during the audit process. 
The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits to branches, which primarily operate as local sales offices, 
that have been designed so that a senior member of the group audit team visits the locations on a rotational basis. In total, our work 
included visits to 6 branches.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. 87

Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’ s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards 
review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’ s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’ s report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’ s and the parent company’ s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

COMPANY CASH FLOW STATEMENT
Period ended 30 September 2015 1. General information 
The consolidated financial statements of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ‘Group’) 
for the period ended 30 September 2015 were authorised for issue by the Directors on 1 December 2015.
The Company was incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The nature of the Group’ s operations and its 
principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report. 
The Company is registered in England and Wales. The address of the registered office is 12 Smithfield Street, London EC1A 9BD.
The separate financial statements of the Company are also reported.
The financial statements represent the period from 29 September 2014 to 30 September 2015. The comparatives are for the 52 
week period ended 28 September 2014. 
The significant accounting policies are disclosed below. The policies for the Group and the Company are consistent unless 
otherwise stated.
Restatement
During the period, the Group adopted IFRIC 21– ‘Levies’. Specific transitional provisions are applicable to first-time application of 
IFRIC 21. The Group has applied the relevant transitional provisions and restated the comparative amounts on a retrospective basis, 
see note 2(a) below.
In addition, the Group has changed its accounting policy relating to client settlement cash, consequently the Group has applied IAS 8 
– ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ and restated the comparative amounts on a retrospective basis, 
see note 2(b) below.
2.  Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) and changes in accounting policy
a. New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted 
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted. The effect of the adoption of 
these changes on the consolidated financial statements is described below.
IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’
IFRIC 21 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and has been applied retrospectively. It is applicable to 
all levies imposed by financial services regulators under legislation, other than outflows that are within the scope of other standards 
and fines or other penalties for breaches of legislation. The interpretation clarifies that an entity recognises a liability for a levy when the 
activity that triggers payment as identified by the relevant legislation occurs.
The trigger that gives rise to the liability to pay the FSCS Levy is that Brewin Dolphin Limited is a company authorised by the FCA at 
the levy date of 1 July. At this point, the full FSCS Levy is recognised. 
The impact of this new interpretation in the current period is to reduce other operating costs by £4,000 and increase profit for the 
period by £3,000. The impact on prior periods is outlined in note 37.
In addition to adopting the above new interpretation, the following amendments came into effect in the current period:
•  Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27) 
• Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions
• Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32 
• Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting – Amendments to IAS 39 
• Annual Improvements 2010–2012 Cycle 
• Annual Improvements 2011–2013 Cycle 
The application of the above amendments had no material effect on the accounts of the Company or Group for the 
periods presented.

Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC   
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS b. Changes in accounting policy 
The Group has amended its accounting policy for client settlement cash. Client settlement account balances were previously shown 
as client settlement cash included within cash and cash equivalents. The accounting policy has been changed to reclassify these 
balances to either trade and other payables or trade and other receivables, which better reflects the substance of these balances. 
The impact of this change in the current period is to reduce cash and cash equivalents by £19.7 million, decrease trade and other 
payables by £16.6 million, and increase trade and other receivables by £3.1 million. There is no impact on profit for the period. 
The impact on prior periods is outlined in note 37, firm’ s cash was not impacted by the change.

The Directors are currently reviewing the impact of these new standards, amendments and interpretations but do not intend to adopt 
the standards early. 
3. Significant accounting policies
a. Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements for both the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) adopted by the European Union, Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and Companies Act 2006.
b. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the Company, rounded to the 
nearest thousand pound (£’000) except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. 
c. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
and its subsidiaries. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those 
used by the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC has taken advantage of the legal 
dispensation not to present its own Statement of Comprehensive Income or Income Statement. The amount of the profit for the 
financial period dealt with in the financial statements of the Company is disclosed in the Company Statement of Changes in Equity.
d. Going concern 
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Strategic Report.

Additional 
Information 3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
e. Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income 
statement as incurred. 
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of 
acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of 
contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised. 
f. Transaction date accounting
All securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients are recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction. The underlying 
investments are not shown in the financial statements of the Group. 
g. Foreign currencies
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’ s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet 
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date 
when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated. 
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’ s foreign operations are 
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of 
transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
h. Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents commissions, investment 
management fees, renewal commissions and other income, excluding VAT , receivable in respect of the period. 
Investment management fees and renewal commissions are recognised in the period in which the related service is provided and 
commissions are recognised when the transaction is performed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’ s net 
carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Income Statement to the extent that they represent a realised profit and loss for 
the Company.
i. Other operating income
Interest receivable and payable on client free money balances is netted to calculate the Group’ s share of interest receivable and 
included under the heading ‘Other operating income’.
j. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and bank overdrafts. 
k. Leases
Rentals on operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Benefits received and 
receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is spread on 
a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC   
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED l. Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant. The fair 
value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity–settled 
share-based transactions are set out in note 31. 
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, 
based on management’ s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’ s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises 
its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. 
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the 
revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
m. Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’ s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised 
based on tax laws and rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited 
in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
n. Investments in subsidiaries
In the Company’ s accounts investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. 
o. Intangible assets 
i) Goodwill 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’ s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is 
reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not reversed in a 
subsequent period (see note 3(v) for the Impairment accounting policy).
When the consideration transferred by the Group is deferred or contingent, this is valued at its acquisition date fair value, and is 
included in the consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in the deferred or contingent consideration, which 
occur in the measurement period, are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments to goodwill. Subsequently to 
the measurement period the deferred and contingent considerations are revised annually at the balance sheet date and any 
corresponding adjustments are posted to the Income Statement. Such deferred or contingent consideration may be settled in shares 
(see note 3(t) for the Shares to be issued accounting policy).
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

Information 3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
ii) Client relationships
Intangible assets classified as ‘client relationships’ are recognised when acquired as part of a business combination or when separate 
payments are made to acquire funds under management by adding teams of Investment Managers. Client relationships acquired 
separately are initially recognised at cost. If acquired as part of a business combination the initial cost of client relationships is the fair 
value at the acquisition date. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
When separate payments are made to acquire funds under management by adding teams of Investment Managers, elements of 
the total consideration may be deferred or contingent. In such cases the cost of the recognised client relationships includes the 
Company’ s best estimate of the future consideration likely to be made, discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and is revised at each balance sheet date. Such deferred or 
contingent consideration may be settled in shares (see note 3(t) for the Shares to be issued accounting policy).
Client relationships are amortised over seven to fifteen years, their minimum estimated useful lives.
iii) Computer software
Computer software which is not an integral part of the related hardware is classified as an intangible asset. Costs of acquiring 
computer software are treated as an intangible asset and amortised over three to ten years, dependent upon the assessment of the 
expected useful life of the software, on a straight line basis from the date the software is operating as management intended. 
Computer software developed internally is separately identified and recognised as an intangible asset if it is part of a specifically 
authorised project which will give probable future economic benefits over a period and is amortised over three to ten years on 
a straight line basis from the date the software comes into use, dependent on the assessment of the expected useful life of 
the software.
The assessment of the expected useful life of computer software is based on the contractual terms or where appropriate past 
experience of the life of similar assets.
p. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment. Depreciation has 
been provided on the basis of equal annual instalments to write off the cost less estimated residual values of tangible fixed assets over 
their estimated useful lives as follows:
 Computer equipment 3 to 4 years
 Office equipment 4 to 10 years
 Leasehold improvements to the earlier of the first break clause of the lease or 10 years
 Motor vehicles 5 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
q. Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments and non-financial assets, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation 
technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability 
if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 
Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, 
except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of 
IAS 17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as value in use in IAS 36.
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to 
which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its 
entirety, which are described as follows:
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date;
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset of liability, either 
directly or indirectly; and
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED r. Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial 
recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
i) Financial assets
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: 
• financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’); 
• available-for-sale financial assets; and 
• loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets are classified as FVTPL where the financial asset is held-for-trading or it is designated as FVTPL. A financial asset is 
classified as held-for-trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future.
Financial assets classified as FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss on remeasurement recognised in profit 
or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividends or interest earned on the financial asset and is 
included in the Income Statement. The fair value is determined in the manner described in note 3(q).
Available-for-sale financial assets (‘AFS’)
Certain shares held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Fair value is determined in the 
manner described in note 3(q). Gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
revaluation reserve with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the revaluation reserve is reclassified 
to profit or loss. 
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in profit and loss when the Group’ s right to receive payment is established.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets 
are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the 
financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. The carrying amount of the financial asset is 
reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its 
cost is considered to be objective evidence of the impairment.
When an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period. In subsequent periods if the amount of impaired loss decreases, in respect of 
AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss. Any increase in 
fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.

Information 3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
ii) Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’. Financial liabilities are classified as 
FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. 
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the ‘other gains 
and losses’ line item in the Income Statement. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 3(q).
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective 
yield basis.
s. Netting of balances
Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle on balance are shown net where there is a currently enforceable legal right 
to set off the recognised amounts and an operational intention to settle net. Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle 
against delivery of stock are shown gross.
t. Shares to be issued including premium
Shares to be issued represent the Company’ s best estimate of the amount of ordinary shares in the Company, which are likely to be 
issued following business combinations or the acquisition of client relationships which involve deferred payments in the Company’ s 
shares. The sum payable which will be converted into shares of equivalent value is discounted to present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and is revised annually in the light of actual results. 
The resulting interest charge from the unwind of the discount is included within finance costs. Where shares are due to be issued 
within a year the sum is included in current liabilities.
u. Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses and the 
return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit to the Statement 
of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is 
not recycled. 
Any past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, 
as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from 
this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to 
the scheme.

Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC   
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED v. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). 
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired. Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit (‘CGU’) to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
For the purposes of impairment testing, client relationships and goodwill are allocated to each of the Group’ s cash-generating units. 
Fair value is established by valuing clients’ funds under management in each of the cash-generating units at the period end; the 
percentages of funds being used depending on values attributed in recent public transactions for the purchase of advisory and 
discretionary funds. If the carrying amount relating to any cash-generating unit exceeds the calculated fair value less costs to sell, a 
value in use is calculated using a discounted cash flow method. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the 
carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
If the recoverable amount of any asset other than client relationships or goodwill is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, 
the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, 
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
w. Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the effect of the 
time value of money is material).
Where some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a 
receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received and the amount receivable can be 
measured reliably.
Onerous contracts
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered 
to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it.
x. Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’ s business that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale.
Components of the Group are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered or settled principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable and the 
component is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Components of the Group classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
No depreciation is charged on businesses classified as held for sale.

Information 4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’ s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
a. Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
i. Recognition of disposal of Stocktrade
In May 2015, the Group signed an agreement to sell its Execution Only division, Stocktrade, to Alliance Trust Savings Limited (the 
‘Purchaser’) for £14 million. 
As at 30 September 2015, the consideration has not been recognised in the financial statements, since the Group continues to 
maintain control over the discontinued operation and is exposed to variable returns in the form of income and associated expenses, 
even though some clients’ contracts have transferred to the Purchaser and are being administered on its systems.
The decision not to recognise the consideration is a material critical accounting judgement.
Associated costs of disposal, including onerous contracts and the resultant provisions have been recognised in accordance with 
IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. 
Refer to note 13 for additional information.
ii. Goodwill and client relationships
The Group assesses whether payments made to newly recruited investment teams under contractual agreements represent 
payments for the acquisition of client relationships or remuneration for ongoing services provided to the Group. The assessment 
requires judgement concerning the terms and levels of these payments to determine whether the costs are capitalised or expensed. 
Payments made for the acquisition of client relationships are capitalised whereas those that are judged to be in relation to the 
provision of ongoing services are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
During the period the Group expensed £259,000 in relation to the acquisition of client relationships and there has been a net 
reduction to the client relationship intangible assets of £105,000 relating to the reassessment of deferred purchase consideration 
liabilities for past acquisitions. In the prior period, the Group capitalised £7,468,000 and expensed £217,000.
b. Key sources of estimation uncertainty
i. Goodwill and client relationships
Amortisation of client relationships 
The useful economic life over which client relationships are amortised is determined by the expected duration of the client relationships 
which are determined with reference to past experience of account closures, in particular the average life of those relationships, and 
future expectations. During the period, client relationships were amortised over a 7 to 15 year period. 
The amortisation for the period was £9,219,000 (2014: £13,592,000), a reduction in the average amortisation period by one year 
would increase the amortisation expense for the period by £834,000 (2014: £1,094,000).
Impairment of goodwill and client relationships
Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. 
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Group values the recoverable amount of goodwill and client relationships at the fair 
value less costs of disposal. The calculation of the fair value less costs of disposal is based on the valuation of the funds under 
management, which make up the relevant intangible asset. A percentage is applied to funds under management (3% for discretionary 
funds and 1% for advisory funds) to determine the fair value. These percentages have been based on recent public transactions. 
The recoverable amount is sensitive to movements in the valuation of funds under management. The key assumptions used to 
determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in 
note 17.
106
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC   
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED ii. Retirement benefit obligation
The calculation of the present value of the retirement benefit obligation is determined by using actuarial valuations. Management make 
key assumptions in determining the inputs into the actuarial valuations, which may differ from actual developments in the future. 
These assumptions are governed by IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (revised 2011), and include the determination of the discount rate, 
life expectancies and future salary increases. Due to the complexities in the valuation, the retirement benefit obligation is highly sensitive 
to changes in these assumptions. The detailed assumptions are set out in note 27.
iii. Share-based payments
Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
During the period, the Group granted its second additional award under the LTIP . The scheme includes performance based 
vesting conditions, which impacts the amount of benefit paid. The Group has made assumptions on the likelihood of meeting the 
performance conditions in determining the expense in the period. The LTIP charge for the period was £669,000; an absolute increase 
of 10% in the vesting assumptions would increase the charge for the period by £251,000. Further information on the scheme is 
disclosed in note 31. 
iv. Provisions
Sundry claims and associated costs
The Group recognises a provision for sundry claims and associated costs. The valuation of the claims is based on the best estimate 
discounted to present value where the impact of the time value of money is material. Further information is disclosed in note 34. 
It is not possible to perform a sensitivity analysis on this balance as it is impracticable.
Leasehold dilapidations 
The Group recognises a provision for leasehold dilapidations. The valuation of the leasehold dilapidations is based on the best 
estimate of the likely cash flows discounted to present value. The estimation also includes assumptions about the split of the total 
estimation of the cost between dilapidations relating to general wear and tear, specific requirements to replace items, and the removal 
of leasehold improvements. If the estimate of the likely cash flows used in the calculation of this provision was increased by 10%, 
the provision would increase by £164,000. Further information is disclosed in note 34. 
The leasehold dilapidation provision has increased during the period by £1,200,000. The increase consists of additions of £1,680,000, 
less utilisations of £232,000 and unused amounts reversed of £248,000. The increase in the provision is primarily attributable to the 
refinement of the estimation methodology as a result of now being able to make a more reliable estimate. 
Onerous leases
The Group has recognised a provision for onerous leases of £4,069,000 (2014: £5,779,000). The valuation of an onerous lease 
is based on the best estimate of the likely future costs discounted to present value. Where the provision is in relation to premises 
and it is more likely than not that the premises will be sublet, an allowance for sublease income has been included in the valuation. 
If the assumptions regarding the sublet income are removed, the provision would increase by £1,232,000 to £5,301,000. 
Further information is disclosed in note 34.

During the current period, the Group received a partial refund of £1,160,000 for the 2011 additional FSCS levies, following the 
recovery by the FSCS of some of the costs levied in that year.

Deferred income taxes are calculated using an expected rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20% (2014: 20%).
The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset in the period in relation to previously unused capital tax losses of £7,686,000 relating 
to the disposal of the Corporate Advisory and Broking division in 2012, available for offset against future capital profits, as it is now 
considered probable that there will be future taxable capital profits available.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 13. Discontinued operations
On 14 May 2015, the Group announced the decision to dispose of its Stocktrade business for £14 million in cash, payable in full upon 
completion. The disposal is expected to complete in 2016. As at 30 September 2015, the consideration for the disposal has not been 
recognised (see note 4a(i)).

that the future economic costs exceed the expected future benefits of the contracts and £0.3 million for intangible and tangible asset 
impairment, based on a value in use calculation (see notes 16 and 18). It is expected that there will be additional separation costs 
recognised in future periods including the write off of the value in use of the intangible and tangible assets. The carrying value of 
these assets at 30 September 2015 is £2.0 million.

contingently issuable shares for Long T erm Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) options are assumed to fully vest. The Directors have selected this measure as it represents the underlying effective dilution by 
offsetting the impact to the calculation of basic shares of the purchase of shares by the Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘ESOT’) to satisfy options.

Impairment of purchased software 
During the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2014, the Board announced that it had taken the decision to terminate the rollout of a 
major new stockbroking and wealth management software into the Discretionary Wealth Management business of the Group and 
only to use it within Stocktrade, the Group’ s Execution Only division. 
The decision to terminate the rollout of the new software into the Group was an indication of impairment. As a result, the recoverable 
amount in use was compared to the carrying value of the software which resulted in an impairment charge of £31.7 million.
Goodwill and client relationship impairment testing
The table below shows the goodwill allocated to cash-generating units:

 Other Investment Management T eams 21,785
48,637
In accordance with IFRS, the Group performs impairment testing for goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently when there are 
indications of impairment. For client relationships, impairment testing is performed at each reporting date.
The recoverable amount for each of the CGUs is the fair value less costs of disposal. The fair value is determined by applying 
percentages to the funds under management for each CGU. The percentages applied are based on reference to recent observable 
market transactions. Discretionary funds are valued at 3% and advisory funds are valued at 1% of assets under management. 
Sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions
A 10bp absolute change in the value of funds under management used for the purpose of impairment testing impacts the valuation 
of the CGUs collectively by +/- 3.9% or +/- £23.3 million movement on the estimated value of funds under management of 
£593.2 million of the CGUs which have goodwill balances as at 30 September 2015.

During the period, the Group had sold its unlisted available-for-sale investment of 19,899 ordinary shares of Euroclear plc’ s share 
capital (refer to note 11). The holding in Euroclear plc resulted from a £431,000 strategic investment in Crest, the London based 
settlement system which was taken over by Euroclear plc. 
In the period, the Group acquired a holding in an open-ended investment protected cell company incorporated and registered in 
Guernsey. The valuation of this investment is based on the value of traded life policies held by that company. 
In the period, the Group also acquired a USD fixed rate note, due to mature on 23 September 2019. The valuation of this investment

Trade debtors relate to either market or client transactions and are considered to be past due once the date for settlement has 
passed. The date for settlement is determined when the trade is booked. It is expected that some transactions may become past 
due in the normal course of business. Fees owed by clients are considered to be past due when they remain unpaid after 30 days 
after the relevant billing date. Trade debtors that are older than ninety days are provided for unless collateral is held. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk is the carrying value as above.

25. Shares to be issued including premium and other deferred purchase liabilities
The Group acquires investment businesses and teams of Investment Managers, bringing with them funds under management (the 
latter classified as the intangible asset client relationships) on deferred purchase terms based on the value of income introduced over, 
normally, a three year period. The payment is normally made in ordinary shares and these shares typically have to be held for a further 
three years. At the discretion of the Board these shares can be purchased in the market rather than issued. The estimated likely cost 
of these shares is reassessed annually, see notes 3(t) and 4. During the period there was a net downward assessment, see note 
4(a) of £0.1 million (2014: £7.5 million net upward assessment). The other side of the liability is recorded in intangible assets-client 
relationships, see note 16.
In the event of the Group being acquired by a third party, provisions exist to renegotiate the deferred purchase consideration into the 
shares of the acquiring entity, or for the deferred settlement period to be truncated.

26. Financial instruments and risk management 
Overview
This note presents information about the Group’ s exposure to each of the financial instrument key risks (market risk, credit risk and 
liquidity risk), the Group’ s policy and procedures for measuring and managing risk and the Group’ s management of capital. 
Risk management
The Board of Directors have overall responsibility for establishing and overseeing the Group’ s Risk Management Framework and 
risk appetite.
The Board have established a clear relationship between the Group’ s strategic objectives and the level of capital which the Board are 
prepared to place at risk through a Risk Appetite Statement. The Risk Appetite Statement outlines the nature and quantum of risk that 
the Board wishes the Group to bear (its ‘risk appetite’) in order to achieve its strategic objectives whilst remaining within all regulatory 
constraints and its own defined levels of capital and liquidity. The Board reviews the statement and related qualitative and quantitative 
measures on at least an annual basis to ensure the document continues to reflect the Board’ s appetite for risk within the context of 
the environment the Group operates within. 
The Group’ s Board Risk Committee provides oversight of the adequacy of the Group’ s Risk Management Framework based on 
the risks to which the Group is exposed. They monitor how management comply with the Group’ s risk management policies and 
procedures. They are assisted in the discharge of this duty by the Group’ s Risk & Compliance Department which has responsibility for 
monitoring the overall risk environment of the Group. The Board Risk Committee also regularly monitors exposure against the Group’ s 
Risk Appetite.
The Group’ s Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the financial statements and working closely with the Board Risk 
Committee, for both review and oversight of internal controls. The Audit Committee is assisted in the discharge of its obligations 
by Internal Audit who undertake periodic and ad-hoc reviews on the effectiveness of controls and compliance with risk 
management policies.

Additional 
Information
The Group’ s risk management policies are intended to ensure that risks are identified, evaluated and subject to ongoing monitoring 
and mitigation (where appropriate). The risk policies also serve to set the appropriate control framework, the adequacy and 
effectiveness of which is also subject to ongoing testing and review. The aim is to promote a robust risk culture with employees across 
the Group understanding their role and obligations under the framework. 
Capital structure and capital management
The capital structure of the Group and Company consists of issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the 
Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity.
Capital generated from the business is both reinvested in the business to generate future growth and returned to shareholders, 
principally in the form of dividends. Consideration is given to regulatory capital requirements and to ensure the Group is sufficiently 
robust to withstand periods of market stress. 
There were no changes in the Group’ s approach to capital management during the period.
Regulatory capital requirements
The Group conducts an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (‘ICAAP’), as required by the Financial Conduct Authority 
(‘FCA’) to assess the appropriate amount of regulatory capital to be held by the Group. There are two regulated entities in the Group: 
Brewin Dolphin Limited (‘BDL’) regulated by the FCA and Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. 
The Jersey branch of BDL is regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission.
The Pillar II capital assessment of the ICAAP is the Board of Directors’ opinion of the level of capital the Group should hold against the 
risks to which the Group is exposed. This takes into the account the Group’ s Principal Risk Register which is updated on a regular 
basis. The ICAAP is kept updated throughout the year to take account of changes to the Group’ s Principal Risks and for any material 
changes to strategy or business plans. The ICAAP is discussed and approved at a Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Board meeting at 
least annually. 
Regulatory capital adequacy is monitored by management. The Group uses the standardised approach to Credit Risk to calculate 
Pillar I requirements. The Group complied with the FCA’ s regulatory capital requirements throughout the period.

31 December 2015 at www.brewin.co.uk.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on 
which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each financial asset and financial liability, are disclosed in note 3(r) to the

The carrying value approximates to the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities held.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the 
Group’ s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of the Group’ s market risk management is to both 
control and manage exposure within the Group’ s risk appetite whilst accepting the inherent risk of market fluctuations. 
The Group undertakes investment management and stockbroking activities on an agency basis on behalf of its clients. The Group 
holds financial instruments as principal, but does not trade as principal. All trades are matched in the market (see note 20). 
The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange exposure. The total 
net foreign exchange exposure resulting from income yet to be converted to sterling at the year end was a debtor of £495,000 
(2014: £122,000).
At the period end Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited (‘TBD’) had net assets of £3.6 million (2014: £4.7 million) denominated in its local 
currency (Euros). The Group is exposed to translation risk in respect of the foreign currency value of the net assets of TBD.
The Group does not hold any derivatives (2014: none).
There has been no change to the Group’ s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk during 
the period.

Additional 
Information
Equity price risk
The Group is exposed to equity risk arising from its available-for-sale investments and those held-for-trading. Equity investments 
designated as non-current available-for-sale investments are held for strategic purposes rather than trading purposes and the Group 
does not actively trade in these investments.
Equity price sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.
If equity prices had been 5% higher/lower:
• Pre-tax profit for the period ended 30 September 2015 would have been £47,000 higher/lower (2014: £45,600 higher/lower) 
due to changes in the value of held-for-trading investment; and
• Other equity reserves as at 30 September 2015 would increase/decrease by £2,300 (2014: increase/decrease by £500,000) 
pre-tax for the Group as a result of the changes in fair value of available-for-sale investments.
The Group’ s sensitivity to equity prices has not changed significantly from the prior period.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of the Group’ s cash and in respect of client deposits. The Group holds client 
deposits on demand (variable interest rate). At the end of the period a 1% increase in base rate would have increased pre-tax 
profitability by £939,000 (2014: £784,000).
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a client or other counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 
Group. The Group’ s exposure to credit risk arises principally from the settlement of client and market transactions (‘settlement risk’) 
and cash deposited at banks. 
 Settlement risk
Exposures to settlement risk are spread across a large number of counterparties and clients. A delivery versus payment (‘DVP’) 
settlement method is also used for the majority of transactions, ensuring that securities and cash are exchanged within a short period 
of time. Consequently, no residual maturity analysis is presented. The Group also holds collateral in the form of cash, as well as equity 
and bonds which are quoted on recognised exchanges. This collateral is held, principally, in Group nominee accounts. 
Concentration of credit risk
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with the exception of cash where the majority is spread across four 
major banks.
Maximum exposure
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is equal to the balance sheet figure.
Credit exposure
Credit exposure in relation to settlement risk is monitored daily. The Group’ s exposure to large trades is limited with an average 
bargain size in the current period of £11,060 (2014: £11,700); there are additional controls for high value trades.
Impaired assets
The total gross amount of individually impaired assets in relation to trade receivables at the period end was £351,000 
(2014: £437,000). Collateral valued at fair value by the Group in relation to these impaired assets was £243,000 (2014: £240,000). 
This collateral is stock held in the clients’ account which per our client terms and conditions can be sold to meet any unpaid liabilities 
falling due. The net difference has been provided as a doubtful debt (see note 21). Note 21 also details amounts past due but 
not impaired. 
Non-impaired assets
Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired in respect of trade receivables relate mainly to bonds and equity trades quoted 
on a recognised exchange, are matched in the market, and are either traded on a DVP basis or against a client’ s portfolio in respect 
of which any one trade would normally be a small percentage of the client’ s collateral held in the Group nominee. At the period end no 
financial assets that would otherwise be past due or impaired had been renegotiated (2014: none).
Loans to employees are repayable over 5 to 10 years (see note 21).
129
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC   
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Overview 26. Financial instruments and risk management (continued) 
The credit risk on liquid funds, cash and cash equivalents, is limited as deposits are diversified across a panel of major banks. 
This ensures that the Group is not excessively exposed to an individual counterparty. The Group’ s policy requires cash deposits to be 
placed with banks with a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2 (S&P)/P-2 (Moody’ s)/F-2 (Fitch), excluding Tilman Brewin Dolphin 
Limited. Requirements and limits are reviewed on a regular basis. The Group’ s allocation of cash and cash equivalents to S&P rating 
grades has been outlined in the below table:
A-1+ A-1 A-2 Below A-2
Cash and cash equivalents 0.2% 67.2% 30.8% 1.8%*
* Held by Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited.
The Group maintains a set of Credit Risk policies which are regularly reviewed by the Board. A due diligence review is also performed 
on all counterparties on an annual basis, at a minimum. The investment of cash is managed by the Treasury Department.
There has been no material change to the Group’ s exposure to credit risk during the period.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group maintains 
adequate cash resources to meet its financial obligations at all times. All client cash deposits are repayable on demand. 
At 30 September 2015, the Group had access to an unsecured overdraft facility of £12 million (2014: £15 million).
The Group has a Liquidity Policy which is reviewed by the Board regularly. As the Group normally deals with the market on a DVP 
basis, liquidity risk is monitored by daily exception reports of unmatched items past settlement date and managed by the Credit 
Control Department. 
There has been no change to the Group’ s exposure to liquidity risk or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk during 
the period.
The following are the undiscounted cash flows, with the exception of shares to be issued, of financial liabilities based on the earliest 
date on which the Group can be required to pay.

Fair value measurement recognised in the statement of financial position
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets 
or liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than the quoted price included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or a liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from formal valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
Some of the Group’ s financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The following table 
gives information about how the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities are determined.

27 . Retirement benefit obligation 
The Group operates a registered Defined Contribution Scheme (the Brewin Dolphin Senior Staff Pension Fund) and a registered 
Defined Benefit Scheme (the Brewin Dolphin Limited RBS) in the UK which both offer pensions in retirement and death benefits to 
members. The disclosures provided are in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme only (the ‘Scheme’).
Pension benefits are related to the members’ final salary at retirement and their length of service. The pension is payable for life 
and has elements increasing in payment in line with inflation up to a maximum of 5% p.a. Since 1 April 2003 the Scheme has been 
closed to new members. Members under age 55 at 1 April 2004 ceased to accrue further service in the Scheme from that date. 
Contributions to the Scheme for the year beginning October 2015 are expected to be £3.0 million.
The Scheme is an HMRC registered pension scheme and is subject to standard UK pensions and tax law. This means that the 
payment of contributions and benefits are subject to the appropriate tax treatments and restrictions and the Scheme is subject to the 
Scheme funding requirements outlined in Section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004.
The Scheme was established under trust and is governed by the Scheme’ s Trust Deed and Rules. In accordance with UK trust and 
pensions law, the Scheme has appointed Trustees. Although the Group bears the financial cost of the Scheme, the responsibility for 
the management and governance of the Scheme lies with the Trustees, who have a duty to act in the best interest of members at 
all times.

 (78,660) (92,983)
Scheme deficit (20,192) (11,345)
Funding level 74% 88%
The last formal scheme funding valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 31 December 2011. As at the date of authorisation 
of these financial statements, the formal scheme funding valuation as at 31 December 2014 has not yet been finalised and any 
changes to the funding assumptions are in the process of being agreed by the Company and Trustees. The funding position at 
31 December 2014 shown is based on funding assumptions agreed for the 2011 valuation updated for the market conditions as at 
31 December 2014.
The Scheme is valued for funding purposes at intervals of not more than three years by an independent qualified actuary. 
The Group and the Scheme’ s Trustees agreed a deficit reduction plan following the 2011 valuation and it was agreed that Brewin 
Dolphin Limited would pay contributions of £250,000 per month from 1 January 2013 with a view to eliminate the deficit by 31 March 
2020. Brewin Dolphin Limited has also agreed to pay contributions at 25.6% of pensionable salaries in respect of future benefit 
accrual for the in-service members of the Scheme. From 1 October 2014, there is no longer any future benefit accrual following the 
retirement of the final in-service member. The next actuarial valuation of the Scheme is due as at 31 December 2014, a revised level of 
contributions in respect of future benefit accrual for in-service members if any, and a revised deficit reduction plan will be considered 
as part of this exercise. The administration costs of the Scheme, including investment management fees and Scheme levy payments 
are currently paid by Brewin Dolphin Limited as they fall due.
Summary of amounts recognised in the financial statements under IAS 19
In the consolidated financial statements, the Group accounts for pension costs, other post-retirement benefits and related 
redundancy provisions in accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. Under the standard, the difference between the market values 
of Scheme assets and the present value of Scheme liabilities is reported as a surplus (to the extent a surplus may be seen) or deficit in 
the Balance Sheet. The accounting value is different from the result obtained using the funding basis.
The accounts show the Scheme has a smaller deficit than that revealed by the last funding valuation. The main reasons for this is the 
difference between the experience of the Scheme over the period from 1 January 2012 to 30 September 2015 and that assumed for 
the purposes of the funding valuation as at 31 December 2011, and the differences in the assumptions used to value the liabilities in 
the accounting and funding valuations for the Scheme.
In the preparation of the valuations under IAS 19 referred to in this note, the actuary has used the assumptions indicated below, which 
the Group has directed for the purposes of accounting and disclosure under IAS 19.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Overview 27 . Retirement benefit obligation (continued) 
Risks
The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to the pension scheme are:
Mortality risk – the assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy. However, if life 
expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the Scheme and consequently 
increases in the Scheme’ s liabilities. The Group and the Scheme’ s Trustees review the mortality assumption on a regular basis to 
minimise this risk.
Investment risk – the Scheme invests its assets in a diversified portfolio of assets. There are risks that the assets underperform relative 
to increases in the value of the Scheme’ s liabilities increasing the cost to the Group of the benefit provision.
There is a risk that the assets invested in do not sufficiently match the characteristics of the Scheme’ s liabilities and so a fall in asset 
values is not similarly matched by a fall in the value of the liabilities. While certain assets are chosen that match the characteristics of 
the Scheme’ s liabilities and membership profile, the Scheme currently invests in a high proportion of equity and assets that are not 
expected to closely match the majority of the Scheme’ s liabilities. The Scheme’ s Trustees review the performance of the assets and 
structure of the portfolio on a regular basis to ensure the risks being taken under investment are commensurate with normal Trustee 
principles and the ability of the Group to mitigate adverse investment experience.
Price inflation risk – some of the Scheme’ s benefits increase in line with price inflation and so if inflation is greater than expected, the 
costs of providing these benefits will increase. The Scheme holds government bonds with payments also linked to inflation to assist in 
mitigating this risk.
Scheme investment strategy and level of matching
The Scheme’ s investment strategy is to invest broadly 85% in higher return seeking assets (e.g. equities, high yielding bonds etc.) and 
15% in matching assets (e.g. fixed interest gilts and index-linked gilts). The long-term objective is to target an investment return of 
2.55% p.a. (net of fees) in excess of a portfolio of gilts that closely matches the behaviour of the Scheme’ s liabilities. The Scheme also 
has a liability matching overlay to mirror the majority of the movement in the matching portfolio. This strategy reflects the Scheme’ s 
liability profile and the Trustees’ and Group’ s attitude to risk. The asset allocations as at 30 September 2015 and 28 September 2014 
are provided below, disaggregated between assets that have a quoted market price in an active market and those that are unquoted.
None of the assets of the pension schemes are invested in the Group’ s own financial instruments and none of the assets are 
properties or other assets used by the Group.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2014 and has been updated to 30 September 2015 by a 
qualified independent actuary. The major assumptions used by the actuary were (in nominal terms) as follows:

30 September

28 September 
2014
Discount rate 3.80% 3.90%

Sensitivity analysis
It should be noted that the methodology and assumptions prescribed for the purposes of IAS 19 mean that the disclosures will be 
inherently volatile, varying greatly according to investment market conditions at each accounting date.
A sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure the Scheme liabilities. The duration of the pension scheme liabilities 
is in the region of twenty years.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Decrease by 0.25% Increase by £4.2m
Rate of inflation (RPI and CPI) Increase by 0.25% Increase by £3.1m
Assumed life expectancy Members live 1 year longer Increase by £3.1m
The sensitivity figures have been calculated using the same method used for the calculation of the disclosed liabilities as at 30 September 
2015. There are no material limitations to the method used to calculate the sensitivities relative to the disclosed liabilities.

• Share Incentive Plan: No Matching Shares shall be forfeited as a consequence of a change of control.
• Equity Award Plan: Awards will vest upon change of control and options will become exercisable from the date of change of control 
and will remain exercisable for one month, after which the options will lapse.
All nil paid shares are held in the Trust up until they become fully paid shares. Nil paid shares were issued as part of the Senior 
Employee Matching Share Purchase Scheme, details of which are set out on page 69 of the Directors Remuneration Report and also 
note 31. The issue of nil paid shares to the Trust does not reduce shareholders’ funds as the individuals subscribe at the market value 
on the day of issue.

The merger reserve is used where more than 90% of the share capital in a subsidiary is acquired and the consideration includes the 
issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. £38.4 million of 
the Merger Reserve arose on a placing of the Company’ s shares and forms part of the distributable reserves. 
The share premium on the shares issued for the settlement of deferred consideration for Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited has been 
credited to the Merger Reserve in the period.

Other share-based payment plans
Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’)
The Group has a Share Incentive Plan. Employees may use funds from their gross salary up to a maximum of 10% of their gross 
salary in regular monthly payments (being not less than £10 and not greater than £125) to acquire ordinary shares in the Company 
(‘Partnership Shares’). Partnership Shares are acquired monthly. For every Partnership Share purchased, the employee receives one 
matching share up to a total value of £20. All shares to date awarded under this scheme have been purchased in the market monthly; 
it is the intention of the Directors to continue this policy in the year to September 2016. 
Deferred Profit Share Plan (‘DPSP’)
The DPSP provides for eligible employees to be required or invited to defer some or all of their annual profit share entitlement into 
an award over ordinary shares (an ‘Award’). Under the DPSP there is currently a mandatory deferral of 33% of any profit share in 
excess of £50,000 for a period of three years and additional deferral requirements for Executive Directors which are set out in the 
Remuneration Report. Employees can elect to voluntarily defer profit share into the plan. Awards are generally in the form of nil cost 
options to acquire ordinary shares, although at the discretion of the Committee they may also take the form of a conditional right to 
receive ordinary shares. Awards in the form of mandatory deferrals made to the employees who leave the Group at any time prior 
to vesting lapse unless the employee leaves as a result of good leaver provisions. It is the intention of the Board to recommend our 
Trustees to purchase the shares in the market for any shares awarded under this scheme in order to avoid dilution in the year to 
September 2016.

Information 31. Share-based payments (continued) 
Equity Award Plan (‘EAP’)
The Equity Award Plan is a discretionary arrangement under which contingent share awards can be made to selected employees 
within the Group below Board level, for example to reward exceptional performance on behalf of the Group or in certain 
circumstances to aid key staff retention. Awards will normally vest three years after grant subject to continued service provisions. 
Awards will only be capable of being satisfied with existing shares sourced via the Company’ s employee benefit trust. No newly 
issued shares and/or treasury shares can be used under the EAP . Only non-director employees are eligible for selection to participate 
in the plan.
The Group recognised total expenses in the period of £8,938,000 (2014: £8,498,000) related to equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions.

* In the prior period, the provision for leasehold dilapidations and social security contributions on share options were included in trade and other payables. During the current period, these have been 
reclassified to provisions to better reflect the nature of these balances.
The Group recognises a provision for settlements of sundry claims and associated costs; settlement of £0.7 million (2014: £nil) has 
been made since the balance sheet date. The timing of the settlement of the remaining balance is unknown, but it is expected that 
they will be resolved within twelve months of the year end.
The onerous contracts provision is in respect of both surplus office space and contracts associated with discontinued operations.
The valuation of an onerous contract is based on the best estimate of the likely costs discounted to present value. Where the 
provision is in relation to premises and it is more likely than not that the premises will be sublet, an allowance for sublease income has 
been included in the valuation.
Provision of £4.1 million has been made for surplus office space, which the Group may not be able to sublet in the short term. 
The maximum exposure is the current estimated amount that the Group would have to pay to meet the future obligations under 
these lease contracts which is approximately £6.9 million as at 30 September 2015 (2014: £14.4 million), if the assumption regarding 
sub-lets is removed and the time value of money is ignored. The longest lease term covered by the provision has eighteen years 
remaining and accounts for £3.6 million of the provision.
Provision of £10.3 million has been made in relation to onerous contracts resulting from discontinued operations (see note 13). 
These costs arise over the term of the contract. The contracts covered by the provision have a maximum remaining term of eight 
years, the maximum exposure is £10.7 million, if the time value of money is ignored.
The Group recognises a provision of £2.3 million for leasehold dilapidations. These costs are expected to arise at the end of the lease. 
The leases covered by the provision have a maximum remaining term of eighteen years.

FIVE YEAR RECORD – CONTINUING OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED) Revenue growth
1.  Discretionary funds under management (‘FUM’) inflows are calculated from the Group’ s client database. The growth of 5% 
(see page 25) net inflows is derived from the total new client accounts opened, closed or transferred between services categories 
during the period. Net inflows of £1.1 billion over the opening discretionary FUM value of £24.0 billion show an increase of 5%.
2.  Discretionary service yield shows the core commission and fee income over the average FUM for the period. Core discretionary 
income in 2015 of £225.5 million (2014: £215.9 million) from average discretionary FUM of £24.4 billion (2014: £23.0 billion) results 
in a 89 bps (2014: 94 bps) yield.
3.  Revenue
1
 Growth of 1% (2014: 2%) is the total income increase from £280.8 million in 2014 to £283.7 million in 2015.
Improved efficiency

 PBT margin is calculated by taking the adjusted
1,2
 profit before tax of £62.2 million in 2015 (2014: £58.4 million) over 
the total income of £283.7 million (2014: £280.8 million) resulting in an adjusted
1,2
 PBT margin of 21.9% (2014: 20.8%).

Group is 449 (2014: 487), total discretionary income is stated as £225.5 million (2014: £215.9 million) showing an income per 
CF30 increase from £443,000 in 2014 to £502,000 in 2015.
6.  Percentage of managed FUM in discretionary service of 88% (2014: 82%) is calculated by using the total discretionary 
managed FUM of £24.8 billion (2014: £24.0 billion) over the total managed/advised FUM for the Group of £28.3 billion 
(2014: £29.4 billion) (see page 21).
7.  Discretionary FUM per CF30 of £55 million (2014: £49 million) is based on the number of CF30s as per point 5 above over the 
total of discretionary managed FUM as per point 6 above.
8. Average client portfolio size is calculated by dividing the total discretionary and advisory managed FUM by the number of clients.
Capital sufficiency
9.  The capital adequacy ratio is calculated by dividing regulatory capital resources over the assessment of regulatory capital 
requirements see note 26.

1,2
 earnings per share 
of 17.1p (2014: 16.0p). The total dividend for the year including the proposed final dividend of 8.25p is 12.0p (2014: 9.9p) giving 
a 70% (2014: 62%) dividend payout.

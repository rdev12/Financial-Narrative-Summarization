This service transfers our in-store specialism for creating ‘custom-
made’ curtains and blinds to our customers home where we can 
advise and consult on the best products, colours and styles. The  
offer includes consultation, measurement, manufacture (through  
our in-house workshop), delivery and fit.
This offer is now live in 30 stores and will be rolled out to give  
national coverage through 2013/14. 10 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Geo ff 	 Coo per 	 Cha i r ma n
I am pleased to report another year of strong progress. 
The management team has continued to focus on our 
well-established strategy for developing the business, as 
well as keeping tight control on day to day operations. As 
a result, Dunelm has posted good growth in revenue and 
profits in the latest financial year, accompanied by further 
strong cash generation. More details are given by Nick 
Wharton, our Chief Executive, in his report.
Given the continuing strong business performance, the 
Board is able to recommend a 15% increase in the final 
dividend to 11.5p per share (2012: 10.0p), bringing the total 
ordinary dividends for the year to 16.0p (2012: 14.0p). We 
have also announced a special dividend of 25p per share, 
returning a further £50.7m of excess cash to shareholders.
The Board has continued to evolve over the last financial 
year with the appointment of a new Non-Executive 
Director, Liz Doherty. Liz joined the Board in May,  
bringing a wealth of experience across large retail and 
consumer businesses.
Looking ahead, we have a range of exciting development 
initiatives and in particular continue to see significant 
potential to expand our store portfolio further within the 
UK. We remain confident in the Dunelm proposition and 
look forward to further profitable growth.

N i c k 	 W ha r t o n 	 Ch ie f 	 E x ec u t ive
Overview
Against the background of continued pressures on the 
consumer throughout the last financial year, the business 
delivered a robust trading performance and made  
good progress against both its operational and  
strategic objectives. 
We remain focused on close operational management and 
on enhancing our customer experience, while investing 
confidently in the future growth of the business. This 
investment, consistent with our four strategic priorities, 
centres on the further strengthening of our specialist 
proposition, while at the same time increasing scale 
through store portfolio and multi-channel expansion. 
Reflecting the benefit of a particularly strong store 
opening programme over the last two financial years, our 
total revenue for the year increased by 12.2%. Within this, 
like-for-like sales (calculated by comparing stores which 
have traded throughout the last two financial years) grew 
by 1.7% as we continue to gain share in a market which we 
believe to be broadly flat. During the year we opened 14 
new superstores, including 2 relocations and the 
reopening of our Coventry store after a major fire in 2011.
Our growth has meant that during the past year we have 
become, according to Verdict Research, market leader  
for the first time with a share of 6.9% of the UK 
homewares market.
Disciplined inventory management and continued 
progress with direct sourcing delivered a 40 basis points 
expansion in gross margin year on year. With operating 
costs growing slightly ahead of sales, reflecting our 
ongoing investment in the customer proposition as well as 
building capability across the business for longer-term 
growth, our operating margin remained at a similar level to 
the previous year, at 15.7%. 
The business remains highly cash generative, readily 
funding the capital requirements associated with our 
growth as well as allowing a 14% year on year increase in 
the level of the ordinary dividend for the year. In addition 
we have been able to announce a special dividend 
totalling £50.7m to be distributed to shareholders in 
October 2013. This reflects our ongoing approach of 
periodically distributing surplus cash to shareholders.
Strategy development
We have continued to make good progress with our four 
strategic priorities.
Priority 1 – develop our specialist proposition
The UK homewares market is estimated by Verdict 
Research to be worth approximately £11bn. As market 
leaders, our key differentiator is industry-leading choice, 
offering quality products over the broadest price 
spectrum. This is supported by strong availability, 
customer convenience through an established multi-
channel proposition and friendly knowledgeable service.
Our range and choice are complemented by exceptional 
value for money at all price points together with strong 
brand representation. The Dunelm brand, with its core 
attributes of trust and value, is applied to the majority of 
products across the proposition. In addition we stock a 
number of key owned brands including Dorma, Hotel and 
Spectrum alongside major proprietary brands such as 
Fogarty, Tempur, Kenwood and Brabantia.
Our broad price architecture is mirrored across each of 
our core categories and creates a proposition that is 
attractive to a very wide customer set. This positioning 
has continued to help preserve existing footfall and attract 
new customers during the past financial year. The Dunelm 
offer ranges from our entry price position, which 
competes with products offered by grocers and discount 
multiples but at a higher quality, through a number of 
mid-market options, to our highest quality products which 
are comparable with offerings in department stores and 
higher-end independent retailers but at keener prices. 
We continue constantly to evolve our offer to ensure it 
remains contemporary, fresh and relevant. Through two 
seasonal refreshes we change approximately 25% of our 
ranges each year; while Special Buys and Miss It Miss Out 
(‘MIMO’) promotions emphasise Dunelm’s value 
credentials and provide a seasonal feel to the store.
We have a clear opportunity to build further awareness of 
the Dunelm brand. During the year, in addition to 
increasing our presence in the national press and growing 
our social media activity, we invested in our first full 
catalogue. Our initial 200 page edition was distributed to 
700,000 people in autumn 2012 and proved extremely 
effective in showcasing the breadth and authority of the 
Dunelm product offer. We followed this with a spring 
catalogue and plan to build on these successful 
investments with a larger autumn 2013 catalogue which 
will have a distribution of one million copies. 14 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013 Dunelm Group plc
Our next phase of investment in brand awareness 
incorporates an evolution of the current Dunelm branding. 
This evolution aims to communicate Dunelm’s range 
authority across all homewares categories and to highlight 
our strengths in value, convenience and service. We are 
introducing a new primary strapline of ‘There’s no place 
like Dunelm’, migrating to the more user-friendly domain 
name of www.dunelm.com and will remove our traditional 
‘Mill’ suffix from across the business. Research has shown 
that these changes will be positively received by both 
existing and new customer groups. The new strapline in 
particular is seen as a better reflection of our customers’ 
emotional connection with the home. We will use this 
evolution in our branding to increase brand awareness and 
introduce Dunelm to a wider group of homewares 
shoppers through our first significant TV advertising 
campaign. Subject to performance in pilot, our planned 
investment in this campaign will amount to approximately 
£3m over the current financial year.
Excellent customer service, a high quality in-store 
experience and differentiating services are all important in 
ensuring that our overall customer experience meets the 
promise of the ‘There’s no place like Dunelm’ campaign. 
During the last financial year, we invested across each of 
these dimensions, foremost of which was a significant 
customer service training programme for store colleagues 
– ‘Customer First’. This has been funded largely by 
reassigning colleague time in-store from non-customer 
facing tasks which we have been able to eliminate or 
reduce through better processes and systems. Initial 
results are pleasing in terms of both customer satisfaction, 
where our net promoter score hit new heights after  
the completion of the training and external recognition 
where Dunelm ranked very positively in the most recent 
annual survey of customer service undertaken by  
Which? magazine.
Our Window Treatments offer spanning fabrics, ready-
made and made to measure curtains and blinds is a 
category that relies on high levels of expertise, service and 
customer interaction. During the year we have 
successfully developed and piloted a new, more intuitive 
and interactive system, to support our made to measure 
service and this will be introduced to all stores this autumn 
ahead of our peak window treatments season.
Our Dunelm At Home service, through which customers 
can select bespoke, made to measure curtains and other 
window treatments via a free home consultation, is now 
available from 30 stores, with a further phased roll-out 
planned over the current financial year. Customers of this 
service are rightly demanding and we invest significantly 
in the training and development of our home consultants 
to ensure good levels of customer satisfaction.
Priority 2 – expand our store portfolio
Dunelm trades from two store formats. The bulk of the 
portfolio comprises out-of-town superstores, with our 
average new store footprint now targeted towards 30,000 
square feet of retail space. This space enables us to offer 
over 20,000 homewares products with the depth of range 
and availability that customers expect from a specialist 
retailer. It also accommodates a Pausa coffee shop, now 
present in 92 stores, providing an additional reason for 
customers to visit and increasing their engagement and 
dwell time. In addition to superstores, we also trade 
profitably from nine smaller high street locations where 
there are currently no suitable out-of-town alternatives.
In the last financial year we again opened over 400,000 
square feet of selling space through 14 new superstores 
(two being relocations and one a reopening) taking our 
superstore chain to 126 stores at the year end, providing 
3.8 million square feet of selling space in total. A further 10 
new stores are contractually committed. Following a 
detailed catchment analysis process completed in 2011, 
which sought to incorporate the impact of the anticipated 
growth of our multi-channel sales, we believe our mature 
UK superstore portfolio will consist of approximately 200 
stores. 
Our new stores continue to deliver strong returns on 
invested capital with the average expected discounted 
payback for stores opened in the last three financial years 
being approximately 28 months. We will continue to target 
the majority of our new store openings to achieve 
discounted cash flow payback of 36 months. However, as 
our portfolio becomes more mature our investment 
criteria will need to reflect some cannibalisation of 
revenues from existing stores and going forward we 
anticipate that a proportion of new stores (perhaps  
up to 30%) will be targeted to achieve payback in up  
to 48 months. 
Our refit programme covered 14 superstores this year,  
of which 4 were ‘major’ refits. The programme is designed 
to improve the shopping environment in our existing 
stores and to create a more consistent customer 
experience in terms of space allocation and  
department layouts. 
Chief Executive’s review co nt in ued 15 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements
As a result of this continued investment our portfolio is 
highly contemporary with 42% of the superstore chain 
either new or having benefited from a major refit over the 
past three years. 
Priority 3 – grow multi-channel
In common with trends elsewhere in UK retail, Dunelm 
customers are embracing the convenience and value of 
multi-channel shopping with a significant proportion of 
shopping journeys now involving some element of online 
activity (browsing, research or purchasing) through our 
website, www.dunelm.com.
The last financial year saw continued investment in both 
website development, to enhance the customer 
experience, and in digital marketing where returns remain 
attractive. Our ‘Reserve and Collect’ (‘R&C’) proposition, 
which links our store stock files to the web in real time, 
enables our customers to check availability and order 
from over 16,000 products. This was further enhanced 
during the year to provide for same day collection. R&C 
customers, who represent approximately a third of 
multi-channel revenues, pay for their reserved products 
on collection in store creating a clear opportunity for 
add-on or incremental sales in store. 
Development of the core website included the redesign of 
our homepage as well as key product pages where 
customers ‘land’ following an internet search. We have 
also introduced Paypal as a payment alternative and 
optimised our site for tablet users in response to the rapid 
increase in the number of customers accessing our site 
from these devices. Developments such as expert guides, 
better recommendations for complementary products 
and enhanced alternative images also ensure that our 
website stimulates interest, communicates our expertise 
and provides added value. 
As a consequence of all of the above, our multi-channel 
revenues continued to grow strongly, representing over 
4% of revenues over the full financial year and 
approximately 4.5% in the final quarter.
Our next targeted development will materially improve 
speed and choice within our home delivery offering 
where, despite strong progress elsewhere, our proposition 
remains below benchmark and therefore provides a clear 
opportunity for further improvement and revenue growth. 
The transfer of our fulfilment operation to a scalable 
facility that will enable us to hold stock of approximately 
20,000 lines, each available for next day delivery, is 
progressing well and is anticipated to be fully operational 
prior to peak winter trading.
While, as outlined above, significant enhancement of our 
multi-channel model has been possible on our existing 
web technology platform, our pace of development is 
restricted due to the configuration of the current software. 
Accordingly, we have initiated a programme to upgrade 
the platform and expect this to be completed during the 
second half of the current financial year, representing a 
capital investment of £4–5m. This replatforming will 
deliver a more customer-friendly website as well as 
allowing future developments to be achieved over shorter 
lead times, thus enabling more frequent introductions of 
improved functionality to our customers. 
Following a successful trial of extended inventory  
within furniture, we are targeting further web exclusive 
ranges and will apply our enhanced e:marketing and 
promotional capability to drive awareness of both core 
and extended ranges. 
Priority 4 – develop and exploit our infrastructure
Focused investment in our business infrastructure across 
IT systems, distribution facilities and people resources is a 
key contributor to Dunelm’s continued success and this 
continued in the past year. 
Investment in our IT systems has enabled us to improve 
stock control, make in-store processes more efficient and, 
through the upgrade during the year of our till systems, 
has enabled a better customer experience when they pay 
for their goods. The project to upgrade our enterprise 
wide SAP system is progressing well and is expected to be 
completed this calendar year.
The capacity and capability of the Group has been further 
strengthened by targeted recruitment including a Chief 
Information Officer who joined the business at the start of 
the current financial year. Meaningful headcount increases 
made in our buying, supply and space management teams 
have enabled us to develop product range options such 
that the best performing products within each category 
can be matched to each individual store based on their 
overall space and configuration. This development will 
continue in the current financial year, helping to create a 
more consistent shopping experience for our customers 
and reducing our lifecycle exposure to discontinued 
inventory. 
Summary and outlook
Dunelm delivered robust trading results over the year, in a 
demanding retail environment. We have strengthened our 
specialist proposition, improved customer service in-store 
and increased the profile of our brand. Each of these, 
together with our traditional product strength, has enabled 
us to increase sales on a like-for-like basis. We have also 
made good strategic progress scaling our business through 
new stores and multi-channel and strengthening our 
infrastructure. I would like to thank all my colleagues for their 
hard work and commitment in achieving this.
While recent economic data, particularly the volume of 
housing transactions, may suggest some improvement in 
consumer confidence, a degree of caution in relation to the 
broader UK economic environment remains appropriate. 
Furthermore, the unusually warm summer weather has had a 
temporary dampening effect on recent trading.
With strong plans in place to improve brand awareness and 
to grow Dunelm further through new stores and multi-
channel expansion, we remain confident in the future 
prospects for the business. Combined with our very strong 
financial position, this enables us to pay a special dividend 
equal to 25p per share as well as proposing an increase in 
the ordinary dividend in line with earnings.

Operating result
The ‘2013’ accounting period represents trading for the 52 
weeks to 29 June 2013 and the comparative period ‘2012’ 
represents trading for the 52 weeks to 30 June 2012.
Group revenue for 2013 was £677.2m (2012: £603.7m), an 
increase of 12.2%. This increase in revenue was achieved 
through growth in like-for-like sales of 1.7% and 
contribution from net new space amounting to 10.5%, the 
latter reflecting the strong store opening programme over 
the past two years including 14 new openings in 2013 (of 
which two were relocations and one a reopening). Like-
for-like sales performance was positive in both the first 
half (+2.2%) and second half (+1.2%) despite very strong 
comparative sales in the last quarter of 2012.
Gross margin increased by 40 basis points to 48.7%  
(2012: 48.3%) primarily reflecting benefits from direct 
sourcing initiatives. We will continue to pursue 
opportunities to drive margin benefits from direct 
sourcing and from challenging our UK based suppliers  
to achieve cost efficiencies. 
Operating costs grew by 13.6% compared with last year. 
Expansion of the store portfolio was the largest driver of 
this, but we also made important increases to our 
investment in customer service, the in-store shopping 
environment, multi-channel operations, marketing and our 
overall business infrastructure:
•	 Customer service. Thanks to various operational 
efficiency initiatives, we were able to reduce the time 
spent in stores on handling stock. We reinvested 
significantly in colleague hours to provide improved 
customer service, supported by a major training 
initiative under the banner of ‘Customer First’.
•	 In-store environment. We introduced improved product 
display mechanics (such as plastic pallets for walkway 
displays) and new point-of-sale materials across  
the estate.
•	 Multi-channel operations. As well as bearing the costs of a 
much higher volume of home-delivered orders than 
previously, we also invested in developing the website 
itself and in preparing the ground for transfer of our 
fulfilment operation to a third party provider this autumn.
•	 Marketing. We continued to increase our marketing 
investment with the launch of the Dunelm catalogue 
and further focus on digital marketing activities.
•	 Business infrastructure. We expanded our capabilities in 
a number of areas, including functions required to 
support our increasing focus on direct sourcing.
Group operating profit for the financial year was £106.5m 
(2012: £95.2m), an increase of £11.3m (11.9%). 
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation were £127.1m (2012: £113.9m). This has been 
calculated as operating profit (£106.5m) plus depreciation 
and amortisation (£20.6m) and represents an increase of 
11.6% on the previous year. The EBITDA margin achieved 
was 18.8% of sales (2012: 18.9%).
Financial items and PBT
The Group generated £1.5m net financial income for the 
year (2012: £1.0m). Financial items include interest earned 
on surplus cash deposits of £0.9m (2012: £0.8m) and 
foreign exchange gains arising from the translation of 
dollar denominated assets and liabilities at the end of the 
period, worth £0.6m (2012: £0.2m). As at 29 June 2013 the 
Group held $4.8m in US dollar cash deposits and 
additional forward contracts for $45.9m representing 
approximately 50% of the anticipated US dollar spend 
over the next 12 months. 
After accounting for interest and foreign exchange 
impacts, profit before tax for the year amounted to 
£108.1m (2012: £96.2m), an increase of 12.3%. 18 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Key performance indicators
* Including relocations. 19 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Tax, PAT and EPS
The tax charge for the year was 24.6% of profit before tax 
compared with 26.0% in the prior year. This reflects the 
reduction in the headline rate of corporation tax to 23.75% 
(2012: 25.50%) as well as a one-off benefit received in 
2012 as a result of a project that increased the level of 
assets qualifying for capital allowances. We expect the tax 
charge to trend approximately 100 bps above of the 
headline Corporation Tax rate going forward. This 
difference is mainly due to depreciation charged on 
non-qualifying capital expenditure.
Profit after tax was £81.5m (2012: £71.2m), an increase of 
14.4%.
Basic earnings per share for the year ended 29 June 2013 
was 40.2p (2012: 35.3p), an increase of 13.9%. Fully diluted 
EPS increased by 14.0% to 40.0p (2012: 35.1p).
Capital expenditure
Gross capital expenditure in the financial year was £26.5m 
compared with £38.6m last year. Significant investments 
were made in order to support continued growth and 
development of the Superstore portfolio with the addition 
of 14 new stores (58% of capital expenditure) and 14 refits. 
The remaining investment related mainly to IT activities, 
including a refresh of till systems, initial work on upgrading 
our core enterprise system (‘SAP’) due to be completed 
this autumn and initial work on implementing a new 
technology platform for our multi-channel offer.
Working capital
Investment in working capital increased by £3.4m over the 
year, primarily as a result of additional stock to support 
the expansion in the store estate, partially offset by lower 
average inventories per store.
Cash position and dividend
Dunelm remains a highly cash generative business. In 2013 
the Group generated £100.4m (2012: £91.9m) of net cash 
from operating activities, an increase of 9.2%. Net cash 
resources at the end of the year were £44.7m (2012: 
£65.2m) with daily average cleared funds over the course 
of the financial year £66.2m (2012: £57.6m).
An interim dividend of 4.5p was paid in April 2013 (2012: 
4.0p). It is proposed to pay a final dividend of 11.5p per 
share (2012: 10.0p). The total dividend of 16.0p represents 
a 14.3% increase over last year reflecting the Group’s 
strong financial performance and leaves dividend cover of 
2.5x, in line with our target. This dividend will be paid on 
20 December 2013 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 29 November 2013.
The Board reviews the Group’s funding position on a 
regular basis and has concluded that access to committed 
lines of external funding is not required in the short term. 
Dunelm continues to maintain uncommitted lines of 
funding with partner banks whilst trading with a positive 
net cash position.
Additional returns to shareholders
The Group’s policy is to maintain cash resources such  
that it is able to invest in the four pillars of its strategy  
and in addition to take advantage of investment 
opportunities as and when they arise, for example 
freehold property acquisitions. It also remains committed 
to returning excess capital to shareholders from time to 
time where these cash resources are materially in excess 
of investment requirements. 
During the year, the Group returned excess capital  
of £65.8m (32.5p per share) to shareholders via a B/C 
share scheme.
In keeping with its capital policy and taking into account 
the Group’s current financial strength; anticipated trading 
performance; its known and anticipated investment plans; 
and the level of cash available, the Board has also 
announced that surplus cash amounting to £50.7m (25.0p 
per share) will be returned to shareholders in the form of a 
special dividend. This will be paid on 11 October 2013 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 20 
September 2013. 
Share buyback
The Board has decided to commence the purchase of shares 
to hold in treasury in order to satisfy future exercises of 
options granted under incentive plans and other share 
schemes. This will avoid issuing new shares, which has been 
our general practice historically. This programme will 
commence in October 2013 and over time we expect to 
build a holding equivalent to approximately 60% of 
outstanding options at any time (currently 2.3m options).
Financial risk and treasury management
The Group Board has established an overall Treasury 
Policy, day-to-day management of which is delegated to 
the Finance Director. This policy ensures the following;
•	 Effective management of all Clearing Bank operations.
•	 Access to appropriate levels of funding and liquidity.
•	 Optimal investment of surplus cash within approved 
risk/return profile.
•	 Appropriate management of foreign exchange 
exposures and cash flows.
Key performance indicators
In addition to the traditional financial measures of sales 
and profits, the Directors review business performance 
each month using a range of other KPIs. These include 
measures shown on page 18, opposite.

Key risks and uncertainties
Description
The quality and safety of our stores products and 
services (including coffee shops) is essential to 
the business. If our specialist proposition fails to 
deliver this there is a risk that individuals could be 
harmed and that reputational damage could lead 
to consumers, colleagues and other stakeholders 
losing confidence in the brand.
Mitigation
•	 We have a range of policies specifying the 
quality of products and production processes 
that are signed up to by suppliers.
•	 We operate a full test schedule for all new 
products and on a sample basis for ongoing 
lines, overseen by our specialist T echnology 
team. This also covers human rights concerns.
•	 Food hygiene is maintained through the 
adoption of clear operating guidelines 
contained in the Groups ‘Food Safety Manual’. 
Staff certification is compulsory and risk 
assessments, equipment inspections and 
compliance audits are in constant use to ensure 
standards are maintained.
•	 We continue to invest in a re-fit programme to 
ensure stores remain contemporary and provide 
a high quality shopping environment.
•	 All our operating locations are subject to 
regular health and safety compliance audits 
to ensure they provide a safe and secure 
environment.
Progress in 2012/13
•	 Our policies and procedures have been 
reviewed and updated.
•	 Our product recall procedure has been 
reviewed.

In common with all businesses, Dunelm faces risks 
and uncertainties, the effective management of 
which is necessary to enable us to achieve our 
strategic objectives and to secure our business 
for the long term.
Our risk management process aims to ensure that 
the business balances both risk and reward and 
makes sound judgements as to likelihood and 
impact. 
Periodic risk identification and assessment 
workshops are in place involving senior 
management representing all parts of the business 
to review the risk profile of the organisation and  
to assess the potential likelihood and impact of 
those risks. The Group’s Risk Register, which lists 
and ranks the risks in terms of both potential 
impact as well as relative importance, is updated 
following these workshops. 
Quarterly reviews of these risks and the controls  
in place to address them are undertaken by 
management and the Board gains assurance 
through twice yearly reviews, as well as by  
regular challenge to the executive team.
Further details of our governance and risk 
framework is set out in the Corporate Governance 
report on pages 36 to 42.
Our assessment of the principal risks facing the 
business are set out below:

Description
The Group competes with a wide variety of 
retailers both in-store and online. Failure to 
maintain a competitive offer in the Homewares 
market on multiple fronts (price, range, quality 
and service) could materially impact returns and 
limit opportunities for growth.
Mitigation
•	 The Board continually monitors Group 
performance within the Homewares market and 
against specific competitive threats.

to gauge relative customer perception and 
experience.
•	 We have a strong focus on new product 
development, both in existing and new 
homewares categories, to strengthen our 
specialist proposition.
•	 We are investing significant resource to develop 
and enhance our multi-channel customer offer.
Progress in 2012/13
•	 We are now the UK’s leading homewares 
retailer with a market share of 6.9%.

in-store towards activities which enhance the 
customer experience.
•	 We have Introduced a new customer feedback 
system which enables us to react quickly to 
both positive and negative feedback.
•	 Increased marketing expenditure has helped 
raise awareness of our brand.
•	 Our online sales now account for 4.1% of total 
sales (up from 2.5% in 2011/12).

Description
We are dependent on the reliability and capability 
of key information systems and technology. 
A major incident (including a cyber-attack), 
sustained performance problems or failure to

significant threat to the business, at least in the 
short term.
Mitigation
•	 All business critical systems are based on 
established, industry leading package solutions, 
with full support in place.
•	 We have a disaster recovery strategy designed 
to ensure continuity of trade.
Progress in 2012/13

Description
Availability of vacant or new retail space in the 
right location is essential to deliver our growth 
plans. Inability to secure or develop the required 
retail trading space to deliver our superstore 
format will limit our pace of expansion or force us 
to compromise our offer.
Mitigation
•	 Our Group Property Director actively monitors 
availability of retail space with the support of 
professional advisers.
•	 Financial modelling helps us assess the viability 
of potential sites.
•	 The Group’s strong cash generation and debt-
free status provide an attractive covenant to 
landlords and the ability to acquire freehold 
units if appropriate.
Progress in 2012/13
•	 Our strategy for the acquisition of sites in key 
catchment areas remains under regular review.
•	 We have legally completed on 10 new stores

Description
Significant cost price increases and high levels 
of volatility have been a feature of retailing 
over recent years particularly freight rates, raw 
materials, energy and exchange rates. Failure to 
manage and control these changes may lead to 
pressure on margins and adversely impact the 
financial results.
Mitigation
•	 Dunelm uses its scale, buying power and 
growth to secure supply of key raw materials at 
competitive prices.
•	 Increased direct sourcing of products from the 
Far East has mitigated cost increases.
•	 Freight rates, energy and currency are bought 
forward to help mitigate volatility and aid 
margin management.
Progress in 2012/13
•	 16.2% of our products are now sourced directly 
from the Far East (14.3% 2011/12).
•	 Foreign currency hedging has been increased 
to provide a greater level of certainty in 
commercial decision making.

Description
The Group could suffer the loss of a major facility 
with a consequent impact on short-term trading 
or diversion of focus from longer-term strategy 
and planning. This could materially affect the 
profitability of the business. 
The Group could suffer the loss of a major supply 
partner also impacting short-term trading.
Mitigation
•	 Physical infrastructure – Head office, workroom, 
multi-channel and distribution centre activities 
are all subject to disaster recovery plans and 
could all operate from fall back facilities.
•	 Suppliers – The Group seeks to mitigate this 
risk by limiting the dependency on individual 
suppliers and by actively managing key supplier 
relationships. High stock service levels and a 
high proportion of direct-to-store deliveries 
further mitigate supply chain risk.
Progress in 2012/13
•	 We have carried out desk-top simulations of 
disaster scenarios affecting our major facilities.
•	 We have moved away from UK supplies to 
direct sourcing from factories in cases where 
supplier capability issues were identified.

How do we manage CSR?
We do not treat CSR as a separate function: Ultimate accountability rests with the Board; individual Directors and 
senior managers have responsibility for CSR topics through their role accountabilities.
The diagram below sets out how we manage CSR matters:
CSR Consideration Why it matters to Dunelm
Customers
The success and future growth of our business depends on us being able to 
deliver a wide choice of products and services to our customers, that are 
great value, from a convenient location
Colleagues
We employ over 8,000 colleagues across our stores and in our distribution, 
manufacturing and store support centre locations. Without their hard work 
and dedication we would be unable to deliver great products and services to 
our customers and successfully grow and develop our business
Health and Safety
We recognise that we have a duty of care to ensure the health and safety of 
customers, colleagues, contractors and all other visitors to our premises. 
Health and safety risk management is an integral part of the core standards 
that we set for our business
Suppliers
We do not manufacture our own products, therefore we need to maintain 
relationships with suppliers and manufacturers worldwide who can meet our 
high standards for design, innovation, quality and value. These suppliers must 
also demonstrate that they operate in accordance with recognised standards 
that uphold human rights
Environment
We recognise that we have a responsibility to manage the impact of our 
business on the environment both now and in the future. The Group is 
committed to controlling and minimising the impact of its operations in  
the key areas of waste management, energy consumption and carbon  
(CO

Colleagues
Champion: Finance Director
What do we do?
We are a growing business and we need to be able 
to attract and retain colleagues to help us deliver our 
development plans. We offer a competitive remuneration 
and benefits package, including our annual sharesave 
scheme which is open to all colleagues.
We are an equal opportunities employer; our policy is to 
recruit, develop, promote and retain skilled and motivated 
people regardless of disability, race, religion or belief, sex, 
sexual orientation, gender reassignment, marital status 
or age.
We maintain regular communication with all colleagues, through store manager ‘huddles’, our Dunelm Gazette 
magazine which is published at least quarterly, and via the computer-based ‘Dunelm Academy’, to which all 
colleagues have access. We also operate a Colleagues’ Council, through which colleague representatives can raise 
and discuss ideas and concerns with senior management. Concerns raised are then fed back to the Executive Board 
for consideration and action. In addition we run an annual colleague engagement survey the output of which also is 
fed back to the Executive Board and actions agreed.
We offer a range of training and development opportunities to colleagues at all levels of the business. These include:
•	 Nationally accredited modern apprenticeships and NVQs.
•	 Our graduate programme, which leads to an Institute of Leadership and Management qualification.
•	 Support for colleagues studying for professional qualifications, such as in finance, HR and IT.
•	 A range of workshops in key management skills, such as leadership and communications.
•	 Interactive computer based product knowledge and other training.

CSR Report continued
Health and safety
Champion: Chief Operating Officer
What do we do?
The Board is ultimately responsible for the creation and implementation of our health and safety policy and procedures, 
which include an effective system of ‘upward’ and ‘downward’ communication, appropriate standards for monitoring 
performance and for ensuring that sufficient resources are available to support this activity.
Health and safety is a standard agenda item at every Board meeting and the Board receives a monthly report and a 
formal annual presentation from the Group’s Health and Safety manager.
Regular Health and Safety review meetings held between the Group’s Health and Safety Manager and senior 
management from key operational functions. These meetings ensure risks are understood and that relevant mitigating 
action has been taken to provide a safe environment.
Each store manager is responsible for ensuring the implementation of health and safety policy and procedures in his or 
her store, supported by the area manager and the Group Health and Safety Manager. Risk assessments are in place and 
updated as required.
We have an in-house health and safety audit document, which proactively addresses health and safety risk and is 
updated every six months. The audit covers stores, workplace transport, store development, warehousing and the  
store support centre. Our stores complete an online self audit monthly and area managers audit all of their stores at 
least once a year. This is backed up by our in-house operational audit team and followed up by the Group Health and 
Safety Manager.
We have an ongoing programme of education and training, including DVDs and interactive computer based learning.
What have we achieved this year?
2012/2013 Objectives Achievements
Further utilise and develop the intranet and e-learning 
systems for training and central recording of site 
documentation
We have introduced a Training and Development team 
within the HR department to manage the training for all 
colleagues assisted through e-learning
Review and improve our key risk controls for:
•	 Fire Safety
•	 Work Related Road Safety
•	 Workplace Transport
Annual extinguisher training introduced
Driver guide fully reviewed
Six monthly driver survey completed
Other achievements
By targeting high standards of compliance to Company procedures and using positive reinforcement of success 
achieved, we have been able to improve compliance against our internal audit to 89% for 2012/13 (82% 2011/12). We 
have seen an accident rate of 3.9 accidents for every 100,000 visits (up from 3.5 in 2011/12), which reflects our focus on 
ensuring that all accidents are recorded, however minor. The proportion of accidents involving very minor incidents (no 
treatment required) is high: 52% of customer accident reports and 42% of colleague reports. 
Customer accidents
Actions taken to address two key areas for accidents to customers have seen excellent results:
•	 Car Park trips – six monthly inspection surveys with remedial repairs have been implemented which has resulted in a 
50% reduction in reported accidents from this cause in January to June 2013 compared with the previous six months.
•	 Falling canvasses – Adjustments to our display stands have resulted in a 32% reduction in reported accidents from 
this cause in January to June 2013 compared with the previous six months.
Colleague accidents
The extended use of ‘totes’ for stock deliveries and the introduction of plastic pallets in place of wooden pallets has led 
to a reduction in colleague accidents:
•	 Deliveries – a reduction of 24% of accidents in January to June 2013 compared to the previous six months.
•	 Replenishment – a reduction of 38% of accidents in January to June 2013 compared with the previous six months.
2013/14 objectives
•	 Review and update Health and Safety training DVDs.
•	 Develop an online accident reporting system.
•	 Development of new claim handling procedures in line with requirements of legal reforms. 29 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information
Suppliers
Champion: Buying Director
What do we do?
We work with our suppliers to ensure that our products are produced in clean and safe environments, that workers are 
treated with respect and earn a reasonable wage and that suppliers work within the relevant local laws and regulations. 
All direct suppliers are required to sign up to our ‘Code of Conduct’ enforced by a full programme of independent factory 
audits at least every three years, based on the Ethical Trading Initiative (‘ETI’) base code. Following the well publicised 
factory fire in Bangladesh (not a Dunelm supplier) we extended our audit to specifically cover building safety.
Where non-conformances are discovered we have a formal procedure for working with a supplier to help them achieve 
compliance, usually within three months. The majority of non-conformances arise from the absence of records. Critical 
non-conformances such as use of child labour or absence of valid Building Certificate are escalated immediately and 
supplies cease until the issue has been resolved. Ultimately if progress is inadequate we will cease to trade with the supplier.
We aim to treat all of our suppliers fairly and consistently. We ask all of our suppliers to sign our standard terms and 
conditions. All new suppliers are made aware of the basis of trade with Dunelm and in particular our standard payment 
terms in advance of commencing trade. The number of days’ purchases outstanding for payment at 29 June 2013 was 
29 days (2012: 30 days).
What have we achieved this year?
2012/13 objectives Achievements
Work with partners to develop in-house ethical auditing 
expertise
New in-house combined technical and ethical audit 
implemented from December 2012– includes building safety
Upgrade supplier ethical audit database to give us greater 
visibility
Database cleansed and updated
Other achievements
We have formalised commercial arrangements with a small number of partners in the Far East – this will enable us to 
monitor adherence to our policies more closely.
2013/14 objectives
•	 Join SEDEX to gain better visibility of supply chain standards.
•	 Set targets for key suppliers to improve workplace conditions beyond the minimum.
•	 New sustainability standards to be introduced – to encourage better water usage, reduction of harmful effluents, use 
of recycled materials and energy efficiency.
•	 Procedure to be implemented to ensure full traceability for timber and paper products.
Community
Champion: Marketing Director
What do we do?
We adopt a ‘charity of the year’, for which collections are made in-store, specific fund-raising 
events are organised and the Group makes its own donations. Each store has a ‘Charity 
Champion’ and amounts raised by store are reported monthly, with the top three recognised 
in the Dunelm Gazette. We also support colleagues who are raising money for charities of 
their choice, often by matching the sums raised.
We have a monthly payroll lottery, half of the proceeds of this go to our chosen charity.
We do not make any political donations.
What have we achieved this year?
2012/13 objectives Achievements
Support our Charity of the Year, Wallace and Gromit’s 
children’s charity whose objectives are to improve the 
quality of life of sick children in hospitals and hospices 
across the United Kingdom
Funds were raised through a variety of ways, including  
our payroll lottery, the annual Friends and Family night,  
(a themed fancy dress fundraising evening in store), 
through sale of pin badges, bake sales, fancy dress days, 
sample sales and the ‘Wrong Trousers’ day
The total value of donations made by the Group in the year ended 29 June 2013 was £80,000 (2012: £97,000). Total 
funds raised for charity by the Group and colleagues was £205,000 (2012: £192,000).
2013/14 objectives

senior managers representing key areas of the business.  
This team is tasked with the development and implementation 
of strategy as well as ongoing monitoring to achieve high levels of environmental performance.
Our progress over the past financial year and our goals for the forthcoming year are detailed below:
1. Waste recycling 
What do we do?
Dunelm is committed to increasing the volume of waste which is recycled and to reducing the volume of waste going to 
landfill. This commitment is championed by our National Recycling Manager. 
During the year the company has continued to develop its ‘Recycle at Work’ initiative. This program ensures that 
colleagues are engaged and supported to deal appropriately with waste at a site-by-site level. All superstores and 
warehouses are equipped with balers to process waste at source, while colour coded bins and signage supports further 
grading and segregation of other waste streams. This initiative is underpinned by annual site audits to ensure ongoing 
compliance and improvement. 
In the year we have invested in an industrial paper shredder. This adds to our capabilities and means that our national 
recycling centre can now recycle all of our cardboard, plastics, paper, confidential paper, bottles and cans. This 
investment, combined with our drive in stores has increased the level of recycled waste to 82% (2012: 76%)
We have also engaged our suppliers to review the specification of packaging used to maximise recyclable content. All 
plastic packaging is now clear LDPE (‘Low Density Polyethylene’), this product having a much greater recyclable 
content. The use of polystyrene has also been reduced.
This drive to improve our level of recycling has allowed us to divert all of our waste from landfill. Any waste that is not 
recycled within the business is sent offsite for further sortation, to extract other recyclable content, and the remaining 
‘general waste’ is incinerated in a waste to energy plant with carbon capture technology.
What have we achieved this year?
2012/13 objectives Achievements
Reduce all waste to landfill to zero Dunelm achieved a ‘Zero Waste to Landfill’ status in December 2012.
Increase use of reusable totes in the supply chain Deliveries in reusable totes now account for 17% of all supplier deliveries
Waste recycled (all stores) – %
CSR Report continued
2013-14 objectives
•	 To maintain ‘zero waste to landfill’. 
•	 To increase the recycled element of waste to over 90%. 
•	 To reduce the level of polystyrene in packaging by 50%. 31 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

2. Energy usage
What do we do?
Energy reduction on a site-by-site basis has been a key focus for the Group in the last financial year. 
Dunelm fit AMR (‘Automatic Meter Reading’) smart meters in all sites to monitor and control all electricity and gas 
supplies. Data on energy consumption is pulsed through on a half-hourly basis allowing us to profile high or unusual 
patterns, target specific sites and to monitor the success of our energy reduction initiatives.
All investments in new and refitted stores now come with a Building Management System (‘BMS’) as standard. This 
BMS is designed to optimise energy usage across the site while maintaining an appropriate shopping environment for 
our customers and colleagues. At the end of the year we had 118 stores (2012: 101) with BMS. 
As a result of these actions we have reduced electricity usage in like-for-like stores by over 8% during the past three 
years. Last year in isolation, however, saw an increase of 1.2% as a result of extended operating hours as well as very 
unseasonal weather through a wet summer and historically cold March.
What have we achieved this year?
2012/13 objectives Achievements
To reduce electricity usage by 5% in LFL stores Target missed, Electricity consumption increased by 1.2% 
(see above) 
Y-O-Y Reduction in electricity consumption

3. Carbon emissions (CO
2
)
What do we do?
Dunelm participate in the Environment Agency’s Carbon Reduction Commitment (‘CRC’) 
scheme and have submitted annual reports for the last three years. During this time we  
have reduced our CO
2
 equivalent emissions per ft
2
 of selling space by 13%. The Group’s 
carbon footprint from these ‘core’ supplies was 26,747 tonnes of CO
2
 (2012: 23,234 tonnes), 
a year-on-year increase of 9 tonnes per store.
Over the past year we have continued to source electricity from ‘Green Energy’ supplies such as combined heat and 
power sources where CO
2
 emissions are 30% lower than the national average. We have also signed a new energy 
supply agreement which commits the business to this source of energy for the next two years. 
We continue to reduce the emissions generated by our company car fleet. Average emissions were 114 CO
2
 g/km (2012: 
120 CO
2
 g/km) driven by the many fuel efficient options that exist on our car schemes. 
During the year Dunelm achieved reaccreditation with the Carbon Trust Standard (‘CTS’) recognising our success and 
commitment to reducing our carbon footprint. This certification lasts until December 2014 and underlines our 
continuing commitment in this area. 
The Group has continued its association with a specialist partner to consult on our energy buying strategy, investments 
in energy saving technology and to further focus on reducing our carbon emissions.
This year we will focus on building design, in-store environment and investments to reduce consumption further. 
Continued investment and optimisation of BMS will remain a strategic goal and we aim to complete a full ‘store-wide’ 
LED lighting trial. 
2013/14 objectives
•	 To reduce electricity by 5% in LFL stores.
•	 To reduce gas usage by 10% in LFL stores.
•	 Fully trial LED lighting technologies in new stores. 32 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

4. Product packaging
What do we do?
Dunelm continues to work with suppliers to reduce the absolute level of product packaging whilst at the same time 
improving its recyclable content.
In the year we have audited many of our waste streams to divert materials from landfill where possible. Most recently we 
have identified a particular specification of clear plastic or wrap that should be used by suppliers. This will be the 
standard for all suppliers going forward. 
The Group is promoting a reduction in the use of ‘single-use’ carrier bags and has implemented a charge for these bags 
in all stores in Wales and Northern Ireland in line with legislation.
What have we achieved this year?

Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information
Dear Shareholder
Governance has remained at the top of the external 
business agenda over the past year and we have 
continued to evolve our own arrangements in response.
In my letter last year I outlined our approach to 
governance, which is set out in detail in the corporate 
governance report which follows this letter. Put simply, we 
believe that sound governance is an essential requirement 
for long-term, sustainable growth and we apply 
regulatory guidelines in a pragmatic way that adds value 
to your Board and your Company.
Our appointment of Liz Doherty as an additional Non-
Executive Director in May is part of our succession plan 
for the Board. Liz has broad operational and financial 
experience and a strong track record across a number of 
retail and consumer businesses, both here in the UK and 
abroad. Her experience of branding, marketing and 
multi-channel will be particularly valuable as the Dunelm 
business continues to grow.
In January we held our second Corporate Governance 
presentation, attended by a number of our major 
institutional shareholders and their representative bodies. 
We had an open discussion of a number of topics that are 
important to our shareholders and ourselves, including 
succession, remuneration and risk. Following on from this, 
we have made some changes to the performance-related 
remuneration of our Executive Directors, which Marion 
Sears, Chair of the Remuneration Committee, explains in 
her report. 
In response to the increasing requirements of regulators 
and investors for us to focus more on risk, we have 
widened the terms of reference of our Audit Committee, 
which now becomes the Audit and Risk Committee. 
Notwithstanding the formal committee requirements, we 
see management of risk as a whole Board issue; we have 
also formally considered our ‘risk appetite’ in the context 
of our strategy discussions. 
As required by the Corporate Governance Code, we 
appointed an independent third party to carry out our 
Board evaluation. The overall conclusion was that the 
Board is operating effectively and is closely aligned to the 
culture of the business. Further details are described in 
the Corporate Governance report.
In accordance with emerging best practice, we have 
defined and adopted an Investor Relations strategy, which 
includes our Corporate Governance presentation. 
Consequently, we have refreshed our investor relations 
website and included more content, particularly on 
Corporate Social Responsibility. We believe our Non-
Executive Directors have more contact with institutional 
investors than our peers, through attendance at results 
presentations and a selection of the shareholder meetings 
which follow.
At our AGM this year we will again be seeking authority to 
buy back shares to satisfy employee share option 
entitlements. In view of Will Adderley’s shareholding of 
30.48% we will also need to request a waiver under the 
Takeover Code. We have listened to shareholder concerns 
about ‘creeping control’, and in the Corporate Governance 
report we have drawn more explicit attention to the 
safeguards against this, which we hope shareholders will 
consider in a positive light.
Yours sincerely

Overview
Our approach to governance can be summarised as follows:
•	 We believe that good governance leads to stronger value creation and lower risks for shareholders.
•	 We support corporate governance guidelines and seek to apply them in a way that is meaningful to our business and 
consistent with our culture and values. 
•	 If we decide that the interests of the Company and its shareholders can be better served by doing things in a 
different way, we will explain the reasons why. 
•	 We believe that the Board’s governance role includes to instil and maintain a culture of honesty, integrity and 
transparency throughout the business, through our policies, communications and by the way in which we act.
For more information please see the copy of the presentations that we made to our major institutional investors and 
shareholder representatives in January 2012 and 2013, available in the ‘Reports and Presentations’ section of our 
corporate website. 
Code compliance
This report explains how we have applied the principles of good governance and code of best practice set out in the 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Corporate Governance Code’) published in June 2010.
At the end of the financial year, the Board considers that it is fully compliant with the Corporate Governance Code.
Board role and composition
The role of the Board is to set the strategy that will secure the continued growth of the Group over the long term in  
the interests of its shareholders, whilst preserving and enhancing our culture. In doing so we take account of our 
responsibilities to colleagues, customers, the community in which we operate and the interests of our other stakeholders.
Within this context, the Board has overall responsibility for controlling the Group, making decisions relating to the 
Group’s strategic direction and measuring progress towards strategic goals.
Board balance and committee membership is fully compliant with the requirements of the Corporate Governance Code. 
The names and roles of each of the Directors are set out in the table below. Liz Doherty was appointed to the Board on 
1 May 2013.
The Board considers that Geoff Cooper was independent on appointment and that Marion Sears, Simon Emeny, Matt 
“ We believe that sound Governance is an essential requirement 
for long-term sustainable growth.”

Davies and Liz Doherty are independent. Overall the Board considers that there is a good balance of Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors.
Two directors, Geoff Cooper and Marion Sears, will have served nine years on the Board during the 2013/14 financial 
year (seven years since flotation of the Company). The Board has specifically considered whether they continue to 
exhibit independence of character and judgement, and confirmed that they do. As noted in the report of the 
Nominations Committee, Board refreshment is a continued area of focus and the tenure of Directors is being considered 
as we manage succession over the next few years. Our policy on Board diversity is explained in the Nominations report.
The Board has adopted written statements setting out the respective responsibilities of the Chairman, Executive 
Deputy Chairman and the Chief Executive; these are available on the Group’s website or from the Company Secretary. 
In general terms, the Chairman is responsible for running the Board and the Chief Executive is responsible for running 
the Group’s business, supported by the Executive Deputy Chairman who focuses specifically on strategic activities 
which protect and enhance shareholder value and embed the Group’s culture and values.
Board attendance
The Board held eight meetings in the course of the year, one of which was dedicated to a formal review of strategy.

Will Adderley were each unable to attend one meeting. They still received the Board papers, and passed on comments in advance of the meeting via 
the Chairman.
Board activities
There is a schedule of matters reserved to 
the Board for decision or approval, which is 
available on the Group’s website or from the 
Company Secretary. Examples of such 
matters include Group strategy and budget, 
Group capital structure, approval of financial 
results and report and accounts, significant 
capital or contractual commitments, 
maintaining internal control and risk 
management and approval of significant 
Group-wide policies.
At each meeting, the Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director report on operational 
performance (including health and safety) 
and the Finance Director reports on financial 
performance. There is a rolling agenda of 
other operational, strategic and risk topics 
which is regularly refreshed to reflect the 
most up to date strategy and ‘live’ issues in 
the business. The principal topics discussed 
by the Board in 2012/13 were:
Areas of focus

Corporate governance report continued
Minutes of all Board and Committee meetings are taken by the Company Secretary and committee secretary 
respectively and circulated for approval. Any unresolved concerns raised by a Director are recorded in the minutes.
Non-Executive Director Meetings
The Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors met twice during the year without Executive Directors being 
present and regularly have informal individual meetings with the Executive Directors and other senior managers in  
the business, usually at a store location. In addition the Non-Executive Directors meet at least once a year without  
the Chairman present as part of the Board effectiveness review process, which includes a formal review of the 
Chairman’s performance.
Board committees
The Board has appointed three committees, an Audit and Risk Committee, a Nominations Committee and a 
Remuneration Committee. The terms of reference of each of these committees can be found on the Group’s website 
and are available from the Company Secretary. 
During the period, the Audit Committee was renamed the Audit and Risk Committee and its terms of reference were 
widened, to reflect its increased focus on management of risk.
Details of the membership of the committees and of their activities during the past financial year can be found in the 
reports from the Chair of each of the committees on pages 43 to 59.
Training and induction
Upon joining the Board, any new Director is offered a comprehensive and tailored induction programme with visits to 
key sites and meetings with senior managers and other colleagues. For example, on appointment Liz Doherty was given 
access to recent Board and Committee papers, including strategy documentation. She met with each of the Executive 
Directors and the Company Secretary and visited a store with the Senior Independent Director. She toured the Group’s 
warehouse with the Board in July, and will take part in the store visit programme described below.
As part of each Director’s annual review any additional training or development needs are addressed. Please see the 
Directors’ biographies on pages 34 and 35 for details of the specific skills and experience of each Director.
Throughout the year all Directors have visited stores both informally and together with members of the senior 
management team. Feedback is given at the following Board meeting. Two Board meetings were also held near a store 
(Oxford and Kettering) and were followed by a store tour.
The Company Secretary reports monthly to the Board on new legal, regulatory and governance developments that 
affect the Group and actions are agreed where needed. The Board also received presentations from independent 
advisers on financial and governance issues. Directors attend seminars and tutorials provided by independent 
organisations which cover the whole range of governance topics.
Evaluation
Each of the Directors receives a formal evaluation of their performance during the year.
The Board and Committees are also formally evaluated as a whole.
Actions implemented during the period as a result of our 2012 evaluation included:
•	 Board agenda was refocused on significant strategic and decision items.
•	 We reviewed how the Board communicates with our stakeholders and considered it to be appropriate.
•	 Succession planning below Board level was considered.
This year Condign Board Consulting, an independent third party provider of Board evaluation services, was appointed 
to carry out our first external evaluation. Condign had no previous business relationship with the Group or any of the 
Directors and it is not intended that they be engaged to provide services of any other type to the Company in the 
future. The evaluation consisted of individual interviews with each Director and the Company Secretary, attendance at a 
Board meeting as an observer and review of Board packs. 
The evaluation confirmed that:
•	 The Board is operating effectively and is closely aligned to the culture of the business.
•	 Appropriate balance is being achieved between governance, strategic and operational matters.
•	 NED succession planning is still an important area of focus.
Agreed actions planned as a result of the evaluation include:
•	 The Board succession plan will remain a regular Board agenda item (alongside formal Nominations Committee meetings).
•	 More time to be spent defining the Board’s risk appetite.
•	 Contacts between NEDs and between NEDs and Executive Directors/Executive Board members, to be  
timetabled formally. 39 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

The Chief Executive and the Finance Director report back to the Board after the investor roadshows. The Group’s 
brokers also provide a written feedback report and attend a Board meeting annually to discuss investor views. 
The Corporate Governance presentation was hosted by Geoff Cooper, the Chairman and the other Non-Executive 
Directors in January 2013, with the Deputy Chairman Will Adderley representing the Adderley family shareholding. 14 
institutional investors and investor representatives attended. The presentation covered our approach to corporate 
governance, risk, audit, remuneration, nominations, corporate social responsibility, changes since last year and live 
issues. We find this a useful way to communicate and exchange views outside the busy pre AGM period, and it has been 
well received by attendees.
We also offered to meet with the main proxy advisers and Marion Sears, the Senior Independent Director and Dawn 
Durrant, the Company Secretary, met with two of them separately to explain our governance approach.
We upgraded our corporate website in September, to make it more user-friendly and also to add information and policies 
in relation to governance and corporate social responsibility. Please see http://dunelm-mill.production.investis.com
All Directors will be available at the Annual General Meeting to meet with shareholders and answer their questions. 
Rule 9 waiver
We will be requesting authority to buy back up to 5m shares (2.5% of our share capital) at the AGM. As our Deputy 
Chairman, Will Adderley, has a beneficial interest in 30.48% of our share capital, in order to exercise this right we have 
to ask shareholders to approve a waiver of Rule 9 of the Takeover Code, which would otherwise require him to make an 
offer to buy all of the shares in the Company. We understand that a number of shareholders have concerns about Rule 
9 waivers in general, as they can lead to major shareholders gaining ‘creeping control’; as a result they automatically 
vote ‘against’ the resolution.
We would like to reassure shareholders that:
•	 Shares bought back by the Company would be held in treasury and used only to satisfy share option entitlements, 
and not cancelled.
•	 From 2012, Will Adderley no longer participates in the Long Term Incentive Plan and therefore his shareholding will 
not increase through that mechanism.
•	 Since flotation of the Company in 2006, the Adderley family has reduced its holding (from 67% to just over 54% 
currently).
•	 There has been a Relationship Agreement in place since flotation which provides safeguards to other shareholders 
– for details please see the Directors’ Report on page 60.
We therefore request that shareholders take into account our specific circumstances when making their voting decision 
in relation to the waiver resolution.

Conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 allows the Board of a public company to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts of interest 
of individual Directors where the Articles of Association contain a provision to that effect. The Company’s Articles of 
Association give the Board this authority subject to the following safeguards:
•	 Directors who have an interest in matters under discussion at a Board meeting must declare that interest and abstain 
from voting.
•	 Only Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered are able to approve a conflict of interest and, in 
taking that decision the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the 
success of the Company. 
The Directors are able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they feel this is appropriate. 
All Directors are required to disclose any actual or potential conflicts to the Board and the following existing conflicts 
have been considered and approved:
•	 Will Adderley is a major shareholder and connected to other major shareholders. Authorised on the basis that Mr 
Adderley continues to abide by the terms of the Relationship Agreement entered into between himself, other major 
shareholders and the Company on flotation of the Company in 2006.
•	 Geoff Cooper is a Director of Travis Perkins plc which potentially competes with the Company for retail property. 
Authorised on the basis that Mr Cooper is not involved in day to day decisions in relation to the property portfolio in 
either Company.
There were no other matters disclosed that are considered by the Board to give rise to a conflict of interest.
Any conflicts are considered by the Board and any authorisations given are recorded in the Board minutes and 
reviewed annually by the Board.
The Board considers that its procedures to approve conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest are operating 
effectively.
Appointment and removal of Directors
The Articles of Association of the Company provide that a Director may be appointed by ordinary resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders in general meeting, or by the Board so long as the Director stands down and offers himself for 
election at the next Annual General Meeting of the Company. The Articles also provide that each Director must stand 
down and offer him or herself for re-election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting at least every three years. 
The Board has decided to adopt the requirement of the Corporate Governance Code, that all Directors should stand 
down and offer themselves for re-election at each Annual General Meeting.
Directors may be removed by a special resolution of shareholders, or by an ordinary resolution of which special notice 
has been given in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The Articles also provide that the office of a Director shall 
be vacated if he is prohibited by law from being a Director, or is bankrupt; and that the Board may resolve that his office 
be vacated if he is of unsound mind or is absent from Board meetings without consent for six months or more. A 
Director may also resign from the Board.
The Nominations Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment and removal of Directors.
In accordance with the Corporate Governance Code, all Directors will retire from the Board and offer themselves for 
re-election at the Annual General Meeting.
Powers of Directors
The business of the Company is managed by the Board, which may exercise all of the powers of the Company, subject 
to the requirements of the Companies Act, the Articles of Association of the Company and any special resolution of the 
Company. As stated above, the Board has adopted internal delegations of authority in accordance with the Code and 
these set out matters which are reserved to the Board or committees and the powers and duties of the Chairman, the 
Executive Deputy Chairman and the Chief Executive respectively.
At the Annual General Meetings of the Company from 2007 onwards, the Board sought and was given authority to 
issue shares and to buy back and reissue shares. Similar resolutions are being tabled at the 2013 Annual General 
Meeting, together with a waiver of any obligation of Will Adderley under the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers to 
make an offer for all of the shares of the Company if the authority to buy back shares is used. Any shares bought back 
would be held in treasury for reissue to employees who exercise options under one of the Group’s share incentive 
schemes. For further details see the Notice of Annual General Meeting which accompanies this report.
Advice and insurance
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. In addition Directors may seek legal 
advice at the Group’s cost if they consider it necessary in connection with their duties.
The Group purchases Directors’ and Officers’ Liability insurance cover for its Directors. 41 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Articles of Association

Governance and risk
•	 Risk is a ‘whole Board’ matter for Dunelm. We do not have a separate Risk Committee, although we have renamed 
our Audit Committee as the Audit and Risk Committee, to reflect the additional risk activities that it is undertaking.
We believe that risk is best managed by a combination of the following:
•	 Formal risk management processes as described in this report.
•	 The Board and senior management leading by example.
•	 Alignment through shareholding.
•	 Embedding our culture and ethics.
Throughout the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report there has been in place an established, 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. The process has 
been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board and is in accordance with the Turnbull Guidance on 
Internal Control for Directors.
The diagram below sets out how responsibility for risk management is allocated.
•	 Risk management is a collective Board responsibility. Risks are reviewed formally twice a year and separately 
management consider ‘what keeps us awake at night’. Important risk topics are covered in-depth either by regular 
timetabled presentations (e.g. health and safety), by ‘Deep Dive’ discussions (e.g. supply chain security), or regularly 
as a standard agenda item (e.g. competitor activity). In addition, KPIs covering risk topics are contained in the 
standard reports presented at each meeting.
•	 The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the risk management framework. Risks are reviewed by 
the Committee formally twice a year. Risk topics selected by the Audit and Risk Committee are considered ‘in-depth’ 
at Board meetings, supported by a paper prepared by the relevant executive. In the period topics covered included 
IT disaster planning, cyber security and Bribery Act compliance.
•	 In February, we revised the terms of reference of the Audit Committee and renamed it the Audit and Risk Committee, 
to reflect the increasing onus on Boards to understand and manage risk. We did consider whether a separate risk 
committee should be formed, but decided against this in the light of the size of the Board and our belief that the 
Board as a whole is responsible for managing risk.
•	 A register of major strategic and operational risks is maintained. Each risk is documented, together with the 
mitigating factors and controls in place to manage it. Risks are assessed in terms of impact and likelihood and the 
‘top 10’ risks are identified for specific focus. A member of the Executive Board is allocated responsibility for 
management of each risk.
•	 The Executive Board reviews the risk register periodically throughout the year. It is presented twice per annum to  
the Audit and Risk Committee and key risks and mitigating actions are taken on to the Board agenda for monitoring  
as appropriate. 42 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Corporate governance report continued
Internal control and internal audit
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The diagram 
below summarises the Group’s system.
The system of internal control comprises:
•	 A list of matters specifically reserved for Board approval, for example significant capital expenditure.
•	 A well-established control framework comprising clear structures and accountabilities for colleagues, well 
understood policies and procedures and budgeting and review processes. 
•	 Each Head of Department and store manager has clear responsibilities and operates within defined policies and 
procedures covering such areas as financial targets, human resources management, customer service, health and safety. 
•	 The Executive Directors and Executive Board monitor compliance with these policies and procedures in the course of 
regular reviews.
•	 In addition there is a rolling programme of review of store compliance by the operational audit team.
The Audit and Risk Committee has oversight of the system of internal controls and of the internal audit programme (see 
below) and receives the report of the external auditor following the annual statutory audit. 
In February 2013, the Audit and Risk Committee reconsidered whether an internal audit function is required. In previous 
years the Committee has not considered this to be necessary in view of the adequacy of internal and risk management 
controls and reporting in place, the relatively low level of complexity in the business and the close involvement of the 
Executive Directors in the operation of the business. This assessment was supported by KPMG.
However, as the business grows in size and complexity, the Committee has decided that some internal audit activities 
should be undertaken. These could be carried out either by external or internal teams, reporting to the Audit and Risk 
Committee. The programme will be in place from 2013/14 and will initially cover topics including business continuity, 
compliance with delegated authorities and employment taxes.
Please note that internal control systems such as this are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute, assurance against material loss or 
accounting misstatement.
Bribery Act 2010
Following the coming into force of the Bribery Act in July 2011, we have reviewed the procedures in place to ensure that 
we are able to comply with its requirements. Actions taken include:
•	 Anti-corruption and anti-bribery policy implemented.
•	 The policy on acceptance of gifts and other privileges has been updated and a formal procedure has been 
implemented for signing off and logging hospitality.
•	 Executive Board members and Heads of Department have received training and also signed a declaration of 
compliance, which is an annual process.
•	 Standard terms and conditions for suppliers include a Bribery Act clause.
•	 The Whistleblowing Policy refers specifically to the Bribery Act.
Actions taken in the past financial year include:
•	 Training extended to the whole of the Buying, Merchandising and Quality teams.
•	 Formalising agreement terms with certain ‘high risk’ partners.
•	 Induction for relevant individuals to include a briefing on policy requirements.

Matt Davies
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee
Dear Shareholder,
Much external discussion in relation to corporate governance in the past year has focused on management of risk and 
we have reflected this by renaming and widening the terms of reference of this Committee to encompass risk as well as 
audit. This change formalises activities already in place, with the Committee taking oversight of the processes for 
managing risk and its standing agenda items already including topics such as fraud and Bribery Act.
As in previous years, we have reviewed the need for an internal audit function. Recognising the increasing size and 
complexity of the business, we have decided that some element of assurance is now appropriate. We have identified a 
series of areas to be reviewed and on which reports will be provided to the Committee, with the reviews being carried 
out by a combination of internal and external expertise, depending on the subject matter. We consider that this 
approach will be both flexible and cost effective.
The Committee is aware of a growing trend towards rotation of external auditors. It is our intention to invite tenders for 
the 2013/14 audit.
Finally, shareholders will note that this year advisory fees paid by us to KPMG, our auditor, exceeded the audit fee. This 
was principally due to advice taken to help us structure and implement the B/C share scheme used to return capital to 
shareholders in November 2012. KPMG advised on the similar return of capital in 2010 and so were in the best position 
to help us. In addition, there was a specific project on capital allowances. The level of advisory fees paid to KPMG in the 
period was £154,917 versus the audit fee of £76,900. The committee considered that the independence of the audit was 
not affected, and I expect non-audit fees to return to a normal level from 2013/14.
I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM.
Yours sincerely,
Matt Davies
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee

Audit and Risk Committee report
2012/13 summary
Principal activities
- Committee renamed Audit and Risk Committee and terms of reference widened
- Internal audit programme established
- Decision to tender statutory audit in 2013/14
This report provides details of the role of the Audit and Risk Committee and the work it has undertaken during the year.
The purpose of the Committee is to oversee the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and public announcements 
relating to financial performance, to oversee the audit process, monitor the effectiveness of financial controls and the 
process for identifying and managing risk throughout the Group. In February 2013, the Committee was renamed the 
Audit and Risk Committee, and its terms of reference updated to include a formal review of the Board’s risk appetite. 
These changes reflect the increasing role that the Committee is undertaking in the oversight of risk in the business.
The full terms of reference for the Committee can be found via the Group’s website, www.dunelm.com.
The Committee has approved a policy which allows employees to raise legitimate concerns in confidence without fear 
of discrimination.
The following Directors served on the Committee during the year:
Member Period from: To:
Matt Davies (Chair) 8 February 2012 To date
Marion Sears 18 January 2005 To date
Simon Emeny 25 June 2007 To date
Liz Doherty 1 May 2013 To date
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Finance Director, the Chief Executive and the Chairman of the Board usually attend meetings by invitation, along 
with a representative from the external auditors. 
The Board considers that I have recent and relevant financial experience by virtue of my professional qualification and 
my executive role as Chief Executive of Halfords Group plc. 
Committee activities in 2012/13
Two meetings were held in the year and members’ attendance was as shown in the table below.

1 There was no Committee meeting between the appointment of Liz Doherty on 1 May 2013 and the period end.
During the year the activities of the Committee included:
Routine items
•	 Approval of the full year results issued in September 2012 and the half year results issued in February 2013.
•	 Review of the process for identifying and managing risk within the business in September 2012, including a review of 
the risk register, and a mid year update of these in February 2013.
•	 Verification of the independence of the auditor and approval of the scope of the audit plan and the audit fee.
•	 Review and confirmation of the Group’s policy for use of the auditors for non-audit work (please see below).
•	 Review of fraud and Bribery Act controls are standing agenda items for each meeting.
Specific topics
•	 Following our annual review of the requirement for an internal audit function, a programme of internal audit work has 
been agreed (please see below).
•	 The schedule of risk topics to be considered in-depth at Board meetings was updated, in the period they included 
cyber security, IT disaster planning and Bribery Act compliance.
•	 It was agreed that the Board should specifically consider the risk appetite of the Group – this happened as part of 
the Board’s annual strategy review in May and will be monitored by the Committee.
•	 We considered the draft proposals by the United Kingdom Financial Reporting Council and by the European Union 
that would require companies to tender their external auditor and decided to tender the audit in 2013/14.
External auditor
The Group reappointed KPMG Audit plc as external auditor for the financial year ended 29 June 2013. The Group paid 
KPMG £76,900 in relation to the statutory audit of the Group and Company financial statements and the audit of Group 
subsidiaries pursuant to legislation.  45 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information
The Committee had the opportunity to meet privately with the auditors during the period. 
Use of auditors for non-audit work
The Committee is aware that the use of audit firms for non-audit work is a sensitive issue for our shareholders and 
corporate governance analysts, as it could potentially give rise to a conflict of interest.
Our policy is simple – we will only use auditors for non-audit work if:
•	 they offer demonstrably better capability than alternative providers; and 
•	 there is no potential conflict with the independence of the audit.
We have a relatively flat management structure and all work commissioned by our auditor is required to be sanctioned 
by the Finance Director, who consults with the Committee Chairman if the fee involved is significant or if there are any 
issues regarding independence. Therefore we do not consider that any more complex guidelines are needed.
During the year, our audit fee was £76,900 and fees for work carried out by KPMG on other projects were £154,917 
broken down as follows:
Project Fee Comment
Tax advice on 
return of capital via 
B/C share scheme
£65,000 KPMG advised on the previous return of cash in 2010 and therefore had the most relevant 
expertise of this specific structure
Capital Allowances 
Project
£51,567 KPMG have previous relevant experience of the business thereby providing demonstratively 
better value in a tender process
Tax Compliance £29,600 KPMG have previous relevant experience of the business and so were the most appropriate 
partner
Miscellaneous  
Tax Advice
£5,000 KPMG have knowledge gained though previous tax projects and so were the most appropriate 
partner
Other £3,750 KPMG have previous relevant experience of the business and so were the most appropriate 
partner
Fees for non-audit services therefore exceeded the audit fee, however this is mainly due to the use of KPMG to advise 
on our return of capital and the capital allowances project. Non-audit fees are expected to return to a normal level In 
2013/14.
Tender of external audit
The Committee discussed the regulatory proposals that would require a compulsory tender of the statutory audit. 
Whilst compulsory tendering is not yet required, the Committee nevertheless decided to initiate a tender process  
in respect of the 2013/14 statutory audit. At least one firm outside the ‘Big Four’ will be invited to participate in the 
tender process.
Internal audit
Prior to 2013, the Committee considered that an internal audit function was not required in view of the adequacy of 
financial controls in place and the relatively low level of complexity in the business. 
Given the continuing growth of the business in terms of both scale and complexity, in February 2013 the Committee 
agreed that a programme of internal audit work should be devised and implemented. 
The work will be conducted either by an internal team that is independent of the activity under review, or by an external 
party, decided on a case by case basis. In either case, the review will be conducted on behalf of the Committee and will 
report back to them.
The initial areas to be covered are:
Review topic Reviewed by
Processes for setting authority limits and ensuring adherence Internal team working alongside of the external auditors
Adequacy of disaster planning and business continuity plans 
and procedures
Specialist external business continuity consultants
Ability to comply with mandatory carbon reporting requirements External auditors
Compliance with PAYE, NI and other relevant employment taxes External accountancy firm
This report was reviewed and approved by the Committee on 12 September 2013.

Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee
12 September 2013 46 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Dear Shareholder,
In the year to 29 June 2013 there were no changes to executive remuneration policy other than the introduction of 
claw-back to unvested share options under performance-related pay. The majority of remuneration earned by the 
executives during the year was performance-based and resulted from strong operating performance, reflected in our 
share price, which increased by 89% to 947p during the year.
Dunelm again performed well in a difficult retail market. We exceeded budget EPS by 3.9% and the compound annual 
growth rate in EPS over the last three years has exceeded RPI by 10.4%. Accordingly, the Directors will receive a bonus 
award of 97% of salary, and 86.7% of the LTIP award made in 2010 will vest. Nick Wharton has been CEO since 2010 and 
this is the first LTIP to vest to him, making a significant increase in his total remuneration compared with previous years. 
He will retain these vesting LTIP shares (after sale of shares to cover his tax and national insurance liability) as he builds 
towards his target shareholding of two times salary after five years. 
We are again being fully transparent and following best practice by publishing the single number for remuneration for 
each of the Executive Directors.
We are increasingly conscious that Dunelm’s growth rate, which is faster than the market growth rate, means that our 
comparator peer group is changing significantly. We will keep this under review and will consult shareholders over the 
implications of this if appropriate. 
Looking forward, in 2013/14 the Executive Directors will receive a 2% increase in base salary, in line with the Group 
average, although Will Adderley has again declined this increase and will be paid the same base salary as last year and 
the year before. The Non-Executive Directors’ fees have been increased with effect from 1 July 2013, for the first time 
since 2010, following a bench marking exercise. We continue to position ourselves at ‘median-or-below’ levels; the 
Chairman’s fee is now £120,000 per year and the standard Non-Executive fee is £40,000 per year with an additional 
£5,000 fee for committee chairmanship. Going forward, Non-Executive Director fees will increase annually in line with 
the Company average.
The Remuneration Committee has also introduced two refinements to executive performance related pay with effect 
from 1 July 2013 to ensure we remain in line with best practice. For annual bonus, the performance condition continues 
to be calculated according to the same formula as before, but progress on strategic development of the business will be 
used to inform the discretionary element relating to personal objectives. For the LTIP we have introduced a two year 
deferral period which will be added onto the (unchanged) three year performance testing period. The purpose of both 
of these changes is to focus management attention firmly on long-term strategy implementation and to align 
management with long-term shareholders’ interests.
I look forward to meeting shareholders at the AGM in November.
Yours sincerely,
Marion Sears
Chair of the Remuneration Committee

Advisers
During the year, the Committee took advice from Deloitte (Birmingham office) in respect of the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors. Deloitte (London office) also provided tax advice to the Company in relation to capital allowances. 
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration policy and alignment with strategy
The Remuneration Committee’s policy is to provide an executive remuneration structure that will pay fairly for the  
roles and responsibilities of each Director and incentivise strongly for value creation, with an emphasis on the long  
term. This is in keeping with the family origin of the business and is important to the Adderley family who remain our 
majority shareholders.
Since the flotation of the Company our executive remuneration has been structured specifically:
•	 To reward performance.
•	 To be focused on long term value creation.
•	 To align executives with shareholders through share ownership.
Our policy is consistent with delivery of the objectives set out in our corporate strategy, which are all long term in 
nature; namely the growth and development of our specialist product offer, our stores portfolio, our multi-channel 
capability and our infrastructure. 
It is our intention to maintain a simple and transparent remuneration structure that does not frequently change. 
Structure of executive remuneration
(i) Base salary
Base salaries are set at, or below, the median for comparable companies and increases are expected to be in line with 
Group-wide awards unless merited by specific circumstances. In setting base salaries a retail peer group is considered 
within the FTSE 250 as well as industry wide surveys which cover the FTSE 250 and small-cap sector. In addition the 
operational scale and complexity of the role each Director performs is discussed and adjustments are applied to reflect 
these. It is our policy that base salary should comprise a minority of the total remuneration that an Executive Director 
can earn.
(ii) Pension
The Remuneration Committee has decided not to use final salary pension plans as a way of remunerating its Executive 
Directors. Instead the Group contributes 10% of base salary to the Executive Directors’ personal pension plans. The 
Remuneration Committee believes this is an efficient way to assist Executives to prepare for retirement. When 
determining overall remuneration levels for an Executive, the Remuneration Committee takes account of contributions 
to pension plans. 49 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

(iii) Performance related pay
The Remuneration Committee’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors’ remuneration  
should be variable and performance-related in order to encourage and reward superior business performance and 
shareholder return.
Constituents
Performance related pay consists of:
•	 An annual cash bonus of up to 100% of salary.
•	 An annual award of share options to the value of 150% of salary under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), 
exercisable after three years, subject to performance criteria being met (and from 2013 following a two year deferral). 
This is set at the median for the annual cash bonus but in the upper quartile for the LTIP in order to incentivise 
consistent above market average growth.
Nick Wharton, our Chief Executive, has an additional one-off five year LTIP award, approved by shareholders in 2010, 
which runs until 2015, and which aligns his interests to share price performance over and above the regular three year 
LTIP.
Balance of fixed and variable remuneration
Potential performance pay currently comprises just over two thirds of maximum potential earnings at up to 250% of base 
salary; the annual cash bonus entitlement is up to 100% of base salary and the three year LTIP is up to 150% of salary. 
On an annual basis, around 70% of the maximum earnings opportunity is performance-related and over 40% is 
measured on a three year cumulative performance. The following illustrates the balance between fixed and variable 
remuneration during the year for the Executive Directors:
Table 3 – Balance of fixed and variable remuneration
The breakdown does not include any share price growth or other benefits (e.g. cash car allowance, value of private 
medical insurance, pension contribution or all employee share ownership plans). 
Performance measures – financial 
The Remuneration Committee selects performance measures that it believes are:
•	 Aligned with the Group’s strategic goals.
•	 Unambiguous and easy to calculate.
•	 Transparent to Directors and shareholders. 
The financial performance measure applicable to both the annual cash bonus and the LTIP is based on growth in 
earnings per share (‘EPS’) over the performance period. 
The Remuneration Committee considered the use of EPS as a performance measure carefully when the Company was 
floated in 2007 and has discussed it with shareholders on a number of occasions. EPS is believed to be closely aligned 
to the drivers of growth for the business and in the long-term, EPS performance is expected to be reflected in 
shareholder value. As discussed with institutional shareholders at the recent Corporate Governance presentation, EPS is 
a more suitable performance measure for Dunelm than for many other companies and it is therefore considered 
appropriate to use it as a single measure, supplemented by discretion reflecting non-financial performance measures as 
described below. The use of EPS for Dunelm specifically is considered appropriate because of the absence of leverage 
in the business and because the capital expenditure controls exercised by the Board are sufficiently rigorous to avoid 
EPS accretion by means of ineffective investment of capital. Should this change the Committee would review whether 
an additional financial underpin would be appropriate. In the event of a major capital transaction the Committee 
reserves the right to adjust the target or change the performance conditions. 50 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Remuneration report continued
Performance measures – non-financial
Payment of the annual cash bonus may be adjusted based on personal, non-financial job objectives linked to delivery  
of the strategy, set at the commencement of the year and assessed by the Remuneration Committee. With effect from  
1 July 2013, in addition to personal job objectives, the Committee will refer to certain strategic KPIs and share price 
performance to inform its discretion over the bonus awarded, although there will not be a formulaic link. 
Each Director’s remuneration is therefore linked to both personal performance and Group strategy and performance.
Future LTIP participation by Will Adderley
With effect from 1 January 2012, and in response to shareholder concerns about Will Adderley obtaining ‘creeping 
control’ of the company through vesting of share incentive awards, Will Adderley has indicated that he no longer wishes 
to receive further awards under the LTIP. He will be entitled to receive shares under existing awards, subject to 
performance criteria being met.
Claw back
From 2012 the Committee decided to introduce a claw back provision under which cash bonus entitlements and 
unvested LTIP awards made from 2012 onwards will not be paid in certain circumstances. Claw back will take place at 
the Remuneration Committee’s discretion if:
•	 performance to which a bonus or LTIP award relates proves to have been misstated; or
•	 there has been a miscalculation in the extent to which performance conditions have been met in respect of previous 
awards made to the individual that have vested and been exercised; or
•	 there has been gross misconduct on the part of an individual.
Change of control
If there is a change of control of the Company, any awards under the LTIP that have not yet vested will be exercisable at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee taking into account the period of time that has elapsed since grant of 
the award, and the extent that any performance target has been met.
Share options and dilution
It is Group policy to comply with the provisions of the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Executive 
Remuneration when determining the number of shares over which share scheme incentive awards may be made. At the 
date of this report options have been granted over 2.3% of the Company’s issued share capital. The Group does not 
hold any shares in an employee benefit trust.
(iv) Shareholding requirements
To strengthen the alignment between management and long-term business success, executive Directors and other 
senior managers in receipt of discretionary share awards are required to build a shareholding as follows:
Table 4 – shareholding requirements
  Required holding Period of time to build holding
Executive Directors 2 x base salary 1 x salary after 3 years
2 x salary after 5 years
Executives receiving LTIP Options 1 x base salary 5 years
Executives receiving market priced options 0.5 x base salary Over time
These required Director shareholdings are set at above market levels.
In addition, from 2013 awards made to Executive Directors under the LTIP will be subject to an additional two year 
deferral after the end of the performance period. Dividend entitlement will accrue during this period, and the Executive 
will be entitled to exercise his option over the shares at the end of the two year period, whether or not they are still 
employed. This is intended to focus management attention firmly on long-term strategy implementation and to align 
management with long-term shareholders’ interests. 
Directors’ shareholdings are disclosed in the Directors’ Report on page 61. 51 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is determined by the Board as a whole. The Non-Executive Directors do not 
receive bonuses or participate in any incentive plans. They are paid annual fees based on the market rate, which reflect 
any additional responsibilities taken when chairing a committee of the Board.
Senior Executive remuneration
The Remuneration Committee provides oversight and guidance on the remuneration structure for below Board senior 
executives. The package for new appointments is formally presented to the committee for approval. In conducting its 
assessment of senior executive remuneration the committee pays particular regard to whether any individual is 
incentivised to take risks inappropriate to their role and responsibilities. For example, in the finance function, managers 
are not remunerated against individual financial performance, but against corporate performance and personal 
qualitative objectives.
Sharesave scheme
An annual invitation is made to all employees under our savings related share option scheme, or ‘Sharesave’. Options 
are granted at the maximum 20% discount to the market price at the date of invitation, exercisable after three years. 
Last year we were pleased that 9% of colleagues applied to join, compared with 7% in previous years. We will continue 
to offer Sharesave as a way of encouraging colleague engagement through share ownership.
Implementation of remuneration policy during the period
Executive Directors
(i) Base salary and benefits
Prior to the beginning of each financial year the Remuneration Committee sets the base salaries of Executive Directors. 
The Committee examines the salaries of Directors in a comparator retail peer group of public companies and also 
considers all industry surveys for the FTSE 250 and small cap sectors. In addition the operational scale and complexity 
of the role each Director performs is discussed and adjustments are applied to reflect these. In setting base salaries any 
increase for Executive Directors is expected to be in line with Group-wide salary increases unless specific circumstances 
merit a different approach. Base salary comprises just under one third of the total potential remuneration that an 
Executive Director can earn.
In addition to base salary, the Executive Directors are entitled to benefits comprising a car allowance, a contribution of 
10% of base salary to a personal pension, private medical insurance and life insurance.
In June 2012, the base salary review resulted in a 2% increase for all Executive Directors from 1 July 2012, in line with the 
Group wide award, which was waived by Will Adderley.
Following the review in May 2013, Executive Directors have been awarded a 2% increase in basic salary from July 2013, 
again in line with the Group-wide award. Will Adderley has waived this increase. 52 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Will Adderley £265,000 0% £265,000 0%
David Stead £264,000 2% £269,300 2%
(ii) Annual cash bonus
Executive Directors are awarded a performance-related cash bonus, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Performance criteria are based on growth in earnings per share against budget, and personal non-financial objectives 
relevant to each Director, linked to delivery of strategy. Any bonus amounts determined to be payable are paid after the 
year-end results are finalised. 
For Nick Wharton and David Stead 100% of the annual bonus is calculated according to performance against budget 
but may be adjusted at the discretion of the committee, depending on an individual’s performance against personal 
objectives. For Will Adderley, 50% of the annual bonus is calculated according to the performance against budget and 
50% is awarded for performance on strategic projects which are an important focus of his time.
The prospects for the market and the Group are considered when setting the budget EPS target for the year. In 
addition we have regard to both market consensus expectations for EPS and individual broker forecasts. The bonus 
parameters are described below:
Table 7 – Bonus parameters for financial target
 
EPS 
performance  
(percentage of 
target)
Percentage of 
maximum  
bonus payable
Threshold 95% 5%
Target 100% 40%
Maximum 105% 100%
For the year ended 29 June 2013, budget EPS was 38.5p. Accordingly the target set was that no bonus would be paid 
until EPS reached 36.5p and at 40.4p maximum bonus would be paid. Market consensus for 2012/13 EPS at the date the 
target was set was 37.6p.
Reported EPS of 40.0p was 3.9 % above target. After due consideration of job performance progress against strategic 
objectives and achievement of non-financial performance targets, the committee awarded a discretionary element of 
bonus as shown below. This was equivalent to 10% of salary bringing the total award to 97%. Will Adderley was awarded 
a bonus of £257,050 and choose to waive 50% of this award and requested the other 50% to be donated to the Group’s 
charity of the year.

Nick Wharton £395,760 97%
Will Adderley n/a n/a
David Stead £256,080 97%
(iii) Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
Under the LTIP, Executive Directors are awarded nominal cost share options annually. These awards vest three years 
after date of grant, to the extent that the applicable performance target is met. 
The Remuneration Committee has chosen growth in fully diluted EPS over each three-year performance period as the 
performance target for the awards under the LTIP. The Committee believes that this measure is closely aligned to the 
drivers of growth of the business and that in the long term, EPS performance will be reflected in shareholder value. The 
committee is satisfied that capital expenditure controls exercised by the Board are sufficiently rigorous to avoid EPS 
accretion by means of ineffective investment of capital and in any event reserves the right to adjust the target in the 
event of a major capital transaction. 
The LTIP is structured as follows (awards vest on a straight-line basis between the threshold and maximum points):

Maximum RPI + 12% RPI + 15% 100% 53 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information
The maximum point was increased for awards made from 2011 onwards, in line with the increase in maximum annual 
award from 120% to 150% of base salary. This was part of an overall review of Executive Directors’ remuneration. It was 
explained fully in the 2011 annual report and approved by shareholders at the AGM in November 2011.
The Committee meets after the results for each three-year performance period are available to determine the extent to 
which performance conditions have been satisfied. There is no retesting.
Awards cannot be granted to Executive Directors under the LTIP over Ordinary Shares in excess of 5% of the issued 
Ordinary Share capital in any rolling 10 year period. 
Details of outstanding awards made to Executive Directors under the LTIP and awards made and exercised during the 
financial year are set out in tables 15 to 17 of this report.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the Company’s EPS record over the three-year performance period which 
ended on 29 June 2013. Reported fully diluted EPS grew at a compound annual rate of 14.1%. This is 10.4% above the 
compound annual growth in RPI over the same period. Accordingly, 86.7% of the December 2010 LTIP award will vest in 
December 2013 as follows:
Table 10 – LTIP awards vesting in respect of 2010/13
  Shares vesting
Percentage of 
maximum award
Nick Wharton 48,262 86.7%
Will Adderley 62,956 86.7%
David Stead 52,744 86.7%
The 2010 LTIP awards which vested in favour of Nick Wharton, Will Adderley and David Stead as described above are 
included in the single number for total remuneration for 2012/13 set out in table 14. Their value has been calculated 
using the average share price over the three months preceding the end of the performance period on 29 June 2013, 
which is 866.45p.
Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is determined by the Board as a whole. The Non-Executive Directors do not 
receive bonuses or participate in any incentive plans. They are paid annual fees which reflect additional responsibilities 
taken when chairing a committee of the Board. 
Fees were reviewed in April 2013 for the first time in three years, and it was found that they are now significantly out of 
line with the norm for a company of our size. Fees will therefore be increased from 1 July 2013 as set out below:
Table 11 – Non-Executive Director Fees
 
Fee between July 2010 and  
June 2013 (per annum) Fee from July 2013 Comment
Geoff Cooper – Chairman £100k £120k

Audit and Risk Committee 
Chair fee of £5k
Simon Emeny £30k £40k
Liz Doherty £40k from appointment on 
1 May 2013
£40k
Going forward, rather than reviewing fees every three years, fees for the Non-Executive Directors will increase annually 
in line with the Company average.
Service contracts
In accordance with the Group’s policy, the service contracts of the Executive Directors have no fixed-term, the notice 
period for termination is 12 months from either party and payments on termination are restricted to a maximum of the 
value of salary for the notice period. The Remuneration Committee will apply mitigation rigorously in respect of any 
post remuneration payment.
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years with a provision for 
termination of one month’s notice from either party, or three months’ notice from either party in the case of Geoff 
Cooper, the Chairman. 54 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Relative TSR performance
The graph below shows the Group’s performance over five years, measured by total shareholder return, compared with 
the FTSE General Retail Index and the FTSE 250. The Remuneration Committee has chosen these indices for 
comparison because they provide a range of comparator companies which have similar market capitalisation, which are 
in the same sector and which face similar market and economic challenges in the long term.

Will Adderley was awarded a bonus of £257,050 and chose to waive the element of this award that relates to 
achievement of personal objectives (50%) and requested the other 50% to be donated to the Group’s charity of the 
year. 
David Stead waived taxable benefits totalling approximately £1,000.
The realisable gain on LTIP awards vesting in the relevant financial period is calculated using the LTIP award whose 
performance period ends on the last day of the financial period being reported on (so for 2012/13, the LTIP award used 
is the 2010 award, with a performance period of July 2010 to June 2013 inclusive). The realisable value of the award is 
then calculated by multiplying the number of shares which will vest after applying the performance criteria, by the 
average share price for the three months ended on the last day of the performance period. 
Nick Wharton’s 2012/13 remuneration includes the realisable gain in respect of the first LTIP award made to him that has 
matured since his appointment on 1 December 2010. This accounts for the large increase in his total remuneration for 
2012/13 compared with the previous year.

The Directors do not have entitlements under any other share-based incentive plan.
Total remuneration figure
In line with developing requirements to set out total remuneration in a transparent way as a ‘single number’ we have 
included a Total Remuneration figure for each Executive Director in Table 14. This total includes all rewards that the 
Director received or will receive pertaining to the year being reported. 
In the case of Dunelm our simple remuneration structure means that the total remuneration includes: base salary, value 
of benefits, pension contribution, cash bonus relating to the year, the actual value of SAYE options vesting and 
exercised in the year and the value of the (gross) LTIP shares vesting in respect of the performance period ended in the 
year, calculated using the average share price over the three months ended on the last day of the performance period 
(which we refer to in the tables as ‘realisable value’).
Total remuneration earned by the Executive Directors in 2012/13 was £3.11m and by the Non-Executive Directors was 
£0.21m . The total remuneration of all Directors was £3.32m.

Dear Shareholder,
We have continued to focus on Board composition and refreshment during the year with the aim of creating the right 
diversity of skills and mix of tenure amongst the Non-Executive Directors. This means that, for a while, we will have a 
larger Board due to overlap of tenure as we seek to maintain continuity whilst managing succession.
We were pleased to appoint Liz Doherty as a new Non-Executive Director in May. Liz brings a broad range of 
operational and financial experience to the Board and she is also an experienced Non-Executive Director. 
We are fully compliant in terms of Board balance between Executives and Independent Directors, and also in terms of 
Committee membership. However, we think continually about the future needs of the business and about how the 
Board can help to preserve our culture throughout the organisation, whilst at the same time ensuring the calibre of 
Board necessary to support our ambitions for growth. 
The executives have made some important senior management appointments during the year to support these ambitions 
and all senior positions have well developed succession plans in place. Store management teams have been reorganised in a 
clear and transparent way to ensure all colleagues have the opportunity to see a path for internal promotion. 
Looking forward, we will continue to work on Board composition and refreshment with the aim of achieving smooth 
succession of Directors over the next few years.
Yours sincerely,
Marion Sears
Chair of the Nominations Committee

Nominations Committee report
2012/13 summary
Principal activities
- Appointment of Liz Doherty as Non-Executive Director
- Detailed review of Board skills and experience repeated
- Update of Board succession plan
- Evaluation conducted as part of our first external Board Evaluation
This report provides details of the role of the Nominations Committee and the work it has undertaken during the year.
The purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board by keeping the composition of the Board under review and 
conducting a rigorous and transparent process when new appointments to the Board are made. The full terms of 
reference for the Committee can be found on the Company’s website.
The following Directors served on the Committee during the year:
Member Period from: To:
Marion Sears (Chair) 18 January 2005 To date

Will Adderley 17 February 2011 To date
Matt Davies 8 February 2012 To date
Liz Doherty 1 May 2013 To date
The NED search process, and succession planning as part of this, was discussed by the whole Board at every Board 
meeting with an update paper provided by myself. However there were two formal Committee meetings held in the 
year and members’ attendance was as shown in the table below. I also act as Secretary to the Committee.

General succession planning
The Committee keeps under review the balance of skills on the Board as a whole and the knowledge, experience, length 
of service and performance of the Directors. On at least an annual basis each Director’s intentions are discussed with 
regard to serving on the Board and their succession is considered in the context of the shape of the overall Board and 
the corporate governance guidance on Non-Executive Director tenure. This transparency amongst a small and 
collegiate Board allows for an open discussion about succession for each individual, both for short-term emergency 
purposes as well as longer-term plans.
While all Board appointment processes and succession discussions are led by the Nominations Committee these are viewed 
as important whole-Board topics and no appointment will be made to the Board without agreement of all Directors.
Committee activities in 2012/13
NED search
With three of our Non-Executives completing six years on the Board since IPO in 2012/3, as stated last year the 
Committee has been mindful of the need to keep the Board composition fresh. Much of the Committee’s activities 
during the year were therefore focused on our search for a new Non-Executive Director.
Following our detailed review of the skills and balance on the Board, and our likely needs in the context of our strategy 
going forward, we drew up a role and person specification for which the main requirements were;
•	 Relevant experience in retail or similar business, including multi-channel.
•	 Familiarity with the current challenges of operating management, including multi-channel and international.
•	 Understanding of branding and marketing.
•	 Cultural fit.
We also had regard to the requirement to achieve a diversity of characters, backgrounds and experiences amongst 
Board members. In particular, we prioritised the appointment of a female candidate. 59 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information
We decided not to appoint a single search firm to assist us as we were not under time pressure to make an appointment 
quickly and we believe there is value in searching widely through a variety of intermediaries without a preset timetable. 
Instead we applied the requirements of best practice for ‘open advertising’ by talking to a large number of contacts 
who know Dunelm and who understand our culture and ambitions. These included several search agents, our advisers 
and some of our shareholders and we also asked our own networks for candidate suggestions. As a result we held 
informal meetings with a very large number of people over the course of more than a year and we also screened 
existing Directors of FTSE 100 companies ourselves as a desk exercise to ensure that our search was sufficiently 
comprehensive and representative. 
In April 2013 we were pleased to announce the appointment of Liz Doherty as an additional Non-Executive Director. Liz 
was introduced to us by the search firm CT Partners Augmentum with whom Dunelm has no other relationship. 
Liz has held a number of senior finance roles within significant international businesses.  Most recently, she was Finance 
Director of Reckitt Benckiser plc.  Prior to this, she was Finance Director of Brambles Limited (Australia) and Group 
International Finance Director of Tesco plc. She started her career at Unilever plc, where she held a number of finance 
roles in the UK and Europe. Liz is also a Non-Executive Director of Nokia Corporation and Delhaize Group and is a fellow 
of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.
Board succession
As stated last year, we have a formal plan for how Board membership should develop over the coming years and we are 
taking actions to implement this. 
Skills balance and Directors’ performance evaluation
The Nominations Committee reviews Board composition and the balance of skills provided by the Directors in a whole 
Board session each year, in the light of the most recent strategy discussions. In 2012/3 we repeated the detailed review 
conducted during 2011/12, and this has also been addressed in our external Board evaluation which is described in the 
Corporate Governance Report. The outcome of this has been incorporated into our Board succession plan which will be 
discussed again by the Board in autumn 2013.
In addition to the external Board evaluation, the performance of all of the Directors has been assessed individually. The 
Chairman of the Board led a process of collecting feedback on each Director’s performance and provided them with a 
one-to-one evaluation and discussion of training needs. As Senior Independent Director I collected feedback about the 
Chairman and provided him with an evaluation of his performance. 
Diversity
In 2011 we set out the Board’s policy on diversity which we believe remains appropriate for Dunelm. It can be 
summarised as follows:
•	 Whilst confirming that our overriding concern is to ensure the Board comprises outstanding individuals who can lead 
the Group, we also believe the Group’s best interests are served by ensuring that these individuals represent a range 
of skills, experiences, backgrounds and perspectives, including gender.
•	 Accordingly, it is our policy that the Board should always be of mixed gender. 
•	 Quotas are not appropriate as a target for female representation on company Boards, since they are likely to lead to 
compromised decisions on Board membership, quality and size. 
•	 We will seek to ensure that specific effort is made to bring forward female candidates for Board appointments.
•	 We will monitor the Group’s approach to people development to ensure that it continues to enable talented 
individuals, both male and female, to enjoy career progression activities within Dunelm.
Tenure and Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors will seek re-election at the 2013 AGM.
Given that Geoff Cooper and I have been Board members since 2004, we have served nine years on the Board, seven  
of these following the Company’s flotation in 2006. In accordance with best practice, in 2013, our contracts will be 
renewed for a one year term, subject to earlier termination by notice and reappointment at the AGM. Simon Emeny has 
entered a third term as Non-Executive Director which takes his tenure to 2016, and Matt Davies and Liz Doherty both 
remain within their first term. Our main priority during this succession phase is to balance the changes with a period of 
time in between each appointment and departure.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on 12 September 2013.

Directors’ report and business review
The Directors present their report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 29 June 2013. 
Together with certain information in the reports from the Chief Executive and the Finance Director on pages 12 to 19, 
the Risks and Uncertainties on pages 20 to 23 and the Corporate Social Responsibility review on pages 24 to 32, which 
are incorporated into this report by reference, this report satisfies the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 to 
produce a Business Review.
The purpose of this Business Review is to provide to shareholders a review of the Group’s business over the period, and 
to describe the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group.
Principal activity
The principal activity of the Group is that of a specialist UK homewares retailer selling to customers through stores, over 
the internet and via a catalogue.
Review of business and future developments
A review of the business and future developments of the Group is given in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 12 to 15.
Shareholder and voting rights
All members who hold Ordinary Shares are entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting. On a show of 
hands at a general meeting every member present in person shall have one vote and on a poll, every member present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote for every Ordinary Share held.
On 2 October 2006, Jean Adderley, Bill Adderley and Will Adderley (all shareholders) entered into a Relationship 
Agreement with the Company, pursuant to which each of Jean Adderley, Bill Adderley and Will Adderley undertook  
to the Company that, for so long as, individually or together, they are entitled to exercise, or to control the exercise of, 
30% or more of the rights to vote at general meetings of the Company or they are able to control the appointment of 
directors who are able to exercise a majority of votes at Board meetings of the Company, they will:
a) conduct all transactions and relationships with any member of the Group on arms length terms and on a normal 
commercial basis;
b) not take any action which precludes or inhibits any member of the Group from carrying on its business 
independently of Jean and Bill Adderley and their associates (as defined in the Listing Rules);
c) not exercise any of their voting rights or other powers to procure any amendment to the Articles of Association of 
the Company which would be inconsistent with or undermine any of the provisions of the Relationship Agreement;
d) abstain from voting on any resolution to which LR11.7.R(4) of the Listing Rules applies involving Jean Adderley, Bill 
Adderley or Will Adderley or any of their associates as the related party;
e) not carry on (other than through their holding of securities of the Company) or have any financial interest (other than 
a financial interest in securities which are held for investment purposes only) in any person who carries on a business 
as a homewares retailer, to the extent that it would be inconsistent with or undermine any provisions of the 
Relationship Agreement; and
f) only enter into, amend or terminate any transaction, agreement or relationship between themselves or any of their 
associates and any member of the Group with the approval of a majority of the independent Non-Executive 
Directors.
WA Capital Limited and Nadine Adderley, to whom Will Adderley has transferred shares by way of a gift, have 
subsequently become party to this agreement.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of Ordinary Shares in the Company other than certain restrictions imposed by 
laws and regulations (such as insider trading and marketing requirements relating to close periods) and requirements of 
the Listing Rules whereby Directors and certain employees of the Company require Board approval to deal in the 
Company’s securities.
Change of control
The Company is not party to any significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate solely on a change of 
control of the Company following a takeover bid.
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for additional compensation 
for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a 
takeover bid.
Results and dividends
The consolidated profit for the year after taxation was £81.5m (2012: £71.2m). The results are discussed in greater detail 
in the Finance Director’s review on pages 16 to 19.
A final dividend of 11.5p per share (2012: 10.0p) is proposed in respect of the year ended 29 June 2013 to add to an 
interim dividend of 4.5p per share paid on 12 April 2013 (2012: 4.0p). The final dividend will be paid on

1 WA Capital Limited is a company established by Will Adderley to act as a long-term holding company for his Dunelm shareholding. It is a United 
Kingdom limited company of which he is the sole director and shareholder, and is UK resident for tax purposes. Shares held by WA Capital Limited and 
by Nadine Adderley are included in the total beneficial interest of Will Adderley in the table above. 
Will Adderley is deemed to retain a legal interest in shares held by two trusts, the Leicester Foundation and the 
Paddocks Discretionary Trust, by virtue of the fact that he and his wife are trustees, although not beneficiaries, of those 
trusts. At the period end the shareholdings of these trusts were: Leicester Foundation: 1,167,250 Ordinary Shares (2012: 
1, 167,250), Paddocks Trust: 172,750 Ordinary Shares (2012: 172,750). These interests are not included in the table above. 
In total therefore, Will Adderley’s legal and beneficial interest in Ordinary Shares totals 63,167,347 representing 31.1% of 
the issued Ordinary Share Capital.
David Stead exercised nil cost options over 85,215 shares under the Long-Term Incentive Plan on 18 October 2012. On 
the same day he sold 43,460 Ordinary Shares at a price of 679.4p per share to cover his income tax and national 
insurance liability, the balance of 41,755 shares were transferred to his wife Jane Stead. Shares held by David’s wife are 
included in his beneficial interest in the table above.
On 17 October 2012 Simon Emeny transferred 26,400 Ordinary Shares of 1p each to his wife, Selina Emeny, for nil 
consideration. Following this transfer Mr Emeny’s beneficial holding in the Company was unchanged.
There were no changes in the Directors’ shareholdings between the year end and 12 September 2013.
Details of share options held by Directors at the period end are given in the Remuneration Report.
All Directors will be retiring at the 2013 Annual General Meeting and will be offering themselves for re-election. 
Biographical details of the Directors are set out on page 34 and 35 and details of their service contracts are in the 
Remuneration Report on page 53. 62 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

Share capital and treasury shares
The Company has only one class of shares, Ordinary Shares of 1p each. 
The issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company has increased by 574,940 Ordinary Shares during the period due to the 
exercise of share options. Details of option exercises by Directors are set out above.
At 29 June 2013 the Company did not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury (2012: nil). There were no movements of  
shares in or out of treasury during the period and there have been no movements of shares in or out of treasury since  
the period end.

WL Adderley is also deemed to hold a legal interest in 1,167,250 Ordinary Shares held by The Leicester Foundation  
and 172,750 Ordinary Shares held by the Paddocks Discretionary Trust, by virtue of the fact that he is a trustee of  
those trusts.
Powers of Directors
Specific powers of the Directors in relation to shares and the Company’s Articles of Association are referred to in the 
Corporate Governance report on page 40.
Treasury and risk management
The Group’s approach to treasury and financial risk management is explained in the Key Risks and Uncertainties section on 
page 23.
Going concern
The Directors have made appropriate enquiries and formed a judgement at the time of approving the financial 
statements that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. 
Auditor
Due to an internal reorganisation, the Group’s auditor, KPMG Audit plc, has decided to wind down its audit business and 
transfer it to KPMG LLP.
As a consequence, KPMG Audit plc has notified the Group that it is not seeking reappointment at the forthcoming AGM and 
KPMG LLP has agreed to be appointed in its place. The statement of circumstances required under section 519 of the 
Companies Act 2006 is reproduced in part 5 of the Notice of AGM.
In accordance with section 489 of the Companies Act 2006 and the recommendation of the Audit Committee, a resolution 
is to be proposed at the AGM for the appointment of KPMG LLP as auditors of the Group.
Disclosure of information to auditor 
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Directors’ report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditor is unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Group’s auditor is aware of that information.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union (‘EU’) and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements on the 
same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
the Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Parent Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent 
Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the Company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
b) the management report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Consolidated statement of changes in equity
For the 52 weeks ended 29 June 2013 70 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the 
‘Group’). The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and 
not about its Group.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’) and in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 and these are presented on pages 64 to 84.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented 
in these Group financial statements.
The annual financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for financial instruments, 
which have been stated at fair value. The financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest 
thousand.
Going concern 
The Group has considerable financial resources together with long standing relationships with a number of key 
suppliers and an established reputation in the retail sector across different geographic areas. As a consequence, the 
Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. The Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report 
and financial statements.
Further information regarding the Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position is set out in the Directors’ Report and Business Review on pages 60 to 62. The 
financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Finance 
Director’s review on pages 16 to 19. In addition note 17 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; and its exposures to credit risk 
and liquidity risk.
Use of estimates and judgements
The presentation of the annual financial statements requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The key estimates and judgements used in the financial statements are as follows:
Inventory provisions
The Group provides against the carrying value of inventories held, based upon average losses incurred to clear old and 
discounted lines. Sensitivities to the assumptions for specific product lines are not expected by management to result in 
a material change in the overall provisions.
Taxation
There are transactions whose ultimate tax treatment is uncertain. The Group makes provision for anticipated tax issues 
based on the likelihood of whether additional taxes may arise. The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities 
based on estimates of future taxable income and recoverability. If these estimates do not materialise or change, or there 
are changes in tax rates or to the period over which losses might be recognised, then the value of the deferred tax 
assets or liability will need to be revised in a future period.
Equity-settled share-based payments
Certain employees and Directors of the Group receive equity-settled remuneration in the form of equity-settled share-
based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares. The cost 
of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value, determined using an 
appropriate pricing model, at the date at which they are granted. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, 
together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the non-market vesting conditions are 
expected to be fulfilled, ending on the relevant vesting date. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled 
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date is adjusted to reflect the Directors’ best available estimate of 
the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest based upon non-market conditions.
It is not considered likely that any change in assumptions with respect to taxation or share-based payments would have 
a material impact on the financial statements.
Accounting policies 71 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or 
indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In 
assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, 
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue
Revenue represents the proceeds from sales of goods and related services. It excludes sales between Group companies 
and is after deducting returns, discounts given and VAT. For the majority of sales, revenue is recognised at the point of 
sale with the exception of custom made products, where revenue is recognised at the point that the goods are 
collected, and gift vouchers, where revenue is recognised when the vouchers are redeemed.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the prevailing rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Resulting 
exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement for the period.
Intangible assets
These comprise software development and implementation costs and trademarks and are stated at cost less 
amortisation (see below). Costs incurred on the Group’s own brand are expensed as incurred.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. 
These are as follows:
•	 software development 3 years 
•	 trademarks 5 years
Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment 
losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of 
an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
•	 computer equipment 3 years
•	 freehold buildings 50 years
•	 fixtures and fittings 4 years
•	 motor vehicles 4 years
•	 office equipment 5 years
•	 plant and machinery 4 years
•	 leasehold improvements over the period of the lease
The residual value of an asset, if significant, is reassessed annually.
Current assets
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and then carried at amortised cost net of  
impairment provisions.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is derived using the average cost method and 
includes costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price less cost to sell in the ordinary course of business.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand 
and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. 72 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Bank borrowings and borrowing costs
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at their fair value. 
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the financial period in which they are incurred.
Borrowings are classed as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments used are forward exchange contracts and are measured at fair value. The fair values are 
determined by reference to the market prices available from the market on which the instruments involved are traded.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Group’s treasury policy. Cash flow 
hedges are instruments that hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or a liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
For cash flow hedges that proportion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective 
hedge, as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, is recognised in equity, directly in 
the hedge reserve with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement. Such hedges are tested, both at 
inception to ensure they are expected to be effective and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing 
effectiveness. When the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated 
gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all 
other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the 
same period in which the hedge cash flows affect the income statement.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are 
recognised in the income statement.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time-value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash 
inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds the 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Share capital
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the 
shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received net 
of any directly attributable incremental transactions costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders. 
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. A 
provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefit to be derived by the Group from a contract is 
lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting its obligations under the contract.
Expenses
Property leases
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement evenly over the full term of the lease.
Where leases for land and buildings provide for fixed rent review dates and amounts, the Group accounts for such 
reviews by recognising, on a straight-line basis, the total implicit minimum lease payments over the non-cancellable 
period of the lease term.
Accounting policies continued 73 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information
Financing income/expense
Financing income/expense comprises interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate 
method, interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains and losses.
Retirement benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan using a third-party provider. Obligations for the contributions 
to this plan are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group operates an employee share save scheme open to all employees enabling them to save money which may be 
used after three years to acquire shares in the Company at a predetermined price.
The Group also operates other share option schemes enabling certain employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair 
value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the options. Fair value is measured using the binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
applicable to the options.
At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest 
and amends the charge accordingly. 
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved such that the Company is obligated to 
pay the dividend.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax represents the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be recognised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that the related tax benefit will be recognised.
New Standards and interpretations
In the current year there were no new standards adopted that had a material impact on the Group or Company results.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following relevant standards were endorsed by the EU, but 
not yet adopted by the Group:
IFRS 10 – Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement
The above will be adopted in the Group and Company financial statements when they become effective. When 
adopted, none of the above standards or amendments are expected to have any significant impact on the financial 
statements of the Group or Company.  74 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Notes to the annual financial statements
For the 52 weeks ended 29 June 2013 
1 Segmental reporting
The Group has one reportable segment, retail of homewares in the UK. 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Board of Directors of Dunelm Group plc. Internal management reports are 
reviewed by them on a monthly basis. Performance of the segment is assessed based on a number of financial and 
non-financial KPI’s as well as on profit before taxation.
Management believe that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for 
making resource allocation decisions.
All material operations of the reportable segment are carried out in the UK. The Group’s revenue is driven by the 
consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or 
group of customers.

(Profit) on disposal of ineligible assets (14) (81)
 26,601 25,026
The taxation charge for the period as a percentage of profit before tax is 24.6% (2012: 26.0%).
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% (effective from 1 April 2013) was substantively enacted on  
3 July 2012, and further reductions to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were 
substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. 
This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly and further reduce the deferred tax asset at 29 June 
2013 (which has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date) by £190,000. 76 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 11.5p per Ordinary Share for the period ended 29 June 2013 which 
equates to £23.3m. The dividend will be paid on 20 December 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 29 November 2013. The Directors have announced a special dividend amounting to £50.7m (25.0p per 
share), to be paid on 11 October 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 20 September 2013.
8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume 
conversion of all dilutive Potential Ordinary Shares. These represent share options granted to employees where the 
exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s Ordinary Shares during the period.

16 Interest bearing loans and borrowings
The Group maintains a £10m overdraft facility. Interest is payable on funds utilised under the facility at the rate of 1.5% 
above the bank’s base rate.
17 Financial risk management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. A formal 
process for reviewing and managing risk in the business has been developed. A register of strategic and operational risks is 
maintained and reviewed quarterly by the Board, who also monitor the status of agreed actions to mitigate key risks.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s foreign exchange hedging agreements with it’s 
banking counterparties. The Group only deals with creditworthy counterparties and uses publicly available financial 
information to rate its counterparties. 
As the principal business of the Group is retail related, trade receivables consist of a relatively small number of 
customers, which tend to be charity or local authority based. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the 
financial statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s 
approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and extreme circumstances. The Group manages this risk by continuously 
monitoring cash flow forecasts. The Group’s available facilities can be found in note 16.
Group policy is that surplus funds are placed on deposit with counterparties approved by the Board, with a minimum of 
‘A’ credit rating. Credit limits with approved counterparties are limited to £25m for any individual party. 79 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information
17 Financial risk management continued
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the 
Group’s income. 
Interest rate risk
The Group’s bank borrowings incur variable interest rate charges linked to LIBOR and Barclays Bank Base Rate. The 
Directors do not consider that future changes in interest rates are likely to cause a material direct impact on 
profitability. The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities is detailed in note 16.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on purchases denominated in US dollars. These amounted to 
approximately 16% of the total stock purchases in the year ended 29 June 2013. The outstanding US dollar liabilities at 
the year end were $525,000 (2012: $256,000) and payments on account were $6,234,000 (2012: $6,227,000).
During the year the Group entered into exchange rate swaps for $65.7m to sell sterling and buy US dollars. These swaps 
are accounted for as cash flow hedges. During the year the net mark to market profit on foreign currency hedging 
instruments taken to equity was £0.3m (2012: £0.3m). At the balance sheet date the Group had 16 swap contracts 
outstanding with a maximum value of $45.9m.
All of the Group’s revenues are in sterling. Purchases of promotional goods are generally in US dollars. Purchase of 
regular range goods are generally in sterling, although some lines are now being imported directly and paid for in US 
dollars. We cover exchange rate exposure on expected promotional product purchases up to a maximum of 100% of 
forecast purchases over a four month horizon. We cover exchange rate exposure on expected regular range purchases 
up to a maximum of 50% of forecast purchases over a 12 month horizon. We use various means to cover the above 
currency exposures; hold excess funds in US dollars, take out forward contracts for the purchase of US dollars, enter 
into forward rate options.
In the event of a significant adverse movement in the US dollar exchange rate, the Group would seek to minimise the 
impact on profitability by changing the selling price of goods.
Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal foreign currency exposure is to the US dollar. 
The Directors believe that an increase or decrease of 10% in the US dollar to sterling exchange rates would not have a 
material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The US dollar year end exchange rate applied in the above analysis is 1.5239 (2012: 1.5617). Strengthening and 
weakening of sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign 
exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Fair values
The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying value. The fair value 
of foreign currency contracts are sums required by the counterparties to cancel the contracts at the end of the year.
Fair value hierarchy
Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels:
•	 Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•	 Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
•	 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method. 
Gains on cash flow hedges during the year amounted to £387,000 (2012: gain £476,000).
Capital management
The Company manages its equity as capital.
The Board’s objective with respect to capital management is to ensure the Group continues as a going concern in order 
to optimise returns to shareholders. The Board’s policy is to retain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, 
creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development. The Board regularly monitors the level of capital in 
the Group to ensure that this can be achieved.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market. The shares are intended to be used for issuing 
shares under the Group’s share option programmes. The Board has authorised a share purchase programme designed 
to ensure that all options expected to vest under share option schemes can be fulfilled out of treasury shares. 80 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013

19 Treasury shares
In the past the Company has acquired its own shares (‘treasury shares’) for the purpose of delivery to employees under 
employee share schemes. No such purchases were made during the financial year. 
The Company did not reissue any treasury shares during the year. (2012: nil). 
20 Share-based payments
As at 29 June 2013, the Group operated three share award plans:
a) Dunelm Group Share Option Plan (‘GSOP’)
b) Dunelm Group Savings Related Share Option Plan (‘Sharesave’)
c) Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
There were nil exercisable options in total under these schemes as at 29 June 2013 (2012: 128,228).
a) Dunelm Group Share Option Plan
The GSOP was established in December 2003. Options have a vesting period of three years from date of grant and a 
maximum life of 10 years. All subsequent grants have an exercise price equal to market price at date of grant. These 
grants are dependent on the level of growth in the Group’s EPS relative to RPI as well as continuing employment with 
the Group.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the 
options, assessed using a binomial model. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the 
calculations are as follows:
 
November 2012

b) Dunelm Group Savings Related Share Option Plan
The Sharesave scheme was established in 2006 and is open to all staff with eligible length of service. One grant was made 
under the scheme during the year, in November 2012. Options may be exercised under the scheme within six months of the 
completion of the three year savings contract which commenced on 1 January 2013. There is provision for early exercise in 
certain circumstances such as death, disability, redundancy and retirement.

The weighted average share price at the time of exercise was 699.4p.
c) Long-Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP was approved by the Board in 2006 enabling the Group to award shares to particular individuals, normally in 
the form of nominal cost options. The LTIP is administered by the Remuneration Committee. One grant was made in the 
year, to the Executive Directors and senior management. The grants are exercisable in November 2015. These grants are 
dependent on the level of growth in Group EPS relative to RPI, as well as continuing employment. The maximum life of 
options under the LTIP is 10 years from the date of grant. Full details of this plan are included in the Remuneration 
Report on pages 47 to 56.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of  
the options.

Parent Company statement of changes in equity
For the 52 weeks ended 29 June 2013 87 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Company information
Basis of preparation
The Company financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’) and as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006. 
The accounts of the Company are prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006, applicable accounting standards and specifically in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the adjusted cost of the investment, Scope of IFRS 2 share-based 
payments requires the Parent Company to recognise an increase in the cost of its investment in a subsidiary which has 
issued share options in the Parent Company’s shares to its employees.
Current assets
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and then carried at amortised cost net of  
impairment provisions. 
Bank borrowings and borrowing costs
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at their fair value. 
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the financial period in which they are incurred.
Borrowings are classed as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months from the balance sheet date.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Where a Group Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other Group 
Companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements for them as such. In this 
respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable the 
Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Share capital
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the 
shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received net 
of any directly attributable incremental transactions costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Share-based payments
The Company operates three share option schemes details of which are set out in note 12. 
The fair value of options granted is realised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair 
value of employee services received in the subsidiaries under these schemes are recognised as an expense in the 
financial statements of the subsidiary undertakings which benefit from the employee services. The company has 
recognised the fair value of the share-based payments as an increase in equity with a corresponding adjustment to 
investments. 
Fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the options. Fair value is measured using the binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
applicable to the options.
At each balance sheet date the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives expected to vest. Any 
impact of this revision is recognised as an adjustment to equity with a corresponding adjustment to investments.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved such that the Company is obligated to 
pay the dividend.
Parent Company accounting policies 88 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2013
Parent Company accounting policies continued
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax represents the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be recognised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that the related tax benefit will be recognised.

At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards, amendments and interpretations were in 
place but not yet effective:

Omega International Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004
OVERVIEW
 Successfully admitted to AIM in April 2004
 Turnover a record £21.3m
 Job creation exceeded 200
 Improved operating margin at 19%
 Strong cash inflow from operations of £4.9m
I am pleased to report that the year ended
31 December 2004 reflected a period of
significant achievement and importance for
the Group.
The Company was successfully admitted
to the Alternative Investment Market of the
London Stock Exchange on 13 April 2004.
This achieved a key objective and allowed
the Company to redeem all remaining
preference shares and to pay in full the
associated dividend liabilities. The increase
in our share price since flotation reflects
how well the listing was received.
The financial performance of the Group
has been robust with turnover at a record
£21.3m (2003: £17.8m). We recorded
a 47% gross margin (2003: 44%) and
an operating margin of 19% (2003: 16%).
Operating profit has grown by 41% to
£4.1m which reflects economies of scale
and improved efficiencies on incremental
volumes. Cash flow has been strong,
allowing the early repayment of some
£1.3m of long term debt.
The Directors are proposing a maiden
dividend of 1.5p per ordinary share payable
on 8 July 2005.
The Group’s strategy continues to focus
strongly on increased development of its
kitchen brands and expanded distribution
through independent retail outlets
nationwide in the replacement and
new build markets.
Current trading is in line with expectations
and the Directors are confident that the
product launches in 2005, together with
improved distribution, will lead to further
growth in volumes, margins and profit.
On behalf of the Group, I would like to
thank all of our customers and suppliers
as well as our own skilled and dedicated
staff, who now number over 200, for
their support, commitment and energy
throughout the year.

Omega International Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
 Twenty new kitchens launched in 2004
 Further investment in new outlets and displays
 Manufacturing productivity improved by 18%
 96% of all kitchens shipped complete and on time
Omega’s three brands, Sheraton, Omega
Kitchens and Chippendale Kitchens are
distributed and sold through a national
network of specialist kitchen outlets, the
majority of which are independent retailers.
Omega had a very good year with progress
being made in all areas of the business.
The Group continued with its investment
in expanding and strengthening its display
base on all three brands by taking on new
displaying dealers as well as adding displays
of new kitchen ranges within existing outlets.
During 2004 Omega also increased its
focus on sales activity in the South where
historically its distribution has not been as
concentrated. This ongoing initiative is
expected to gain momentum throughout
2005 and make an increased contribution
to the business.
New product development continues to
be a key area for the Group. Twenty new
kitchens were launched during 2004 across
all three brands, helping to improve yields
per outlet as well as refreshing the mix
of kitchens on display nationally.
Omega continues to work closely with its
displaying outlets, utilising its national sales
force to motivate dealers and their staff
as well as constructing tailored marketing
packages including showroom layouts,
staff training, CAD planning and quotations,
product promotions and support materials.
Our modest market share should allow us
to continue with our growth plans even if
market conditions ease.
The operational side of the business also
made significant progress. Production
volumes increased by around 20% in line
with sales growth and manufacturing
volumes per operative improved by over
18% in the year.
Service levels remained consistently high,
averaging 96% of all kitchens being
despatched complete and on time to our
dealers or their customers’ home addresses.
The Group continues with its successful
formula into 2005, targeting additional new
display outlets and further strengthening the
existing display network. Four new kitchens
have been launched into Sheraton this
month and a new product development
programme for Omega Kitchens and
Chippendale Kitchens is now underway
with launches planned for September 2005.

Omega International Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004
TRADING
Turnover grew by 20% to £21.3m from
£17.8m in 2003. Increased volumes and
improved cost controls allowed gross
margins to reach 47% up from 44% in
2003. Further, operational efficiencies
allowed operating margins to reach 19%
for the year compared with 16% in 2003.
UNUSUAL ITEMS
The consolidated profit and loss account
includes a tax charge that is much lower
than the statutory rate of 30%. This arose
from statutory deductions of £3m available
to the Group through the exercise of EMI
share options by the Executive Directors
on the flotation of the Company.
On flotation, all the Company’s previously
issued preference shares were redeemed
together with deferred dividend payments
of £1.4m arising on redemption.
In view of the significance of these unusual
items, an adjusted earnings per share
calculation has been presented that excludes
their impact on reported results.
CASH FLOW
The placing of new shares on flotation and
the exercise of options raised £2.06m net of
expenses which was used mainly to redeem
the remaining preference shares and to pay
the deferred dividend referred to above.
Operating cash flows at £4.9m against
£1.8m in 2003 reflected both improved
profitability and control of working capital,
especially stock levels which reduced
slightly year on year. Capital expenditure
totalled £0.7m, leaving the remainder
of cash flows, after the payment of £0.6m
in Corporation Tax, to service and reduce
net debt.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE
The Group is now funded by equity
and medium term borrowings from
Lloyds TSB Bank plc. Early repayments
of the ten year loan from the bank have
resulted in a year end balance of £2.1m
(2003: £3.8m). Other borrowings at
the beginning of the year of £1.3m were
repaid in full, leaving net gearing of 15%
at year end.
Both medium and short term facilities are
payable in Sterling and carry interest linked
to base rate.
TREASURY
The Group’s current policy is to use floating
interest rates on its debt and any surplus
funds are placed on deposit daily. However,
when commitments allow, early repayments
will continue to be made on the medium term
debt rather than placing funds on deposit.
About one third of the Group’s purchases
of material are made in Euros. It is the Group’s
policy to purchase Euros using forward
options when rates are favourable. This
though is usually for less than the next half
year’s purchases and the purchase of forward
currency, if any, is delegated to the Finance
and Operations Directors, acting together.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 Turnover up 20%
 Gross and operating margins increased by 3% of sales
 Share capital restructured on float
 Operating cash inflow of £4.9m

Omega International Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004
EMPLOYEES
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued its practice of keeping them informed
of matters affecting them as employees and the various factors affecting the performance of the Group. This is done through a quarterly
newsletter, regular meetings of the Elected Council and team briefings.
The Directors recognise that continued and sustained improvement in the performance of the Group depends on its ability to attract,
motivate and retain employees of the highest calibre. Furthermore, the Directors believe that the Group’s ability to sustain a competitive
advantage over the long term depends, in a large part, on ensuring that all employees contribute to the maximum of their potential.
The Group is committed to improving the performance of all employees through development training.
The Group is an equal opportunity employer. The Group’s policies seek to promote an environment free from discrimination, harassment
and victimisation and to ensure that no employee or applicant is treated less favourably on the grounds of gender, marital status, age, race,
colour, nationality or national origin, disability or sexual orientation or is disadvantaged by conditions or requirements which cannot
objectively be justified. Entry into, and progression within the Group, is solely determined on the basis of work criteria and individual merit.
The Group continues to give full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by disabled persons, having regard to their
respective aptitudes and abilities. The policy includes, where practicable, the continued employment of those who may become disabled
during their employment and the provision of training and career development and promotion, where appropriate.
SHARE SCHEME
Share ownership is a key part of the Group’s remuneration philosophy and the Directors believe that a major key to the Group’s future
success lies in a motivated management team holding a stake in the Company. Details of share options granted during the year are set
out in the Remuneration Report on page 12.
POLICY AND PRACTICE ON PAYMENT OF CREDITORS
It is the Group’s policy to agree terms and conditions for its business transactions with its suppliers. The Group seeks to abide by the payment
terms agreed with suppliers whenever it is satisfied that the supplier has provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms
and conditions. Where specific credit terms are not negotiated with suppliers, the Group endeavours to meet such suppliers’ normal terms.
In the year ended 31 December 2004 average creditor days for the Group were 88 days (2003: 95). The Company had no trade
creditors at the year end.
ENVIRONMENT
The Group recognises the importance of environmental responsibility. The nature of its activities has a minimal effect on the environment
but where they do, the Group acts responsibly and is aware of its obligations at all times.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The next AGM of the Company will be held on 8 June 2005. Details of the business to be proposed at the AGM are contained within the
Notice of Meeting, which is set out on pages 31 to 32.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution proposing that they be re-appointed
as independent auditors and authorising the Directors to fix their remuneration will be proposed at the AGM.
By order of the Board.

For the year ended 31 December 2004

Omega International Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004
PRINCIPLES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
As an AIM quoted Company, Omega International Group PLC is not required to comply with the provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code. However, the Board recognises the value of good corporate governance as a positive contribution to the well being of the business
and believes in applying these principles in a sensible and pragmatic manner.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors consists of six members, including a Non-Executive Chairman and two other Independent Non-Executive Directors.
The roles of Non-Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separated and clearly defined. The activities of the Group are
controlled by the Board, which meets throughout the year. There is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the full Board’s
decision, together with a policy enabling Directors to take independent advice in the furtherance of their duties at the Group’s expense.
The Board programme is designed so that Directors have regular opportunity to consider the Group’s strategy, policies, budgets, progress
reports and financial position and to arrive at a balanced assessment of the Group’s position and prospects.
The Board is assisted by the Company Secretary, who provides a point of reference and regular support for all Directors and senior managers.
He has responsibility for ensuring that Board procedures are followed, for establishing the Group’s corporate governance policies and for
assisting the Board in facilitating compliance by the Company with its legal obligations.
The Board has appointed two standing committees, which are as follows:
The Audit Committee
The committee comprises the two Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman and is chaired by Bob Murray,
in view of his financial experience. Its duties include a comprehensive review of the annual and interim financial statements before they
are presented to the Board for approval. The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year to review the findings of the external auditors,
key accounting policies and judgements. It has unrestricted access to the Company’s external auditors.
The Remuneration Committee
The committee comprises the two Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman and is chaired by Prue Leith.
It meets at least twice a year and is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on remuneration policy for Executive Directors
and for setting salaries, incentive payments and share options granted.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company seeks to ensure that all shareholders are kept informed about the Company and its activities. A comprehensive annual
report and accounts and an interim report are sent to shareholders and there is frequent dialogue with institutional investors, including
individual and Group presentations following the preliminary and interim announcements.
The AGM is a forum for shareholders’ participation with the opportunity to meet and question Board members including the
Non-Executive Chairman.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board of Directors acknowledges its overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and for monitoring their
effectiveness. The Board has control over strategic, financial and compliance issues and has introduced a structure of responsibility
with appropriate levels of authority. The Board as a whole has continued to review annually the effectiveness of the Group’s systems
of internal control.
The Company’s Directors and varying levels of management have clear responsibilities in ensuring that the control environment operates
efficiently. Clear lines of responsibility are developed through the Group’s organisation structure. Ethical policies are communicated
through all forms of personnel training and via appropriate procedures.
_1_OMG_ARB04.qxd  01/04/2005  10:28  Page 8 9
Omega International Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004
INTERNAL CONTROL (CONTINUED)
Although no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, the Group’s systems are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that problems are identified on a timely basis and are dealt with appropriately. The principal
features of the Group’s internal financial control structures can be summarised as follows:
a. preparation of budgets and forecasts approved by the Board;
b. monthly management accounts, showing comparisons of actual results against budget and prior year results, are reviewed by the Board.
Variances from budget are thoroughly investigated and are discussed at monthly management meetings;
c. the Group’s cash flow is also monitored against forecast; and
d. the Board authorises capital expenditure where this is significant.
GOING CONCERN
Under Company law, the Directors are required to consider whether it is appropriate to prepare financial statements on the basis that
the Company and Group are going concerns. As part of its normal business practice, budgets, cash flow forecasts and longer term
financial projections are prepared and in reviewing this information, the Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group have
adequate resources to enable them to continue in business for the foreseeable future. The Directors have therefore adopted the going
concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year.
The Directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently as explained on pages 17 to 18 under the
heading ‘Accounting Policies’. They also confirm that reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates have been made in preparing
the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004, that applicable accounting policies have been followed and that the
financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Omega website is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not
involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that occur to the financial
statements after they are initially presented on the website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
By order of the Board.

Omega International Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004
As an AIM quoted Company, Omega International Group PLC is not required to comply with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
The following disclosures are made voluntarily. The contents of this report are unaudited unless clearly identified as audited.
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Non-Executive Directors:
Prue Leith (Chair)
Kevin McDonald
Bob Murray
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board.
The Non-Executive Directors do not take part in discussions on their remuneration. Neither the Non-Executive Chairman nor the other
Non-Executive Directors received any pension, share options or other benefits from the Group, nor did they participate in any of the
bonus schemes.
Remuneration of Executive Directors
The main aim of the Company’s Executive pay policy is to secure the skills and experience needed to meet its strategic business objectives.
Furthermore, the Company aims to align the interests of all employees as closely as possible with the interests of shareholders through share
based incentives and bonus schemes based on profit.
The Company’s Remuneration Committee decides the remuneration policy that applies to Executive Directors. In setting the policy it considers
a number of factors including:
(a) The basic salaries and benefits available to Executive Directors of comparable companies.
(b) The need to attract and retain Executive Directors of an appropriate calibre.
(c) The need to ensure Executive Directors’ commitment to the continued success of the Group by means of incentive schemes.
The Company’s remuneration policy is to:
(a) Have regard to the Executive Directors’ experience and the nature and complexity of their work in order to pay a competitive salary
that attracts and retains management of the highest quality.
(b) Link individual remuneration packages to the Group’s long term performance through the award of share options and incentive schemes.
(c) Provide post-retirement benefits through contributions to Executive Directors’ self invested pension schemes.
(d)Provide employment-related benefits including the provision of a company car (or car allowance), fuel, medical and life insurance
and insurance relating to the Executive Directors’ duties.
SALARIES
The Remuneration Committee meets at least once a year in order to consider and set the annual salaries for Executive Directors,
having regard to the needs of the Company, individual responsibilities, personal performance and salary survey information.
PENSIONS (AUDITED)
The Executive Directors are members of their own defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held independently
of the Group. The amounts contributed by the Group for the year ended 31 December 2004 were £58,613 (2003: £29,565).
The Company does not provide any other post-retirement benefits to the Directors.
CONTRACTS OF SERVICE
The Executive Directors have contracts of service that can be terminated by either party on 12 months’ notice. If the Company terminates
the contracts by notice but other than on giving full notice, the contracts of service provide for the payment of a fixed amount equal to
the salary and other contractual benefits for the unexpired portion of the appointment or notice entitlement, as the case may be.

These share options cannot be exercised before 29 June 2007 and have an expiry date of 28 June 2014. They are subject to stringent
performance targets based on profit growth.

Omega International Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated
cash flow statement, the accounting policies and the related notes.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report
is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and
transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement, the Financial Review, the Directors’ Report, the Corporate Governance Statement, the
Remuneration Report and the other items included in the contents section.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination,
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 December 2004
and of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

17
Omega International Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004
The Group’s principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year and with the preceding year
are set out below.
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The accounts are prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain tangible
fixed assets and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
The Group accounts are a consolidation of the accounts of Omega International Group PLC and all of its subsidiary undertakings for the
year ended 31 December 2004. All inter-Group transactions are eliminated.
TURNOVER
Turnover comprises the net amount receivable from customers after deducting any discounts for displays or for other marketing support
in respect of the goods and services provided in the normal course of business. Turnover is recognised once goods are delivered or the
services are provided to customers. Turnover excludes VAT. 
INVESTMENTS
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Loans to subsidiaries are classified as part of
the investment when such loans are envisaged to be long term in nature. 
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Tangible fixed assets, excluding freehold land and buildings, are stated at the cost of acquisition less any provision for depreciation.
Freehold land and buildings are stated at valuation on an existing use basis. An external professional valuer performs a full valuation at
least every five years and an interim valuation is carried out in the third year after a full valuation. Interim valuations are also performed
where the Directors believe that it is likely that there has been a material change in value. Revaluation gains are recognised in full through
the statement of total recognised gains and losses and credited to the revaluation reserve.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the valuation or cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line
basis from the date it is brought into productive use to the end of its expected useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and equipment 5–10 years
Fixtures and fittings 4–10 years
Computer hardware and software 3–6 years
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Interest on borrowings specifically and exclusively linked to the construction of fixed assets is capitalised as part of the cost of the asset
until practical completion occurs.
INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
Intangible fixed assets comprise trademarks and similar rights and assets and are carried at cost less amortisation. Amortisation is provided
on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life of the asset which has been taken as five years.
_1_OMG_ARB04.qxd  01/04/2005  10:28  Page 17 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
18
Omega International Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004
STOCKS
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is the purchase cost, including transport, for raw materials, together with a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal
levels of activity, for work in progress and finished goods.
Net realisable value is based on estimated normal selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and sale.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
TAXATION
The charge for tax is based on the profit for the year and takes into account tax deferred or accelerated because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for accounting and tax purposes. Full provision is made for deferred tax resulting from timing
differences between profits computed for tax purposes and profits stated in the financial statements to the extent that there is an
obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future as a result of the reversal of those timing differences. Deferred tax
assets are recognised to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable. Deferred tax is not discounted.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Government grants are recognised in the profit and loss account so as to match them with the expenditure towards which they are
intended to contribute. To the extent that the grants received are intended as a specific reduction against certain tangible fixed assets,
they are recognised in the profit and loss account over the expected useful economic life of the related tangible fixed asset.
PENSION BENEFITS
The Group provides pension benefits to its employees through contributions to defined contribution Group personal pension policies.
The amounts charged to the profit and loss account are the contributions payable in the period.
LEASES
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Assets acquired under finance lease or similar arrangements are recorded at cost and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or
the useful life of the asset concerned. The lease liability is recognised as a liability at the inception of the lease and interest is charged to
the profit and loss account so as to produce a constant rate on the outstanding liability.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currency are retranslated at either the rate of exchange at 31 December or at the contracted rate where the transaction is covered
by a forward exchange contract. All currency differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In accordance with FRS 8, “Related Party Disclosures”, the Company discloses details, if any, of material transactions between the
reporting entity and related parties. However, transactions between the Company and other Group companies have not been disclosed
in accordance with the exemption in FRS 8 paragraph 3(a).
SHARE OPTIONS
The intrinsic value of share options granted (being the market price at the date of grant less the exercise price) is charged against profit on
a straight line basis over the initial vesting period. An equivalent amount is credited to the profit and loss reserve.

8. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share of 8.3p (2003: 7.7p) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share reflect the adjustment of the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume conversion
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, being outstanding share options.
The number of shares has been adjusted to calculate earnings per share as though the 10 for 1 share split on 13 April 2004 had been
in effect throughout both 2003 and 2004.
Weighted average number of shares:
2004 2003
For basic earnings per share 26,356,537 22,770,000
Share options 48,510 —
For diluted earnings per share 26,405,047 22,770,000
The share options outstanding at 31 December 2003 were not dilutive under the provisions of FRS 14. The dilution above at
31 December 2004 does not give rise to a difference between basic and diluted earnings per share.
The earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share reflect:
2004 2003
£’000 £’000
Profit for the period 3,591 1,836
Dividends – non-equity (1,411) (94)
Basic earnings 2,180 1,742
Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated so as to exclude certain one-off items that have arisen during 2004 in
connection with the Company’s admission to AIM. Adjusted earnings per share is provided in order that the effect of these one-off items
can be fully appreciated. 
Adjusted earnings used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share reconciles to basic earnings as follows:

16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, bank loans and overdrafts and various items, such as debtors and creditors, that arise
from its operations. The Group also enters into forward foreign currency contracts the purpose of which is to manage the currency risks
arising from the Group’s operations.
The main financial risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks. It is the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments
should be undertaken. The year end positions reflect this policy and there have been no changes in the policy since 31 December 2004.
 Liquidity risk: Through cash flow forecasting, daily monitoring and monthly review the Group monitors working capital
and capital expenditure requirements. Liquidity risk is further managed by the agreement of term loans and working capital facilities,
details of which are given below.
 Interest rate risk: The Group finances its operations through a combination of bank loans and bank overdrafts. The Group
currently borrows at floating rates of interest to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
 Foreign currency risk: Approximately a third of the Group’s purchases of raw materials are from continental Europe.
These purchases are mostly priced and invoiced in Euros. The Group’s policy is to reduce currency exposures on purchases,
if appropriate, through the use of forward currency contracts.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 13, to exclude short term trade debtors and trade creditors from the following
disclosures (all of which relate to the Group), with the exception of the currency risk exposure analysis.
Interest rate risk of financial assets
The Group has no financial assets, other than short term debtors and cash on hand. Cash on hand is held in bank accounts at floating
rates of interest.

Interest rate risk of financial liabilities
The interest rate risk profile of the Group’s financial liabilities was:
Floating rate Fixed rate

liabilities liabilities Total
£’000 £’000 £’000
At 31 December 2004:
Bank loans 2,100 — 2,100
At 31 December 2003:
Bank loans and other borrowings 5,117 — 5,117
Preference shares — 700 700
Total 5,117 700 5,817
Fixed rate financial liabilities relate exclusively to the £1 cumulative redeemable preference shares, all of which were redeemed during 2004.
All the Group’s creditors falling due within one year (other than bank and other borrowings) are excluded from the above tables either
due to the exclusion of short term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability. Due to the exclusion of certain
Euro denominated trade creditors, all of the above financial liabilities are denominated in Sterling.
Details of interest and maturity profiles attaching to bank borrowings are given in Note 15.
Borrowing facilities
The Group’s various undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were as follows:
2004 2003
£’000 £’000
Working capital facility
Expiring within one year 1,500 500
Invoice discounting facility
Expiring within one year — 962

Fair value of financial liabilities
The following table reflects the carrying amount and the fair value of the Group’s financial liabilities.
2004 2003
Book value Fair value Book value Fair value
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Primary financial instruments issued 
to finance the Group’s operations:

Long term borrowings 1,700 1,700 3,537 3,537
Preference shares —— 700 2,089
Derivative financial instruments held 
to hedge the currency exposure 
on expected future purchases:
Forward foreign currency contracts —1 —11
Except for the preference shares, the book value of all financial liabilities approximates to fair value. For the preference shares, the fair
value at 31 December 2003 was significantly higher than book value due to the likelihood of repayment of the deferred dividend
given the proposed admission to the Alternative Investment Market. In the case of short term and long term borrowings, the fair value
approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as they are all held at floating rates of interest. The fair value of forward
foreign currency contracts is based on the relevant market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
Hedges
As explained above, the Group’s policy is to reduce currency exposures on purchases, if appropriate, through the use of forward currency
contracts. Under the Group’s accounting policy, foreign currency liabilities that are hedged by forward currency contracts are translated
at the contracted rates. Consequently, the carrying value of the relevant liability effectively includes the gain or loss on hedging
instrument. Such gains and losses are treated as deferred for the purpose of the table below.
Unrecognised Deferred 
Total net Total net

Gains and losses on hedges at:
31 December 2004 — — — 1 — 1

At both balance sheet dates, unrecognised and deferred gains on forward currency contracts are recognised in full in the profit and loss
account in the year following.

NOTES
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting is also entitled to appoint a proxy or proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote
instead of him. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. Appointment of a proxy will not preclude a member from attending
and voting in person at the Meeting. 
2. To be effective, the instrument appointing a proxy and any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed (or a notarially
certified copy of such authority) must be deposited at the Registrars’ office not less than 48 hours before the time for holding the Meeting.
A form of proxy is enclosed with this notice.
3. In the case of joint holders of a share the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted
to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For this purpose seniority is determined by the order in which the names
of the holders stand in the register of members in respect of the joint holding. 
4. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the time by which a person must be entered on the register
of members in order to have the right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is 48 hours prior to the time fixed for the Meeting
or, if the Meeting is adjourned, such time being not more than 48 hours prior to the time fixed for the adjourned Meeting. Changes to
entries on the register of members after that time will be disregarded in determining the right of any person to attend or vote at the Meeting.
5. Resolution 8 gives the Directors the authority to allot shares and resolution 9 allows limited allotments on a non-pre-emptive basis.
The Directors have no present intention of using such authority but consider it advisable to have the authority in case appropriate
circumstances arise.

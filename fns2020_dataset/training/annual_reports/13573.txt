Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information This is my first Chairman’s review. Before I 
joined Rolls-Royce I sensed that it would be an 
extraordinary privilege to serve such a great 
company with such a rich history. So it has 
proved to be. In the past nine months I have 
travelled widely and met a broad cross-
section of colleagues, customers, suppliers 
and investors. All have been free with their 
time and open with their perspectives. 
I have two dominant initial impressions.  
The first is of the pride that people across  
the world have in the activities and 
achievements of the Group. We have a team 
that really does aspire to be ‘trusted to 
deliver excellence’ in everything it does, yet is 
under no illusions about what this will take. 
There is pride but no sense of complacency.
The second impression is of opportunity. 
Some of our business segments face strong 
headwinds and there will be some inevitable 
volatility. But, overall, Rolls-Royce competes in 
markets characterised by long-term demand 
growth and the opportunity to add value. 
This is as true of the services we provide as  
it is of our products. These opportunities are 
increasingly global in nature. Rolls-Royce has 
a great British history but its future has to 
be as a great global company.
In 2013, Rolls-Royce delivered another year  
of growth in revenues, profits and order book. 
This performance was achieved against a 
background of significant global economic 
and political uncertainty. The 13 per cent of 
increase in the payment to shareholders to 
22.0 pence reflects the confidence that the 
Board has in the fundamentals of the 
business as well as in its future prospects.
The increase in the payment to shareholders 
also recognises the importance that many of 
our investors place on annual cash returns. 
Nevertheless a key characteristic of  
Rolls-Royce is that it is a long-term business 
with technologies that take years to develop. 
This creates the necessity of a long-term 
view and for long-term investment, together 
with a commensurate attitude and mindset 
for risk.
Our strategy must be directed towards 
creating a sustainable business. For  
Rolls-Royce that means driving profitable 
growth whilst achieving a positive economic, 
social and environmental impact. We will 
deliver better power to our customers, use 
innovation to secure a better future, and 
build on today’s achievements to develop  
a better business, ready to meet the 
challenges ahead.
Research and development, and innovation 
more broadly, are crucial. They will become 
more so as we strive to improve the quality 
and performance of our power systems and 
services. The Trent XWB, for example, has 
proved to be the most efficient large civil 
aero engine in the world. Design and 
development of that engine started in 2006. 
In our Marine business, innovation and the 
development of liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
power systems has led to the possibility  
of a 40 per cent reduction in a ship’s CO 2 
emissions and the virtual elimination of 
sulphur and oxides of nitrogen emissions 
compared with conventional, diesel-powered 
craft. This presents a clear environmental 
and commercial opportunity. These 
innovations have also taken years to develop.
We are committed to both the short-term 
performance and to the long-term health  
of the Group. It is a matter of ‘both-and’,  
not ‘either-or’. In my experience the most 
successful, most enduring organisations 
invest equivalent resource and imagination 
in the long-term health of their business  
as they do in their short to medium-term 
performance.
CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW
 
In 2013, Rolls-Royce 
delivered another year  
of growth in underlying 
revenues, underlying 
profits and orders. 
The Board is proposing  
an increase in the final 
payment to shareholders  
of 13.4p bringing the full  
year payment to 22.0p.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 4 Strategic report Ian Davis
Chairman
Dwelling on performance, I am totally 
supportive of John Rishton and the 
management team’s operational focus on 
the 4 Cs – customer, concentration, cost and 
cash. John describes the progress, and the 
continuing opportunities, of these 4 Cs in 
this report. I am particularly pleased at the 
progress in improving customer service and 
delivery reliability. Engineering and 
technology companies can have an inbuilt 
tendency to focus on product rather than  
on customer. Yet it is our customers who pay 
our bills and finance our investments. It is  
of the highest strategic and commercial 
importance that we deliver on our product 
and service commitments to our customers. 
Over and above the continuing need for 
investment, I would like to comment on  
a couple of themes relating to long-term 
health: diversity and good governance. 
I have remarked already on the need for 
Rolls-Royce to establish itself as an even 
more global Group. This will require us to 
become more diverse in our workforce and 
in our people development. To achieve our 
aspirations we have to attract, retain and 
develop the best talent everywhere we 
operate – commercial as much as 
engineering, female as much as male. 
We are making real progress. Our global 
apprenticeship programme enjoys world-
wide renown. Our record graduate intake  
in 2013 includes 32 nationalities from 97 
universities around the world. Additionally 
we continue to broaden internationally our 
network of University Technology Centres 
which are so important to our future. But 
more needs to be done. 
We can and need to do more to attract and, 
particularly, retain exceptional women.  
The engineering sector has not always been 
a favoured destination for well-qualified 
women and there may be cultural and 
historical reasons for this. For a Group  
like Rolls-Royce, this should be as much  
an opportunity as a problem. Purposeful 
diversity is an important part of our  
long-term planning.
Fundamental to a healthy company are 
strong ethical standards and behaviours, 
supported by good governance. As John 
Rishton has repeatedly made clear, the  
Group will not tolerate improper conduct. 
We are striving to ensure that every single 
Rolls-Royce employee knows what is 
expected of them and understands the 
standards to be met. The Board and 
management are united in this endeavour. 
In particular, I will focus on ensuring that  
we have the appropriate governance 
arrangements and structures in place  
to reinforce the required conduct and 
behaviours, wherever we operate.
Over recent years, the Board and 
management have been greatly assisted  
by the wise counsel of our International 
Advisory Board (IAB) whose membership  
is described on page 38. The IAB’s primary 
role is to provide context on political and 
economic developments around the world 
and to alert the Group to possible long-term 
opportunities, threats and risks. They are 
also available to provide counsel and support 
in specific areas of expertise. I am grateful  
to the IAB members for their contributions. 
I am also indebted to my fellow Board 
directors for their hard work and remarkable 
commitment to our Group as well as for 
their patience and good humour in dealing 
with the new Chairman. The Board has been 
augmented in January 2014 by Lee Hsien 
Yang and Warren East, both of whom bring  
a wealth of experience in global technology 
oriented industries. Further details of their 
careers are included on pages 36 and 37. I am 
delighted that they have joined the Group.
In the Queen’s Birthday Honours, Michel 
Dubarry, Rolls-Royce International President 
– France, Head of Europe and Northern 
Africa, was awarded an OBE. In the New 
Year’s Honours, Hamid Mughal, Director  
of Manufacturing, received an OBE and my 
fellow Board member, Warren East, a CBE. 
Their recognition is well deserved and I 
congratulate each of them. 
I would also like, in closing, to acknowledge 
Sir Simon Robertson for his inspirational 
chairmanship and leadership of the Board.  
I am sure that, over time, I will forgive him 
for being such a hard act to follow. 
I feel honoured to have the opportunity to 
serve as Chairman of Rolls-Royce. We have, 
and will have, challenges. However, I would 
be disappointed if this review does not 
convey my deep sense of opportunity to 
improve both short-term performance and 
to build the long-term health of the Group. 
2013 was a good year for Rolls-Royce and I 
would like to thank my colleagues for their 
hard work and efforts in making this happen.
Ian Davis
Chairman

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 5
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information In 2013, Rolls-Royce continued to grow  
its order book and expand its portfolio.  
The Group increased its underlying profits, 
and underlying revenues. The order book 
increased to £71.6 billion. 
This performance demonstrates both the 
long-term demand for our products and 
services, and the confidence our customers 
place in us. 
We strive continually to improve quality, 
performance and cost. To that end we invest 
in innovation, infrastructure and in the 
global workforce upon whose ability and 
ambition our current and future success 
entirely depends. I am impressed every day 
by the commitment and professionalism of 
my colleagues around the world and I thank 
them for their hard work.
The leaders of the Group have devoted 
considerable time and energy into 
articulating the vision, values, strategy and 
business priorities that we share, as well  
as setting out the standards of behaviours 
expected from everybody at Rolls-Royce. 
Providing clarity on these core beliefs,  
and making sure they are understood by 
everyone in the Group will enable us to 
better serve our customers and secure  
a profitable future for our employees and 
shareholders. 
Vision: better power for a changing world
Values: trusted to deliver excellence
Strategy: customer, innovation,  
profitable growth
These are described in greater length on 
pages 8 and 9.
Our business priorities in 2013 remained  
the same as in previous years, and have been 
characterised as ‘The 4 Cs’:
Customer – deliver on the promises  
we have made
Concentration – decide where to grow  
and where not to
Cost and Cash – improve financial 
performance
In 2013, we have made progress in all of 
these, although there remains much more  
to do.
Customer
It is essential that we deliver on the promises 
made to our customers. Across the business 
we have significantly improved on-time 
delivery. This foundational step will 
strengthen our customer relationships and 
drive more efficient use of resources, such  
as inventory. In Civil aerospace, on-time 
delivery to our wide-body customers was  
100 per cent in 2013 for the first time. 
In 2013, major milestones were achieved  
in a number of important programmes.  
The Airbus A350 XWB flew for the first time 
powered by our Trent XWB engines. We have 
now received orders for more than 
1,600 Trent XWBs, making this our best-
selling Trent engine. The Trent 1000 engine, 
which powers the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, 
has achieved the best performance of any 
new wide-body engine entering service, with 
a 99.9 per cent despatch reliability. In June, it 
was selected by Singapore Airlines to power 
50 Boeing 787 aircraft. In Marine, the first of 
our innovative Environships went to sea. This 
vessel combines a wave-piercing bow, 
gas-powered engines and advanced 
propulsion systems that together reduce CO 2 
emissions by 40 per cent, compared with 
equivalent diesel-powered vessels. Lastly,  
BAE Systems announced that the UK’s Type 26 
Destroyer programme will feature four MTU 
diesel gensets from Power Systems, together 
with our Trent-derived MT30 gas turbines.
Concentration
Concentration means deciding where to 
invest for future growth and where not.  
We have two technology platforms: gas 
turbines and reciprocating engines. Within 
gas turbines, we have a strong Civil aerospace 
business, with over £60 billion in orders.  
We will continue to invest here, including in 
the next generation of narrow-body aircraft 
engines. We will also look for opportunities 
to expand in reciprocating engines.
In 2013, we acquired Hyper-Therm HTC,  
a specialist ceramics company, to increase  
our capabilities in ceramic matrix materials 
that will, in the future, play a critical part in 
improving the performance of gas turbine 
engines. We also acquired a Norwegian 
company, SmartMotor AS, a leader in the 
permanent magnet technology employed  
in our Marine business. We integrated PKMJ 
Technical Services, a US-based nuclear 
engineering services business with expertise 
in extending the life of nuclear plants.
Areas where we have decided not to grow 
include the sale of our 50 per cent holding  
in the RTM322 helicopter engine programme 
to Turbomeca, a Safran company.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 6 Strategic report Cost
The highly regulated nature of the aerospace 
industry means that it will take both time 
and tenacity to drive cost out of the 
business, and we are still not where we need 
to be. However there are a number of areas 
where progress is being made. We reduced 
indirect headcount by 11 per cent, with 
further savings identified for 2014. Unit cost 
fell in Marine, Energy and Power Systems, 
although this was more than offset by an 
increase in Civil, where capacity growth has 
preceded volume growth and the cost per 
unit has predictably risen. We are building 
newer, more efficient facilities and capacity 
that will support a doubling of production  
of Trent engines. We are moving production 
away from high cost countries, and we are 
consolidating our supply chain. These 
actions will deliver benefits over time. 
We have prioritised investment that 
improves operational performance, adds  
to our technical capability and reduces cost. 
This includes a shop floor IT modernisation 
programme that will increase operational 
efficiency and an Integrated Production 
Systems programme that will improve 
delivery to customers while reducing cost. 
Cash
The Group delivered a cash inflow of 
£359 million (£312 million excluding 
Tognum), after payments to shareholders, 
prior to acquisitions, disposals and foreign 
exchange. Inventory has been an area of 
significant focus. While substantially 
improving our on-time delivery to customers 
and preparing for the ramp-up in volumes, 
we have improved inventory turns from  
3 times to 3.4 times, excluding Tognum.  
This is one of the largest one-year 
improvements in our stock turns.
We continue to invest significantly to deliver 
our order book. In 2013, capital expenditure 
was £687 million (£590 million excluding 
Tognum and £491 million in 2012). This 
included two new aero-engine test facilities: 
one at the NASA Stennis Space Center in 
Mississippi, US, and the other at Dahlewitz, 
Germany. We have extended our global 
Marine services network with a new facility 
in Guangzhou, China. An advanced aerofoil 
machining facility at Crosspointe in Virginia, 
US, will begin production in 2014. In the UK, 
production has started at our new state-of-
the-art fan disc factory in Washington, Tyne 
and Wear and we are also close to completing 
a new turbine blade factory in Rotherham.
In January 2013, we appointed Lord Gold to 
lead a review of our process and procedures 
regarding compliance and business ethics. 
This followed our report to the Serious Fraud 
Office (SFO) of concerns about bribery and 
corruption involving intermediaries in 
overseas markets. In December, the SFO 
confirmed that it had begun a formal 
investigation into these matters. We have 
co-operated fully with the regulatory 
authorities and will continue to do so. 
During the year, we published a new Global 
Code of Conduct. Under a programme 
implemented in 2013, all employees are 
asked to certify they have: received a copy  
of the Global Code; read and understood it; 
will comply with it; and have received a 
management briefing. I have made it 
explicit that we will not tolerate improper 
business conduct of any sort. We have 
updated and re-launched our confidential 
reporting line for employees, now known  
as the Ethics Line, available 24 hours a day,  
to make sure that we can hear about and 
address any matters of concern.
It is important that everyone at Rolls-Royce 
recognises that they are an ambassador for 
the Group. We have set out three common 
behaviours that will make sure we maintain 
high ethical standards, build trust with our 
customers and each other and help secure 
the long-term success of our business:
win right – securing business fair  
and square; 
focus with firm resolve – decide what  
needs to be done, then focus relentlessly  
on delivery – refusing to be distracted;  and 
communicate – simply, consistently  
and often.
Every aspect of the Group’s performance 
results from the endeavours of the 55,000 
men and women who share a vision of 
delivering ‘better power for a changing 
world’. It is their ingenuity and commitment 
alongside our continued investment in 
technology, that allows us to seize the 
opportunities that our changing world 
presents and to face the future with 
confidence.

CUSTOMER OUR STRATEGY
OUR VISION OUR BUSINESS MODEL
Since its earliest days, Rolls-Royce has been striving to 
achieve ever higher standards. Our vision is delivering 
‘better power for a changing world’.
Better: we will succeed only by continually raising 
standards. We constantly improve quality, performance 
and cost. We are inquisitive, energetic and ‘better’ every 
day. Even when we may be the best, we must continue 
to get better.
Power: we are a power systems company that develops, 
sells and services mission-critical products. Our customers 
demand innovation that improves performance and 
reduces the environmental impact of our power systems.
Changing world: the world around is changing 
rapidly and the pace of change is accelerating. New 
markets are emerging, shifting the balance of economic 
power. Regulation is, rightly, driving the requirement for 
cleaner power and setting new standards for business 
conduct. Our continuous investment in technology, our 
ingenuity and our commitment to excellence allow us to 
seize the opportunities that change presents and to face 
the future with confidence.
Better power for a changing world
We operate in competitive markets. Our 
competitors are well-funded, ambitious 
and full of smart people. 
Our strategy will enable us to win by focusing 
on three powerful themes: customer ; 
innovation and profitable growth.
The business model is built around our core strategic themes 
of customer, innovation and profitable growth. We are a power 
systems company based on two technology platforms, gas 
turbines and reciprocating engines. Continuous investment 
in innovation delivers better products and services on behalf 
of customers. This allows us to meet their needs and grow 
profitably to the benefit of our shareholders. 
Around the core strategic themes of the model we:
Grow sales for original equipment and the associated aftermarket 
through developing strong routes to market based on customer 
relationships, understanding and knowledge. Allocate capital 
in a disciplined way, choosing where to grow, and where not to. 
Reduce costs and generate cash, to enable profitable growth from 
our order book and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet. 
Fund research, development, infrastructure and future 
programmes. Our financial resilience and resources provide a 
firm foundation from which to invest. Risk and Revenue Sharing 
Arrangements are a particular feature of the civil aerospace 
sector as a means of sharing risk due to the scale of 
investment  required for large gas turbines.
Our business model places emphasis on reducing 
costs so that we can generate the funds we need 
to deliver our vision of ‘better power for a 
changing world’.
OUR VISION, BUSINESS MODEL, STRATEGY AND VALUES
Rolls-Royce is a global Group, providing integrated power 
solutions for customers in civil and defence aerospace, 
marine, energy and power markets. Our products work 
in mission-critical environments where safety is paramount.

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 8 Strategic report PROFITABLE GROWTH INNOVATION
Innovation: is our lifeblood. 
We must continually innovate 
to remain competitive. To drive 
innovation, we create the right 
environment – curious, 
challenging, unafraid of failure, 
disciplined, open-minded and 
able to change with pace. But 
most importantly, we ensure 
our innovation is relevant to 
our customers’ needs.
Profitable growth: by 
focusing on our customers, 
and offering them a 
competitive portfolio of 
products and services, we 
will create the opportunity 
to grow our market share. Of 
course we have got to make 
sure that we are not just 
growing, but growing 
profitably. That means 
ensuring our costs are 
competitive. We look after 
our cash and we win right.
OUR VALUES
We say we are ‘trusted to deliver 
excellence’, but simply being Rolls-Royce 
does not give us the right to make that 
claim. Trust takes a long time to earn 
and can be lost in an instant.
Trust: is earned by doing what we say 
we will. It demands care, consistency, 
courage and competence. Trust commits 
us to high ethical standards – it is 
central to who and what we are.
Deliver: part of being trusted. We

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 9
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information 2013 was another good year for the Group, 
with significant growth in our order book, 
good growth in underlying revenues and 
profits, coupled with a cash inflow, but as 
ever, there are some areas where progress 
has been slower than I would have liked.  
Our confidence in the future remains high, 
reflected in our increased final payment to 
shareholders but, as you would expect me  
to say, we have more to do on cost and cash 
across the Group to deliver the future 
performance implicit in this confidence.
The results reflect the full consolidation  
of Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG (formerly 
Tognum AG) from 1 January 2013. Previously, 
Tognum was accounted for as a joint venture.
Order intake in the year of £26.9 billion saw 
the order book grow yet again to reach 
record levels. This reflects £2.5 billion from 
Power Systems and £18.9 billion from our 
Civil business reflecting a very successful 
year for the Trent XWB. This vote of 
confidence from our customers gives good 
visibility and underpins our confidence to 
invest for the future. 
Underlying revenues and profit before tax 
increased by 27 per cent and 23 per cent 
respectively. Prior to the impact of 
consolidating Power Systems, underlying 
revenue growth was six per cent and profit 
advanced by 11 per cent. The 11 per cent 
growth in profits reflected strong  
margins in Defence, the benefit of the 
IAE International Aero Engines AG (IAE) 
restructuring which was executed in the 
middle of 2012 and a lower research and 
development charge against profits. Profits 
were adversely impacted by price pressure  
in our Marine business and the pace of cost 
reduction in our Civil business.

*  2012 figures have been restated to reflect the adoption of amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits and the change in accounting 
policy for RRSAs.
Our largest business, Civil aerospace, was 
the backbone of the Group’s order increase 
and saw revenue grow steadily. The installed 
base saw more engines flying more hours. 
Profit benefited from the higher volumes, 
the new IAE trading arrangements and 
higher entry fees from our partners. 
However, our Civil profits were held back by 
higher unit costs where progress has lagged 
our expectations, but the actions we have 
taken in 2013 will yield savings in 2014.
Defence aerospace performed very well  
in 2013, largely due to higher export  
sales and lower research and development 
(R&D) spend. Services held up well, albeit 
with some softness on flying hours of 
military transport aircraft. We expect a 
15-20 per cent decline in both Defence 
revenue and profit in 2014 as we complete 
some major export delivery schedules. We 
expect original equipment revenue to 
decrease by 30-40 per cent due to fewer 
deliveries of engines to power the C130Js, 
V-22 Ospreys and Typhoons, as well as fewer 
Adour engine kits. 
As always, it is important to put this into 
perspective. Our Defence business has had 
two very good years of revenue and profit 
growth. Which means the numbers we are 
guiding for in 2014, bring us back only to 
2011 revenue levels, and we expect growth 
again in 2015. 
Marine’s offshore and merchant markets 
continue to see intense competition driven 
by overcapacity and price pressure. This 
affected the order intake during the year 
that sees order cover for 2014 at a lower level 
than we started 2013. In this challenging 
environment, we made some good progress 
on cost, but have more to do if we are to 
compete more effectively. Our Naval 
business remains stable.
Energy saw some improvement in 2013 and 
we continue to work hard to improve further 
its financial performance.
Power Systems delivered a very strong 
second half performance, contributing 
£2.6 billion to revenue in 2013 (nil in 2012) 
and an underlying profit before tax of 
£257 million (2012 £77 million). We are very 
pleased with Power Systems and it remains a 
key part of our desire to go to market via two 
strong technology platforms: gas turbines 
and reciprocating engines.
Our cost base can be broadly split between 
85 per cent relating directly to our delivered 
product, ten per cent indirect (commercial 
and administration) and five per cent on 
R&D. We continue to push hard on product 
cost as we work with the internal and 
external supply chains and although Civil 
unit costs increased in 2013, we did realise 
improvements in Marine and Energy.  
We expect to see progress across all our 
segments in 2014. In terms of indirect cost, 
we achieved our objectives to reduce 
headcount by 11 per cent, primarily through 
voluntary severance arrangements. After 
taking into account the related restructuring 
costs during the year, the benefits to this 
reduction will be seen in future years. 
We were pleased with the cash inflow  
of £359 million at Group level, prior to 
acquisitions, disposals and foreign exchange, 
which included an inflow of £47 million from 
Power Systems. Net working capital improved 
slightly, reflecting a good second half 
performance on inventory and higher 
deposits, mainly in Civil, flowing from the 
order intake. We made good progress on 
inventory, improving turns from 3 to 3.4 
times (excluding Power Systems), helped by a 
consistent focus in the second half of the year. 
Cost and cash remain areas of intense focus 
going forward.
In terms of financial reporting, please note 
the following:
1.  To better align our reporting structure 
with our organisation, going forward  
we will report as: Aerospace and Marine 
& Industrial Power Systems (MIPS). 
Aerospace comprises Civil aerospace  
and Defence aerospace. MIPS comprises 
our Marine, Power Systems, Energy  
and Nuclear businesses. Our Nuclear 
Submarines business will be reported 
within Energy and Nuclear. We will 
continue to report the same level of 
financial detail for our business segments 
as we normally do.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 10 Strategic report
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW Mark Morris
Chief Financial Officer
development and production phases of the 
contract should be considered separately  
in accounting for the RRSA, which results  
in the entry fee being matched against the 
non-recurring development costs as 
described above. 
The FRC Conduct Committee’s view is that 
the RRSA contract cannot be divided into 
separate development and production 
phases, as the fees and development 
components received by the Group during 
the development phase are exchanged for 
the obligation to pay the supplier a pre-
determined share of any sales receipts 
during the production phase. On this basis 
the entry fees received would be deferred in 
their entirety and recognised over the period 
of production.
The FRC Conduct Committee has confirmed 
that, in view of the change to the policy and 
the additional disclosure we have made, it 
does not intend to pursue its consideration 
of this accounting policy further. We will 
keep the size of the difference under review, 
and do not currently expect the difference 
between the two approaches to become 
material in the foreseeable future.
We consider that the policy we have adopted 
best reflects the commercial effect of the 
agreements and is in accordance with 
Adopted IFRS. So far as we can tell, it is also 
aligned with the approach taken by others  
in our industry under both IFRS and US 
accounting standards (which we believe 
does not conflict with IFRS in this regard). 
Historically, we recognised the entry fee as 
income when received, which we believed 
matched it to the recognition of non-
recurring development costs incurred on 
behalf of the workshare partner. However, 
this did not take account of the fact that  
we capitalise some of our non-recurring 
development costs. Therefore, where we 
capitalise those costs, we will now defer the 
equivalent portion of the entry fee received 
and recognise it as the related costs are 
amortised in the production phase. As 
required by Adopted IFRS, we have made this 
change retrospectively; the impact of the 
change in policy in 2012 has been to increase 
profit before tax by £25 million and to reduce 
net assets at 31 December 2011 and 2012 by 
£184 million and £170 million respectively. 
Had the policy not been amended, profit 
before tax in 2013 would have been 
£39 million higher and at 31 December 2013  
net assets £208 million higher.
Adopted IFRS does not explicitly deal with 
payments of this nature from suppliers and 
so, in developing an accounting treatment 
for entry fees that best reflects the 
commercial objectives of the contractual 
arrangement, we have analysed key features 
of RRSAs in the context of relevant 
accounting pronouncements and have had 
to weigh the importance of each feature  
in faithfully representing the overall 
commercial effect. Consequently this is a 
judgemental area. The judgements we have 
taken in respect of this matter are set out in 
detail in note 1 to the financial statements. 
In summary, our view is that the 
2.  Consistent with past practice and IFRS 
accounting standards, the Group provides 
both reported and underlying figures.  
We believe underlying figures are more 
representative of the trading 
performance, by excluding the impact  
of year end mark-to-market adjustments, 
principally the GBP/USD hedge book. In 
addition, post-retirement financing and 
the effects of acquisition accounting are 
excluded. The adjustments between the 
underlying income statement and the 
reported income statement are set out  
in more detail in note 2 to the financial 
statements. This basis of presentation  
has been applied consistently since the 
transition to IFRS in 2005. 
3.  The Group has changed its accounting 
policy in respect of entry fees arising from 
Risk and Revenue Sharing Arrangements 
(RRSAs) following discussions with the 
Conduct Committee of the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC). This is covered 
further in note 1 to the financial 
statements.
RRSAs with key suppliers are a feature of  
our Civil aerospace business. Under these 
arrangements the workshare partner shares 
in the risks and costs of developing an 
engine and during the production phase, 
supplies components and receives a share  
of the programme revenues over the life  
of the engine programme. The share of 
development costs borne by the workshare 
partner and of the revenues it receives 
reflect the proportionate forecast cost of 
providing their parts compared to the overall 
forecast manufacturing cost of the engine.
The contribution to the development costs  
is achieved by the workshare partner 
performing their own development work, 
providing parts in the development phase 
and paying a non-refundable cash entry  
fee, such that both parties bear their 
proportionate share of the forecast non-
recurring development costs.

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 11
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information Underlying revenue increased £3.3 billion  
to £15.5 billion, of which £2.6 billion was due 
to the inclusion of Rolls-Royce Power Systems 
AG (RRPS) from 1 January 2013. The 
remaining increase (six per cent) reflects a 
seven per cent growth in OE revenue and  
a four per cent increase in services revenue. 
Original equipment performance included 
growth of 21 per cent in Energy, 13 per cent in 
Defence aerospace and 12 per cent in Marine. 
Underlying services revenue continues to 
represent around half (47 per cent) of the 
Group’s underlying revenue. In 2013, services 
revenue grew in all businesses, as the 
installed base of products continued to  
grow and the services network expanded.
Underlying profit before financing  
and taxation increased 22 per cent to 
£1.8 billion, including £190 million from the 
consolidation of RRPS from 1 January 2013. 
Excluding RRPS, the increase was due to a 
number of factors: increased revenue; 
continued strong margins in Defence 
aerospace and the restructured relationship 
with IAE. 
Further discussion of trading is included in 
the business segment reports on pages 14  
to 23.
Underlying financing costs increased 
18 per cent to £72 million, including 
£10 million from RRPS.
Underlying taxation was £434 million,  
an underlying tax rate of 24.7 per cent 
compared with 22.1 per cent in 2012.  
The Group’s tax payments are described  
on page 137.
Underlying EPS increased 10 per cent to 
65.59 pence, lower than the increase in the 
underlying profit after tax due to the NCI 
share of RRPS.
Payments to shareholders: at the AGM on  
1 May 2014, the directors will recommend  
an issue of 134 C Shares with a total nominal 
value of 13.4 pence for each ordinary share. 
Together with the interim issue on 2 January 
2014 of 86 C Shares for each ordinary share 
with a total nominal value of 8.6 pence, this  
is the equivalent of a total annual payment to 
ordinary shareholders of 22.0 pence for each 
ordinary share. Further details are on page 43.
Net underlying R&D charged to the income 
statement increased by 18 per cent to  
£624 million including £174 million from 
RRPS, reflecting a combination of increased 
spend of £33 million offset by higher net 
capitalisation of £61 million (due to the 
phasing of major new programmes,  
in particular the certification of the  
Trent XWB 84k), R&D tax credits of £28 million 
and net deferral of RRSA entry fees of 
£26 million. The Group continues to expect 
net R&D investment to remain within four 
to five per cent of Group underlying revenue.
Reported profit before tax has reduced  
from £2,766 million to £1,759 million. In 
addition to the changes in underlying profit 
before tax described above, reported profit 
before tax has been affected by (i) the 
impact of mark-to-market adjustments on 
derivative contracts (£497 million reduction); 
(ii) the impact of consolidating RRPS 
(£322 million reduction, comprising the 
unrealised profit on reclassification to a 
subsidiary, the additional amortisation  
on recognised intangible assets and the 
revaluation of the put option on NCI);  
(iii) the net impact of disposals (£483 million 
reduction, disposal of RTM322 in 2013 more 
than offset by the restructuring of IAE  
in 2012); and (iv) the cost of providing 
discretionary pension increases (£64 million). 
The reported tax charge is affected by the 
related tax impact of these items and the 
reduction of tax rates in the UK. This is set 
out in more detail in note 2 to the financial 
statements. 
Intangible assets (note 9) represent long-
term assets of the Group. These assets 
increased by £121 million with additional 
development, certification and software 
costs being largely offset by annual 
amortisation charges.
The carrying values of the intangible assets 
are assessed for impairment against the 
present value of forecast cash flows 
generated by the intangible asset. The 
principal risks remain: reductions in assumed 
market share; programme timings; increases 
in unit cost assumptions; and adverse 
movements in discount rates. There have 
been no significant impairments in 2013.
Property, plant and equipment increased  
by £283 million due to the ongoing 
development and refreshment of facilities 
and tooling as the Group prepares for 
increased production volumes.
Net post-retirement scheme deficits  
(note 19) reduced by £100 million as a result 
of adopting the amendments to IAS 19. 
During the year, the net deficit fell by 
£49 million, principally due to the 
movements in the assumptions used to

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 12 Strategic report
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW value the underlying assets and liabilities in 
accordance with IAS 19. This reduction in the 
deficit was after agreeing to fund additional 
pension increases in the Rolls-Royce Pension 
Fund, where there is no indexation for 
pre-1997 service, at a cost of £64 million. 
Overall funding across the schemes has 
improved in recent years as the Group has 
adopted a lower risk investment strategy 
that reduces volatility going forward and 
enables the funding position to remain 
stable: interest rate and inflation risks are 
largely hedged, and the exposure to equities 
is around 11 per cent of scheme assets.
The Group’s funding of its defined benefit 
schemes is expected to increase modestly  
in 2014, largely as a result of funding the 
discretionary benefits.
Net funds increased by £0.6 billion to  
£1.9 billion due in part to the £250 million 
proceeds received on the sale of the Group’s 
interest in the RTM322 engine. Average net 
funds were £350 million.
Investments in joint ventures and 
associates increased by 15 per cent, largely 
as a result of retained profits in existing 
joint ventures.
Provisions largely relate to warranties and 
guarantees provided to secure the sale of  
OE and services.
Net financial assets and liabilities relate to 
the fair value of foreign exchange, commodity 
and interest rate contracts, financial RRSAs 
and the put option on the NCI of Rolls-Royce 
Power Systems Holding GmbH, set out in 
detail in note 17. The change largely reflects 
the inclusion of the put option. There is also 
an impact of the change in the GBP/USD 
exchange rate on the valuation of foreign 
exchange contracts and the movement in  
put options on NCI of £259 million. 
The USD hedge book increased ten per cent
 
to US$24.7 billion. This represents around 
four years of net exposure and has an 
average book rate of £1 to US$1.59. 
Net TotalCare® assets relate to Long-Term 
Service Agreement (LTSA) contracts in the 
Civil aerospace business, including the 
flagship services product TotalCare. These 
assets represent the timing difference 
between the recognition of income and 
costs in the income statement and cash 
receipts and payments.
Customer financing facilitates the sale of OE 
and services by providing financing support 
to certain customers. Where such support  
is provided by the Group, it is generally to 
customers of the Civil aerospace business 
and takes the form of various types of credit 
and asset value guarantees. These exposures 
produce contingent liabilities that are 
outlined in note 18. The contingent liabilities 
represent the maximum aggregate 
discounted gross and net exposure in respect 
of delivered aircraft, regardless of the point 
in time at which such exposures may arise.
During 2013, the Group’s gross exposure 
reduced by £213 million to £356 million, due 
largely to the expiry of guarantees. On a net 
basis, exposures reduced by £11 million.
Segmental reporting
During 2013, we have revised the internal 
structure of the business to focus on 
(i) aerospace; and (ii) marine and industrial 
markets. The internal reporting structure has 
been developed to reflect this. Consequently, 
in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating 
Segments, from 1 January 2014, we will 
report the Group’s segments as follows: 
Aerospace, comprising Civil aerospace and 
Defence aerospace; and 
Marine and Industrial Power Systems, 
comprising Marine, Power Systems, Energy 
and Nuclear.

Group 2014 guidance
For the full year 2014, we expect underlying 
Group revenue and profit to be flat. This 
reflects a significant decline in Defence 
revenue, as we complete the delivery phase 
of a number of major export programmes. 
Additionally, the largest part of our Marine 
business, Offshore, will generate lower 
revenue in 2013. We expect growth to 
resume in 2015 as Civil and Defence 
deliveries increase.
We expect profitability to be much stronger 
in the second half of 2014, reflecting the 
timing and mix of trading and cost 
reduction. To be more consistent with 
market practice, our cash guidance in the 
future will be based on free cash flow. We 
expect our 2014 free cash flow to be similar 
to 2013 (£781 million).

CIVIL AEROSPACE Rolls-Royce powers more 
than 30 types of commercial 
aircraft and has almost 
13,000 engines in service 
around the world.
What we do
The Civil aerospace segment is a major 
manufacturer of aero engines for the  
airliner and corporate jet markets. We have 
particular strengths in the wide-body 
market where Rolls-Royce has a 54 per cent 
share of aircraft on order. Demand for our 
products and services remains robust. 
2013 financial review
The order book increased 22 per cent, 
including new orders of £18.9 billion  
(£10.3 billion in 2012). Trent engines and 
aftermarket services now constitute 
73 per cent of the Civil aerospace order book. 
Revenue increased three per cent, including 
three per cent growth in OE revenue. There 
was a 20 per cent increase in business jet 
engine deliveries and a small increase in 
Trent engines. Profit increased 14 per cent, 
reflecting higher volumes, the £112 million 
higher benefit from the restructured 
trading relationship with IAE and £26 million 
higher RRSA entry fees. 
In 2014, we expect modest growth in 
revenue and good growth in profit. 
How we are performing
The airline industry saw global passenger 
traffic up around five per cent in 2013. 
Airlines in developed markets benefited 
from a modest economic recovery. In many 
developing markets there were significant 
increases in traffic supported by economic 
growth and market liberalisation.
Civil Large Engines: Nearly 1,400 Trent 700 
engines for the Airbus A330 have been 
delivered to date and during 2013 Airbus 
delivered the 1,000th aircraft. The milestone 
aircraft and its Trent 700 engines were 
accepted by Cathay Pacific, the first airline  
to put the Trent 700 into service in 1995.
Important milestones were achieved in  
two major Civil Large Engine programmes.  
In June, the first flight of the new Airbus 
A350 XWB was powered by our Trent XWB 
engines. Then in September, the Boeing 
787-9 version of the Dreamliner took to the 
skies for the first time, powered by our  
Trent 1000 engines. 
Singapore Airlines Group placed a major 
order with us to power 50 Boeing 787 
aircraft with Trent 1000 engines.
In July, we celebrated the first delivery of  
two new Rolls-Royce powered aircraft to the 
British Airways fleet – the Airbus A380 and 
the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. 
In September, we announced that, due to the 
current regulatory environment, we would 
not proceed with a planned joint venture 
with United Technologies Corporation to 
develop an engine to power future mid-size 
aircraft. Rolls-Royce remains fully committed 
to this important market segment and we 
continue to invest in technologies that will 
enable us to take advantage of opportunities 
as they arise.
The Trent XWB will enter service in 2014 
with Qatar Airways. This is the best-selling 
Trent engine yet, with more than 1,600 
engines already on order. 
Significant orders for the Trent XWB came 
from airlines in Europe, North America, the 
Middle East and Asia and these included a 
landmark first ever engine order for  
Rolls-Royce from Japanese airline JAL.
Corporate and regional: In our corporate 
and regional engine business, we delivered 
the 3,000th BR700 series engine. This engine 
series powers the Gulfstream G500 and 
G550, the Bombardier Global 5000 and 
Global 6000 (BR710), the Boeing 717 (BR715) 
and the Gulfstream G650 (BR725).
The first production version of the Cessna 
Citation X business jet flew in August, 
powered by our AE 3007C engines. Deliveries 
of the new aircraft are due to begin in 
early 2014.
Services: Revenue from services for civil 
airliners increased by three per cent in 2013, 
reflecting continued growth in the fleet of 
widebodied engines. More than 1,100 
aircraft in service are covered by TotalCare.
Some 1,500 business aircraft are covered  
by CorporateCare® and in 2013 more than 
70 per cent of customers for new Rolls-Royce 
powered business jets enrolled in 
CorporateCare.
Future priorities and opportunities
In 2014, particular priority will be given to 
supporting the smooth entry into service  
of the Airbus A350 XWB. Rolls-Royce is the 
sole engine supplier for this new aircraft, 
and orders for the Trent XWB represent 
53 per cent of the Civil aerospace order book. 
Significant management attention  
will continue to be paid to financial 
performance, in particular reducing costs 
and improving inventory turn. 
Developing new technology for future 
engine programmes and enhancing existing 
products remains a major priority. 
Market outlook: We estimate that the  
global civil engine market will be worth 
approximately US$1,750 billion over the next 
20 years, with US$1,050 billion being for 
original equipment and US$700 billion of 
aftermarket services. Over half of this value 
comprises engines for twin aisle airliners 
and large business jets, where Rolls-Royce is 
currently the number one engine supplier  
in terms of market share. Our forecasts are 
based on our own internal forecasting tools, 
data from Ascend Online Fleets and airline 
schedules from Official Airline Guide (OAG).

DEFENCE AEROSPACE We are the second largest 
provider of defence  
aero-engine products  
and services globally, with 
around 16,000 engines  
in service with over 160 
military customers in  
more than 100 countries. 
What we do 
Our engines power aircraft in every major 
market sector including transport, combat, 
patrol, trainers, helicopters, and unmanned 
aerial vehicles. 
2013 financial review
The Defence order book declined 21 per cent 
(15 per cent decrease in 2012) reflecting 
continued budgetary pressures on our major 
customers. The net order intake of £1.6 billion 
was five per cent higher than the previous 
year. Revenue increased seven per cent, 
reflecting a 13 per cent increase in OE and a 
two per cent increase in services. Strong OE 
growth was driven by higher export sales, 
particularly of our EJ200 and Adour engine 
programmes. Profit increased 11 per cent due 
to higher volumes and lower R&D spending. 
In 2014, we expect a decline in revenue and 
profit of between 15-20 per cent before 
growth resumes in 2015. This one year 
decline is the consequence of well publicised 
cuts in defence spending among major 
customers, and the completion of the 
delivery phase of a number of major export 
programmes. After two record years, this 
re-basing, supported by cost reduction 
programmes, will position the business well 
for future growth.
How we are performing
2013 was a challenging year as traditional 
markets continued to experience 
unprecedented budgetary pressures. While 
this environment creates risks for existing 
business, it also presents opportunities for 
us to develop innovative solutions to meet 
the evolving needs of our customers. 
Nowhere is this more evident than in  
the area of services where we have the 
opportunity to help customers manage  
their budgets and costs more efficiently.
We also continue to pursue new equipment 
sales opportunities in global markets such 
as Asia and the Middle East where budgets 
are less constrained.
MissionCare contracts worth £492 million 
were secured in 2013. These included the 
first MissionCare contract for the support  
of EJ200 engines in Saudi Arabia. 
In order to get closer to our customers, we 
are expanding our presence at operational 
bases. During 2013, we opened a new 
support facility at RAF Marham in the UK 
and announced another at Tinker Air Force 
Base in the US. 
In-service fleets continue to benefit from 
technology enhancements, with the 
upgraded AE 1107 now providing 17 per cent 
more power for the V-22 Osprey aircraft.  
The latest T56 enhancement kits achieved 
Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) certification 
and recorded their first sales in the US, 
where fuel savings in the US Air Force C-130 
fleet could amount to billions of dollars. 
Our leading position in transport was 
underpinned by the entry into service of  
the A400M powered by TP400 engines, 
broadening our portfolio in a market where 
the Rolls-Royce powered C-130 is the leading 
player. This year we delivered our 1,500th 
AE 2100 engine for the C-130J.
The Rolls-Royce LiftSystem® continued to 
perform well as the F-35B Lightning II 
aircraft expanded its flight test programme 
and deliveries to the US Marine Corps 
accelerated. We delivered the 40th  
Rolls-Royce LiftFan and the 50th 3 Bearing 
Swivel Module (3BSM). 
In order to concentrate our resources on 
markets where we can add greatest value, 
we sold our share in the RTM322 helicopter 
engine programme to Turbomeca, a Safran 
company, in September 2013. To further 
improve efficiency, we have reconfigured 
our organisation to bring us closer to our 
major customers. 
We expect our services business to  
continue to grow as we continue to provide 
customers with greater capability.
Future priorities and opportunities
We are focused on managing costs to ensure 
we maximise our ability to compete and win 
in an increasingly uncertain market. 
Our inclusion in the Hawk Advanced Jet 
Training System team to pursue the US Air 
Force T-X training contract provides just one 
of several paths to growth. Customers also 
continue to invest in their transport aircraft 
fleets, where we have a strong position. 
Defence applications for the Trent 700  
should increase as the Airbus A330 tanker 
aircraft is selected by more military 
customers. The UK’s fleet of tankers 
continues to expand with Rolls-Royce 
benefiting both as the engine supplier  
and as an AirTanker shareholder.
Market outlook: We estimate a business 
opportunity over the next 20 years of 
US$155 billion in original equipment and 
US$260 billion in services. Source: Forecast 
International 2014.

natural gas (LNG). 
2013 financial review
The order book increased one per cent 
including new orders of £2.7 billion 
(£3.3 billion in 2012). In 2013, we saw stable 
order inflow in our Merchant and Naval 
businesses. This was offset by weaker  
order flow in Offshore, where the phasing  
of projects has slowed growth in some of our 
key products. Revenue increased 12 per cent, 
reflecting higher sales in both new 
equipment and in services. Growth was 
particularly strong in Offshore and in Naval, 
offset by further weakening in our Merchant 
business, which declined 11 per cent. Profit 
decreased four per cent as volume growth 
was more than offset by pricing pressure 
and a less favourable mix. In 2013, 
profitability was also offset by investments 
in Marine to better position the business for 
future growth, including higher spending on 
R&D and restructuring costs. 
In 2014, we expect a modest decline in 
revenue, with a modest increase in profit. 
The nuclear submarine business will be 
reported in the Energy and Nuclear segment 
going forward.
How we are performing
The global shipbuilding industry has had  
a challenging year. Important factors driving  
the market continue to be ship efficiency, 
environmental performance and value 
for money. 
Merchant: The adoption of LNG as a marine 
fuel is gaining momentum: the first 
LNG-powered cargo vessel of our Environship 
design took to the seas in May; the world’s 
first LNG-powered cruise ferry entered 
service during the summer; and the world’s 
first LNG-powered tug boat was delivered. 
We also won our first contract to convert a 
diesel-powered cargo ship to LNG. Bergen 
engines using LNG fuel are all provided via 
the Power Systems business segment.
Naval: Our MT30 gas turbine was 
successfully installed in the Royal Navy’s new 
aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth. The 
MT30 was also selected by BAE Systems for 
the UK’s new Type 26 Frigate programme and 
has now been selected by navies in the UK, 
US and South Korea, across five types of ship. 
We delivered a new design of water jet to the 
US Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship programme.
This year we opened a new facility in Derby, 
UK, to support our Submarine business. In 
February, we agreed an £800 million 
contract with the MoD for the provision of 
nuclear propulsion systems for the UK’s 
submarine flotilla. A critical design gate was 
successfully passed by our new nuclear plant 
design, PWR 3. 
Offshore: We delivered one of our most 
advanced vessels to date, when a UT 830 
seismic survey ship was launched. It features 
a wealth of Rolls-Royce equipment 
integrated into our own vessel design.  
It is now at work identifying oil and gas 
reserves around the world. 
Our wave-piercing hull design was chosen for 
the first time in Asia, when Chinese customer 
COSCO announced an order for two UT 
vessels, with options for four more. These will 
feature a range of Rolls-Royce equipment, 
and include MTU diesel gensets from our 
Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG subsidiary. 
Several contracts were won to supply our 
largest azimuth thrusters for drill ships. 
We enhanced our technology portfolio 
through the acquisition of a Norwegian 
company, SmartMotor AS, a leader in 
permanent magnet technology. 
Services: We offer customers a global  
service capability through a network of 37 
workshops in 28 countries. With more than 
1,100 service engineers, we provide round-
the-clock support wherever our customers 
need it and offer not only repair and overhaul 
but also a growing number of vessel 
upgrades to improve efficiency. We also train 
our customers in the operation of our 
equipment in our training centres in Norway, 
Singapore and Brazil. This year, we opened 
our third workshop in southern China. 
Future priorities and opportunities
The key priorities for the Marine segment 
are to increase our competitiveness in a 
challenging market and continue to develop 
innovative technologies. 
We will continue to develop the synergies 
between the Marine and Power Systems 
segments. We are working with a number  
of oil majors, in developing the availability  
of LNG. The aftermarket offers growth 
opportunities as we continue to utilise  
our growing global network of service 
engineers and workshops. In Submarines, 
our focus is on maintaining customer 
confidence by achieving our savings 
commitment to the MoD through  
increased operational efficiency. 
Market outlook: We see a business 
opportunity over the next 20 years of 
US$270 billion for original equipment and 
US$125 billion for services (not including 
nuclear submarine business). Based on our 
own forecasting tools.

ENERGY Energy has sold 4,600 gas 
turbines with 180 million 
operating hours recorded. 
Rolls-Royce has over 
50 years of experience 
in the nuclear industry.
What we do
Our Energy segment supplies customers 
with aero-derivative gas turbines, 
compressors and related services. 
In Civil Nuclear, we provide products and 
services spanning the nuclear reactor 
life-cycle from concept design and 
installation to obsolescence management 
and plant life extension. We have a strong 
position in nuclear instrumentation and 
control systems.
2013 financial review
The order book increased by 14 per cent 
with new orders of £1.1 billion (£0.8 billion 
in 2012). The business saw a strong recovery 
in order intake in oil and gas. Power 
generation markets remain suppressed. 
In Civil Nuclear, we continue to extend the 
suite of products and services that we offer 
to nuclear utilities to enable them to achieve 
safe, efficient and reliable lifetime reactor 
operations. Revenue increased nine per cent, 
driven by higher OE volumes in our oil and 
gas business. Profit increased by £7 million, 
reflecting higher volumes, partially offset 
by strong pricing pressure and continued 
investment in our Civil Nuclear business. 
We continue to work to improve the 
financial performance of the business. 
In 2014, Energy will include nuclear 
submarines to form our Energy and Nuclear 
business. We expect good growth in revenue 
and profit, with further improvement in the 
return on sales. 
How we are performing
Oil and gas: In total, 33 RB211 gas turbines 
were ordered for oil and gas applications, 
22 of which were for pipeline compression 
projects. This includes a US$175 million 
contract from Asia Gas Pipeline for 12 units.
Our new purpose-built packaging, assembly 
and test facility in Santa Cruz, Brazil, became 
operational and the first units were delivered 
to Petrobras for use in its deepwater offshore 
production activities.
Power generation: Demand continued to be 
subdued for new power generation capacity 
in mature economies. Seven Trent 60 units 
were ordered, including five for the SARB 
offshore oilfield project in the UAE.
We released enhanced power ratings for 
the Trent 60 gas turbine, consolidating 
its position as the most powerful aero 
derivative available.
Services: We continue to strengthen both our 
aftermarket products and services capability 
as well as our penetration of the installed 
fleet, resulting in a six per cent year-on-year 
increase in aftermarket revenue. 
Currently 24 per cent of the core engine 
fleet is under long-term service agreements. 
During the year we received several new major 
service contracts including a US$138 million 
five-year contract from Petrobras to support 
15 of its RB211 industrial gas turbine power 
generation units installed on four oil 
platforms operating in the Campos Basin.
Civil Nuclear: We strengthened our strategic 
relationships during the year with AREVA, 
Westinghouse, Hitachi, EDF and Rosatom. 
Our acquisition of PKMJ Technical Services 
in the US means we now provide services to 
every nuclear utility in the US and Canada. 
We continued to deliver the instrumentation 
and control (I&C) upgrade for EDF’s fleet of 
1,300MW nuclear reactors in France and 
provided I&C systems and components for 
seven new nuclear reactors currently under 
construction in China.
Future priorities and opportunities
Our focus is on growing our market position 
in oil and gas, including opportunities in 
pipelines and LNG. In power generation, we 
will benefit from any recovery in industrial 
demand for electricity.
In Civil Nuclear our priorities will continue 
to be satisfying our customers, winning new 
orders and high-quality delivery. Improving 
operational efficiency will be a key feature 
for the Nuclear business during 2014. 
We will assess potential investments in 
high-value manufacturing in order to 
contribute positively to a successful new 
build programme for the UK.
In international markets, we will extend the 
suite of products and services that we offer 
to nuclear utilities to enable them to achieve 
safe, efficient and reliable lifetime nuclear 
reactor operations.
Market outlook: In the oil and gas, and 
power generation sectors, the Group’s 
20-year forecast values demand for total 
aero-derivative gas turbine and compressor 
systems at more than US$60 billion and 
associated services at around US$60 billion. 
Sources: McCoy Power reports, LEK Consulting, 
Booz & Co., IEA, Infield Systems and our own 
forecasting tools. We estimate a demand for 
nuclear mission-critical equipment, systems, 
engineering and support services of 
US$610 billion over the next 20 years. 
Based on nuclear capacity forecasts from 
the International Energy Agency, the World 
Nuclear Association, the International

final quarter of 2013 saw strong sales, driven 
by the pre-purchase of engines for industrial, 
including agricultural, applications ahead of 
the introduction of tighter environmental 
standards in Europe. Marine revenue is well 
supported by demand from navies in Asia 
and the US. In defence, major programmes to 
power military tanks provide stability despite 
continued pressure on government spending. 
Revenue decreased 0.5 per cent with good 
growth in the Marine and Industrial  
divisions offset by lower revenue in oil  
and gas, medium-speed engines and  
lower aftermarket sales. Profit increased 
0.3 per cent, reflecting a strong second half. 
The Fjord Line shipping company ordered 
Bergen gas-powered engines. Its 
Stavangerfjord and Bergensfjord cruise 
ferries, both 170 metres long, are each to be 
equipped with four Bergen B-gas engines. 
The engines ensure that these ships already 
meet future IMO Tier III limits as well as 
satisfying mandatory EU regulations 
projected for 2015, for sulphur emissions 
from ferries.
In addition to these contract wins, we 
continue to build capacity through joint 
ventures and partnerships. L’Orange has 
established a consortium with Hoerbiger, for 
the supply of equipment for large-scale diesel 
and dual-fuel engines for the Asian market. 
Onsite Energy and regional Polish energy 
supplier Kogeneracja Zachód intend to form  
a partnership for the supply and maintenance 
of cogeneration plants. Over the coming years, 
both companies plan on working exclusively 
with each other to supply small- to medium-
sized Polish cities with environmentally-
friendly energy from CHP plants.
Future priorities and opportunities
Our long-term growth relies on five pillars: 
power; propulsion; services; regional 
expansion and, the product portfolio.
In 2014, we expect most markets to stabilise. 
although some segments are expected to 
remain difficult. This leads us to expect 
continued volatility in revenues. Overall we 
expect to see a positive performance 
primarily driven by marine applications.
We will invest in future technologies to 
maintain our technological leadership. We are 
configuring our different engine series to 
meet tougher emission standards. At the same 
time we will improve efficiency and keep a 
focus on costs and cash in all other areas.
Market outlook: We estimate the total 
market opportunity for high-speed engine 
original equipment over the next ten years 
to be €280 billion. The forecast data is taken 
from a range of sources including: Global 
Insight; Oxford Economics, Diesel and Gas 
Turbine Worldwide, Clarkson Research and 
our own internal forecasting tools.
In 2014, we expect modest growth in revenue 
and good growth in profit driven by growth 
in marine and land power systems markets.
How we are performing
2013 proved a challenging year. Headwinds 
confronting the business included the 
Eurozone crisis, US fiscal challenges and 
slowing of growth in emerging countries. 
General nervousness about the global 
economic environment led to constrained 
order activity within the market.
Despite these adverse market conditions, a 
number of significant orders and contracts 
were achieved.
As outlined in the Marine segment review, 
Power Systems also benefited from contracts 
awarded by Chinese customer COSCO and 
from the UK MoD for the generator sets of  
the Royal Navy’s future Type 26 Frigate. The  
Type 26 propulsion system will consist of a 
combination of four MTU diesel gensets and a 
Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbine. These examples 
highlight the synergies and benefits of 
complementary product portfolios.
MTU introduced the upgraded Series 1163 
marine engines for IMO Tier II and IMO  
Tier III emission standards. These are cleaner 
and more fuel-efficient than the previous 
generation and offer a better power-to-
weight ratio.
For the British Intercity Express Programme, 
MTU received orders of rail Powerpacks with 
Series 1600 engines. The Powerpacks will 
drive Hitachi’s future high-speed trains 
which are scheduled to go into service from 
2017 on Great Western Main Line and East 
Coast Main Line routes. Twenty locomotives 
built by Chinese manufacturer, Dalian 
Locomotive & Rolling Stock and powered by 
MTU engines went into service in Argentina.
China-based Xiangtan Electric Manufacturing 
Corporation shipped its first ever export of 
mine dump trucks to the Pilbara mine site  
in Australia for Rio Tinto. Each of the 230 
metric -ton trucks is powered by an MTU 
mining engine.

Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information In 2013, we invested £1,118 million in gross 
research and development (R&D) of which 
£746 million was funded by the Group, prior 
to receipts from risk and revenue sharing 
arrangements. 
We continually pursue innovation that will 
improve the performance of our power 
systems and benefit our customers. 
We have developed and actively deployed 
a new innovation portal to improve the 
exchange of ideas around the world as we 
invest to improve the efficiency of our 
global R&D footprint.
People
We have an engineering resource inside the 
Group of around 16,600 engineers. Many 
work as integrated teams across borders on 
our major programmes and a number of our 
top engineers, or Rolls-Royce Fellows, are 
recognised as world-renowned experts in 
their fields.
We continued our commitment to recruit 
and develop the very best engineers and 
scientists, and the first cohort of our 
evolving internal Specialist Academy has 
graduated in October 2013. The Academy 
has been designed for technologists who 
have the potential to join the Rolls-Royce 
Fellowship at the very top of our specialist 
career ladder.
Research and technology
World-class technology gives us competitive 
product performance. We generate the 
largest number of patents of any UK 
company, 549 new patent applications were 
approved for filing in 2013 (including 
Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG). To further 
expand our capabilities, we acquired 
Hyper-Therm HTC, a US-based specialist 
in ceramic materials; and SmartMotor, a 
world leader in permanent-magnet machines 
and drives technology, headquartered in 
Norway. In addition, we acquired from GKN 
the 49 per cent of Composite Technology 
and Applications Limited (CTAL) that we 
did not already own, giving us 100 per cent 
ownership. CTAL is engaged in the 
development of composite fan blades and 
containment cases for the next generation 
of advanced turbofan engines.
In 2013, we further increased our 
investment in early-stage research and 
technology to about 20 per cent of the net 
R&D spend. We have good visibility of stable, 
long-term government match-funding for 
research investments in aerospace 
technologies following the creation in the 
UK of the Aerospace Technology Institute, 
and in the EU through the Clean Sky 2 Joint 
Technology Initiative in Horizon 2020 and 
continuous German support via
Luftfahrtforschungsprogramm (LuFo) V. 
University Technology Centres
In addition to our significant in-house R&D 
capability, we pursue advanced technologies 
via a global network of 29 University 
Technology Centre (UTC) partnerships. 
Each centre is part-funded by the Group and 
works closely with our engineering teams, 
undertaking specialist work led by world-
class academics. In 2013, Nanyang 
Technological University joined this network 
with the launch of the Rolls-Royce@NTU 
Corporate Lab, a joint investment of 
SGD$75 million (£38.5 million) between 
Rolls-Royce, Nanyang University and the 
National Research Foundation (NRF) 
of Singapore. 
Our model of developing technology 
through collaboration with academia 
and other partners was recognised by the 
German Fraunhofer Institute for Production 
Technology which benchmarked 160 
European companies: Rolls-Royce was one 
of five companies to receive the ‘Successful 
Practices’ award in technology 
management in 2013.
Research and development
Flight test results have shown the Trent XWB 
to be the world’s most efficient large, civil, 
aero engine. 
The Trent 1000 Package C received EASA 
certification in September and a few weeks 
later powered the newest version of the 
Dreamliner, the Boeing 787-9 on its first 
flight from Seattle, USA.
The Joint Strike Fighter F-35B, with short take 
-off and vertical landing (STOVL) capability 
provided by the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem®, 
successfully completed its second set of 
carrier trials aboard the USS Wasp in August 
2013. In September, the T56 engine Series 3.5 
technology enhancement program received 
FAA approval and has now been chosen to 
power the ‘Hurricane Hunter’ aircraft of 
the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration.
In 2013, we received the Green Ship 
Technology Award for our Environship 
concept – a design for cargo ships that 
reduces CO 2 emissions by up to 40 per cent 
compared to similar diesel powered vessels.

also supporting a £76 million Sharing in 
Growth programme in the nuclear industry.
We continue to seek new capabilities in 
emerging markets across the world through 
our supplier development groups. These help 
drive competition with our existing internal 
plants and suppliers, and also allow us to 
develop new markets – Brazil (Energy) and 
China (Marine) being good examples. We 
expect the proportion of our supplier spend 
in emerging markets to increase. 
Information technology 
In 2013, we invested over £100 million in IT, 
continuing with the modernisation of our 
IT infrastructure and also launching our Shop 
Floor IT modernisation programme. We have 
launched an Integrated Production Systems 
programme to address the need for 
simplified, globally scalable and secure 
systems. The programme will improve 
delivery to the customer whilst improving 
efficiency and reducing operating costs. We 
are also investing in our customer systems 
to improve the customer experience through 
the use of portals and digital workflow.

Expenditure in 2013 on property, plant 
and equipment.
We are delivering customer and business 
benefits as we continue to invest at record 
levels and transform our industrial 
infrastructure.
Our teams around the world focus on 
improvement in all the classical operational 
metrics – safety, quality, cost, on-time 
delivery, inventory – while at the same time 
ensuring that the next generation of 
advanced products and processes are 
successfully industrialised. 
Our operations employ 25,000 people in 
17 countries at 85 Rolls-Royce facilities. 
In addition, 33 joint venture facilities, seven 
manufacturing technology partnerships 
and over 70 significant suppliers help us 
to meet customer demand. 
Developing our capacity
This year we have extended our own 
capacity and capability. This included our 
new turbine blade factory in Rotherham, 
UK and our new 17,000 square metre, 
state-of-the-art discs manufacturing facility 
in Washington, UK, that has now started 
production. When fully operational later this 
year, it will have the capacity to manufacture 
over 2,000 fan and turbine discs annually. 
We are also taking steps to adjust capacity 
where market segments are contracting or 
demanding a lower price point. Although 
our diverse portfolio helps us balance 
growing and shrinking segments, we do 
expect an ongoing need to adjust capacity 
through plant renewal and closures. 
Advanced manufacturing
We apply advanced technologies, methods 
and processes to deliver ‘best in class’ 
manufacturing performance through our 
Rolls-Royce Production System and the 
Advanced Manufacturing network, which 
has developed over the past five years.
The advanced centres in this network bring 
together university, government and 
industrial partners to provide a realistic 
testing ground for new industrial techniques 
that improve yield and reduce costs. These 
have proved to be successful both for 
Rolls-Royce and our supplier partners.
The Advanced Forming Research Centre in 
Glasgow, UK, the National Composites 
Centre in Bristol, UK and the Manufacturing 
Technology Centre in Coventry, UK, are 
expanding their facilities and the new 
Commonwealth Centre for Advanced 
Manufacturing in Richmond, USA, is now 
fully operational. 
Our future Advanced Remanufacturing 
and Technology Research Centre in Singapore 
and High Temperature Components Centre 
of Excellence in the UK will ensure we lead 
in high-performance, low-emission turbine 
technology.
Our processes will increasingly include 
powder-based manufacturing, additive layer 
manufacturing technologies and ultra-high 
temperature materials. ‘Knowledge-based 
manufacturing’ is another developing area. 
Here, we will use dynamic computer models 
to design and verify processes. These 
approaches will increase design flexibility, 
speed of manufacture and performance.
Suppliers 
Strong relationships with our suppliers are 
critical to our performance. We work closely 
to align our strategies as well as assessing 
performance through our Supplier Advanced 
Business Relationship (SABRE) requirements.
Rolls-Royce has taken a leading role in the 
establishment of the Aerospace Engine 
Supplier Quality Committee. Through this 
body, gas turbine engine makers and their 
suppliers – with input from regulatory 
agencies – aim to agree a set of common 
industry-wide standards. These will help 
remove variability and waste, enabling the 
aerospace supply chain to be leaner and 
more competitive.
To support UK suppliers in the global 
aerospace market, Rolls-Royce is sponsoring 
the UK Government-backed Sharing in 
Growth programme. It is a £110 million

Improving operational performance
Improving the environmental performance 
of our operations contributes to profitable 
growth. We have set a three-year target  
to reduce energy consumption by ten per cent 
by the end of 2015, with 2012 as the baseline 
year excluding product test and development 
and normalised by revenue.
Our energy use increased slightly in 2013, 
reflecting our increased levels of activity, 
but we are on track to reduce our overall 
emissions of greenhouse gases. We continue 
to invest in improvements to our facilities. 
Our total spend in 2013 amounted to almost 
£3 million on projects, including upgrades  
to compressed air systems, lighting systems 
and controls, and additional energy 
monitoring capability in our plants and 
offices. We are seeking to make wider  
use of more sustainable energy sources, 
where cost effective and practical to do so.

substitution and phase out programmes. 
Greenhouse gas emissions
In 2013, our total greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from our facilities, processes, 
product test and development was 
520 kilotonnes carbon dioxide equivalent 
(ktCO 2e). This represents a reduction of 
nine per cent compared with 572 ktCO 2e  
in 2009 (see table). This reduction has been 
achieved, despite a growth in our global 
facilities footprint. We have introduced a 
longer term GHG target over ten years, 
aimed at reducing emissions by 17 per cent 
by the end of 2022 (baselined at 2012), 
excluding product test and development.
The figures in the table do not include 
emissions associated with Rolls-Royce Power 
Systems AG. We expect to integrate this 
subsidiary into our reporting process  
during 2014. Power generation relates  
to the operation of commercial gas-fired  
power stations.
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard  
(revised edition) data gathered to fulfil our 
requirements under the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency 
scheme, and the UK Government’s GHG 
reporting guidance as the basis of our 
methodology and source of emissions factors 
for Company reporting for 2013. Further 
details on our methodology can be found 
within our ‘Basis of Reporting’, available at 
www.rolls-royce.com/sustainability.
Safety
We are committed to continually improving 
the standards of health and safety in the 
workplace. We have steadily improved 
performance over previous years. In 2013, 
there were no fatalities or significant 
injuries and we achieved a 17 per cent 
reduction in the Total Reportable Injury (TRI) 
rate from 0.54 in 2012 to 0.45 TRIs per 100 
employees. Over the longer term, we have 
reduced the TRI rate by 37 per cent since 
2009. We have set a new target to reduce 
TRIs per 100 employees by 15 per cent by 
2015 (baselined at 2012). 
We continue to analyse high-potential 
incidents and each of them is investigated  
at business segment level, with some also 
included in Group level assessment. The 
number of high-potential incidents has 
declined slightly from previous years and  
the number of ‘near misses’ reported has 
significantly increased. The increased level 
of near miss reporting reflects greater risk 
awareness, overall proactive reporting,  
risk based investigation and other 
improvements. These contribute to both  
TRI and high potential incident reductions. 
Throughout the year, we continued several 
global safety improvement plans. The 
Electrical and Process Safety programmes 
included site reviews and training and tools 
for ensuring efficient implementation of 
control measures. Reviews have also been 
carried out on the use and control of 
exposure to a number of chemicals newly-
regulated under the REACH regulations. 
These reviews confirmed that our controls 
are suitable and that they ensure 
occupational exposures and releases to the 
environment are within limits set by the 
new requirements. 
Health
The current incidence of occupational illness 
stands at 0.86 cases per 1,000 employees. 
The leading causes of illness are noise-
induced hearing loss, work-related upper 
limb disorders and stress. This reflects our 
global health risk profile and provides the 
focus for our health improvement activities.
Following a prosecution in the UK by the 
Health and Safety Executive for one case  
of Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS), 
independent advice was sought from the  
UK Health and Safety Laboratory and we are 
continuing to strengthen our management 
of HAVS.

Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Board uses a range of financial and non-financial 
indicators to monitor Group and segmental performance 
in line with the strategy.
Financial indicators are shown below. The key objectives of the Board and its committees are described on pages 
39 to 54 and non-financial key performance indicators are shown in the sustainability section on pages 26 to 29.
Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG (RRPS), formerly Tognum AG, was fully consolidated from 1 January 2013. 
To aid understanding, the impact on 2013 of consolidation has been displayed separately below.
The order book provides an indicator of future business. 
It is measured at constant exchange rates and list prices and 
includes both firm and announced orders. In Civil aerospace, 
it is common for a customer to take options for future 
orders in addition to firm orders placed. Such options are 
excluded from the order book. In Defence aerospace, 
long-term programmes are often ordered for only one year 
at a time. In such circumstances, even though there may be 
no alternative engine choice available to the customer, only 
the contracted business is included in the order book. Only 
the first seven years’ revenue of long-term aftermarket 
contracts is included.

Order intake is a measure of new business secured during 
the year and represents new firm orders, net of the 
movement in the announced order book between the start 
and end of the period. Any orders which were recorded in 
previous periods and which are subsequently cancelled, 
reducing the order book, are included as a reduction to 
intake. Order intake is measured at constant exchange rates 
and list prices and consistent with the order book policy of 
recording the first seven years’ revenue of long-term 
aftermarket contracts. Order intake for any given year 
includes the seventh year of revenue. 
Monitoring of revenues provides a measure of business 
growth. Underlying revenue is used in order to eliminate the 
effect of the decision not to adopt hedge accounting and to 
provide a clearer year-on-year measure. 
The Group measures foreign currency revenue at the actual 
exchange rate achieved as a result of settling foreign 
exchange contracts from forward cover.

Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 30 Strategic report Underlying profit before financing is presented on a basis 
that shows the economic substance of the Group’s hedging 
strategies in respect of the transactional exchange rate and 
commodity price movements. In particular: (a) revenues and 
costs denominated in US dollars and euros are presented on 
the basis of the exchange rates achieved during the year; 
(b) similar adjustments are made in respect of commodity 
derivatives; and (c) consequential adjustments are made to 
reflect the impact of exchange rates on trading assets and 
liabilities and long-term contracts on a consistent basis.

The Group reports the balance of net funds/debt on a 
weekly basis and average cash is therefore the average of 
these weekly net balances. These balances are reported at 
prevailing exchange rates and in recent periods, year-on-
year movements in average cash balances reflect the 
significant acquisitions and disposals which have taken 
place, most notably RRPS in 2011 and IAE restructuring in 
2012. The impact on average cash balances will depend on 
when these transactions took place during the year.
In a business requiring significant investment, the Board 
monitors cash flow to ensure that profitability is converted 
into cash generation, both for future investment and as a 
reward for shareholders. The Group measures cash flow as 
the movement in net funds/debt during the year, after 
taking into account the value of derivatives held to hedge 
the value of balances denominated in foreign currencies.
The figure for 2011 includes investment of £1,496 million 
in RRPS.
R&D is measured as the self-funded expenditure both 
before amounts capitalised in the year and amortisation of 
previously-capitalised balances. The Group expects to spend 
approximately five per cent of revenues on R&D although 
this proportion will fluctuate depending on the stage of 
development of current programmes. This measure reflects 
the need to generate current returns as well as to invest for 
the future.

Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Group places great importance on the identification and effective 
management of risks. Our approach to enterprise risk management 
helps us to deliver our objectives and maximise the returns of the Group.
The following table describes the risks that the risk committee, with endorsement from the Board, considers to have the most material 
potential impact on the Group. They are specific to the nature of our business notwithstanding that there are other risks that may occur 
and may impact the achievement of the Group’s objectives.
The risk committee discussions have been focused on these risks and the actions being taken to manage them.
Risk or uncertainty and potential impact How we manage it
PRODUCT FAILURE
Product not meeting safety expectations, or causing 
significant impact to customers or the environment 
through failure in quality control.
 Operating a safety first culture
 Our engineering design and validation process is applied from initial 
design, through production and into service
 The safety committee reviews the scope and effectiveness of the Group’s 
product safety policies to ensure that they operate to the highest 
industry standards (see safety committee report on page 52)
 A safety management system (SMS) has been established by a dedicated 
team. This is governed by the Product Safety Review Board and is subject 
to continual improvement based on experience and industry best 
practice. Product safety training is an integral part of our SMS
 Crisis management team led by the Director – Engineering and 
Technology or General Counsel as appropriate
BUSINESS CONTINUITY
Breakdown of external supply chain or internal facilities 
that could be caused by destruction of key facilities, 
natural disaster, regional conflict, financial insolvency 
of a critical supplier or scarcity of materials which would 
reduce the ability to meet customer commitments, 
win future business or achieve operational results.
 Continued investment in adequate capacity and modern equipment 
and facilities (see operations section on page 25)
 Identifying and assessing points of weakness in our internal 
and external supply chain, our IT systems and our people skills
 Selection and development of stronger suppliers (see operations 
section on page 25)
 Developing dual sources or dual capability 
 Developing and testing site-level incident management and business 
recovery plans
 Crisis management team led by the Director – Engineering and 
Technology or General Counsel as appropriate
 Customer excellence centres provide improved response to supply 
chain disruption
COMPETITOR ACTION
The presence of large, financially strong competitors 
in the majority of our markets means that the Group 
is susceptible to significant price pressure for original 
equipment or services even where our markets are mature 
or the competitors are few. Our main competitors have 
access to significant government funding programmes 
as well as the ability to invest heavily in technology 
and industrial capability. 
 Accessing and developing key technologies and service offerings 
which differentiate us competitively (see engineering and technology 
section on page 24)
 Focusing on being responsive to our customers and improving 
the quality, delivery and reliability of our products and services
 Partnering with others effectively
 Driving down cost and improving margins (see Chief Executive’s review 
on pages 6 and 7 and Chief Financial Officer’s review on page 10) 
 Protecting credit lines (see additional financial information on 
pages 137 and 138)
 Investing in innovation, manufacturing and production (see operations 
section on page 25)
 Understanding our competitors
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 32 Strategic report Risk or uncertainty and potential impact How we manage it
INTERNATIONAL TRADE FRICTION
Geopolitical factors that lead to significant tensions 
between major trading parties or blocs which could 
impact the Group’s operations. For example: explicit 
trade protectionism; differing tax or regulatory regimes; 
potential for conflict; or broader political issues.
 Where possible, locating our domestic facilities in politically stable 
countries and/or ensuring that we maintain dual capability
 Diversifying global operations to avoid excessive concentration 
of risks in particular areas
 Network of regional directors proactively monitors local situations
 Maintaining a balanced business portfolio in markets with high 
technological barriers to entry and a diverse customer base
 Understanding our supply chain risks
 Proactively influencing regulation where it affects us (see sustainability 
on page 28)
MAJOR PRODUCT PROGRAMME DELIVERY
Failure to deliver a major product programme on time, 
to specification or technical performance falling 
significantly short of customer expectations would have 
potentially significant adverse financial and reputational 
consequences, including the risk of impairment of the 
carrying value of the Group’s intangible assets and the 
impact of potential litigation.
 Major programmes are subject to Board approval (see additional 
financial information on page 137)
 Major programmes are reviewed at levels and frequencies appropriate 
to their performance against key financial and non-financial 
deliverables and potential risks throughout a programme’s life cycle 
(see additional financial information on page 137)
 Technical audits are conducted at pre-defined points performed 
by a team that is independent from the programme
 Programmes are required to address the actions arising from reviews 
and audits and progress is monitored and controlled through to closure
 Knowledge management principles are applied to provide benefit to 
current and future programmes
COMPLIANCE
Non-compliance by the Group with legislation or other 
regulatory requirements in the regulated environment in 
which it operates (for example: export controls; offset; use 
of controlled chemicals and substances; and anti-bribery 
and corruption legislation) compromising our ability to 
conduct business in certain jurisdictions and exposing 
the Group to potential: reputational damage; financial 
penalties; debarment from government contracts for 
a period of time; and/or suspension of export privileges 
or export credit financing, any of which could have 
a material adverse effect.
 An uncompromising approach to compliance is now, and should 
always be, the only way to do business
 The Group has an extensive compliance programme. This programme 
and the Global Code of Conduct are promulgated throughout the Group 
and are updated and reinforced from time-to-time, to ensure their 
continued relevance, and to ensure that they are complied with both 
in spirit and to the letter. The Global Code of Conduct and the Group’s 
compliance programme are supported by appropriate training 
(see ethics committee report on pages 49 and 50) 
 A legal and compliance team has been put in place to manage the 
current specific issue (see ethics committee on pages 49 and 50) 
through to a conclusion and beyond
 Lord Gold has reviewed the Group’s current compliance procedures 
and an improvement plan is being implemented

MARKET SHOCK
The Group is exposed to a number of market risks, some 
of which are of a macro-economic nature, for example, 
foreign currency exchange rates, and some which are more 
specific to the Group, for example liquidity and credit risks, 
reduction in air travel or disruption to other customer 
operations. Significant extraneous market events could 
also materially damage the Group’s competitiveness and/
or credit worthiness. This would affect operational results 
or the outcomes of financial transactions.
 Maintaining a strong balance sheet, through healthy cash balances 
and a continuing low level of debt
 Providing financial flexibility by maintaining high levels of liquidity 
and an investment grade ‘A’ credit rating (see additional financial 
information on page 138)
 The portfolio effect from our business interests, both in terms of 
original equipment to aftermarket split and our different segments 
provide a natural shock absorber since the portfolios are not correlated
 Deciding where and what currencies to source in, where and how much 
credit risk is extended or taken and hedging residual risk through the 
financial derivatives markets (foreign exchange, interest rates and 
commodity price risk – see additional financial information on page 137)
IT VULNERABILITY
Breach of IT security causing controlled data to 
be lost, made inaccessible, corrupted or accessed 
by unauthorised users.
 Establishing ‘defence in depth’ through deployment of multiple 
layers of software and processes including web gateways, filtering, 
firewalls, intrusion, advanced persistent threat detectors and 
integrated reporting
 Security and network operations centres have been established
 Active sharing of information through industry, government and 
security forums (see risk committee report on page 51)
The strategic report was approved by the Board on 12 February 2014.

Nigel T Goldsworthy
Company Secretary
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 34 Strategic report
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES As Chairman, I am responsible for leading the Board and for 
ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role. Strong 
governance is vital to this and I was reassured, when I joined 
Rolls-Royce, to find a robust governance foundation already in place. 
The challenge ahead is to build upon this foundation and ensure 
that the Group’s values ‘trusted to deliver excellence’ apply not just 
to our products but also to the way that we conduct and govern our 
business.
Governance structure
In November, I led a discussion on governance with the non-
executive directors. We will regularly review and develop our 
governance arrangements to ensure that the right decisions are 
made by the right people.
My instinct from my discussions to date is to allow as much time 
as possible at Board meetings for discussion on strategic and 
operational issues. With regard to committees, I have concluded that 
merging the work of the separate safety and ethics committees into 
one broader-based safety and ethics committee will give greater 
focus to our sustainability agenda.
I agree with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) that good 
governance enhances a company’s sustainable performance and 
so helps underpin long-term economic growth. Sustainability has to 
be part of everything we do if our business is to endure in the long 
term. Further details on sustainability are on pages 26 to 29. We 
must provide excellent products which are safe, reliable, kinder to 
the environment and provide the right solutions for our customers 
at the right price. We can only endure if we are trusted by the world 
to deliver excellence in everything we do. 
Board changes
During the year, Sir Simon Robertson retired as Chairman and Peter 
Byrom and Ian Strachan retired as non-executive directors at the 
conclusion of the AGM on 2 May 2013. I was appointed as a non-
executive director on 1 March 2013 and was appointed Chairman 
on 2 May 2013. Lee Hsien Yang and Warren East were appointed as 
non-executive directors on 1 January 2014. Having served for nine 
years as a non-executive director, Iain Conn has decided to retire and 
will not be standing for re-election at the AGM on 1 May 2014.
Business ethics
In January 2013, we appointed Lord Gold to lead a review of our 
compliance procedures. Lord Gold presented an interim report to 
the Board in July 2013, having spent time immersing himself in the 
culture and systems of the Company. 
We require high standards of ethical behaviour wherever we do 
business and for that behaviour to be second nature for every 
employee. With over 55,000 employees operating in many business 
sectors, regions and cultures across the world, we are well aware 
that this is not something that can be achieved overnight but only by 
relentless pursuit over time. Further details on ethics related matters 
can be found in the ethics committee report on pages 49 and 50.
Remuneration
Our remuneration report reflects the new reporting regulations. 
At the 2014 AGM shareholders shall, for the first time, have the right 
to vote on the policy section of the remuneration report separately 
and that vote is binding. The remuneration report can be found on 
pages 53 to 69.
At the 2014 AGM, we will be proposing to renew our long-term 
incentive plan, the Performance Share Plan (PSP). We are also taking 
the opportunity to ask shareholders to approve our Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan. Further details are set out in the remuneration report.
I believe that Rolls-Royce benefits from a strong Board though we 
will continue to look for opportunities to further strengthen and 
diversify, as discussed in the nomination committee report on 
page 47. I look forward to continuing to work with and support 
my colleagues at Rolls-Royce as we face the challenges and 
opportunities ahead.

Governance principle: leadership
Board membership
The directors biographical details are on pages 36 and 37 which 
demonstrate the skills and experience of the Board. The experience 
and knowledge of each of the directors gives them the ability to 
constructively challenge strategy and scrutinise performance. 
On 12 February 2014, the Board noted that Iain Conn intended to 
retire as the Senior Independent Director and as a non-executive 
director and would therefore not seek re-election at the AGM on 
1 May 2014. The Board has resolved that Lewis Booth, subject to 
re-election at the AGM, will succeed Iain Conn as the Senior 
Independent Director at the conclusion of the AGM.
UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code)
This report explains how the Company discharges its corporate 
governance responsibilities. In the year to 31 December 2013, 
the revised principles and provisions of the Code (published in 
September 2012 by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) applied 
to the Company. 
Throughout the 2013 financial year, the Company did not fully 
comply with the provisions of the Code for the following reasons:
Code provision Explanation
C.3.5 – The audit 
committee should review 
arrangements by which 
staff of the company may, 
in confidence, raise 
concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters 
of financial reporting or 
other matters.
The Board considered it 
appropriate that this provision 
of the Code be the primary 
responsibility of the ethics 
committee. The ethics 
committee is, however, required 
to refer concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of 
financial reporting to the 
audit committee.
C.3.7 – The audit 
committee should have 
primary responsibility 
for making a 
recommendation 
on the appointment, 
reappointment and 
removal of the external 
auditors. FTSE 350 
companies should put the 
external audit contract 
out to tender at least 
every ten years. 
The audit committee has 
considered the requirement to 
put the audit out to tender every 
ten years. In line with the FRC’s 
transitional arrangements, the 
committee will do so during the 
tenure of the current lead 
partner which expires in 2017. 
The committee concluded that, 
in order to ensure that a 
potential change in auditor is 
managed effectively, it would 
not be in the Company’s 
interests to put the audit out to 
tender in 2013. More detail can 
be found in the audit committee 
report on page 46.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 39
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT In accordance with the Code and the Company’s Articles of 
Association, all directors will retire and put themselves forward for 
election or re-election at the AGM in 2014 with the exception of Iain 
Conn who is not seeking re-election and will retire from the Board  
at the conclusion of that meeting.
The process for succession planning is discussed in the nomination 
committee report on page 47.
The work of the Board in 2013
During 2013, the Board held nine meetings, eight of which were 
scheduled and a further one called at short notice. In addition, two 
formal resolutions were passed by consent of all directors using 
electronic means. Non-executive directors communicate directly 
with executive directors and senior management between formal 
Board meetings. At each scheduled meeting, executive directors 
supplied reports on business and financial performance including 
the usual approval of financial statements and budgets. The Board 
also received regular updates on health, safety and environment 
(HS&E) and employee and legal issues, including a review of its 
governance arrangements. In addition, the chairman of each of the 
Board committees provided reports on matters discussed by that 
committee since the previous Board meeting.
The Board holds an annual day-long strategy meeting, which 
provides a forum for directors to challenge strategy and help 
develop it for the future. The strategy meeting held in September 
2013 included discussions on the ten-year financial plan and the 
strategic context including market structure, competitor 
positioning, cost challenges, technology and with a focus on the Civil 
aerospace and the Marine and Industrial Power Systems businesses. 
In addition to its routine business, matters considered by the Board 
in 2013 included:
 Marine strategy focused on markets, costs, supply chain, product 
development and alignment with the Rolls-Royce Power Systems 
and Bergen engines businesses;
 the closure of the proposed joint venture with Pratt & Whitney;
 updates on the referral to the Serious Fraud Office;
 discussion on Lord Gold’s interim findings, the adoption of a new 
Global Code of Conduct and the roll-out of a comprehensive ethics 
training programme to all employees; 
 relocation to new Group headquarters;
 the effect of sequestration on US defence spending;
 Civil Nuclear business strategy;
 investors’ view on our AGM business;
 restructuring of the Aerospace business;
 liquidity and additional funding;
 the renewal of the Euro Medium Term Note programme;
 preliminary discussions with Wärtsilä regarding a possible offer 
for the company; and
 cyber security.
Board committees
The Board has established a number of committees, the principal 
ones being audit, remuneration, nomination, ethics, risk and safety. 
Terms of reference for each committee are available on the Group’s 
website at www.rolls-royce.com. Reports by committee chairmen  
on the activities of each of the principal committees are on  
pages 44 to 54. The Chairman’s introduction provides more detail  
on page 35 of changes to the committee structures.
Senior management and advisers are invited to attend Board and 
committee meetings where appropriate to contribute to discussions 
and advise members of the Board and committees on relevant 
matters. The involvement of senior management additionally  
helps strengthen the relationship between the Board and senior 
management and helps to provide the Board with a greater 
understanding of operations and strategy.
Internal control 
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for maintaining and reviewing its effectiveness from 
both a financial and an operational perspective. Our risk 
management process is a key element of the Group’s internal control 
system. This system of internal control is designed to identify and 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The processes we use to 
identify and manage risk are set out in the risk committee report  
on page 51. The Board’s report on the Group’s principal risks and 
actions taken to mitigate them is on pages 32 to 34. 
Turnover from joint ventures constitutes an increasingly large part 
of our reported group activity. Responsibility for internal control 
procedures in joint ventures where we do not have a control 
agreement lies with the managers of those operations. We seek to 
exert influence over such ventures by board representation and 
regularly review the activities of these ventures.
The audit committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of 
internal control for the year under review. Further information can be 
found in the audit committee report on page 45. The Board confirms 
that the processes and systems currently in place ensure that the 
Group continues to be compliant with the ‘Turnbull guidance’ as 
contained in ‘Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council in 2005.
Financial reporting 
The Group has a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual 
budget approved by the Board. Revised forecasts for the year are 
reported at least quarterly. Actual results, at both a business and 
Group level, are reported monthly against budget and variances  
are kept under scrutiny.
Financial managers are required to acknowledge in writing that 
their routine financial reporting is based on reliable data and that 
results are properly stated in accordance with Group requirements. 
In addition, for annual reporting, business presidents and finance 
directors are required to confirm that their business has complied 
with the Group’s Finance Manual.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 40 Directors’ report
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT Roles and responsibilities 
The Board has a written remit for the Chairman, Ian Davis, who  
has responsibility for the running of the Board and ensuring its 
effectiveness, and the Chief Executive, John Rishton, who has 
responsibility for running the business. This division of responsibility 
ensures that no one individual has unfettered powers of decision.
In addition, the Board has agreed a set of guiding principles to 
govern the relationship between the Chairman and Chief Executive 
which, for example, requires that the two roles are structured in a 
complementary manner and demands that the relationship 
between the two be based on mutual respect and trust and be 
frank and open.
The Senior Independent Director, Iain Conn, acts as a sounding 
board for the Chairman and can act as an intermediary for other 
directors. He led the nomination committee in the process which 
resulted in the appointment of Ian Davis as Chairman in May 2013. 
Each year, the Senior Independent Director leads a separate meeting 
of the Board excluding the Chairman to review the Chairman’s 
performance. 
Role and operation of the Board
The principal role of the Board is to ensure that the Group’s strategy 
creates long-term success for the Group within an acceptable risk 
profile and provides value for the long-term investor.
To achieve its long-term success the Board must:
 ensure the safety of its products and its people;
 oversee and approve the development of the Group’s strategy, 
monitoring both its achievement and the Group’s risk appetite;
 uphold the values of the Group, including its brand and 
corporate reputation;
 oversee the quality and performance of management and ensure 
it is maintained at world-class standards, through effective 
succession planning and remuneration policies; and 
 maintain an effective corporate governance framework, with 
transparent reporting.
The Board has established a formal schedule of matters reserved for 
its approval, generally being those items which affect the shape and 
risk profile of the Group, as well as items such as the annual budget 
and performance targets, the financial statements, payments to 
shareholders, major capital investments, substantial changes to 
balance sheet management policy and the strategic plan. This 
schedule of matters reserved is reviewed annually.
John Rishton, as the Chief Executive, is responsible for the day-to-day 
leadership, operational and performance management of the Group 
within the confines of the strategy, business plans and budgets 
agreed by the Board. The delegation of responsibilities to the 
executive team is set out in a detailed schedule approved by the 
Chief Executive.
Information is supplied to directors in a manner which enables them 
to fulfil their responsibilities. This includes the circulation of papers 
to be discussed, generally one week before meetings. Presentations 
are made by senior management at Board meetings on business, 
financial and operating issues. Directors are expected to attend all 
meetings of the Board and the committees on which they sit and to 
devote sufficient time to the Company’s affairs to enable them to 
fulfil their duties as directors. If directors are unable to attend a 
meeting, their comments on the papers to be considered are 
discussed in advance with the Chairman so that their contribution 
can be included in the wider Board discussion.
Executive Leadership Team (ELT)
The ELT is the senior decision-making executive committee and met 
26 times during the year. Its membership is described on page 38.  
It developed detailed strategic options for the Group culminating  
in approval of strategy by the Board in September. It reviewed HS&E 
performance, customer relations, governance, financial and 
operational performance. It also reviewed acquisitions and disposals 
and recommended them to the Board where required.
Each business segment holds executive meetings to review 
operational performance of its business, assisting the business 
president in taking such decisions as fall within his remit and 
reviewing proposals before presentation to the ELT or the Board  
for approval as appropriate.
Governance principle: effectiveness
Board evaluation
The Code requires that the Board undertakes an annual evaluation 
of its own performance and that of its committees and individual 
directors and to do so externally at least every three years. In 2013, 
the evaluation process was again conducted internally, full  
external reviews having been carried out by Jan Hall Associates  
in 2010 and 2011.
Initially, directors were asked to complete a confidential survey 
covering the areas set out as best practice published by the Financial 
Reporting Council’s ‘Guidance on Board Effectiveness’. The Company 
Secretary then produced a report which consolidated the responses 
following which the Chairman conducted one-to-one interviews 
with each director and the Senior Independent Director interviewed 
the Chairman. The findings were considered by the Board and 
actions to be taken were agreed. 
The evaluation concluded that the Board was proving to be effective 
under the leadership of Ian Davis and John Rishton and that 
relationships and Board discussions work well. The principal 
recommendation was that succession planning for senior executive 
positions could be improved. Other areas for improvement 
identified included risk processes, mitigation plans, Board papers 
and governance. 
Directors’ terms of appointment
Executive directors are employees who have day-to-day 
responsibilities as executives of the Group in addition to their duties 
as directors. Each executive director receives a service contract on 
appointment (see pages 60 and 61 for further information).
Non-executive directors are generally independent of the Company, 
are not employees and do not participate in the daily business 
management of the Group. On appointment, each non-executive 
director receives a letter setting out the conditions of his or her 
appointment. Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial 
term of three years, which may be extended with the agreement of 
the Board, although reappointment is not automatic. Their term  
of office is also subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the 
AGM and will terminate without compensation if they fail to be 
re-elected (see page 60 for further information).

Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information Director training
Newly appointed directors participate in a structured induction 
programme as detailed in the table below and receive a 
comprehensive data pack providing detailed information on the 
Group. An existing executive director can act as a mentor to each 
newly appointed non-executive director, giving guidance and 
advice as required.

Further training is available for directors, including presentations 
by the executive team on particular aspects of the business. In 2013, 
the Board received training in ethics conducted by our Head of 
Business Ethics. In December 2013, our corporate lawyers, Slaughter 
and May, held a seminar immediately following the Board meeting 
to update the Board on developments in corporate law and 
regulation. In addition, there is a procedure for directors to take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense and 
every director has access to the General Counsel and to the Company 
Secretary who is responsible to the Board on corporate governance. 
All directors are advised of changes in legislation, regulation and 
changing risks with the assistance of the Company’s advisers where 
necessary. In-house training is provided to directors of the 
Company’s subsidiaries and joint ventures. 
Independence of the non-executive directors
The Board conducts a rigorous review of the independence of 
the non-executive directors every year, based on the criteria in 
the Code. This review was undertaken in November 2013 and the 
Board concluded that all the non-executive directors remained 
independent in character and judgement. The Chairman met the 
Code’s independence criteria upon his election as Chairman in May 
2013. His other external commitments are described on page 36.
Non-executive directors are advised of the time required to fulfil the 
role and are asked to confirm that they can make the required 
commitment before the appointment is made. The Board is satisfied 
that each of the non-executive directors is able to devote sufficient 
time to the Company’s business. 
The Board believes it can be appropriate for executive directors to 
take non-executive positions in other companies and organisations, 
as such appointments should broaden their experience. The 
appointment to such positions is subject to the approval of the 
Chairman and the Board and must not conflict with a director’s 
duties and commitments to the Company.
Conflicts of interest
Directors have a duty to avoid a situation in which they have, or can 
have, a direct or indirect interest which conflicts, or possibly may 
conflict, with the interests of the Company unless that situational 
conflict has been authorised by the Board. The nomination 
committee has reviewed and authorised all directors’ situational 
conflicts and has agreed that while directors are required to keep 
confidential all Company information, they shall not be required to 
share with the Company confidential information received by them 
from a third party which is the subject of the situational conflict.
Governance principle: accountability
The directors consider the annual report and accounts, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Investor relations
Communications with shareholders regarding business strategy 
and financial performance are co-ordinated by a dedicated Investor 
Relations department that reports to the Chief Financial Officer. 
Communications regarding the general administration of 
shareholdings are co-ordinated by the Company Secretary.
The Group conducts a dedicated investor relations programme with 
institutional investors which includes various formal events during 
the year, as well as a regular series of one-to-one and group 
meetings. The purpose of these events is to highlight a particular 
issue, theme or announcement that the Group believes warrants 
further explanation or clarification. The events also provide 
opportunities for shareholders to meet members of the senior 
management team. Examples of these events in 2013 were: the 
preliminary and half-year results announcements; the AGM; the 
update given at the Paris Air Show on trends in the Civil and Defence 
aerospace businesses; visits to certain of the Group’s sites; and 
industry conferences. The one-to-one and group meetings provide 
additional context around the Group’s business strategy and 
financial performance. 
In 2013, over 380 meetings took place with over 340 separately 
identifiable institutional investors. The majority of meetings took 
place in the UK (273), 81 meetings were in the USA and Canada, 
and a further 26 meetings took place in Europe. The Chairman also 
meets institutional investors from time-to-time.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT Shareholder communications
Information about the Group is available on the Group’s website 
(www.rolls-royce.com) and in the published annual report, an online 
version of which is also available on the website. The website 
contains financial and other information about the Group including 
current business strategy, historical financial data, and recent 
presentation materials together with information on the Group’s 
businesses, products and services. 
Over 20,000 Rolls-Royce shareholders have registered their email 
addresses with etree so that they benefit from immediate 
communication of the posting of our preliminary results and of the 
publication of our notice of meetings and our online annual report. 
This reduces our printing and mailing costs as well as our carbon 
footprint. We would encourage other shareholders to register for 
this service by following the instructions on the etree website at 
www.etreeuk.com/rolls-royce.
Annual general meeting (AGM)
All holders of ordinary shares are invited to attend the Company’s 
AGM. The Chief Executive gives a presentation highlighting key 
business developments during the year and shareholders have an 
opportunity to ask questions. All directors normally attend the AGM 
and the chairmen of the audit, nomination, remuneration, ethics, 
safety and risk committees are available to answer any questions 
from shareholders on the work of their committees.
The Company sends the AGM notice and relevant documentation to 
all shareholders at least 20 working days before the date of the AGM. 
For shareholders who have consented to receive communications 
electronically, notice is given by email or by written notice of the 
availability of documents on the Group’s website.
This year’s AGM will be held at 11.00am on Thursday, 1 May 2014 at 
the QEII Conference Centre, Broad Sanctuary, Westminster, London 
SW1P 3EE. The AGM notice and the annual report will be available to 
view on the Group’s website. Shareholders unable to attend the AGM 
can vote on the business of the meeting either by post or online.
Shareholders and share capital
Information on shareholders and share capital, which also forms 
part of the Corporate Governance report, is detailed on pages 70  
and 71.
Change of control
Contracts and joint venture agreements
There are a number of contracts and joint venture agreements 
which would allow the counterparties to terminate or alter those 
arrangements in the event of a change of control of the Company. 
The terms of those arrangements are commercially confidential  
and their disclosure could be seriously prejudicial to the Company. 
Borrowings and other financial instruments
The Group has a number of borrowing facilities provided by 
various banks. These facilities generally include provisions which 
may require any outstanding borrowings to be repaid or the 
alteration or termination of the facility upon the occurrence of  
a change of control of the Company. At 31 December 2013 these 
facilities were less than 35 per cent drawn (2012 30 per cent).
The Group has entered into a series of financial instruments to 
hedge its currency, interest rate and commodity exposures. These 
contracts provide for termination or alteration if a change of 
control of the Company materially weakens the creditworthiness  
of the Group.
Employee share plans
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the effect on 
the employee share plans would be as follows:
 PSP – awards would vest pro rata to service in the performance 
period, subject to remuneration committee judgement of Group 
performance;
 APRA deferred shares – the shares would be released from trust 
immediately;
 ShareSave – options would become exercisable immediately. The 
new company might offer an equivalent option in exchange for 
cancellation of the existing option; and
 Share Incentive Plan (SIP) – consideration received as shares 
would be held within the SIP , if possible, otherwise the 
consideration would be treated as a disposal from the SIP .
Payment to shareholders
At the AGM on 1 May 2014, the directors will recommend an issue 
of 134 C Shares with a total nominal value of 13.4 pence for each 
ordinary share. The final issue of C Shares will be made on 1 July 
2014 to shareholders on the register on 25 April 2014 and the final 
day of trading with entitlement to C Shares is 22 April 2014. 
Together with the interim issue on 2 January 2014 of 86 C Shares 
for each ordinary share with a total nominal value of 8.6 pence,  
this is the equivalent of a total annual payment to ordinary 
shareholders of 22 pence for each ordinary share.
The payment to shareholders will, as before, be made in the form  
of redeemable C Shares which shareholders may either choose to 
retain or redeem for a cash equivalent. The Registrar, on behalf of 
the Company, operates a C Share Reinvestment Plan (CRIP) and can, 
on behalf of shareholders, purchase ordinary shares from the

Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information I am pleased to present the report of the audit committee for the 
year. I would like to thank committee members, the executive 
management team and KPMG for the open discussions that take 
place at our meetings and the importance they all attach to its work.
Work of the committee in 2013
At our meetings during 2013, we focused on financial reporting, 
internal control, internal audit and external audit. We received 
presentations from senior executives from the Civil aerospace, 
Defence aerospace and Civil Nuclear businesses. These 
presentations covered key accounting judgements and estimates, 
internal control and risk management. 
We also reviewed the committee’s own terms of reference.
Financial reporting
In addressing our key objective, which is to assist the Board in 
ensuring the integrity of its financial statements, we reviewed 
financial announcements and financial statements with both 
management and the external auditor, concentrating on:
 compliance with financial reporting standards and governance 
reporting requirements;
 areas requiring significant judgements to be made in applying 
accounting policies;
 the appropriateness of accounting policies;
 the procedures and controls around estimates that are key in 
applying accounting policies;
 whether the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s business model, 
strategy and performance; and
 any relevant correspondence from regulators.
Our committee is focused on ensuring integrity of the Group’s 
financial reporting and improving the financial controls framework, 
including the restructuring of business audit committees which 
now report directly to this committee. During the year, we 
encouraged and supported the development of an enhanced 
business audit committee process. Under this process, management 
of each of the Group’s businesses consider the appropriateness and 
related governance of accounting policies, judgements and 
estimates and the control environment relating to their businesses 
including internal audit findings and the robustness of the 
processes used to execute their risk management responsibilities. 
We receive reports on the results of these reviews.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Our committee is focused on ensuring the integrity 
of the Group’s financial reporting and improving 
the financial controls framework.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 44 Directors’ report Our business is complex; in particular the development of gas 
turbines for use in civil aircraft applications requires large upfront 
investments, a long period of sale of original equipment, and a very 
long period over which we generate profits and cash flows from the 
aftermarket by the sale of spare parts and engine maintenance 
work. The in-service period could be longer than 25 years for any 
engine, and the total life cycle of an engine could be more than  
40 years from initial concept, through production, and then through 
the in-service life. Much of the aftermarket repair and overhaul is 
provided through long-term service agreements. Given this long 
exposure, the amount of revenue and profit recognised during any 
period requires a significant number of accounting judgements and 
estimates, supported by engineering and business assessments. 
Consequently, one of our primary responsibilities is to ensure that 
the bases for these judgements and estimates are robust. 
In 2013, our work focused on:
 carrying values of the principal intangible assets in Civil aerospace 
– we considered the business plans for the relevant engine 
programmes, including the key assumptions on which they are 
based, and which support the value in use assessments for the 
intangible assets. We were satisfied that no impairments were 
required; 
 long-term contractual arrangements in Civil aerospace – we 
reviewed the forecasts of future contract performance on which 
the accounting is based. We also considered performance to date 
against these forecasts and the results of a detailed review  
of certain aspects of the processes supporting these forecasts. 
Where the accounting results in a contract asset, we assessed  
the recoverability of the asset against agreed criteria. We were 
satisfied that the forecasts have been prepared on an appropriate 
and consistent basis;
 risk and revenue sharing arrangements (RRSAs) in Civil aerospace 
– (as described in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on page 11), 
during the year and following discussions with the Conduct 
Committee of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the Group  
has reassessed its accounting policy for entry fees received from 
workshare partners. Adopted IFRS does not contain requirements 
that are specific to arrangements of this type and we assessed 
possible alternative policies developed by management. We 
reviewed the revised policy, considered the FRC’s and KPMG’s views 
and I attended a meeting with the FRC. On balance, we agreed 
with management’s view that the revised policy fairly reflects  
the nature of the transaction and that it should be adopted 
retrospectively;
 we reviewed the contractual arrangements that resulted in the 
Group consolidating Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG from 1 January 
2013. We also reviewed the accounting for the business 
combination, based on a third-party valuation of the intangible 
assets acquired, and the valuation of the Daimler put option on 
the non-controlling interest. We were satisfied that appropriate 
judgements and estimates have been made;
 customer financing liabilities in Civil aerospace – we considered 
the adequacy of provisions for these liabilities. We considered the 
likelihood of the liabilities crystallising, based on an assessment  
of customers’ fleet plans and their creditworthiness. We also 
considered the value of any security held, based on third-party 
valuations. We were satisfied that provisions have been made  
on an appropriate basis;
 contingent liabilities – we considered the adequacy of the 
disclosures. In particular, we considered legal advice in respect of 
the possible outcome of the SFO enquiries. We were satisfied that 
the disclosures appropriately reflect the current position; and
 segmental reporting – we considered the changes in management 
structure and internal reporting described on page 10 and the 
implications for reporting in accordance with IFRS 8. We were 
satisfied with the appropriateness of the revised segmental 
reporting from 1 January 2014.
Since the year end, we have reviewed the form and content of the 
Group’s 2013 annual report. The committee has reported to the 
Board that it considers the annual report, taken as a whole, to be fair, 
balanced and understandable. 
Internal control
The Director of Internal Audit provided a report setting out an 
overview of the Group’s control environment and we reviewed the 
processes by which the control environment is assessed and any 
identified weaknesses resolved. We considered control weaknesses 
identified by the auditors in accounting for Civil aerospace long-
term aftermarket contracts, and management’s plans to address 
these. We also received reports of any identified frauds that are 
significant or demonstrate significant weakness in internal control. 
We also reviewed a report on compliance with the Group’s policies 
in respect of expenses incurred by the directors and other senior 
executives, which did not identify any significant issues.
Internal Audit
The Director of Internal Audit presented two updates on audit 
activities and findings covering six-month periods, the resolution  
of control weaknesses, progress against the agreed plan and the 
resourcing of the department. We are continuing to develop with 
him a simplified metrics-driven approach to the reporting, focusing 
on the closure of open items on a timely basis and the identification 
of recurring themes. We were satisfied that the scope, extent and 
effectiveness of Internal Audit are appropriate for the Group. 
I meet the Director of Internal Audit in private before each meeting 
and the committee as a whole has a private meeting with him at 
least once a year.
External auditor
The external audit is a continuous process. At the start of the audit 
cycle, KPMG presented their audit strategy, identifying their 
assessment of the key risks for the purposes of the audit and the 
scope of their work.
For 2013, these risks were: the implementation of a new 
consolidation system; the business combination and Daimler’s  
put option in respect of Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH; 
impairment of intangible assets; long-term contractual 
arrangements; warranties and guarantees; RRSAs; customer 
financing arrangements; contingent liabilities; valuation of 
derivatives; valuation of pension liabilities; recoverability of tax 
assets and adequacy of tax provisions; the adjustments between 
the reported results and the Group’s underlying performance; and 
the form and content of the annual report. More detail is set out in 
KPMG’s report on pages 130 to 135.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 45
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information KPMG reports to the committee at both the half and full-year 
setting out their assessment of the Group’s judgements and 
estimates in respect of these risks and the adequacy of the 
reporting. I meet the lead audit partner in private before each 
meeting and the whole committee meets with KPMG in private  
at least once a year. 
Non-audit services provided by KPMG
In order to safeguard auditors’ independence and objectivity, we do 
not engage KPMG for any non-audit services, except where it is work 
that they must, or are clearly best suited to perform. Fees paid to 
KPMG for audit, audit related and other services are set out in note 8 
to the financial statements.
Excluding Rolls-Royce Power Systems (see below), the main non-audit 
related services provided by KPMG during the year were in respect  
of grant claims and tax compliance and were 11 per cent of the audit 
fee. The nature and level of all services provided by the external 
auditor is a factor taken into account by the audit committee in its 
annual review of the external auditor. 
All proposed services must be pre-approved in accordance with  
an agreed policy. We review the non-audit fees charged by KPMG  
at each meeting and annually review the approval limits.
Following the consolidation of Rolls-Royce Power Systems on 
1 January 2013, we took the decision to allow the completion of 
engagements already in progress. As a result, Rolls-Royce Power 
Systems incurred fees on non-audit services provided by KPMG  
in 2013 of £2.1 million, 210 per cent of its audit fee. This will  
reduce in 2014.
Reappointment of auditor
Following the completion of the audit, we reviewed the effectiveness 
and performance of KPMG with feedback from committee members, 
senior finance personnel and Internal Audit, covering overall quality, 
independence and objectivity, business understanding, technical 
knowledge, quality and continuity of personnel, responsiveness and 
cost effectiveness. We also considered the reports on KPMG by the 
FRC’s Audit Quality Review Team. The audit of Rolls-Royce was not 
subject to their review in 2013. KPMG were appointed as auditors in 
1990 and this appointment has not been subject to a tender process 
since that date. 
The lead audit partner is required to rotate every five years and 
other key audit partners are required to rotate every seven years. 
Jimmy Daboo took over as lead audit partner in 2013 and has had no 
previous involvement with Rolls-Royce in any capacity. No contractual 
obligations restrict our choice of external auditors. We concluded 
that KPMG provides an effective audit and the committee and the 
Board have recommended their reappointment at the 2014 AGM. 
Audit tendering
The Group is a complex and technologically advanced business  
with a long cycle from the development of an engine to its eventual 
retirement. We believe that KPMG’s knowledge of this, built up over 
a number of years, enhances the effectiveness of the audit and that 
the existing professional requirements, such as the rotation of audit 
personnel, maintain independence. However, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code now requires the external audit contract be 
tendered at least every ten years. The FRC has proposed non-binding 
transitional arrangements with respect to audit tendering, 
including a suggestion that tendering should normally fit the 
five-yearly cycle with respect to the lead partner. 
We plan to recommend a tender of the audit during the tenure  
of the current lead partner which, subject to KPMG’s annual 
reappointment, is due to end following the 2017 audit. This will also 
satisfy the requirements proposed by the Competition Commission. 
However, before we make such a recommendation, we will satisfy 
ourselves that, if the tender resulted in a change of auditor: (i) it 
would not be unnecessarily disruptive, taking account of any other 
activities; and (ii) appropriate plans are in place to ensure audit 
effectiveness is maintained. During the year, we approved a tender 
plan prepared by management to be used when the audit is 
tendered but we do not plan to tender the audit during 2014. The EU 
is also finalising requirements which would require mandatory 
rotation of auditors. the draft proposals would require us to appoint 
a different firm by 2020 at the latest. Once finalised, we will take 
account of the EU requirements in our assessment of when to 
recommend an audit tender.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT Ian Davis
Chairman of the nomination committee
I am pleased to present my first report as chairman of the 
nomination committee. 
During the year, the committee continued to develop its succession 
plans for new non-executive directors taking into account their 
respective tenures of office, analysing the skills which were either 
missing or could be missing in future and how different personalities 
would fit around the Board table. We are very clear that we must 
continue to appoint the best candidates but we will show an 
increasing emphasis on recruiting candidates from more diverse 
backgrounds and with international experience.
We are pleased that Lee Hsien Yang has joined the Board as a 
non-executive director. Hsien Yang was already known to the Board 
as a valued member of the IAB (a role that he has relinquished upon 
his appointment to the Board). The committee did not therefore 
engage search consultants in connection with his appointment.
Hsien Yang will bring to our Board a wealth of business experience 
in the Asian marketplace. His biography can be found on page 37.
The Board has been further bolstered by the appointment of Warren 
East as a non-executive director. Warren has extensive experience in 
the global technology sector and an outstanding record of business 
achievement that will be of great value to Rolls-Royce. His biography 
can be found on page 36. Both Warren and Hsien Yang took up their 
posts from 1 January 2014. Sciteb was engaged as search consultant 
for Warren’s appointment. The firm has no other connection with 
the Company.
The topic of boardroom diversity has received much attention over 
the past two years. In September 2011, we issued our response to 
the Davies Report on women on boards stating that we expected to 
make demonstrable progress in this area by 2015. Maintaining the 
right balance on the Board and getting the succession policy right is 
high on my agenda and the Board is clear that purposeful diversity 
is a valuable goal. Gender diversity is an important part of that 
although we do not consider it appropriate to fix a specific target. 
We continue to participate in the FTSE 100 Cross-Company 
Mentoring Programme, the objective of which is to increase the pool 
of eligible senior female candidates for UK board positions and we 
have comprehensive programmes in place to increase the diversity 
of our internal pipeline of future leaders. We have also issued 
guidance to executive search companies outlining the importance 
of diverse candidate short lists. Further details of our gender 
representation can be found in sustainability on page 27.

Key objective:
 to lead the process for appointments to the Rolls-Royce Board.
Responsibilities:
 monitor the composition and performance of the Board and 
its committees; 
 evaluate the balance of skills and experience on the Board and 
the diversity of its members;
 consider and recommend the appointment and removal 
of directors;
 monitor executive development and succession planning;
 evaluate any conflicts of interest that directors might have; and
 evaluate the independence of the non-executive directors and 
their time commitments.

Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information
NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT During the year, the committee reviewed the use of executive search 
consultants and concluded that the existing agency relationships 
were working well and should continue. The overarching brief is to 
find candidates of international stature, with international mindsets 
and relevant experience who could demonstrate sound judgement 
and board skills with an emphasis towards greater diversity.
MWM Consulting was engaged in the search for the vacant 
chairman’s post earlier in 2013. A detailed brief was approved by the 
Board covering both the responsibilities of the role and the desired 
profile which formed the blueprint against which candidates were 
identified and assessed. The search was broad and global in outlook, 
constrained only by the requirements of the brief. Seventy 
candidates from ten different countries were actively considered. 
MWM Consulting has no other connection with the Company.
In addition to the work described above, the committee also carried 
out the following tasks during the year:
 considered time commitments and potential conflicts faced by 
directors who wished to take up non-executive positions on the 
boards of other companies;
 authorised John Rishton’s acceptance of a non-executive role 
at Unilever;
 reviewed its own terms of reference;
 considered the independence of the non-executive directors;
 considered the standing schedule of directors’ conflicts of interest 
and recommended to the Board that the schedule be approved; 
 recommended the appointment of a new Chairman and two  
new non-executive directors and renewed terms of office for 
Dame Helen Alexander, John McAdam and Iain Conn;
 discussed governance arrangements for the Group and the Board 
evaluation process;
 reviewed the Board’s diversity policy; and
 since the year end, the committee has reviewed and approved the 
form of this report.

The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the General 
Counsel, the Director of Risk and the Head of Business Ethics are 
also invited to attend meetings on a regular basis.
Key objective:
 review compliance with Rolls-Royce ethics policies.
Responsibilities:
 review compliance with and recommend changes to the 
Global Code of Conduct;
 monitor evolving practice and requirements of regulatory bodies 
and recommend how they should be applied in the Group;
 establish bribery prevention policies and procedures;
 review arrangements by which staff may raise concerns 
and ensure such concerns are handled effectively; and
 ensure that ethical policies and practices are subject to an 
appropriate level of independent internal scrutiny.
The ethics committee was formed in 2008 in response to the 
publication of the Woolf Committee report. It is responsible, on 
behalf of the Board, for reviewing compliance with the Group’s 
Global Code of Conduct, for improving bribery and corruption 
prevention policies and for reviewing arrangements by which 
staff may raise ethical concerns in confidence. It considers 
recommendations on ethical matters made by external regulatory 
authorities or other bodies and makes recommendations to the 
Board on how they should be applied in Rolls-Royce. I would like to 
thank Ian Strachan for his chairmanship of this committee from 
November 2008 to May 2013.
Referral to Serious Fraud Office (SFO)
On 6 December 2012, we announced that we had passed 
information to the SFO relating to concerns in overseas markets. 
Since that date we have continued our investigations and are 
engaging with the SFO and other authorities in the UK, the USA and 
elsewhere. In December 2013, we announced that we had been 
informed by the SFO that it had commenced a formal investigation. 
The consequence of these disclosures will be decided by the 
regulatory authorities. It remains too early to predict the outcomes, 
but these could include the prosecution of individuals and of the 
Group. Accordingly, the potential for fines, penalties or other 
consequences (including debarment from government contracts, 
suspension of export privileges and reputational damage) cannot 
currently be assessed. As the investigation is ongoing, it is not yet 
possible to identify the timescale in which these issues might be 
resolved. We continue to demand the highest standards of behaviour 
from our people. John Rishton has stated unequivocally that neither 
he nor the Board will tolerate improper business conduct of any sort 
and all necessary action will be taken to ensure compliance. 
Lord Gold’s review
The Group has taken significant further action to strengthen and 
enhance its ethics and compliance programme. In January 2013, 
the Group appointed Lord Gold to review its ethical and compliance 
procedures and make recommendations. Lord Gold began his work 
in 2013 reporting directly to the ethics committee and attending 
its meetings. In July 2013, he presented an interim report, having 
interviewed over 80 senior managers across the Group. In addition 
to a number of detailed recommendations, the report drew 
attention to the need for further strengthening of the Group’s ethics 
and compliance function in the following three areas: develop and 
implement an integrity and values communication strategy; 
provide integrity and values training for all employees; and 
reorganise the compliance function. The ethics committee, the 
Board and the ELT have all reviewed and accepted Lord Gold’s 
interim report and the recommendations made in it and the Group 
has started to implement those recommendations. The Group has 
The Board has a firm belief that the only 
way we can succeed as a Group is by 
applying sound and ethical business 
practices wherever we operate.
Iain Conn
Chairman of the ethics committee
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 49
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information
ETHICS COMMITTEE REPORT developed an holistic ethics and compliance improvement 
programme, overseen by a newly appointed Director of Risk, 
clarifying, with a new Global Code of Conduct, what is expected 
from all individuals in the Group, defining processes to combat 
bribery and corruption and strengthening oversight and review of 
the Group’s performance in these areas. The following is a summary 
of some of the Group’s major activities undertaken in 2013:
Global Code of Conduct (Global Code)
In July 2013, the Board and the ELT approved a revised version of the 
Group’s Global Code of Conduct which is a condensed, updated and 
more readable version of the previous Global Code of Business 
Ethics. The Global Code is being used as a platform for the Group’s 
enhanced ethics and compliance programme and its rollout is being 
supported by manager-led face-to-face awareness briefings for all 
employees and a detailed programme of training which will 
continue. The Board and the ELT received the awareness briefing  
and supporting ethics training in July 2013 and provided feedback  
and input into the materials. The Board agreed that the training 
programme would be compulsory for all employees. 
The rollout programme started in September 2013 and will be 
delivered to all employees and all new starters. All employees are 
being asked to certify they have: received a copy of the Global Code; 
read and understood it; will comply with it; and have received a 
management briefing. In future years, periodic refresher training 
will continue and will also be compulsory. 
Ethics Line
Since 2008, employees have been able to access a confidential 
reporting line to report any concerns they might have. In 2013, the 
Group has reviewed, updated and re-launched its confidential 
reporting line (now known as the Ethics Line). Today we have contact 
numbers in 48 countries in addition to a web-based reporting tool 
which enables employees to ask questions or raise concerns  
24 hours a day wherever they are based in the world. The ethics 
committee receives reports and questions raised through the Ethics 
Line. In July 2013, it was agreed that an oversight committee would 
be established to monitor the detailed operation of the Ethics Line 
and ensure it remains effective and efficient.
Anti-bribery and corruption policies (ABC policies)
Much progress has been made in developing policies to govern the 
use of intermediaries since the formation of the ethics committee  
in 2008. The number of intermediaries used by our businesses has 
continued to fall dramatically during the year. Businesses now have 
greater ownership and direct responsibility for the marketing, sales 
and support of the Group’s products and services. An updated  
and simpler version of the Global Gifts and Hospitality Policy was 
introduced in October 2012 and work has continued in the year to 
capture data, develop a reporting regime and develop key metrics.
In July 2013, following the issue of Lord Gold’s interim report, the 
Director of Risk undertook to carry out a further thorough review  
of all ABC policies, taking account of Lord Gold’s recommendations. 
This review is underway and the Group has started the process  
of updating and modifying its suite of anti-bribery and corruption 
policies so that they are robust, simpler, meet the current needs  
of the business and are embedded as a core part of the Group’s 
processes for winning new business. All revised and enhanced ABC 
policies and procedures will meet the recommendations made by 
Lord Gold and will be supported by a training programme.
ABC compliance team
The ABC compliance organisation’s remit is to embed the ABC 
policies in the businesses, take the ABC programme into a ‘business 
as usual’ mode and make compliance a central part of the Group’s 
processes for winning new business. The ABC compliance team has 
been reorganised during the year to ensure team members remain 
independent of the businesses they are policing. The team has been 
strengthened with the creation of several new roles and broader 
areas of responsibility including offset compliance. A new role of 
Head of Risk Training has been created to ensure that there is a 
robust and effective training programme to support all risk policies 
including compliance and ethics. In response to Lord Gold’s 
recommendations, a protocol is being developed which will ensure 
that the Group’s Legal, HR, Compliance and Ethics functions work  
in a co-ordinated manner when investigating potential ethics and 
compliance breaches, ensuring that any proposed disciplinary action 
is reported to the Director of Risk. 
Ethics team
The ethics team manages the Global Code and the reporting 
Helplines. It works closely with the compliance team. The team has 
been strengthened by the creation of the new role of Group Ethics 
Officer responsible for establishing and co-ordinating a network of 
trained ethics officers across all business sectors to act as a local 
point of contact for ethical issues. 
Conclusion
When I took up the post of chairman of the ethics committee in 
2013, I was well aware of the huge amount of effort and resource 
that this Group had already dedicated to improving the way our 
employees conduct our business. The Board has a firm belief that 
the only way we can succeed as a Group is by applying sound and 
ethical business practices wherever we operate. We are equally 
aware that there will always be more to do and we must always  
seek to improve.

ETHICS COMMITTEE REPORT risks. More focus was given to our key business continuity risks and 
the committee considered and assessed each of the key business 
continuity risks identified by the businesses and their mitigation 
plans. Our discussion on IT vulnerability led us to have an in-depth 
review of our IT Operations Centre and give detailed consideration 
to how IT security risks, including the growing global threat of cyber 
attack, are managed. We also reviewed the committee’s own terms 
of reference.
Risk process
The Director of Risk leads our risk team across the Group which 
is responsible for implementing risk policy and processes. Line 
ownership for risk management is devolved to our business units 
and functions, supported by a network of risk champions and 
risk managers.
Each business maintains a risk register which comprises those risks 
that it considers are material to its objectives and operations. The 
businesses regularly review the effectiveness and consistency of 
risk management activity via their assurance framework and the 
application of the risk management process, all of which are subject 
to review by the business audit committees. Each business formally 
reviews their risks at least twice yearly taking account of work 
carried out by the underlying business units, programmes and 
functions. Business continuity plans are put in place by the 
businesses to mitigate continuity risks.
Every six months, as part of the full- and half-year results process, 
the risk committee reviews the key risks that the businesses and 
functions report in accordance with our enterprise-wide risk 
management system. The committee cross-checks the risks 
identified by the business with those risks it has identified from its 
own assessments and concludes a list of principal risks. During the 
year, the committee discusses how the risks have changed and how 
each risk is managed, identifying where further action is required.
We have benefited from the work we did in 2012 to concentrate our 
focus on a smaller number of risks. I am particularly pleased with 
the way the quality of discussion at these meetings has improved

Key objective:
 to assist the Board in determining the nature and extent 
of the principal risks it is willing to take in achieving its 
strategic objectives.
Responsibilities:
 develop and implement the Company’s Risk Management 
strategy and policy;
 review reports on key risks and monitor the total level of risk

Introduction
Each of the Group’s principal risks are owned by specific members of 
my executive team. We continually review and challenge ourselves 
as to whether these continue to be our principal risks and whether 
our management of those risks remains effective. This year, in 
addition to executive directors, all members of my executive team 
were invited to attend the meetings to ensure there was enhanced 
visibility of the principal risks affecting the business and good 
communication of the outcomes of our discussions to each of the 
businesses and functions.
Work of the committee in 2013
The committee discussed all of the key risks in depth in advance of 
the annual and half-year results process and produced a report on 
principal risks for the Board’s approval. It also discussed the work 
of the Crisis Management Team and agreed to hold more frequent 
crisis management exercises. During the year, work continued on 
the development of meaningful indicators to measure the principal

The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the General 
Counsel, the Director – Engineering and Technology, the Company 
Secretary, the Technical and Quality Director and the Head of 
Product Safety Assurance are also invited to attend meetings.
Key objective:
 review and assure the Board on all safety policies, practices and 
procedures and ensure that these operate reliably and to 
appropriate industry standards.
Responsibilities:
 keep product safety, HS&E, and personnel security policies 
under review;
 make recommendations as to content and communication 
of those policies;
 measure and review safety performance; and
 review external issues which relate to safety policies 
and practices.
Product safety
In all sectors, the Group supplies high value capital products that are 
strictly regulated with regard to safety. Civil aerospace products are 
required to meet relevant airworthiness authority standards, whilst 
defence operators define their own standards for military aerospace 
and naval products. Our Marine and Energy businesses need to 
meet industry specific standards with our Nuclear business being 
particularly highly regulated.
In June 2013, the committee reviewed a Trent case study which 
demonstrated how the Company’s product safety process operates 
in practice both in the design stage and during the operational life 
of an engine. The committee found this product safety process to be 
very thorough and of a very high standard. 
At its meeting in July 2013, the committee considered how the 
Group applied judgements in product safety beyond the levels 
defined in legislation. It received an update on the product safety 
management system and on recent developments in safety in the 
aerospace industry. It also examined the findings of the Australian 
Transport Safety Bureau in respect of the Qantas QF32 event and the 
actions taken by the Group. 
In September, the committee was briefed by senior manufacturing 
and quality managers from the supply chain units (SCUs), the 
Technical and Quality Director and the Head of Product Safety 
Assurance on the Rolls-Royce Management System as it applies to 
safety. This was followed by an in-depth look at the compressor SCU 
and the design to manufacture process for wide-chord fan blades 
as well as the process for monitoring on-going blade production. 
At our meeting in December, the committee reviewed how the 
Director – Engineering and Technology executes his accountability 
for product safety on behalf of the Chief Executive through the 
Company Product Safety Review Board and the Quality System. 
The committee also reviewed its own terms of reference.
Health, safety and environment
In July, the committee considered how the As Low as Reasonably 
Practical (ALARP) approach is applied to HS&E risks, and received 
updates on the global improvement programmes being 
implemented in relation to process safety management and 
electrical safety.
In December, we received an update on 2013 HS&E activity, 
including briefings on the global improvement programmes related 
to process safety, electrical safety and occupational health. 
Further information on our HS&E performance can be found in 
sustainability on pages 28 and 29.
Overall the committee made good progress in 2013, particularly in 
relation to examining the processes that manage product safety. 
Alongside this central theme, the areas of asset integrity, 
occupational safety, occupational health, environmental 
performance and personnel security arrangements for staff 
working in difficult environments were reviewed. In 2014, we intend 
to establish a framework for a structured cyclical review of all HS&E 
and personnel security matters.
This is a Company built on a brand promise of being ‘trusted to 
deliver excellence’ and the safety of our products and our people 
will always remain a central pillar of our business.

non-executive directors and met five times in 2013.

Dame Helen Alexander 5/5
Sir Frank Chapman 4/5
John McAdam 5/5
The Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Director – Human 
Resources, the HR Director – Reward & Pensions, the Company 
Secretary and the Chief Financial Officer are also invited to 
attend meetings. None of these executives were present during 
any discussion of their own remuneration packages.
Key objective:
 to develop a remuneration policy capable of attracting and 
retaining individuals necessary for business success.
Responsibilities:
 to consider and make recommendations to the Board on the 
policy for the remuneration of the executive directors, 
members of the Executive Leadership Team and other direct 
reportees to the Chief Executive (collectively the Senior 
Executives) and the Chairman;
 to determine the whole remuneration package for Senior 
Executives and recommend to the Board the whole 
remuneration package for the Chairman;
 to determine the terms and conditions of service contracts for 
Senior Executives;
 to determine the design, conditions and coverage of any annual 
and long-term incentive schemes for Senior Executives and to 
approve total and individual payments under these schemes;
 to determine targets for any annual and long-term incentive 
schemes;
 to determine the issue and terms of all share-based plans 
available to all employees;
 to determine compensation (if any) in the event of termination 
of service contracts of any of the Senior Executives; and
 to approve the appointment of former executive directors by 
the Company as consultants.
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our directors’ 
remuneration report that has been prepared in accordance 
with the new reporting regulations which became effective 
on 1 October 2013.
The report is divided into two sections. A policy report which sets 
out the approach to remuneration, and a remuneration report 
which details what has been paid to the directors during 2013. 
Each report will be proposed as a separate resolution at the AGM. 
The vote on the policy report is a binding vote.
The remuneration policy must be approved at least every three years 
if it remains unchanged, or sooner in the event the policy needs 
revising. The policy will become effective on 1 May 2014 subject to 
shareholder approval at the AGM. 
We have a clearly defined strategy to win in competitive markets 
through our focus on the customer, innovation and profitable 
growth. Our remuneration policy supports the delivery of this 
strategy and aligns the interests of our directors with that of our 
shareholders. This is achieved by short-term and long-term incentive 
plans which focus on delivering business objectives, profitable 
growth and strong shareholder returns. Annual incentives are also 
based on personal performance which will include the progress 
made on longer-term strategic objectives. An important principle 
of the annual bonus plan is that no bonus can be paid unless the 
entire Group has achieved a base level of business performance. 
For the first time, the bonus and PSP targets we set in 2014 will 
include both profit and cash contributions from Rolls-Royce Power 
Systems. We believe this is appropriate now that Rolls-Royce Power 
Systems is being integrated into the Rolls-Royce business.
Our overall remuneration policy remains relatively conservative 
which has served us well in recent years. There will be no increase in 
basic pay for most of the senior leadership team in 2014. We remain 
satisfied that the existing remuneration arrangements continue to 
align with the Group’s strategy and there are no plans to change the 
current arrangements significantly. The committee will continue to 
monitor our market competitiveness in order to ensure we are able 
to attract and retain the best talent.
Annual bonus
For executive directors and all senior managers, a proportion of any 
annual bonus is made in deferred shares. The committee has agreed 
to allow flexibility to allot new shares to satisfy awards and this 
provision will be part of the new Rolls-Royce plc Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan which will be proposed at this year’s AGM.
Dame Helen Alexander
Chairman of the remuneration committee
We believe that our remuneration policy 
is aligned with our strategy to enhance 
long-term value for our stakeholders.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT Performance Share Plan
The current Performance Share Plan (PSP), approved by shareholders 
ten years ago, expires in 2014. A new PSP will be put forward for 
approval at the AGM. This will be broadly unchanged with the 
following two exceptions which we believe increase the link to 
shareholder interests:
 the new plan will contain malus and clawback provisions to enable 
the withdrawal or amendment of share grants before vesting and 
the right to reclaim awards that have vested or their proceeds in 
the case of serious non-compliance with the Group’s Global Code 
of Conduct, reputational damage or gross misconduct; and
 the directors will be obliged to retain half of all PSP shares released 
to them until a multiple of salary is reached. The shareholding 
requirement has been increased to 250 per cent of salary for the 
Chief Executive and 200 per cent of salary for the other executive 
directors. The share retention policy is explained on page 66. 
Annual bonus outcome
This year’s bonus reflects on-target performance. Group underlying 
profit was £1,500 million which met the base level performance,  
and there was a net cash inflow of £312 million which resulted in an 
annual bonus outcome of 60 per cent. The targets and results exclude 
Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG (previously named Tognum AG).
PSP outcome
Over the three-year performance period for the 2011 PSP grant, 
earnings per share growth was 60 per cent, which exceeded the 
OECD index of consumer prices of six per cent, and cash flow per 
share was 86p. This resulted in 100 per cent of the shares 
conditionally granted being released. The Company’s Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) performance was ninth in the FTSE 100 over 
the three-year performance period which resulted in a 50 per cent 
increase in the number of shares released to executive directors.
Summary of activity during 2013
During 2013, amongst other things, the committee:
 endorsed the out-turn of the 2012 annual bonus and 2010 PSP;
 reviewed executive directors’ base salary levels;
 set 2013 annual bonus targets and performance targets for the 
PSP 2013 – 2015;
 recommended the approval of the 2012 remuneration report  
to the Board;
 approved PSP grants to certain senior management;
 considered the structure of the annual bonus for 2014;
 considered the new BIS regulations in respect of drafting the 
remuneration report;
 considered the projected out-turns for the 2013 annual bonus, 
All-Employee Bonus Scheme and the 2011 PSP;
 considered a benchmarking report for the executive salary review 
in 2014; and
 reviewed its own terms of reference.
We believe our current remuneration practices are in line with  
the new reporting regulations and we welcome the structure and 
transparency introduced by the new requirements. Overall, we 
believe that our remuneration policy is aligned with our strategy  
to enhance long-term value for our stakeholders.
Dame Helen Alexander 
Chairman of the remuneration committee
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 54 Directors’ report
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT Remuneration policy framework
The Group is committed to achieving sustained improvements  
in performance and this depends crucially on the individual 
contributions made by the executive team and by employees at all 
levels. The Board believes that an effective remuneration strategy 
plays an essential part in the future success of the Group.
Accordingly, the remuneration policy will continue to reflect the 
following broad principles:
 the remuneration of executive directors and other senior 
executives should reflect their responsibilities and contain 
incentives to deliver the Group’s performance objectives without 
encouraging excessive risk taking;
 remuneration must be capable of attracting and retaining  
the individuals necessary for business success;
 remuneration policy must be sufficiently flexible to take  
account of changes in the Group’s business environment and 
market practices;
 total remuneration should be based on Group and individual 
performance, both in the short and long term;
 the system of remuneration should establish a close identity of 
interest between senior executives and shareholders through 
measures such as encouraging the senior executives to acquire 
shares in the Company. Therefore a significant proportion of 
senior executive remuneration will comprise share-based 
long-term incentives; and
 when determining remuneration, the committee will take into 
account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Policy report
The policy will start on 1 May 2014, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM.

Salary It is essential that the 
Company provides 
competitive salaries, 
suitable to attract 
and retain individuals 
of the right calibre to 
develop and execute 
the business strategy. 
Salary levels are set using careful 
judgement, taking into account  
the scope of the role and 
responsibilities, performance, 
experience, potential, retention 
issues and salaries elsewhere in the 
Group. Judgement will be informed, 
but not led, by reference to 
companies of a similar size, 
complexity and internationality.
Salaries are reviewed annually and 
normally fixed for 12 months from 
1 March each year. However, salary 
increases are not automatic. 
Exceptionally, salaries may be 
increased on other dates in the year. 
Executive directors may be 
appointed at salaries below the 
target level to enable pay 
progression commensurate with 
growth in the new role. 
Annual salary increases will not 
normally exceed average increases 
for employees in other appropriate 
parts of the Group. 
On occasion, increases may be 
larger where the committee 
considers this to be necessary. 
Circumstances where this may apply 
include: growth into a role; to 
reflect a change in scope of role and 
responsibilities; where market 
conditions indicate a level of under 
competitiveness and the committee 
judges that there is a risk in relation 
to attracting or retaining 
executives.
Where the committee exercises its 
discretion to award increases above 
the average for other employees, the 
resulting salary will not exceed the 
competitive market range.
None, although individual 
performance is the primary 
consideration in setting salary 
alongside overall Company 
affordability and market 
competitiveness.

Benefits To provide market-
competitive benefits 
sufficient to recruit 
and retain, and to 
support the 
executive to give 
maximum attention 
to their role.
Benefits provided include a car or 
car allowance, contribution to the 
cost of fuel, use of a driver, financial 
planning assistance, life assurance 
and medical insurance. Other 
appropriate benefits may be 
provided from time-to-time at the 
discretion of the committee.
Certain benefits, such as 
accommodation or use of a driver, 
are to enable an executive to devote 
maximum time and attention to 
their role. Club membership fees 
may also be provided. The Group 
may pay any tax due on these 
benefits.
The Group offers relocation for 
executives to be located within 
reasonable reach of their place  
of work. Where relocation is not 
practical or a preferred option, or 
where work is mainly split between 
two locations, support for 
accommodation and travel may 
be provided.
Relocation support may include 
items such as transaction and legal 
fees, removals, disturbance 
allowance and temporary travel  
and subsistence costs. International 
relocation support may include 
items such as school fees, tax 
equalisation and home visits.
Benefits will be market competitive 
taking into account the role and the 
local market.
Benefits excluding any 
accommodation, relocation and 
associated tax costs will not exceed 
£100,000 per annum. 
The value of benefits provided for 
international and domestic 
relocation and any ongoing 
accommodation and travel support 
will be appropriate to the individual 
circumstances of the executive and 
only expenses that the committee 
considers necessary and appropriate 
will be supported.
None.
Pension To provide market-
competitive 
pensions sufficient 
to recruit and retain.
New executives to the Company are 
offered membership of a defined 
contribution pension plan. Pension 
contributions are based on base 
salary only.
There are a number of legacy 
pension arrangements, including 
defined benefit plans, which were in 
place before 27 June 2012 and have 
not changed since. Commitments  
to these arrangements will be 
honoured. 
Executives may opt to receive a cash 
allowance in lieu of pension.
The maximum employer 
contribution to defined 
contribution pension arrangements 
is 38% of base salary. Under the 
Group’s legacy defined benefit 
arrangements, the pension due is 
the higher of a pension based on  
the executive’s final salary, with a 
maximum annual accrual rate of 
2.5%, or based on career average 
salary with a maximum annual 
accrual rate of 3.3%. The resulting 
pension is limited so that the 
maximum pension at normal 
retirement age is two thirds of the 
executive’s final remuneration. The 
benefits under these arrangements 
include a lump sum payable on 
death in service and pensions for 
surviving spouses, civil partners 
and certain dependants.

Executives may opt to receive a cash 
allowance in lieu of pension. The 
cash allowance is calculated to be 
equivalent to the employer’s defined

reduced to allow for the additional 
National Insurance cost incurred  
by the employer.
James Guyette participates in 
qualified and non-qualified defined 
benefit and defined contribution 
pension arrangements in the US. 
Under these various arrangements 
combined it is expected that the 
benefits provided by the Company 
will be equivalent in value to a 
pension of two thirds of salary, with 
post retirement increases similar to 
those required by statute in the UK. 
Annual 
bonus
To incentivise and 
reward execution of 
the business strategy, 
delivery of financial 
performance targets 
and achievement of 
personal objectives.
Compulsory deferral 
of part of any bonus 
encourages retention 
and provides 
alignment with 
shareholders.
The committee sets Group financial 
targets and agrees personal 
objectives for each executive director 
at the start of the financial year.  
At the end of the year, business 
performance determines the 
Company bonus payout level and the 
committee considers whether any 
adjustment to the payout level is 
appropriate. Each executive 
director’s bonus is also dependent on 
the achievement of their personal 
objectives and wider contribution to 
the Group. The committee may apply 
an uplift of up to 20% or a reduction, 
potentially to zero, as appropriate.
A portion of the bonus paid, in a 
range 30% to 50%, is compulsorily 
deferred into the Company’s shares 
for a period of two years and is 
subject to continued employment 
(with early release in certain 
circumstances). There are no further 
performance conditions. 
Deferred shares may receive a bonus 
issue of C Shares or equivalent 
during the deferral period. 
The bonus plan is non-contractual 
and may be offered on a year-by-year 
basis. The committee has the right to 
apply the malus provision on an 
individual or group basis and amend 
or withdraw the bonus before 
payment. From 2014, the same right 
over deferred shares will apply as will 
the right to clawback bonuses paid or 
vested shares on an individual basis 
if it can be demonstrated that 
individuals have acted in an 
improper manner. Malus and/or 
clawback provisions may apply in 
exceptional cases such as: material 
misstatement of results; a material 
failure of risk management; serious 
reputational damage; serious 
individual wrongdoing such as 
non-compliance with the Company’s 
Code of Conduct; or gross 
misconduct. 
The current maximum annual 
bonus, linked to business 
performance, is 135% of salary for 
the Chief Executive and 125% for 
other executive directors. This is 
based on achieving the highest 
targets set for business performance. 
However, the committee may adjust 
the bonus to reflect personal 
performance as described in the 
previous column, giving an overall 
maximum of 162% and 150% 
respectively.
The committee has the discretion to 
increase the overall maximum bonus 
level to 200% of salary for the Chief 
Executive and 175% for other 
executive directors, subject to this 
not being above the competitive 
market range.
The bonus payout level is 
determined primarily by Group 
financial performance but the 
committee may introduce 
non-financial metrics and/or 
adjust the payout level to reflect 
other factors as appropriate.  
The final bonus awarded to each 
director is also linked to their 
personal performance.
Any non-financial metrics used  
in the annual bonus plan will be 
linked to the Group’s strategy and 
will not be weighted more than 
50% of the whole bonus. A 
principle applies that no bonus is 
payable unless the base financial 
targets are achieved and this also 
applies if non-financial measures 
are introduced.
Based on the current bonus 
opportunity:
Chief Executive: Bonus generated 
by business performance is 40% 
of salary for achieving the base 
level targets and 135% of salary 
for achieving the highest level of 
targets. Bonus may then be 
adjusted for personal 
performance in a range 0-120%  
at committee discretion with 
100% typically applying for good 
performance and a 20% uplift 
available for outstanding 
personal performance.
Other executive directors:  
Bonus generated by business 
performance is 37% of salary for 
achieving the base level targets 
and 125% of salary for achieving 
the highest level of targets.  
Bonus may then be adjusted for 
personal performance as above.

Share Plan

Post 2014

To incentivise and

and execution of the 
business strategy 
over the longer term.
The plan provides 
alignment with 
shareholder interests 
through the 
performance 
measures chosen 
and a retention 
element through  
the plan timescale. 
A shareholding 
requirement is linked 
to the PSP in order  
to further provide 
alignment with  
shareholders. 
The link between the 
performance 
measures and the 
Company’s strategy 
is explained in the 
notes to this table on 
page 59.
Executive directors are granted 
awards over shares annually at the 
start of a three-year performance 
period. The proportion of the those 
awards that vest is determined at 
the end of the period according  
to a set of Company performance 
measures.
Vesting of awards is subject to 
continued employment until 
vesting date with the exception  
of certain leaver circumstances,  
in which case vesting is subject  
to Company performance and 
pro-rating for service.
The plan rules contain malus and 
clawback provisions. The committee 
has the right to amend and 
withdraw share grants before 
vesting for individuals and groups 
and the right to reclaim vested 
shares or their proceeds from 
individuals where it has been 
demonstrated that they acted in  
an improper manner. Situations 
where the provisions will apply are 
as described in the bonus section  
on page 57. 
Executive directors are required to 
hold a level of shareholding as 
described on page 66.
The Chief Executive is granted 
awards each year over shares to the 
value of 120% of salary. Other 
executive directors are granted 
100% of salary. Subject to the 
earnings per share (EPS) condition 
being met, these shares vest at the 
end of the performance period if  
the Company has achieved the 
maximum target set for cash flow 
per share (CPS). The number of 
shares vesting can be increased by 
25% for above median TSR ranking 
rising to 50% increase for upper 
quartile TSR ranking.
Maximum face values of annual 
awards are therefore 180% of salary 
for the Chief Executive and 150% of 
salary for other executive directors.
 
The three corporate performance 
measures are:
1. EPS – condition.
The increase in EPS over the 
three-year period must exceed  
an appropriate index of consumer 
prices for the same period. If this 
condition is not met share vesting 
is zero.
2. CPS – prime measure. 
The aggregate CPS over the 
performance period will 
determine the number of shares 
which vest. Achieving a base 
target of CPS will result in 30% of 
the shares vesting and achieving 
a maximum CPS target will cause 
100% of the shares to vest. The 
number of shares which may vest 
is determined on a straight-line 
basis between the 30% and 
100% level.
3. Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
relative to FTSE 100 or other 
appropriate index. The number  
of shares vesting will be increased 
by 25% if the Company’s TSR is 
ranked above the median of the 
FTSE 100, or other appropriate 
index, over the same periods and 
by 50% if ranked at or above the 
upper quartile of the same group. 
Intermediate TSR ranking will 
increase the number of shares 
released on a straight-line basis.

Performance  
measures
Fees To reward 
individuals for 
fulfilling the relevant 
role and to attract 
individuals of the 
skills and calibre 
required.
The committee makes 
recommendations to the Board on 
the remuneration of the Chairman. 
The Chairman and the executive 
directors determine the 
remuneration for the non-executive 
directors. The level of remuneration 
is set within a limit approved from 
time-to-time by shareholders.
The Chairman is paid a single 
consolidated fee. Other non-
executive directors are paid a base 
fee covering Board and committee 
membership. Committee chairmen 
and the Senior Independent Director 
receive an additional fee. 
The Articles of Association require 
the Company to set a maximum 
ceiling on the total remuneration 
payable to non-executive directors 
including the non-executive 
Chairman. A resolution to increase 
this to £1,400,000 will be proposed 
at the 2014 AGM. 
Fees are set at a level appropriate for 
the role and are reviewed regularly, 
taking in to account fees payable to 
non-executive directors of 
companies of a similar size and 
complexity.
None
Benefits To devote maximum 
time and attention 
to the requirements  
of the role.
The Chairman has occasional  
use of chauffeur services. 
Travel, hotel and subsistence 
expenses incurred in attending 
Board meetings and committee 
meetings or otherwise required to 
attend the Company’s offices are 
reimbursed by the Company.  
The Group may pay any tax due  
on such benefits.
Where a non-executive director is 
based outside the UK and has to file 
a UK tax return, the Company may 
pay towards tax advice and filing.
The maximum value for chauffeur 
services will not exceed £25,000  
per annum. 
The maximum contribution 
towards tax advice and filing is 
£5,000 per annum.
None
Performance measures and targets
The annual bonus measures are primarily based on Group financial 
performance but may contain non-financial measures as detailed  
in the above table. 
The committee will set the Group financial targets with reference to 
the prior year and to the budgets and business plans for the coming 
year, ensuring the levels to achieve base, on-target and maximum 
bonus payout are appropriately challenging.
The PSP performance measures set out in the policy table support 
the Group’s strategy as follows:
 the EPS growth hurdle ensures any payout is supported by 
sound profitability;
 the aggregate CPS measure incentivises the generation of cash 
flow in line with the Group’s strategy. This measure is set in line 
with the principles described for the annual bonus; and
 the TSR performance measure aligns interests with shareholders by 
rewarding TSR out-performance. The TSR is measured with reference 
to constituents of an appropriate index such as the FTSE 100.
In accordance with the rules of the PSP , the performance condition 
may be replaced or varied if an event occurs or circumstances arise 
which cause the committee to determine that the performance 
conditions have ceased to be appropriate. If the performance 
condition is varied or replaced, the amended performance 
conditions must, in the opinion of the committee, be fair, reasonable 
and materially no more or less difficult than the original condition 
when set.
Shareholders’ views 
This statement of remuneration policy is largely a consolidation of 
policies which have enjoyed the support of shareholders for many 
years. We have considered the guidance provided by the GC 100  
and shareholder advisory groups in preparing this policy and have 
followed this insofar as it is appropriate in the context of our 
business. Prior to finalising the policy, we have shared it with a 
selection of major shareholders. Looking ahead, we welcome an open 
dialogue with shareholders and intend to continue to consult with 
major shareholders before implementing any significant change.
Group employee considerations 
When setting remuneration for executive directors the committee 
takes into account contextual information about pay and conditions 
within the Group, including the following:
 salary increases for the all-employee population;
 bonus awards for the all-employee population; and
 pay ratios between executive directors and other employees.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 59
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information Rolls-Royce employs over 55,000 people in more than 50 countries. 
Inevitably remuneration arrangements differ to reflect local 
markets, but some common themes apply to employees at all 
levels worldwide:
 we aim to offer competitive levels of remuneration, benefits 
and incentives to attract and retain employees;
 all employees participate in bonus arrangements where the bonus 
is determined by the same financial measures as that applicable 
to executive directors; and
 all employees have the opportunity to participate in a savings 
related share option plan.
At more senior levels, remuneration is increasingly long term and 
larger proportions are dependent on both Group and individual 
performance and paid in the form of shares.
Given the scale of the employee population, the committee 
considered that it would be impractical to consult all employees 
when drawing up the policy.

Service contracts
UK-based executive directors’ contracts include the 
following provisions:
 12 months’ notice of termination from Rolls-Royce;
 6 months’ notice of termination from the executive; and 
 reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
The committee recognises that in the case of appointments to 
the Board from outside the Group, it may be necessary to offer 
a longer initial notice period, which would subsequently reduce 
to 12 months after that initial period.
The policy on exit payments is set out in the next section. The 
following table summarises the terms of the executive directors’ 
service contracts:

Colin Smith CBE 1 July 2005 12 months 6 months
James Guyette has a contract with Rolls-Royce North America Inc., 
drawn up under the laws of the State of Virginia, US. This provides 
that, on termination without cause, he is entitled to 12 months’ 
severance pay without mitigation and, in addition, appropriate costs 
incurred in relocating household and personal effects. The contract 
also provides for the payment of club membership fees and for tax 
and financial planning up to a maximum of US$15,000 per annum 
and the Group will gross up any amounts to cover any applicable 
taxes arising.
All contracts also include the entitlement to paid holidays, sick pay 
and other standard employee terms.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors have letters of 
appointment rather than service contracts. No compensation is 
payable to the Chairman or to any non-executive director if the 
appointment is terminated early or if they fail to be re-elected 
at an AGM.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY  Policy on exit payments
The notice period the Company is required to give to executive 
directors under their contracts of employment is 12 months. 
Payment in lieu of notice will not exceed the value of 12 months’ 
salary, benefits and pension contributions. Both mitigation and  
the staggering of payments through the notice period will be 
considered by the committee where appropriate, as will the funding 
of reasonable outplacement and other professional fees. Should 
additional compensation matters arise, such as a settlement or 
compromise agreement, the committee will exercise judgement 
and will take into account the specific commercial circumstances.
Pension benefits on early retirement should be payable in 
accordance with the normal rules of the relevant pension plan. 
Under legacy UK defined benefit pension arrangements, accrued 
pension is reduced to reflect early receipt in accordance with factors 
set by the trustees from time-to-time and is limited to a maximum 
pension of two thirds of the executive’s final remuneration, 
pro-rated by actual service to potential service.
The committee has the discretion to preserve incentive awards 
pro-rated to service and to release deferred shares. In exercising this 
discretion, the committee will have regard to performance and the 
circumstances of leaving. For deferred shares these are usually 
released in cases such as retirement, death, injury, ill-health and 
redundancy.
For PSP , the rules state that unvested awards may be preserved at 
the committee’s discretion according to the circumstances. In such 
cases vesting will be at the normal date, subject to the established 
performance conditions, and pro rata to employment in the 
performance period. In cases such as death and terminal illness, the 
committee also has the discretion to vest the awards immediately 
using an estimate of future out-turn.
The treatment of leavers in the Company’s ShareSave and SIP plans  
is governed by the plan rules. The UK rules are HMRC approved.  
An executive director who has ShareSave options who retires or who 
leaves the Company through ill-health, disability or redundancy will 
be entitled to exercise their options, pro rata to the savings made, 
within six months of leaving the Company. An executive director 
who leaves in any other manner such as dismissal would only be 
entitled to have their savings returned to them. Participants in  
the SIP who leave the Company for the same reasons listed above 
will have their shares released to them free of tax and National 
Insurance contributions.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, PSP awards will 
vest based on the extent to which the committee determines the 
performance conditions have been or would have been met. 
Pro-rating for service in the performance period will apply. Deferred 
shares earned under APRA would vest in full. ShareSave options would 
immediately be exercisable pro rata to savings made. Consideration 
received as shares would be held in the SIP , if possible, otherwise the 
consideration would be treated as a disposal from the SIP .
If awards are made on recruitment (such as buy-outs) the treatment 
on leaving would be determined at the time at the committee’s 
discretion.
Policy on new appointments 
The committee will normally award newly appointed executive 
directors with a remuneration package which is consistent with the 
policy and principles as set out in this report. Base salary may be set 
at a level higher or lower than previous incumbents and in certain 
circumstances, to facilitate the recruitment of individuals of the 
required calibre, the committee may use its discretion to make 
individual additional incentive awards up to a maximum of 
100 per cent of annual salary. Incentive levels may also be increased 
by up to 30 per cent of salary per annum for incentives commencing 
within two years of joining. This level of discretion is considered 
appropriate given the current conservative market positioning of 
Rolls-Royce and our potential need to recruit from other market 
sectors or countries outside of the UK.
In addition, remuneration forfeited on resignation from a previous 
employer may be compensated. The form of this compensation 
would be considered on a case-by-case basis and may comprise 
either cash or shares. Generally: 
 if such remuneration was in the form of shares, compensation  
will be in the Company’s shares;
 if remuneration was subject to achievement of performance 
conditions, compensation will be subject to Rolls-Royce 
performance conditions; and
 the timing of any compensation will, where practicable, match  
the vesting schedule of the remuneration forfeited.
A newly appointed executive director may be provided with 
reasonable relocation support as set out in the policy table.  
Internal appointments would receive a remuneration package  
that is consistent with the remuneration policy. Legacy terms and 
conditions would be honoured, including pension entitlements  
and any outstanding incentive awards. 
If an executive director is appointed following a merger or an 
acquisition of a company by Rolls-Royce, of which the executive 
director was employed, legacy terms and conditions may be 
honoured.
Legacy commitments
Contractual commitments made before 27 June 2012 and before the 
policy comes into effect will be honoured. This will include grants  
made under the old PSP arrangement which will vest, subject to the 
performance criteria being achieved after the adoption of this policy,  
as well as previous contractual provisions relating to the defined 
benefit pension scheme. 
The committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out 
above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax, administrative purposes  
or to take account of a change in legislation) without obtaining 
shareholder approval for that amendment.
The remuneration policy report was approved by the Board on  
12 February 2014 and signed on its behalf.

(c)   Bonus. This is the total APRA bonus earned in 2013. The bonus, based on Group profit and cash performance, was 60 per cent of the 
maximum as detailed on page 57. Personal performance is taken into account in determining individual bonuses payable. The awards 
made to John Rishton and James Guyette included a modification for personal performance of 110 per cent and 105 per cent 
respectively. 60 per cent of the bonus is paid as cash and 40 per cent is deferred into shares for two years subject to continuous 
employment with the Group.
(d)  Long-term incentives. This is the estimated value of the PSP shares that are due to vest in March 2014 (2013 being the final year of the 
performance period) and for John Rishton, as well as his PSP shares, the performance related shares he received on joining the 
Company. It is based on the number of shares that will vest multiplied by the average share price of 1184.52p over the quarter ending 
31 December 2013 (as the vesting price is not known at the date of approval of the remuneration report). Performance has already 
been determined for these awards as detailed on page 64 and 150 per cent of the original award will vest, based on achievement of 
the EPS growth hurdle, the maximum CPS target and TSR performance in the upper quartile of FTSE 100 companies. The share price at 
the date of vesting for the PSP in 2013 was 1020.52p. The vesting price for John Rishton’s release of the performance related and 
restricted shares in 2013 was 1048p.
(e)   Value of the gain made on the exercise of ShareSave options is the difference between the exercise price of 387p and the mid-market 
price of 1062p on the date of exercise. ShareSave is not subject to performance conditions and the UK plan rules are HMRC approved.
(f)   Pensions. For defined benefit plans, this is the increase in pension benefit net of inflation for the current year and applying the HMRC 
methodology multiplier of 20. Cash in lieu of pension accrual is also included.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT Implementation of remuneration policy 
Information on the elements of remuneration and how the 
Company intends to implement the remuneration policy in 2014  
are set out below and on pages 64 to 66.
Base salary 
The committee reviewed the salary levels of executive directors and 
decided not to award any increases for 2014.
Name Base salary
James Guyette $840,000
Mark Morris £510,000
John Rishton £925,000
Colin Smith CBE £525,000
Annual bonus 
The annual bonus pool is delivered under APRA.
In 2013, executive directors were eligible for award levels as detailed 
in the policy report on page 57.
APRA 2013 performance measures
The APRA bonus is determined by Group financial performance  
and personal performance. 
For 2013, the Group financial measures were cash-flow performance 
and profit. Targets for both measures were set as follows:
% of maximum bonus
Base 15%
Target 30%
Maximum 50%
The Group financial performance is the addition of the cash and 
profit out-turns, provided a specified minimum level is achieved  
on both, after deduction of the cost of bonus from profit, otherwise 
no bonus is payable.
The 2013 financial performance which resulted in the APRA bonus 
out-turn of 60 per cent was as follows:
Group underlying  
profit
Group underlying profit* was £1,500 million  
which matched the base level but fell short of 
the on-target level of £1,530 million. 
The profit performance resulted in achievement 
of 15%.
Cash flow Cash flow* for the year was £312 million which 
exceeded both the on-target level of break-even 
and the maximum target of £200 million. 
The cash flow performance resulted in the 
achievement of 50%.
Overall award The minimum level of profit after the cost of 
bonus, necessary to enable payment of bonus 
was £1,500 million. To ensure this was achieved 
the bonus earned through the separate profit 
and cash elements was limited to 60% of the 
maximum.
*  Group underlying profit and cash flow excludes the results of Rolls-Royce Power 
Systems AG (previously named Tognum AG), the impact of acquisitions and disposals  
in the year and unbudgeted foreign exchange translation effects where material.
The extent of this disclosure reflects the Board’s view that APRA 
profit and cash targets are commercially sensitive. This will be kept 
under review.
Deferred APRA awards in March 2013 (subject to audit)
For executive directors and other senior executives, 40 per cent  
of APRA was delivered in deferred shares. As detailed on page 57, 
ordinary shares held as deferred shares may receive a bonus issue  
of C Shares during the deferral period.

All awards are made as performance shares based on a percentage  
of salary and the value is divided by the average share price over a 
three-day period which was 1023.33p before to the date of grant.  
The face value is the maximum number of shares that would vest 
(150 per cent of the award) multiplied by the share price at the date  
of grant. If the base EPS or CPS targets are not achieved, no shares vest.

CPS is calculated as reported cash flow before the cost of business 
acquisitions or proceeds of disposals, foreign exchange translation 
effects, special payments into pension schemes and payments to 
shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of shares  
in issue.
We believe that the combination of EPS, CPS and TSR targets are 
challenging and that the performance necessary to achieve awards 
towards the upper end of the range is stretching. They should not, 
therefore, be interpreted as providing guidance on the Group’s 
performance over the relevant period.
Non-executive directors’ fees paid
The Chairman and the other non-executive directors are not  
eligible to participate in any of the Group’s share schemes, incentive 
arrangements or pension schemes. A facility is in place which 
enables non-executive directors to use some or all of their fees, after 
the appropriate statutory deductions, to make market purchases of 
shares in the Company on a monthly basis.

Pension entitlements (subject to audit) 
The Group’s UK pension schemes are funded, registered schemes and were approved under the regime applying until 6 April 2006. They 
include both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. In the defined benefit pension schemes normal retirement  
age is 62.
John Rishton is a member of one of the Group’s UK defined contribution pension schemes and received employer contributions restricted 
to the annual allowance limits with any excess paid as a cash allowance. The cash allowance is calculated as equivalent to the cost of the 
pension contributions allowing for National Insurance costs.
Mark Morris opted out of future pension accrual and salary linkage with effect from 16 August 2012 and receives a cash allowance in lieu 
of future pension accrual.
Colin Smith CBE opted out of future pension accrual with effect from 1 April 2006 and receives a cash allowance in lieu of future 
pension accrual. 
James Guyette participates in pension plans sponsored by Rolls-Royce North America Inc. He is a member of two defined benefit plans in 
the US, one qualified and one non-qualified. He accrues a retirement lump sum benefit in both of these plans. In addition, James Guyette is 
a member of two 401(k) Savings Plans in the US, one qualified and one non-qualified, to which both he and his employer, Rolls-Royce North 
America Inc., contribute. He is also a member of an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan in the US, to which his employer 
makes notional contributions. Under the defined benefit plans, the earliest age at which benefits can be taken without consent and 
without actuarial reduction by James Guyette is age 65.

Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information Share retention policy (subject to audit)
We believe it is important that the interests of the executive directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders. The deferred 
APRA award and the PSP provide considerable alignment. However, participants in the PSP are also required to retain at least one half of the 
number of after-tax shares released from the PSP , until the value of their shareholding reaches the percentage of salary shown in the table 
below. When this level is reached it must be maintained until retirement or departure from the Group. The director’s total shareholding,  
for the purposes of comparing it with the minimum shareholding requirement, includes shares held: by their connected persons; in the SIP; 
APRA deferred shares that have not vested; and PSP shares that have vested but does not included unvested PSP awards. The shareholding 
requirement will increase in 2014 to 250 per cent of salary for the Chief Executive and 200 per cent of salary for the other executive 
directors. APRA deferred shares will no longer count towards their minimum shareholding requirement.
As at 31 December 2013, the executive directors each complied with the 2013 minimum shareholding requirement as detailed in the  
table below:

 a five-year history of our Chief Executive’s remuneration; 
 our TSR performance over the same period; 
 a comparison of the year-on-year change in our Chief Executive’s remuneration with the change in average remuneration across the 
Group; and 
 a year-on-year comparison of the total amount spent on pay across the Group with profit before tax and dividends paid.

 On 31 March 2011, Sir John Rose retired as Chief Executive and John Rishton was appointed.

  The remuneration for Sir John Rose does not include any pension accrual or contribution  
as he was receiving his pension from 1 February 2008. John Rishton received a special grant 
of shares on joining the Company on 1 March 2011 to mirror the shares he forfeited on 
resigning from his previous employer. The share price has increased from 483.50p at the 
time this grant was made to 1275p at the end of 2013. These are the main reasons why  
John Rishton’s remuneration exceeds that of his predecessor.
Five-year TSR performance
The Company’s TSR performance over the previous five years 
compared to a broad equity market index is shown in the graph 
opposite. The FTSE 100 has been chosen as the comparator because 
it contains a broad range of other UK listed companies.
The graph shows the growth in value of a hypothetical £100 holding 
in the Company’s ordinary shares over five years, relative to the  
FTSE 100 index. The values of the hypothetical £100 holdings at the 
end of the five-year period were £432.40 and £183.10 respectively.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT Advisers to the committee
During the year, the committee had access to advice from Deloitte 
LLP’s executive compensation advisory practice. Total fees for advice 
provided to the committee during the year by Deloitte were 
£120,850. Deloitte also advised the Company on tax, assurance, 
pensions and corporate finance and Deloitte MCS Limited provides 
consulting services. 
Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and adheres to its code in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting. The committee requests Deloitte to attend meetings 
periodically during the year. The committee is satisfied that the 
advice it has received has been objective and independent.

Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013, the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority and the relevant schedules of the Companies Act 2006.

ordinary shareholders of 22 pence for each ordinary share.

the ‘Shareholder information’ section of this report on page 139 or 
by visiting the Group’s website www.rolls-royce.com/investors/
share_information. 
Share class rights
The rights and obligations attaching to the different classes of 
shares are summarised below. The full rights are set out in the 
Company’s Articles of Association, the latest copy of which can be 
found on the Group’s website at www.rolls-royce.com.
Ordinary shares
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s 
annual report. They are also entitled: to attend and speak at general 
meetings of the Company; to appoint one or more proxies or, if they 
are corporations, corporate representatives; and to exercise voting 
rights. They have the right to ask questions at the AGM relating to 
the business of the meeting and for these to be answered, unless 
such answer would interfere unduly with the business of the 
meeting, involve the disclosure of confidential information, if the 
answer has already been published on the Group’s website or if it is 
not in the interests of the Group or the good order of the meeting 
that the question be answered. Holders of ordinary shares may 
receive a bonus issue of C Shares or a dividend and on liquidation 
may share in the assets of the Company.
C Shares
The Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares 
(C Shares) as an alternative to paying a cash dividend. 
Shareholders can choose to:
 redeem all C Shares for cash;
 redeem all C Shares for cash and reinvest the proceeds in 
additional ordinary shares using the CRIP operated by the 
Registrar; or
 keep the C Shares. 
Any C Shares retained have limited voting rights and attract a 
dividend of 75 per cent of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each 
share, paid on a twice-yearly basis. The Company has the option to 
redeem the C Shares compulsorily, at any time, if the aggregate 
number of C Shares in issue is less than ten per cent of the aggregate 
number of all C Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital 
restructuring of the Company.
On a return of capital on a winding-up, the holders of C Shares are 
entitled, in priority to any payment to the holders of ordinary shares, 
to the repayment of the nominal capital paid-up or credited as 
paid-up on the C Shares held by them, together with a sum equal to 
the outstanding preferential dividend which has been accrued but 
not paid until the date of return of capital.
The holders of C Shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote at a 
general meeting only if a resolution to wind up the Company is to  
be considered, in which case they may vote only on such resolution.
Special Share
Certain rights attach to the special rights non-voting share (Special 
Share) issued to HM Government (Special Shareholder). Subject to 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Treasury Solicitor may 
redeem the Special Share at par at any time. The Special Share 
confers no rights to dividends but in the event of a winding-up it 
must be repaid at its nominal value in priority to any other shares.
Certain Articles that relate to the rights attached to the Special Share 
may only be altered with the consent of the Special Shareholder. 
Such Articles include: (i) the foreign shareholding limit provisions 
whereby a foreign person cannot hold more than a 15 per cent 
voting interest in the Company; and (ii) the nationality of directors 
provisions whereby at least the Chairman or the Chief Executive 
must be a British citizen and at least half of the number of directors 
must be British citizens. The Special Shareholder is not entitled to 
vote at any general meeting or any other meeting of any class of 
shareholders.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 70 Directors’ report
SHAREHOLDERS AND SHARE CAPITAL Restrictions on transfer of shares and limitations on holdings
There are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding  
of the ordinary shares or C Shares other than under the Articles of 
Association (as described here), under restrictions imposed by law  
or regulation (for example, insider trading laws) or pursuant to the 
Company’s share dealing code. The Articles of Association provide 
that the Company should be and remain under United Kingdom 
control. As such, an individual foreign shareholding limit is set at  
15 per cent of the aggregate votes attaching to the share capital of 
all classes (taken as a whole) and capable of being cast on a poll and 
to all other shares that the directors determine are to be included  
in the calculation of such holding. The Special Share may only be 
issued to, held by and transferred to the Special Shareholder or his 
successor or nominee.
Shareholder agreements and consent requirements
There are no known arrangements under which financial rights 
carried by any of the shares in the Company are held by a person 
other than the holder of the shares and no known agreements 
between the holders of shares with restrictions on the transfer of 
shares or exercise of voting rights. No disposal may be made to a 
non-Group member which, alone or when aggregated with the 
same or a connected transaction, constitutes a disposal of the whole 
or a material part of either the nuclear business or the assets of the 
Group as a whole, without consent of the Special Shareholder.
Authority to issue shares
At the AGM in 2013, authority was given to the directors to allot new 
ordinary shares up to a nominal value of £124,821,118, equivalent to 
one-third of the issued share capital of the Company.
This is called the first section 551 amount. In addition, a special 
resolution was passed to effect a disapplication of pre-emption 
rights for a maximum of five per cent of the issued share capital of 
the Company. These authorities are valid until the AGM in 2014, and 
the directors propose to renew these authorities at that AGM. It is 
proposed to seek a further authority, at the AGM in 2014 to allot up 
to two thirds of the total issued share capital, but only in the case  
of a rights issue. This is called the second section 551 amount.
The Board believes that this additional authority will allow the 
Company to retain the maximum possible flexibility to respond  
to circumstances and opportunities as they arise; and to allot new 
C Shares up to a nominal value of £500 million as an alternative  
to a cash dividend. Such authority expires at the conclusion of the 
AGM. The directors propose to renew the authority to allot new 
C Shares at the AGM.
Authority to purchase own shares
At the 2013 AGM, the Company was authorised by shareholders to 
purchase up to 187,231,677 of its own ordinary shares representing 
ten per cent of its issued ordinary share capital.
The Company did not make use of this authority during 2013. The 
authority for the Company to purchase its own shares expires at the 
conclusion of the AGM or 18 months from 2 May 2013, whichever  
is the earlier. A resolution to renew it will be proposed at the AGM.
Voting rights
Deadlines for exercising voting rights
Electronic and paper proxy appointments, and voting instructions, 
must be received by the Company’s Registrar not less than 48 hours 
before a general meeting.
Voting rights for employee share plan shares
Shares are held in various employee benefit trusts for the purpose 
of satisfying awards made under the various employee share plans. 
For shares held in a nominee capacity or if plan/trust rules provide 
the participant with the right to vote in respect of specifically 
allocated shares, the trustee votes in line with the participants’ 
instructions. For shares that are not held absolutely on behalf of 
specific individuals, the general policy of the trustees, in accordance 
with investor protection guidelines, is to abstain from voting in 
respect of those shares.
Major shareholdings
At 31 December 2013, the following companies had notified an 
interest in the issued ordinary share capital of the Company in 
accordance with the Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure  
and Transparency Rules:

31 December 2013 to 12 February 2014.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 71
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information Political donations
In line with its established policy, the Group made no political 
donations pursuant to the authority granted at the 2013 AGM. 
Although the Company does not make, and does not intend to make, 
donations to political parties within the normal meaning of that 
expression, the definition of political donations under the 
Companies Act 2006 is very broad and includes expenses 
legitimately incurred as part of the process of talking to members  
of parliament and opinion formers to ensure that the issues and 
concerns of the Group are considered and addressed. These 
activities are not intended to support any political party.
A resolution will therefore be proposed at the AGM seeking 
shareholder approval for the directors to be given authority to make 
donations and incur expenditure which might otherwise fall within 
the terms of the Companies Act 2006. The authority sought will be 
limited to a maximum amount of £25,000 per Group company but 
so as not to exceed £50,000 for the entire Group in aggregate.
During the year, the business expenses incurred by Rolls-Royce North 
America Inc. towards the operation of the Rolls-Royce North America 
Political Action Committee (RRNAPAC) in the US was US$69,430 
(2012 US$44,161). PACs are a common feature of the US political 
system and are governed by the Federal Election Campaign Act.
The RRNAPAC is independent of the Group and independent of any 
political party. The RRNAPAC funds are contributed voluntarily by 
employees and the Company cannot affect how they are applied, 
although under US Law, the business expenses are paid by the 
Company. Such contributions do not require authorisation by 
shareholders under the Companies Act 2006 and therefore do not 
count towards the £25,000 and £50,000 limits for political donations 
and expenditure for which shareholder approval will be sought at 
the AGM.
Indemnity
The Company has entered into separate Deeds of Indemnity in 
favour of its directors, which were in force during the financial year 
and remain in force at the date of this report. The deeds provide 
substantially the same protection as that already provided to 
directors under the indemnity in Article 216 of the Company’s 
Articles of Association. The Company has also reviewed, arranged 
and maintains appropriate insurance cover for any legal action 
taken against its directors and officers.
Disclosures in the strategic report
The Board has taken advantage of section 414C(11) of the 
Companies Act 2006 to include disclosures in the strategic report on:
 greenhouse gas emissions on page 29;
 disabled people and employee involvement on page 27;
 the future development, performance and position of the Group 
throughout pages 1 to 34;
 the financial position of the Group on pages 10 to 13; 
 the R&D and net R&D expenditure as a proportion of underlying 
revenue on pages 24 and 31; and
 the summary of principal risks on pages 32 to 34.
In addition, notes 1, 14, 15 and 17 to the consolidated financial 
statements include the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
financial risk management, details of its cash and cash equivalents, 
indebtedness and borrowing facilities and its financial instruments, 
hedging activities and its exposure to counterparty credit risk, 
liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity 
pricing risk.
Going concern 
As described on page 138, the Group meets its funding 
requirements through a mixture of shareholders’ funds, bank 
borrowings, bonds and notes. The Group has facilities of £3.6 billion 
of which £2.4 billion was drawn at the year end. £200 million of 
these facilities mature in 2014.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group has 
sufficient financial resources. If the put option on Rolls-Royce Power 
Systems Holding GmbH (formerly named Engine Holding GmbH) is 
exercised by Daimler AG, (estimated cost £1.9 billion), the directors 
consider that the Group would be able to raise additional resources  
in the necessary timeframe to meet this commitment. As a 
consequence, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group are well placed to manage their business 
risks and to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future, despite the current uncertain global economic outlook.
Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis 
(in accordance with the guidance ‘Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: 
Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009’ issued by the FRC) in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Responsibility statements 
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual 
report and the financial statements
The directors as listed on pages 36 to 37 are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the Group and parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and  
of their profit or loss for that period.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 72 Directors’ report
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
 for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company financial statements; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent and 
Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the parent company and enable them 
to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a strategic report and a directors’ report 
(including the directors’ remuneration report and corporate 
governance statement) that comply with that law and those 
regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that:
i)  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant information  
of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
ii)  the director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given, and should be interpreted, in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Responsibility statements under the Disclosure and  
Transparency Rules and the UK Corporate Governance Code
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that to the best of his or her knowledge:
i)   each of the Group and parent company financial statements, 
prepared in accordance with IFRS and UK Accounting Standards 
respectively, gives a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the issuer and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
ii)   the strategic report on pages 1 to 34 and pages 137 to 138 of the 
directors’ report include a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
iii)  the annual report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.

  On 2 January 2012, the Group contributed its interest in Bergen Engines AS to Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH (RRPSH – previously Engine Holding GmbH), a company jointly 
held by Rolls-Royce and Daimler AG. Under the terms of agreement with Daimler, Rolls-Royce retained certain rights such that Bergen Engines continued to be classified as a subsidiary 
and consolidated.
6
  As part of the RRPSH shareholders’ agreement, Daimler has the option to sell its shares in RRPSH to Rolls-Royce for a period of six years from 1 January 2013. The initial fair value of the 
exercise price of this option in respect of Bergen Engines AS (£166m) was recognised in 2012 and that amount in respect of RRPS (£1,432m) has been recognised in 2013 and charged to 
retained earnings. In addition, £45m of the initial recognition of the put option on NCI relating to Bergen Engine AS, recognised in 2012, has been reclassified from NCI to retained 
earnings. Subsequent movements in the value of this liability are included in the income statement, but excluded from the underlying results. 
7
  On 1 January 2013, the Group exercised rights in RRPSH that resulted in Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG (RRPS – formerly Tognum AG) being classified as a subsidiary and  
consolidated – see note 25.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
For the year ended 31 December 2013  Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 80 Financial statements
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies
The Company
The consolidated financial statements of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc (the ‘Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2013 consist of the 
consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and include the Group’s 
interest in jointly controlled and associated entities. 
Basis of preparation and statement of compliance
In accordance with European Union (EU) regulations, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted for use in the EU effective 
at 31 December 2013 (Adopted IFRS). 
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP). 
These are set out on pages 124 to 126 and the accounting policies in respect of Company financial statements are set out on page 125.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where Adopted IFRS requires the 
revaluation of financial instruments to fair value and certain other assets and liabilities on an alternative basis – most significantly 
post-retirement scheme liabilities are valued on the basis required by IAS 19 Employee Benefits – and on a going concern basis as described 
on page 72.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pound sterling which is the Company’s functional currency.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRS requires management to make estimates and judgements that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period; the key areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty are described below. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.
The Group’s significant accounting policies are set out on the following pages. These accounting policies have been applied consistently  
to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and by all Group entities.
Amendment to accounting policy
As explained in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on page 11, following discussions with the Conduct Committee of the FRC, the Group 
has reassessed its policy for the recognition of entry fees received under Risk and Revenue Sharing Arrangements (RRSAs). Whilst the impact 
on our historical results is not significant, the directors believe that the change represents an improvement in the policy.
In prior years, entry fees were recognised as other operating income when they were received, on the basis that this matched it to the 
recognition of non-recurring development costs incurred on behalf of the workshare partner. This policy has been revised, to reflect better 
the fact that some of these non-recurring development costs are capitalised. Under the amended policy, where the relevant costs in the 
development programme are capitalised (ie development costs incurred between engine certification and entry into service and 
certification costs and participation fees paid to airframers), an equivalent portion of the entry fee received is deferred and recognised as 
the related costs are amortised after entry into service. In addition, the amount of entry fees recognised in the year will be presented as a 
contribution to research and development expenses, rather than other operating income.
As required by IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, this change has been made retrospectively; the impact 
of the change in policy in 2012 was to increase profit before tax by £25 million and to reduce net assets at 31 December 2011 and 2012 by 
£184 million and £170 million respectively. Had the policy not been amended, profit before tax in 2013 would have been £39 million higher 
and at 31 December 2013 net assets £208 million higher.
The FRC Conduct Committee’s view is that the RRSA contract cannot be divided into separate development and production phases, as the 
fees and development components received by the Group during the development phase are exchanged for the obligation to pay the 
supplier a pre-determined share of any sales receipts during the production phase. On this basis, the entry fees received would be deferred 
in their entirety and recognised over the period of production. 
As explained in the Chief Financial Officer’s review, on page 11, the FRC Conduct Committee has confirmed that, in view of the change to 
the policy and the additional disclosure the Group has made, it does not intend to pursue its consideration of this accounting policy further. 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Key areas of judgement
The directors consider the potential key areas of judgements required to be made in applying the Group’s accounting policies to be:
 Assessing whether or not the Group controls Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH (RRPSH) requires judgement. The shares of RRPSH 
are held equally by the Group and Daimler AG and the rights of each shareholder are encapsulated in shareholder agreements which set 
out, amongst other things, key matters on which the Group has the casting vote at the Shareholders’ Committee of RRPSH. These most 
important matters subject to casting vote which are relevant to assessing whether RRPSH is controlled include (a) setting the annual 
budget and operating and financial plan, (b) appointing, removing and setting the remuneration of key management personnel (though 
removal of the CEO or the CFO requires joint agreement), (c) entering into contracts in the ordinary course of business and (d) establishing 
management procedures and responsibilities. The Group considers that these provisions are sufficient to give it control over RRPSH. 
Daimler AG has protective rights covering matters such as: (i) significant changes to the scale, scope and financing of RRPSH’s business; 
(ii) certain significant supplier relationships; and (iii) changes to contractual arrangements between RRPSH and Rolls-Royce. These are not 
considered sufficient to prevent the Group from directing the activities of RRPSH.
 A large proportion of the Group’s activities relate to long-term aftermarket contracts. The determination of appropriate accounting 
policies for recognising revenue and costs in respect of these contracts requires judgement:
 i)  whether a long-term aftermarket contract is linked, for accounting purposes, to the related sale of original equipment – where the 
long-term aftermarket contract is agreed (or agreed in principle) at the same time as the original equipment contract, these are 
considered to be linked for accounting purposes and treated as a single contract – or whether it should be treated separately; and 
 ii)  the appropriate measure of stage of completion of the contract – this will vary depending on the precise nature of the arrangements. 
Where the service provided is assessed to be continuous, the stage of completion is measured by reference to the flying hours, or 
equivalent, under the contract. Other aftermarket contracts are overhaul event based and the stage of completion is measured 
accordingly.
 The Group has significant intangible assets. In deciding whether certain intangible assets should be recognised, judgement is required:
 i)  IAS 38 Intangible Assets requires that internally-generated development costs should only be recognised if strict criteria are met, in 
particular relating to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits. The directors consider that, due to the complex 
nature of new equipment programmes, these criteria are not met until relatively late in the programme – Civil aerospace programmes 
represent 54 per cent of development costs; for these, the criteria are generally satisfied at the time of the initial engine certification;
 ii)  on delivery of engines without a linked long-term aftermarket contract, the Group has contractual rights to supply aftermarket parts 
to the customers and its intellectual rights, warranty arrangements and, where relevant, statutory airworthiness or other regulatory 
requirements provide reasonable control over this supply. Accordingly the directors consider that these rights meet the definition of an 
intangible asset in IAS 38. However, the directors do not consider that it is possible to determine a reliable fair value for this intangible 
asset. Accordingly, an intangible asset (recoverable engine cost or REC) is only recognised on the occasions where the contractual price 
of the engine is below the cost of manufacture and then only to the extent of this deficit, as this amount is a reliable value. 
 RRSAs with key suppliers (workshare partners) are a feature of our Civil aerospace business. Under these contractual arrangements the 
key commercial objectives are that: (i) during the development phase the workshare partner shares in the risks of developing an engine  
by performing its own development work, providing development parts and paying a non-refundable cash entry fee; and (ii) during the 
production phase it supplies components in return for a share of the programme revenues as a ‘life of type’ supplier. The share of 
development costs borne by the workshare partner and of the revenues it receives reflect a jointly agreed forecast of the proportionate 
cost of providing its production parts compared to the overall forecast manufacturing cost of the engine.  
These arrangements are complex and have features that could be indicative of: a collaboration agreement, including sharing of risk  
and cost in a development programme; a long-term supply agreement; sharing of intellectual property; or a combination of these.  
There is no directly applicable IFRS to determine an accounting policy for the recognition of entry fees of this nature in the income 
statement. Consequently, in developing an accounting treatment for such entry fees that best reflects the commercial objectives of the 
contractual arrangement, the directors have analysed these features in the context of relevant accounting pronouncements (including 
those of other standard setters where these do not conflict with IFRS) and have weighed the importance of each feature in faithfully 
representing the overall commercial effect. The most important considerations that need to be balanced are: the transfer of development 
risk; the workshare partner receiving little standalone value from the payment of the entry fee; and the overall effect being collaboration 
between the parties which falls short of being a joint venture as the Group control the programme. Also important in the analysis is the 
fact that, whilst the Group and the workshare partner share risks and rewards through the life of the contract, these risks and rewards are 
very different during the development and production phases. 
In this context, the entry fee might be considered to represent: an amount paid as an equalisation of development costs; a payment to 
secure a long-term supply arrangement; a purchase of intellectual property; or some combination thereof. The accounting under these 
different scenarios could include: recognition of the entry fee to match the associated costs in the income statement; being spread over 
the life of the programme as a reduction in the cost of supply during production; or being spread over the time period of the access to the 
intellectual property by the workshare partner.  
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 81
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information 1 Accounting policies (continued)
  The directors consider that the most important features of the arrangement are the risk sharing and that the entry fee represents a 
contribution to the development costs that the Group incurs in excess of its proportionate programme share. The key judgements taken in 
reaching this view are: the entry fee is determined by the parties on that basis and the contract specifies that, in the event that a derivative 
engine is to be developed further, entry fees will also be calculated on this basis; the workshare partners describe the entry fee in this way; 
although the workshare partner receives little stand-alone value from paying the entry fee, the entry fee together with its own 
development activities represent its aggregate investment in the collaboration; the amount of the entry fee does not include any amount in 
excess of that necessary to equalise forecast development costs; the Group is not ‘on risk’ for the full development costs it incurs but for that 
amount less the entry fees received; and, as far as can be determined, this appears to be common industry accounting for arrangements of 
this type, under both Adopted IFRS and US accounting standards (which we believe do not conflict with IFRS in this regard).
  The resulting accounting policy (described below) represents the commercial effect of the contractual arrangements in that the Group 
recognises only those development costs to which it is exposed (and thus reflects the significant transfer of development risk to the 
workshare partner) and the costs of supply of parts during the production phase is measured at the workshare partner’s share of 
programme revenues (which we consider to be a commercial fair value). The directors do not consider that accounting which would result 
in entry fees only being recognised in the production phase would appropriately reflect the sharing of development risk. Accordingly, the 
directors believe that the policy adopted best reflects the commercial objectives of the arrangements, the nature of the relationship with 
the workshare partner and is in accordance with Adopted IFRS. 
 The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of financing support provided to customers. In order to assess whether a provision  
should be recognised, judgement as to the likelihood of these crystallising is required. This judgement is based on an assessment on  
the knowledge of the customers’ fleet plans, the underlying value of the security provided and, where appropriate, the customers’ 
creditworthiness.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the accounting policies, estimates are made in many areas; the actual outcome may differ from that calculated. The key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are set out below. The estimation of the relevant assets and liabilities involves the 
combination of a number of assumptions. Sensitivities are disclosed in the relevant notes where this is appropriate and practicable.
Intangible assets arising on consolidation of Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG and put option on Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH
The fair value of intangible assets of RRPS at 1 January 2013 involved the use of valuation techniques and the estimation of future cash 
flows to be generated by RRPS over a considerable period of time. The Group engaged a specialist valuer to assist with these. 
For a period of six years from 1 January 2013, the Group is obliged to acquire, at Daimler AG’s option, the latter’s 50 per cent interest in 
RRPSH. The estimated exercise price of this option has been recognised as a liability. The exercise price of the option is based on averaging 
three valuations at the date the option is exercised, which are based on both internal metrics, requiring estimation of future performance 
of the business, and external metrics.
Forecasts and discount rates
The carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on the estimates of future cash flows arising from the 
Group’s operations, in particular:
 The assessment of whether the goodwill and other intangible assets (carrying value at 31 December 2013 £1,864 million) arising on the 
consolidation of RRPSH is impaired is dependent of the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the business. 
These cash flows are based on the business plan jointly agreed by the shareholders.
 The assessment as to whether there are any indications of impairment of development, participation, certification, recoverable engine 
costs and customer relationships recognised as intangible assets (carrying values at 31 December 2013 £2,499 million, 31 December 2012 
£1,457 million) is dependent on estimates of cash flows generated by the relevant assets and the discount rate used to calculate a present 
value. These estimates include the performance of long-term contractual arrangements as described below, as well as estimates for 
future market share, pricing and unit cost for uncontracted business. The risk of impairment is generally higher for newer programmes 
and, for customer specific intangible assets (RECs), for launch customers.
Assessment of long-term contractual arrangements
The Group has long-term contracts that fall into different accounting periods and which can extend over significant periods – the most 
significant of these are long-term service arrangements in the Civil aerospace business. The estimated revenues and costs are inherently 
imprecise and significant estimates are required to assess: engine flying hours, time on wing and other operating parameters; the pattern 
of future maintenance activity and the costs to be incurred; and life cycle cost improvements over the term of the contracts. The estimates 
take account of the inherent uncertainties and the risk of non-recovery of any resulting contract balances.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
82 Financial statements 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Post-retirement benefits
The Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19. The accounting 
valuation, which was based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in a net deficit of £793 million before 
deferred taxation being recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2013 (31 December 2012 £445 million). The size of the net deficit  
is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes and to actuarial assumptions, which include price inflation, pension and 
salary increases, the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, mortality and other demographic assumptions and the levels of 
contributions. Further details are included in note 19.
Provisions
As described in the accounting policy on page 87, the Group measures provisions (carrying value at 31 December 2013 £733 million, 
31 December 2012 £461 million) at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet 
date. These estimates take account of information available and different possible outcomes.
Taxation
The tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which the 
Group operates. Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear then reasonable estimates may be used to determine 
the tax charge included in the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Group consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings 
together with the Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates made up to 31 December.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of the entity so as to derive benefits from its activities. 
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other 
venturers under a contractual arrangement. An associate is an entity, being neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture, in which the Group 
holds a long-term interest and where the Group has a significant influence. The results of joint ventures and associates are accounted for 
using the equity method of accounting.
Any subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures or associates sold or acquired during the year are included up to, or from, the dates of change  
of control. Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity.
Where the Group has issued a put option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group recognises a liability for the estimated 
exercise value of that option. Movements in the estimated liability after initial recognition are recognised in the income statement.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Adjustments are made to eliminate the profit 
or loss arising on transactions with joint ventures and associates to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.
Significant accounting policies
Revenue recognition
Revenues comprise sales to outside customers after discounts, excluding value added taxes.
Sales of products (both original equipment and spare parts) are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the 
goods are transferred to the customer, the sales price agreed and the receipt of payment can be assured – this is generally on delivery. On 
occasion, the Group may participate in the financing of OE, most commonly by the provision of guarantees as described in note 18. In such 
circumstances, the contingent obligations arising under these arrangements are taken into account in assessing when the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer. As described on page 81, a sale of OE at a contractual price below its cost 
of manufacture is considered to give rise to an intangible asset, a recoverable engine cost. In these circumstances, revenue is recognised to 
the same value as the recoverable engine cost. 
Sales of services are recognised by reference to the stage of completion based on services performed to date. As described on page 81, the 
assessment of the stage of completion is dependent on the nature of the contract, but will generally be based on: flying hours or equivalent 
for long-term aftermarket arrangements where the service is provided on a continuous basis; costs incurred to the extent these relate to 
services performed up to the reporting date; or achievement of contractual milestones where relevant.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 83
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information 1 Accounting policies (continued)
As described on page 81, sales of products and services are treated as though they are a single contract where these components have been 
negotiated as a single commercial package and are so closely interrelated that they do not operate independently of each other and are 
considered to form a single transaction with an overall profit margin. The total revenue is allocated between the two components such that 
the total agreed discount to list prices is allocated to revenue for each of the two components pro rata, based on the list prices. This revenue 
is then recognised for each component on this basis as the products are delivered and services provided, as described above. Where the 
contractual price of the OE component is below the revenue allocated from the combined arrangement, this will give rise to an asset 
included in ‘amounts recoverable on contracts’. This asset reduces as services are provided, increases as costs are incurred, and reduces  
to zero by the end of the contract. Where the overall balance is a liability, it is recognised in ‘accruals and deferred income’. 
Full provision is made for any estimated losses to completion of contracts, having regard to the overall substance of the arrangements.
Progress payments received, when greater than recorded revenue, are deducted from the value of work in progress except to the extent 
that payments on account exceed the value of work in progress on any contract where the excess is included in accruals and deferred 
income within trade and other payables. The amount by which recorded revenue of long-term contracts is in excess of payments on 
account is classified as amounts recoverable on contracts and is separately disclosed within trade and other receivables.
Risk and revenue sharing arrangements (RRSAs)
As described on page 81, the Group enters into arrangements with certain workshare partners under which these suppliers: (i) contribute  
to the forecast costs of developing an engine by performing their own development work, providing development parts and paying a 
non-refundable cash entry fee; and (ii) supply components for the production phase for which they receive consideration, which is an agreed 
proportion of the total programme revenues. Both the suppliers’ contributions to the forecast non-recurring development costs and their 
consideration are determined by reference to their proportionate forecast scopes of supply relative to that of the engine overall. Once the 
forecast costs and the scopes of supply have been agreed at the inception of the contract, each party is then accountable for its own 
incurred costs. No accounting entries are recorded when the suppliers undertake development work or when development components are 
supplied. Cash sums received are recognised in the income statement, as a reduction in research and development costs incurred, to match 
the expensing of the Group’s related costs – where the cash sums are received in advance of the related costs being expensed or where the 
related costs are capitalised as intangible assets, the recognition of the cash received is deferred (in accruals and deferred income) to match 
the recognition of the related expense or the amortisation of the related intangible asset respectively. The payments to suppliers of their 
shares of the programme revenues for their production components are charged to cost of sales as programme revenues arise.
The Group has arrangements with partners who do not undertake development work or supply parts. Such arrangements are considered  
to be financial instruments as defined by IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are accounted for using the amortised cost method.
Government investment
Where a government or similar body has previously invested in a development programme, the Group treats payments to that body as 
royalty payments, which are matched to related sales.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match them with the related expenses that they are intended to 
compensate. Where grants are received in advance of the related expenses, they are included in the balance sheet as deferred income. 
Non-monetary grants are recognised at fair value.
Interest
Interest receivable/payable is credited/charged to the income statement using the effective interest method. Where borrowing costs are 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of the specific asset.
Taxation
The tax charge/credit on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax:
 Current tax is the expected tax payable for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
 Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts  
of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes and is calculated using the 
enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Tax is charged or credited in the income statement or other comprehensive income (OCI) as appropriate, except when it relates to items 
credited or charged directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
84 Financial statements 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill or 
for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination 
and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets 
can be utilised.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates of exposures in relation to tax audit issues. Tax 
benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be sustained. Once considered to be probable, management reviews each 
material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of that benefit on the basis of potential 
settlement through negotiation and/or litigation. All provisions are included in current liabilities. 
Foreign currency translation
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting Group undertaking (foreign currencies) 
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate ruling at the year end. Exchange 
differences arising on foreign exchange transactions and the retranslation of assets and liabilities into functional currencies at the rate 
ruling at the year end are taken into account in determining profit before taxation.
The trading results of Group undertakings are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year. The assets and liabilities  
of overseas undertakings, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at the exchange rates ruling 
at the year end. Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation of the opening net investments, and from the translation of the 
profits or losses at average rates, are recognised in OCI. The cumulative amount of exchange adjustments was, on transition to IFRS in 
2004, deemed to be nil. 
Financial instruments
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement requires the classification of financial instruments into separate categories 
for which the accounting requirement is different. The Group has classified its financial instruments as follows:
 short-term investments are generally classified as available for sale;
 short-term deposits (principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions), trade receivables and short-term 
investments not designated as available for sale are classified as loans and receivables;
 borrowings, trade payables, financial RRSAs, put options on NCI and C Shares are classified as other liabilities; and
 derivatives, comprising foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and commodity swaps are classified as fair value through  
profit or loss.
Financial instruments are recognised at the contract date and initially measured at fair value. Their subsequent measurement depends  
on their classification.
 Available for sale assets are held at fair value. Changes in fair value arising from changes in exchange rates are included in the income 
statement. All other changes in fair value are taken to equity. On disposal, the accumulated changes in value recorded in equity are 
included in the gain or loss recorded in the income statement.
 Loans and receivables and other liabilities are held at amortised cost and not revalued (except for changes in exchange rates and forecast 
contractual cash flows, which are included in the income statement) unless they are included in a fair value hedge accounting 
relationship. Where such a hedging relationship exists, the instruments are revalued in respect of the risk being hedged, with the change 
in value included in the income statement.
 Fair value through profit or loss items are held at fair value. Changes in fair value are included in the income statement unless the 
instrument is included in a cash flow hedge. If the instruments are included in an effective cash flow hedging relationship, changes  
in value are taken to equity. When the hedged forecast transaction occurs, amounts previously recorded in equity are recognised in  
the income statement.
Financial instruments are derecognised on expiry or when all contractual rights and obligations are transferred.
Hedge accounting
The Group does not generally apply hedge accounting in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts or commodity swaps held to 
manage the cash flow exposures of forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies or in commodities respectively.
The Group applies hedge accounting in respect of transactions entered into to manage the fair value and cash flow exposures of its 
borrowings. Forward foreign exchange contracts are held to manage the fair value exposures of borrowings denominated in foreign 
currencies and are designated as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps are held to manage the interest rate exposures and are designated 
as fair value or cash flow hedges of fixed and floating rate borrowings respectively.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 85
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and changes in the fair value of the related hedged item are 
recognised directly in the income statement.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are recognised directly in equity. Any 
ineffectiveness in the hedging relationships is included in the income statement. The amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the 
income statement to match the recognition of the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, for cash flow hedges and if the forecast transaction remains probable, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
The portion of a gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective 
hedge is recognised directly in equity. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses 
accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to profit when the foreign operation is sold.
Business combinations and goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the fair 
value cannot be measured reliably, in which case the value is subsumed into goodwill. Where fair values of acquired contingent liabilities 
cannot be measured reliably, the assumed contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the same manner as other contingent 
liabilities. 
Goodwill recognised represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value to the Group of the net of  
the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. On transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004, business combinations were not 
retrospectively adjusted to comply with Adopted IFRS and goodwill was recognised based on the carrying value under the previous 
accounting policies. Goodwill in respect of the acquisition of a subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Certification costs and participation fees
Costs incurred in respect of meeting regulatory certification requirements for new civil aero-engine/aircraft combinations including 
payments made to airframe manufacturers for this and participation fees are carried forward in intangible assets to the extent that they 
can be recovered out of future sales and are charged to the income statement over the programme life, up to a maximum of 15 years from 
the entry into service of the product.
Research and development
In accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets, expenditure incurred on research and development is distinguished as relating either to a 
research phase or to a development phase.
All research phase expenditure is charged to the income statement. Development expenditure is capitalised as an internally generated 
intangible asset only if it meets strict criteria, relating in particular to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits. As 
described on page 81, the Group considers that it is not possible to distinguish reliably between research and development activities until 
relatively late in the programme.
Expenditure capitalised is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years from the entry into 
service of the product. 
 
The fair value of research and development recognised during a business combination relate to the acquired company’s technology. 
Amortisation occurs on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years.
Recoverable engine costs
The Group may sell OE to customers at a price below its cost, on the basis that this deficit will be recovered from the profits of highly 
probable future aftermarket sales. As described on page 81, this sale is considered to give rise to an intangible asset, which, subject to  
an impairment review, is recognised at the time of delivery and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period that highly probable 
aftermarket sales are expected to be earned.
Customer relationships
The fair value of customer relationships recognised during a business combination relate to the acquired company’s established 
relationships with its existing customers that result in repeat purchases and customer loyalty. Amortisation occurs on a straight-line basis 
over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years. 
 
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
86 Financial statements 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Software
The cost of acquiring software that is not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment is classified as an intangible asset and 
amortised over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of five years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment 
over their estimated useful lives. No depreciation is provided on assets in the course of construction. Estimated useful lives are as follows:
i) land and buildings, as advised by the Group’s professional advisers:
 a) freehold buildings – five to 45 years (average 24 years)
 b) leasehold buildings – lower of adviser’s estimates or period of lease
 c) no depreciation is provided on freehold land
ii) plant and equipment – five to 25 years (average 13 years)
iii) aircraft and engines – five to 20 years (average 15 years).
Operating leases
Payments made and rentals received under operating lease arrangements are charged/credited to the income statement on a straight-
line basis.
Impairment of non-current assets
Impairment of non-current assets is considered in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent of other assets, impairment is considered for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Goodwill and 
intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. Other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and 
investments are assessed for any indications of impairment annually. If any indication of impairment is identified, an impairment test is 
performed to estimate the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be below the carrying value, the carrying value is reduced  
to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised as an expense. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use or fair 
value less costs to sell, if this is readily available. The value in use is the present value of future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Cost comprises direct 
materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, including depreciation of property, plant and equipment, that 
have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling 
prices less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, investments in money-market funds and short-term deposits with a maturity 
of three months or less on inception. The Group considers overdrafts (repayable on demand) to be an integral part of its cash management 
activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Post-retirement benefits
Pensions and similar benefits (principally healthcare) are accounted for under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. Surpluses  
in schemes are recognised as assets only if they represent economic benefits available to the Group in the future. A liability is recognised  
to the extent that the minimum funding requirements in respect of past service will give rise to an unrecognisable surplus. 
The service and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement:
 current service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees;
 past service costs are recognised immediately; and
 financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 87
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Actuarial gains and losses and movements in unrecognised surpluses and minimum funding liabilities are recognised immediately in OCI.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments
The Group provides share-based payment arrangements to certain employees. These are principally equity-settled arrangements and are 
measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares or 
options that will vest, except where additional shares vest as a result of the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition in the 
Performance Share Plan (PSP).
Cash-settled share options (grants in the International ShareSave plan) are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The Group 
recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, taking into account the estimated number of options that will 
actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period. Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement 
for the year.
The cost of shares of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc held by the Group for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of employee share plans 
is deducted from equity in the consolidated balance sheet. See note 21 for a further description of the share-based payment plans.
Sales financing support
In connection with the sale of its products, the Group will, on occasion, provide financing support for its customers. These arrangements 
fall into two categories: credit-based guarantees; and asset-value guarantees. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 39 and IFRS 4 
Insurance Contracts, credit-based guarantees are treated as insurance contracts. The Group considers asset-value guarantees to be non-
financial liabilities and accordingly these are also treated as insurance contracts. As described on page 82, the directors consider the 
likelihood of crystallisation is assessing whether provision is required for any contingent liabilities.
The Group’s contingent liabilities relating to financing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers 
and a broad product portfolio, and are reported on a discounted basis.
Revisions to Adopted IFRS in 2013
With effect from 1 January 2013, the Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits issued by the IASB in June 2011. 
A description of these amendments and their effect is set out in note 19. In summary, the amendments require:
 recognition of certain administrative costs as operating costs rather than being included in net financing;
 net financing to be calculated on the net asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet using an AA corporate bond rate rather than 
using an expected rate of return for scheme assets; and
 immediate recognition of previously unrecognised past-service credits. 
Had these amendments not been adopted, the results would have been affected as follows:
 profit before financing £15 million higher (2012 £22 million higher);
 net post-retirement financing £107 million higher (2012 £56 million higher); and
 net assets £73 million lower (2012 £100 million lower).
Revisions to IFRS not applicable in 2013
Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU.  
 
Under Adopted IFRS, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
and amendments to IAS 17 Separate Financial Statements are effective for 2014. The principal potential effect is that certain entities 
previously classified as joint ventures might be classified as joint operations, requiring the Group’s share of the individual assets and 
liabilities of these entities to be included in the financial statements rather than the equity accounting method previously applied. The 
Group has reviewed its material joint ventures and has concluded that none are to be classified as joint operations under the requirements 
of IFRS 11. If endorsed, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes, but is not 
anticipated to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a 
significant impact on the financial statements.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 88 Financial statements
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2 Segmental analysis
The analysis by business segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, on the basis of those segments whose 
operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board (the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8), as follows:
Civil aerospace – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services.
Defence aerospace – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines and aftermarket services.
Marine – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of marine-power propulsion systems and aftermarket services.
Energy –  development, manufacture, marketing and sales of power systems for the offshore oil and gas industry and 
electrical power generation and aftermarket services. 
Power Systems – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of diesel engines.
Engineering and technology and Operations, discussed in the strategic report, operate on a Group-wide basis across all the above segments.
The operating results reviewed by the Board are prepared on an underlying basis, which the Board considers reflects better the economic 
substance of the Group’s trading during the year. The principles adopted to determine underlying results are:
Underlying revenues – Where revenues are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, these 
reflect the achieved exchange rates arising on settled derivative contracts.
Underlying profit before financing – Where transactions are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group 
undertaking, this reflects the transactions at the achieved exchange rates on settled derivative contracts. In addition, adjustments have 
been made to exclude one-off past-service costs and credits on post-retirement schemes and the effect of acquisition accounting.
Underlying profit before taxation – In addition to those adjustments in underlying profit before financing:
 includes amounts realised from settled derivative contracts and revaluation of relevant assets and liabilities to exchange rates forecast 
 to be achieved from future settlement of derivative contracts; and
 excludes unrealised amounts arising from revaluations required by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, changes 
in value of financial RRSA contracts arising from changes in forecast payments, changes in the value of put options on NCI and the net 
impact of financing costs related to post-retirement scheme benefits.
This analysis also includes a reconciliation of the underlying results to those reported in the consolidated income statement.

Deferred taxation assets and liabilities
The 2013 Budget announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 21 per cent from 1 April 2014 and to 20 per cent from  
1 April 2015. These reductions were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. As the reduction to 20 per cent was substantively enacted  
prior to the year end, the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at this rate. The resulting charges or credits have 
been recognised in the income statement except to the extent that they relate to items previously charged or credited to OCI or equity. 
Accordingly, in 2013, £59 million has been credited to the income statement, £1 million has been charged to the OCI and £9 million has  
been charged directly to equity.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which a deferred tax liability  
has not been recognised, aggregate to £573 million (2012 £144 million). No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the potential 
withholding tax due on the remittance of undistributed profits as the Group is able to control the timing of such remittances and it is 
probable that consent will not be given in the foreseeable future. 
6 Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per ordinary share (EPS) are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares held under trust, which have been treated as if they had 
been cancelled.
Diluted EPS are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year for the bonus element  
of share options.
2012 figures have been restated to reflect the adoption of amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits – see note 19, and the change in the 
accounting policy for RRSAs – see note 1. The impact of the restatement on the previously reported EPS of 123.23p was an increase of 1.40p 
relating to the IAS 19 amendments and an increase of 0.75p relating to the change in the accounting policy for RRSAs.

  The level of fees payable to the Company’s auditors for the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements reflects the fact that limited incremental work is required in respect of  
the audit of these financial statements. Rolls-Royce plc, a subsidiary of the Company, is also required to prepare consolidated financial statements and the fees payable to the Company’s 
auditors for the audit of those financial statements, including the audit of the sub-consolidation, is included in the audit of the Company’s subsidiaries pursuant to legislation.

  As described on page 46, in 2013, fees for other services to KPMG in respect of Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG (RRPS) were £2.1m. Following the consolidation of RRPS on 1 January 2013, 
the audit committee approved the continuation of engagements already in progress at that date. 
3
  This includes £0.3m (2012 £0.3m) for the review of the half-year report.

  In 2012, as part of the Group’s IT modernisation programme, KPMG provided specialist internal audit support while the Group recruited its own personnel. In addition, consulting 
services were provided by a firm which was acquired by KPMG after being engaged by the Group.

Goodwill
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units, or  
groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the 
goodwill as follows:

9 Intangible assets (continued)
Goodwill has been tested for impairment during 2013 on the following basis:
 The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed by reference to value in use. These have been estimated using cash flows from the most 
recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market 
conditions. Given the long-term and established nature of many of the Group’s products (product lives are often measured in decades), 
these forecast the next ten years. Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based on a range of growth rates  
(2.0 – 2.75 per cent) that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
 The key assumptions for the impairment tests are the discount rate and, in the cash flow projections, the programme assumptions,  
the growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs. Impairment tests are 
performed using prevailing exchange rates.
 The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 13 per cent (2012 13 per cent), based on the Group’s weighted average cost 
of capital, adjusted for specific risk where appropriate.
The principal value in use assumptions for goodwill balances considered to be individually significant are:
 Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG – Volume of equipment deliveries, pricing achieved and cost escalation. These are based on current and 
known future programmes, estimates of capture of market share and long-term economic forecasts. The principal foreign exchange 
exposures are on translating income in a variety of non-functional currencies into euros. For the purposes of the impairment only, cash 
flows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at two per cent. Following the recognition of RRPS at fair value on 1 January 
2013, reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions could cause the value of goodwill to fall below its carrying value, such as a 
reduction in the level of cash generation of nine per cent, a reduction in the assumed long-term growth rate to 0.8 per cent or an increase 
in the assumed discount rate of 0.7 per cent. 
 Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG – Volume of engine deliveries, flying hours of installed fleet and cost escalation. These are based on 
current and known future programmes, estimates of customers’ fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts. The principal 
foreign exchange exposure is on translating US dollar income into euros. For the purposes of the impairment test only, cash flows beyond 
the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5 per cent (2012 2.5 per cent). The directors do not consider that any reasonably possible 
change in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value. The overall level of business 
would need to reduce by more than 85 per cent to cause an impairment of this balance.
 Vinters Limited – Volume of equipment deliveries, capture of aftermarket and cost escalation. These are based on current and known 
future programmes, estimates of customers’ fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts. The principal foreign exchange 
exposures are on translating income in a variety of non-functional currencies into Norwegian kroner. For the purposes of the impairment 
test only, cash flows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5 per cent (2012 2.5 per cent). The directors do not consider 
that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value. 
The overall level of business would need to reduce by more than 75 per cent to cause an impairment of this balance.
Other intangible assets
Certification costs and participation fees, customer relationships, technology, patents and licences, order backlog, trademark, development 
costs and recoverable engine costs have been reviewed for impairment in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. 
Where an impairment test was considered necessary, it has been performed on the following basis:
 The carrying values have been assessed by reference to value in use. These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent 
forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions 
over the lives of the respective programmes.
 The key assumptions underlying cash flow projections are assumed market share, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, discount 
rates, and foreign exchange rates.
 The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 11 per cent (2012 11 per cent), based on the Group’s weighted average cost 
of capital.
 No impairment is required on this basis. However, a combination of changes in assumptions and adverse movements in variables that 
are outside the Group’s control (discount rate, exchange rate and airframe delays), could result in impairment in future years. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 100 Financial statements

The fair value of a financial instrument is the price at which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, 
willing parties in an arms-length transaction. Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the 
balance sheet date, using the methodologies described below.
A These primarily comprise unconsolidated companies where fair value approximates to the book value.
B  Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not 
exceeding six months. 
C  Fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves. Amounts 
denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, 
derived from observable market prices (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement).
D  Borrowings are carried at amortised cost. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13).
E  The value of the put option on NCI is determined in accordance with the contractual terms, which requires averaging three valuations, covering forecasts of the business performance 
and external metrics of comparable business and transactions. 
F  The fair value of RRSAs is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows. The contractual cash flows are based on future trading activity, which is estimated based on latest 
forecasts (Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13). 
IFRS 13 defines a three-level valuation hierarchy:
Level 1 – quoted prices for similar instruments;
Level 2 – directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs; and
Level 3 – inputs not based on observable market data. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 105

Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses various financial instruments to manage its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. Where the effectiveness  
of a hedging relationship in a cash flow hedge is demonstrated, changes in the fair value that are deemed effective are included in the cash 
flow hedge reserve and released to match actual payments on the hedged item. The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure 
to movements in the price of commodities (jet fuel and base metals). To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated 
in US dollars, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value hedges. The Group uses interest rate swaps, forward rate 
agreements and interest rate caps to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.

Exercise price of put option on non-controlling interests and financial RRSAs
The Group has agreed a put option with Daimler AG, such that Daimler can sell its interest in Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH 
(RRPSH) to the Group. The exercise price of this option is included as a financial liability. 
The Group has financial liabilities arising from financial RRSAs. These financial liabilities are valued at each reporting date using the 
amortised cost method. This involves calculating the present value of the forecast cash flows of the arrangements using the internal rate  
of return at the inception of the arrangements as the discount rate. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 106 Financial statements

Risk management policies and hedging activities
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk; liquidity risk; credit risk; interest rate 
risk; and commodity price risk. The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk – The Group has significant cash flows (most significantly US dollars, followed by the euro) 
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity. To manage its exposures to changes in values 
of future foreign currency cash flows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the 
Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions. For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated 
as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies. To manage the 
risk of changes in these fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value 
hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments. The Group aims to match its translational 
exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities. Where appropriate, foreign currency financial liabilities may be designated 
as hedges of the net investment.
Liquidity risk – The Group’s policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure 
that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and 
opportunities. The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group 
to manage its liquidity risk. 
Credit risk – The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial 
instruments. The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the Group’s risk management activities. The 
Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures. Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a 
central treasury function in accordance with the Group credit policy. The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the Group’s 
exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the Group transacts strictly with ‘BBB+’ or higher rated financial institutions 
based on pre-established limits per financial institution. At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk to 
individual customers or counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying 
value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate risk – The Group’s interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk), floating rate borrowings 
and cash and cash equivalents (cash flow risk). Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate profile within the Group 
policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net debt at floating rates of interest as a natural hedge to the net cash position. These 
are designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk – The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations. To minimise its cash 
flow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions. For accounting purposes, these 
derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
Other price risk – The Group’s cash equivalent balances represent investments in money market instruments, with a term of up to three 
months. The Group does not consider that these are subject to significant price risk.  Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 107

Some of the Group’s borrowings are subject to the Group meeting certain obligations, including customary financial covenants. If the 
Group fails to meet its obligations these arrangements give rights to the lenders, upon agreement, to accelerate repayment of the facilities. 
There are no rating triggers contained in any of the Group’s facilities that could require the Group to accelerate or repay any facility for a 
given movement in the Group’s credit rating. 
In addition, the Group has undrawn committed borrowing facilities available as follows:

At 31 December 2013 the Group had no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates on that date. The main interest rate sensitivity for 
the Group arises as a result of the gross up of net cash and this is mitigated as described under the interest rate risk management policies 
on page 106. 
C Shares and payments to shareholders
The Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares (C Shares) as an alternative to paying a cash dividend. C Shares in 
respect of a year are issued in the following year. Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their C Shares for cash. Any C Shares 
retained attract a dividend of 75 per cent of LIBOR on the 0.1 pence nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have 
limited voting rights. The Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the C Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of C Shares  
in issue is less than ten per cent of the aggregate number of C Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.

The amount of warranty and guarantee provision charged to the income statement and utilised by RRPS was £86m and £78m respectively.
Provisions for warranties and guarantees primarily relate to products sold and generally cover a period of up to three years.
Provisions for contract loss and restructuring are generally expected to be utilised within two years. 
In connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide financing support for its customers – generally in 
respect of civil aircraft. The Group’s commitments relating to these financing arrangements are spread over many years, relate to a number 
of customers and a broad product portfolio and are generally secured on the asset subject to the financing. Customer financing provisions 
cover guarantees provided for asset value and/or financing. These guarantees, the risks arising and the process used to assess the extent  
of the risk are described under the heading ‘Customer financing’ in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on page 13. It is estimated that the 
provision will be utilised as follows:

Potential claims with specific claim dates: 
 In one year or less 29 30 
 In more than one year but less than five years 38 43

Commitments on delivered aircraft in excess of the amounts provided are shown in the table below. These are reported on a discounted 
basis at the Group’s borrowing rate to reflect better the time span over which these exposures could arise. These amounts do not represent 
values that are expected to crystallise. The commitments are denominated in US dollars. As the Group does not generally adopt cash flow 
hedge accounting for future foreign exchange transactions, this amount is reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting 
date spot rate. The estimated values of aircraft providing security are based on advice from a specialist aircraft appraiser.

 Although sensitivity calculations are complex, the reduction of relevant security by 20 per cent illustrates the sensitivity to changes in this assumption.
There are also commitments in respect of undelivered aircraft, but it is not considered practicable to estimate these, as deliveries can be 
many years in the future, and the relevant financing will only be put in place at the appropriate time.
The Group’s captive insurance company retains a portion of the exposures it insures on behalf of the remainder of the Group. Significant 
delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost 
and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date. The insurance provisions are based on information 
currently available, however it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary. Provisions for outstanding claims 
are established to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
112 Financial statements 19 Post-retirement benefits
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes:
 UK defined benefit schemes are funded, with the assets held in separate trustee administered funds. Employees are entitled to 
retirement benefits based on either their final or career average salaries and length of service; and
 overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans and provide benefits in line with local practice. 
Additionally in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Group’s employment practices include the provision of 
healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees. These schemes are unfunded.
The valuations of the defined benefit schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, where relevant, updated by the scheme 
actuaries to 31 December 2013.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity, interest rate, inflation and investment risks. In the UK, 
and in the principal US pension schemes, the Group has adopted an investment policy to mitigate some of these risks. This involves 
investing a significant proportion of the scheme assets in liability driven investment (LDI) portfolios, which hold investments designed to 
offset interest rate and inflation rate risks. In addition, in the UK, the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund has invested in a longevity swap, which is 
designed to offset longevity risks in respect of existing pensioners.
The Group has adopted amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits with effect from 1 January 2013. The impact is described further below. 
2012 figures have been restated to put them on a comparable basis.

The Group operates a PaySave scheme in the UK. This is a salary sacrifice scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee 
contributions and the Group makes additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay. As a result, there is a 
decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of £37 million (2012 £36 million) in the year.

  Where a surplus has arisen on a scheme, in accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, the surplus is recognised as an asset only if it represents an unconditional economic benefit available 
to the Group in the future. Any surplus in excess of this benefit is not recognised in the balance sheet.
2
 A minimum funding liability arises where the statutory funding requirements require future contributions in respect of past service that will result in a future unrecognisable surplus.

Defined benefit schemes
Assumptions 
Significant actuarial assumptions for UK schemes (weighted average by size of the obligation) used at the balance sheet date were 
as follows:
2013 2012
Discount rate 4.4% 4.4%
Inflation assumption
 1
 3.5% 3.0%
Rate of increase in salaries 4.5% 4.1%
Male life expectancy – current pensioner 22.5 22.6
   – future pensioner currently aged 45 24.2 24.4
1
 For the UK schemes, this is the assumption for the Retail Price Index. The Consumer Price Index is assumed to be one per cent lower. 
Discount rates are determined by reference to the market yields on AA rated corporate bonds. The rate is determined by using the profile  
of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
114 Financial statements 19 Post-retirement benefits (continued)
The inflation assumption is determined by the market implied assumption based on the yields on long-term indexed linked government 
securities and increases in salaries are based on actual experience, allowing for promotion, of the real increase above inflation.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the SAP actuarial tables, with future improvements 
in line with the CMI 2013 core projections and long-term improvements of 1.25 per cent. Where appropriate, these are adjusted to take 
account of the relevant scheme’s actual experience. 
Other assumptions have been set on advice from the relevant actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and the 
assumptions used in the most recent funding valuation. The rate of increase of pensions in payment is based on the rules of the relevant 
scheme, combined with the inflation assumption where the increase is capped. 
Assumptions for overseas schemes are less significant and are based on advice from local actuaries. The principal assumptions are the 
discount rate, 4.5 per cent (2012 3.9 per cent) and inflation, 2.3 per cent (2012 2.4 per cent).

  Under the longevity swap, the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund (RRPF) has agreed an average life expectancy of pensioners with a counterparty. If pensioners live longer than expected the 
counterparty will make payments to the RRPF to offset the additional cost of paying pensioners. If the reverse applies the cost of paying pensioners will be reduced but the scheme  
will be required to make payments to the counterparty. Following the adoption of the amendments to IAS 19 and the interaction with IFRS 13 from 2013 the longevity swap has been 
valued on an external fair market basis, rather than using the same assumptions as used for the valuation of the scheme’s liabilities. As the surplus on the RRPF is restricted, this has 
had no impact on the net surplus/deficit recognised in the balance sheet. Had the longevity swap been valued on the same basis as 2012, its value would have been a liability of £156m, 
the movement since 2012 largely reflecting the changes in mortality and discount rate assumptions. The valuation is based on an estimate of the assumptions that a hypothetical third 
party would use for the future mortality and premium. 
The scheme assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by,  
the Group. The longevity swap is valued by the scheme actuaries based on the difference between the agreed longevity assumptions at 
inception and actual longevity experience. All other fair values are provided by the fund managers. Where available, the fair values are quoted 
prices (eg listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds). Unlisted investments (private equity) are included at values provided by the fund 
manager in accordance with relevant guidance. Other significant assets are valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves.

Future contributions 
The Group expects to contribute approximately £325 million to its defined benefit schemes in 2014.
In the UK, the funding is set on the basis of a triennial funding valuation by the actuaries for which the assumptions may differ from those 
above. In particular, the discount rate used to value the obligations takes account of the investment strategy, rather than being based on 
market yields of AA corporate bonds. As a result of these valuations, the Group and the scheme trustees agree a Schedule of Contributions 
(SoC), which sets out the required contributions from the employer and employees for current service. Where the scheme is in deficit, the 
SoC also includes required contributions from the employer to eliminate the deficit. The most recent agreed triennial valuations for the 
principal schemes are:

Sensitivities
The calculations of the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the assumptions set out on page 114. The following table summarises  
the estimated impact of a change in the assumption on the UK defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2013, while holding all other 
assumptions constant. This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is 
unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
For the most significant funded schemes, the investment strategies are designed to hedge the risks from interest rates, inflation on an 
economic basis and in the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund in the UK, the longevity of pensioners. Where appropriate, the table also includes the 
corresponding movement in the value of the plan assets.

A  An unrecognised past-service credit related to the restructuring of certain overseas healthcare schemes in 2011. This has now been recognised in full at 1 January 2012. As a 
consequence, the amortisation of this past-service credit in 2012 is eliminated. In addition, an adjustment has been made in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation on one  
of the UK schemes to put it on a consistent basis with the other schemes.
B  Previously all administrative costs were offset against the expected return on scheme assets. The amendments only allow this in respect of the costs of managing scheme assets; other 
administrative expenses are now included in the current service cost.
C  Previously net financing comprised the actual expected return on scheme assets based on the underlying assets and a financing charge on scheme liabilities calculated using a ‘AA’ 
corporate bond rate. The amendments require net financing to be calculated on the net asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet using an AA corporate bond rate. This has a 
consequential impact on amounts recognised in OCI: (i) the change in assumed return on scheme assets affects the related actuarial gains or losses; and (ii) implicit financing on 
movements in the unrecognised surplus and the minimum funding liability is not included in the income statement.

Fair values of share-based payment plans
The weighted average fair value per share of equity-settled share-based payment plans granted during the year, estimated at the date of 
grant, are as follows:
2013 2012 
PSP – 25% TSR uplift 1128p 885p 
PSP – 50% TSR uplift 1254p 985p 
ShareSave – three year grant 287p n/a 
ShareSave – five year grant 349p n/a 
APRA 1027p 809p 
PSP 
The fair value of shares awarded under the PSP is calculated using a pricing model that takes account of the non-entitlement to dividends 
(or equivalent) during the vesting period and the market-based performance condition based on expectations about volatility and the 
correlation of share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency 
between share price performance and TSR vesting. This adjustment increases the fair value of the award relative to the share price at the 
date of grant.
ShareSave
The fair value of the options granted under the ShareSave plan is calculated using a binomial pricing model that assumes that participants 
will exercise their options at the beginning of the six-month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price. Otherwise it 
assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term. This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between 
the start and end of the exercise window.
APRA
The fair value of shares awarded under APRA is calculated as the share price on the date of the award, excluding expected dividends.

Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information 23 Contingent liabilities
On 6 December 2012, the Company announced that it had passed information to the SFO relating to concerns in overseas markets.  
Since that date the Company has continued its investigations and is engaging with the SFO and other authorities in the UK, the USA  
and elsewhere.  
 
In December 2013, the Company announced that it had been informed by the SFO that it had commenced a formal investigation. The 
consequence of these disclosures will be decided by the regulatory authorities. It remains too early to predict the outcomes, but these could 
include the prosecution of individuals and of the Group. Accordingly, the potential for fines, penalties or other consequences (including 
debarment from government contracts, suspension of export privileges and reputational damage) cannot currently be assessed. As the 
investigation is ongoing, it is not yet possible to identify the timescale in which these issues might be resolved. 
 
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, 
performance and reliability. The Group has, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, 
performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items. Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions 
and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts. As a consequence of the insolvency 
of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked 
for certain of the Group’s UK-based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group. While the outcome of 
some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after 
allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group. The Group’s share of equity-accounted entities’ contingent 
liabilities is £13 million (2012 £48 million). 
 
Contingent liabilities in respect of customer financing commitments are described in note 18.

Acquisitions
Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG (RRPS – formerly Tognum AG)
From 25 August 2011 to 31 December 2012 the Group’s interest in RRPS was classified as a joint venture and equity accounted. On 
1 January 2013, conditions were fulfilled which gave the Group certain rights that result in RRPS being classified as a subsidiary and 
consolidated. Accordingly, the Group’s joint venture interest in Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH (RRPSH) has been reclassified 
as a subsidiary. The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed are £1,339 million, giving rise to goodwill of £773 million, as 
set out in the table below. Rolls-Royce and Daimler AG (Daimler) each hold 50 per cent of the shares of RRPSH, which itself held over 
99 per cent of the shares of RRPS. During 2013, RRPSH acquired the remaining 1 per cent of shares of RRPS. RRPS is a premium supplier  
of engines, propulsion systems and components for marine, energy, defence, and other industrial applications (often described as ‘off-
highway’ applications). 
Other
On 30 April 2013, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Hyper-Therm High-Temperature Composites, Inc., a 
producer of state-of-the-art composite materials, including ceramic matrix composites, engineered coatings and thermal-structural 
components.  
 
On 15 August 2013, the Group acquired 100 per cent of SmartMotor AS, a leading specialist in the development of permanent  
magnet technology. 
On 24 December 2013, the Group acquired the remaining 49 per cent of shares not held in Composite Technology and Applications Limited, 
a business engaged in the development of composite fan blades and containment cases for the next generation of advanced turbofan 
engines.
For each of the other acquisitions noted, the acquisition cost (net of cash and borrowings acquired) has been allocated to identifiable assets 
and liabilities – principally technology, patents and licences, customer relationships, trademark, order backlog and other intangible assets.

In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the Group has opted not to recognise goodwill in respect of the non-
controlling interest in RRPS. The previous joint venture investment holding in RRPSH of £1,328 million was revalued, giving rise to a gain  
of £115 million. 
As part of the RRPSH shareholders’ agreement, Daimler AG has the option to sell its shares in RRPSH to Rolls-Royce for a period of six years  
from 1 January 2013. The initial fair value of the exercise price of this option in respect of RRPS has been recognised as a liability  
(£1,432 million), which has been charged to NCI and retained earnings.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of RRPS amounting to £773 million (which is not tax deductible) consists of anticipated synergies  
and the assembled workforce. The anticipated synergies principally arise from:
 increases in revenue from the combination of the routes to market; and
 cost savings from the combination of the supply chain and central functions. 
The gross contractual value of trade receivables acquired is £446 million. At the acquisition date, it was estimated that contractual cash 
flows of £24 million would not be collected.
The acquisition of the controlling interest in RRPS contributed £2,593 million of revenue and profit before tax of £10 million (including 
amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition) to the Group’s results for the year.
Disposals
On 29 January 2013, Alstom acquired Tidal Generation Limited.
On 2 September 2013, Turbomeca (a Safran company) acquired the Group’s 50 per cent shareholding and interest in the RTM322 helicopter 
engine programme for which it has received a cash consideration of €293 million. Rolls-Royce will progressively transfer its operational 
responsibilities in the engine programme to Turbomeca over a multi-year period.

Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 set out on pages 75 to 129.  
In our opinion: 
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (Adopted IFRS); 
 the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; and 
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks
In arriving at our opinions set out in this report, the risks that had 
the greatest effect on our audit and the key procedures we applied 
to address them are set out below. Those procedures were designed 
in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, 
consequently, where we set out findings we do not express any 
opinion on these individual risks. 
The basis of accounting for revenue and profit in the Civil 
aerospace business 
Refer to page 81 (Key areas of judgement – Long-term aftermarket 
contracts), page 83 (Significant accounting policies – Revenue 
recognition) and page 44 (Audit committee report – Financial reporting)
 The risk The amount of revenue and profit recognised in a year 
on the sale of engines and aftermarket services is dependent, 
inter alia, on the appropriate assessment of whether or not each 
long-term aftermarket contract for services is linked to or separate 
from the contract for sale of the related engines. As the 
commercial arrangements can be complex, significant judgement 
is applied in selecting the accounting basis in each case. The most 
significant risk is that the Group might inappropriately account for 
sales of engines and long term service agreements as a single 
arrangement for accounting purposes as this would usually lead 
to revenue and profit being recognised too early because the 
margin in the long term service agreement is usually higher than 
the margin in the engine sale agreement.
 Our response We made our own independent assessment, with 
reference to the relevant accounting standards, of the accounting 
basis that should be applied to each long-term aftermarket 
contract entered into during the year and compared this to the 
accounting basis applied by the Group.
 Our findings We found that the Group has developed a framework 
for selecting the accounting basis to be used which is consistent 
with accounting standards and has applied this consistently.  
For almost all the agreements entered into during this year, it  
was clear which accounting basis should apply. Where there was 
room for interpretation, we found the Group’s judgement to have 
been balanced.  
The measurement of revenue and profit in the Civil 
aerospace business 
Refer to page 81 (Key areas of judgement – Long-term aftermarket 
contracts), page 83 (Significant accounting policies – Revenue 
recognition) and page 44 (Audit committee report – Financial 
reporting) 
 The risk The amount of revenue and profit recognised in a year  
on the sale of engines and aftermarket services is dependent,  
inter alia, on the assessment of the percentage of completion  
of long-term aftermarket contracts and the forecast cost profile  
of each arrangement. As long-term aftermarket contracts can 
extend over significant periods and the profitability of these 
arrangements typically assumes significant life-cycle cost 
improvement over the term of the contracts, the estimated 
outturn requires significant judgement to be applied in assessing 
engine flying hours, time on wing and other operating parameters, 
the pattern of future maintenance activity and the costs to be 
incurred. The inherent nature of these estimates means that their 
continual refinement can have an impact on the profits of the Civil 
aerospace business that can be significant in an individual 
financial year. The assessment of the estimated outturn for each 
arrangement involves detailed calculations using large and 
complex databases with a significant level of manual intervention. 
 Our response We tested the controls designed and applied by the 
Group to provide assurance that the estimates used in assessing 
revenue and cost profiles are appropriate and that the resulting 
estimated cumulative profit on such contracts is accurately 
reflected in the financial statements; these controls operated over 
both the inputs and the outputs of the calculations. We challenged 
the appropriateness of these estimates for each programme and 
assessed whether or not the estimates showed any evidence 
of management bias. Our challenge was based on our assessment 
of the historical accuracy of the Group’s estimates in previous 
periods, identification and analysis of changes in assumptions 
from prior periods and an assessment of the consistency of 
assumptions across programmes, detailed discussions and 
assessments of the achievability of the Group’s plans to reduce 
life-cycle costs and an analysis of the impact of these plans on 
forecast cost profiles taking account of contingencies and analysis 
of the impact of known technical issues on cost forecasts. Our 
analysis considered each significant airframe that is powered  
by the Group’s engines and was based on our own experience 
supplemented by discussions with an aircraft valuation specialist 
engaged by the Group. We assessed whether the valuer was 
objective and suitably qualified. We also checked 
the mathematical accuracy of the revenue and profit for each 
arrangement and considered the implications of identified errors 
and changes in estimates. 
 Our findings Our testing identified weaknesses in the design and 
operation of controls. In response to this we assessed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s plans for addressing these weaknesses 
and we increased the scope and depth of our detailed testing and 
analysis from that originally planned. We found no significant 
errors in calculation. Overall, our assessment is that the 
assumptions and resulting estimates (including appropriate 
contingencies) resulted in mildly cautious profit recognition.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
to the members of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc only Recoverability of intangible assets (certification costs and 
participation fees, development expenditure and recoverable 
engine costs) and amounts recoverable on contracts primarily 
in the Civil aerospace business 
Refer to page 82 (Key sources of estimation uncertainty – Forecasts 
and discount rates), pages 86 and 87 (Significant accounting policies – 
Certification costs and participation fees, Research and development, 
Recoverable engine costs and Impairment of non-current assets),  
page 99 (Note 9 to the financial statements – Intangible assets) and 
page 44 (Audit committee report – Financial reporting) 
 The risk The recovery of these assets depends on a combination of 
achieving sufficiently profitable business in the future as well as 
the ability of customers to pay amounts due under contracts often 
over a long period of time. Assets relating to a particular engine 
programme are more prone to the risk of impairment in the early 
years of a programme as the engine’s market position is 
established. In addition, the pricing of business with launch 
customers makes assets relating to these engines more prone 
to the risk of impairment. 
 Our response We tested the controls designed and applied by the 
Group to provide assurance that the assumptions are regularly 
updated, that changes are monitored, scrutinised and approved 
by appropriate personnel and that the final assumptions used in 
impairment testing have been appropriately approved. We 
challenged the appropriateness of the key assumptions in the 
impairment test (including market size, market share, pricing, 
engine and aftermarket unit costs, individual programme 
assumptions, price and cost escalation, discount rate and 
exchange rates ) focusing particularly on those assets with 
a higher risk of impairment (those relating to the Trent 900 
programme and launch customers on the Trent 900 and 1000 
programmes). Our challenge was based on our assessment of the 
historical accuracy of the Group’s estimates in previous periods, 
our understanding of the commercial prospects of key engine 
programmes, identification and analysis of changes in 
assumptions from prior periods and an assessment of the 
consistency of assumptions across programmes and customers 
and comparison of assumptions with publicly available data 
where this was available. We considered the appropriateness 
of the related disclosures in note 9 to the financial statements. 
 Our findings Our testing did not identify any deviation in the 
operation of controls which would have required us to amend the 
nature or scope of our planned detailed test work. We found that 
the assumptions and resulting estimates were balanced and that 
the disclosures in note 9 appropriately describe the inherent 
degree of subjectivity in the estimates and the potential impact 
on future periods of revisions to these estimates. We found no 
errors in calculations.
Accounting for the consolidation of Rolls-Royce Power Systems 
Holding GmbH and valuation of Daimler AG’s put option 
Refer to page 81 (Key areas of judgement – Rolls-Royce Power Systems 
Holding GmbH), page 82 (Key sources of estimation uncertainty – 
Intangible assets arising on consolidation of Rolls-Royce Power Systems 
AG and put option on Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH), 
page 83 (Accounting policies – Basis of consolidation) and page 44 
(Audit committee report – Financial reporting) 
Control of Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH
 The risk Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH (a special 
purpose vehicle owned equally by the Group and Daimler AG 
(RRPSH)) acquired a controlling interest in Rolls-Royce Power 
Systems AG (RRPS) on 25 August 2011. From that date, the Group 
equity accounted for its joint venture interest in RRPSH as control 
was shared with Daimler AG. On 1 January 2013, conditions were 
fulfilled which the Group considered gave it control over RRPSH 
and from that date the Group’s 50 per cent interest has been 
classified as a subsidiary and RRPSH has been consolidated in the 
Group financial statements. Assessing whether or not the Group 
controls RRPSH is a critical accounting judgement. The rights of 
the Group and Daimler AG are encapsulated in shareholder 
agreements and assessing whether the Group’s rights are 
sufficient to give it control over RRPSH requires detailed 
consideration of the relevant provisions and a commercial 
assessment as to which rights are most important. 
 Our response We analysed the shareholder agreements with 
particular reference to rights relating to key matters including the 
existence of a casting vote in respect of key matters described on 
page 81 at the shareholders meeting and Shareholders’ Committee 
of RRPSH. 
 Our findings We found that the terms of the agreements provide 
the Group with the power to establish key operating and capital 
decisions of RRPSH and to appoint, remove and set the 
remuneration of key management personnel. The agreements 
also provide Daimler AG with rights (in particular over matters 
that would significantly change the scale, scope and financing 
of RRPSH’s business, certain significant supplier relationships  
and changes to contractual arrangements between RRPSH with 
Rolls-Royce) which we have determined provide protection to 
Daimler AG over its interest in RRPSH but are not sufficient  
to prevent the Group from controlling RRPSH. On that basis,  
we consider that it is appropriate that RRPSH (and hence RRPS)  
has been consolidated from 1 January 2013.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 131
Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information Consolidation of Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH
 The risk Estimating the fair value of intangible assets of RRPS  
at the date of consolidation involved the use of complex valuation 
techniques and the estimation of future cash flows over a 
considerable period of time. To the extent that greater or  
lesser value is attributed to intangibles (which are subject to 
amortisation), lesser or greater value is attributed to goodwill 
(which is not).
 Our response We evaluated the basis upon which the Directors 
identified and assessed the fair value of each significant asset, 
liability and contingent liability of RRPS and its subsidiaries having 
regard to the relevant accounting standards. For the intangible 
assets, we assessed whether the measurement basis and 
assumptions underlying the estimate of the fair values were 
reasonable, taking account of our experience of similar assets in 
other comparable situations and of the work performed by a 
valuer engaged by the Group. We assessed whether the valuer 
was objective and suitably qualified, had been appropriately 
instructed and had been provided with complete, accurate data 
on which to base its evaluation. We also assessed whether or not 
the estimates showed any evidence of management bias with 
a focus on whether there was any indication of value being 
inappropriately attributed to goodwill rather than 
depreciable assets. 
 Our findings We found that the intangible assets identified were 
typical for acquisitions of similar businesses and that the valuation 
bases used were in accordance with accounting standards. We 
have no concerns with the basis on which the valuer had been 
instructed by the Group and found that (i) the valuer was objective 
and competent, (ii) the estimates used in the valuations were 
balanced and did not result in either too much or too little 
goodwill being recognised and (iii) the valuations arrived at by  
the valuer had been adopted by the Group without adjustment.
Valuation of Daimler AG’s put option 
 The risk As part of the shareholder agreements, for a period of six 
years from 1 January 2013 Daimler AG has the option to require 
the Group to purchase its 50 per cent interest in RRPSH. The 
estimated amount of the purchase price of this option has been 
recognised as a financial liability on the Group balance sheet. The 
purchase price is based on averaging three valuations, which are 
based on both internal and external metrics, at the date the 
option is exercised. The external metrics include price/earnings 
ratios for comparable companies and those implicit in comparable 
transactions. There is judgement involved in choosing appropriate 
comparable companies and transactions and in predicting what 
these might be at a future date. 
 Our response We analysed the shareholder agreements and tested 
the reasonableness of the estimate of the purchase price of the 
option, including assessing whether the Group’s judgement as to 
which external metrics should be used was appropriate, and the 
accuracy of its calculation. We also assessed whether or not the 
estimates showed any evidence of management bias with a 
particular focus on the risk that the liability might be understated 
given its visibility. 
 Our findings We found that the resulting estimate was acceptable 
but mildly optimistic resulting in a somewhat lower liability being 
recorded than might otherwise have been the case. 
Liabilities arising from sales financing arrangements 
Refer to page 82 (Key areas of judgement – financing support), page 
88 (Significant accounting policies – Sales financing support, page 112 
(Note 18 to the financial statements – Provisions for liabilities and 
charges) and page 44 (Audit committee report – Financial reporting) 
 The risk The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of 
financing and asset value support provided to customers. This 
support typically takes the form of either a guarantee with respect 
to the value of an aircraft at a future date or a guarantee of a 
customer’s future payments under an aircraft financing 
arrangement. Judgement is required to assess the likelihood of 
these liabilities crystallising, in order to assess whether a provision 
should be recognised and if so the amount of that provision. The 
total potential liability is significant and can be affected by the 
assessment of the residual value of the aircraft and the 
creditworthiness of the customers. 
 Our response We analysed the terms of guarantees on aircraft 
delivered during the year in detail and obtained aircraft values 
from and held discussions with aircraft valuation specialists 
engaged by the Group. We assessed whether the valuer was 
objective and suitably qualified, had been appropriately 
instructed and had been provided with complete, accurate data 
on which to base its evaluation. For all contracts on delivered 
aircraft, we assessed the commercial factors relevant to the 
likelihood of the guarantees being called, including the credit 
ratings and recent financial performance of the relevant 
customers and their fleet plans, and critically assessed the Group’s 
estimate of the required provisions for those liabilities. We 
considered movements in aircraft values and potential changes  
in the assessed probability of a liability crystallising since the 
previous year end and considered whether the evidence supported 
the Group’s assessment as to whether or not a liability needs to be 
recognised and the amount of the liability recognised or 
contingent liability disclosed. We considered the appropriateness 
of the related disclosure in note 18 to the financial statements.
 Our findings We found that the assumptions and estimates were 
balanced and that note 18 appropriately discloses the potential 
liability in excess of the amount provided for in the financial 
statements for delivered aircraft and highlights the significant 
but unquantifiable contingent liability in respect of aircraft 
which will be delivered in the future.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT Accounting for risk and revenue sharing arrangements
Refer to page 81 (Key areas of judgement – Risk and revenue sharing 
arrangements), page 84 (Significant accounting policies – Risk and 
revenue sharing arrangements), page 11 (Chief Financial Officer’s 
review) and page 44 (Audit committee report – Financial reporting) 
 The risk The Group receives non-refundable cash payments under 
risk and revenue sharing arrangements (which are referred to as 
entry fees). The assessment of when these entry fees should be 
recognised in the income statement involves analysis of their 
commercial substance in the context of the agreement as a whole. 
As there is no single accounting standard that directly addresses 
these types of agreements, management has to apply very 
significant judgement in deciding how to apply the various 
provisions of accounting standards that are relevant to different 
aspects of the agreements. These arrangements are complex and 
have features that could be indicative of: a collaboration 
agreement, including sharing of risk and cost in a development 
programme; a long-term supply agreement; sharing of 
intellectual property; or a combination of these.
 Our response We independently analysed the agreements under 
which significant entry fees have been received to establish the 
range of possible accounting treatments that could be adopted 
and to assess which of these would in our view most appropriately 
reflect the requirements of accounting standards. The most 
significant accounting standards considered were 
IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and 
errors, IAS 18 Revenue, IFRS 11 Joint arrangements in terms of the 
timing of recognition of the entry fees and IAS 1 Presentation of 
financial statements in respect of their presentation as an offset 
against the expenditure to which they relate. We also had regard 
to the definitions of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the 
IFRS Framework and, to the extent they did not conflict with 
Adopted IFRS, to pronouncements of other standard-setting 
bodies that more explicitly address accounting for payments from 
suppliers and collaborative arrangements. We examined 
correspondence between the Group and the Financial Reporting 
Council and attended meetings between them. We sought to 
identify the accounting applied in similar circumstances by other 
companies including the Group’s direct competitors and compare 
these to the approach adopted by the Group and the requirements 
of Adopted IFRS. We assessed whether the change to the 
accounting policy made in the year was appropriate and 
recalculated the resulting amounts in the financial statements. 
We considered the appropriateness of the related disclosures. 
 Our findings Our analysis indicated that in substance, from the 
point of view of both the Group and the risk and revenue sharing 
workshare partners, the entry fees represent the reimbursement 
of expenditure incurred by the Group as part of an engine 
development programme and that this represented a significant 
transfer of development risk from the Group to the partners that 
should be reflected in the income statement at the time the 
reimbursed expenditure is recognised. On that basis, we found 
that the revised accounting policy most appropriately reflects the 
commercial substance of the entry fees. So far as it was possible to 
tell, we found that the accounting applied by the Group was 
similar to the approach taken by others. We found that the change 
to the accounting policy made by the Group was appropriate given 
the incidence of entry fees in the year and the costs capitalised on 
the programmes to which these entry fees relate. We found that 
the disclosures in the financial statements properly describe the 
accounting treatment adopted by the Group and the directors’ 
basis for applying that treatment.
Bribery and corruption 
Refer to page 120 (Note 23 to the financial statements – Contingent 
liabilities) and page 44 (Audit committee report – Financial reporting) 
 The risk A large part of the Group’s business is characterised by 
competition for individually significant contracts with customers 
which are often directly or indirectly associated with governments 
and the award of individually significant contracts to suppliers.  
The procurement processes associated with these activities are 
highly susceptible to the risk of corruption. In addition the Group 
operates in a number of territories where the use of commercial 
intermediaries is either required by the government or is normal 
practice. The Group is currently under investigation by law 
enforcement agencies, primarily the Serious Fraud Office in the UK 
and the US Department of Justice. Breaches of laws and regulations 
in this area can lead to fines, penalties, criminal prosecution, 
commercial litigation and restrictions on future business.
 Our response We evaluated and tested the Group’s policies, 
procedures and controls over the selection and renewal of 
intermediaries, contracting arrangements, ongoing management, 
payments and responses to suspected breaches of policy. We 
sought to identify and tested payments made to intermediaries 
during the year, made enquiries of appropriate personnel and 
evaluated the tone set by the Board and the Executive Leadership 
Team and the Group’s approach to managing this risk. Having 
enquired of management, the audit committee and the Board as 
to whether the Group is in compliance with laws and regulations 
relating to bribery and corruption, we made written enquiries  
of the Group’s legal advisers to corroborate the results of those 
enquiries and maintained a high level of vigilance to possible 
indications of significant non-compliance with laws and 
regulations relating to bribery and corruption whilst carrying out 
our other audit procedures. We discussed the areas of potential or 
suspected breaches of law, including the ongoing investigation, 
with the audit committee and the Board of directors as well as the 
Group’s legal advisers and assessed related documentation. We 
assessed whether the financial effects of potential or suspected 
breaches of law or regulation have been properly disclosed in 
note 23 to the financial statements. 
 Our findings We found that the disclosures in note 23 to the 
financial statements reflect appropriately the matters required  
to be disclosed by accounting standards and highlighted that, as  
the investigation is at too early a stage to assess the consequences 
(if any), including in particular the size of any possible fines, no 
provision can be made at year end.

Strategic report Financial statements Directors’ report Other information The presentation of ‘underlying’ profit 
Refer to page 10 (Chief Financial Officer’s review), page 89 (Note 2 to 
the financial statements – Segmental analysis) and page 44 (Audit 
committee report – Financial reporting) 
 The risk In addition to its Adopted IFRS financial statements, the 
Group presents an alternative income statement on an 
‘underlying’ basis. The directors believe the ‘underlying’ income 
statement reflects better the Group’s trading performance during 
the year. The basis of adjusting between the Adopted IFRS and 
‘underlying’ income statements and a full reconciliation between 
them is set out in note 2 to the financial statements on pages 89 
and 91. A significant recurring adjustment between the Adopted 
IFRS income statement and the ‘underlying’ income statement 
relates to the foreign exchange rate used to translate foreign 
currency transactions. The Group uses forward foreign exchange 
contracts to manage the cash flow exposures of forecast 
transactions denominated in foreign currencies but does not 
generally apply hedge accounting in its Adopted IFRS income 
statement. The ‘underlying’ income statement translates these 
amounts at the achieved foreign exchange rate on forward foreign 
exchange contracts settled in the period, retranslates assets and 
liabilities at exchange rates forecast to be achieved from future 
settlement of such contracts and excludes unrealised gains and 
losses on such contracts which are included in the Adopted IFRS 
income statement. In addition, adjustments are made to exclude 
one-off past-service credits on post-retirement schemes and the 
effect of acquisition accounting and a number of other items.
  Alternative performance measures can provide investors with 
appropriate additional information if properly used and presented. 
In such cases, measures such as these can assist investors in gaining 
a better understanding of a company’s financial performance and 
strategy. However, when improperly used and presented, these 
kinds of measures might mislead investors by hiding the real 
financial position and results or by making the profitability of the 
reporting entity seem more attractive.
 Our response We assessed the appropriateness of the basis for  
the adjustments between the Adopted IFRS income statement 
and the ‘underlying’ income statement and recalculated the 
adjustments with a particular focus on the impact of the foreign 
exchange rate used to translate foreign currency amounts in the 
‘underlying’ income statement. As the Group has discretion over 
which forward foreign exchange contracts are settled in each 
financial year, which could impact the achieved rate both for the 
period and in the future, we assessed whether or not this showed 
any evidence of management bias. We also assessed: (i) the extent 
to which the prominence given to the ‘underlying’ financial 
information and related commentary in the annual report 
compared to the Adopted IFRS financial information and related 
commentary could be misleading; (ii) whether the Adopted IFRS 
and ‘underlying’ financial information are reconciled with 
sufficient prominence given to that reconciliation; (iii) whether 
the basis of the ‘underlying’ financial information is clearly and 
accurately described and consistently applied; and (iv) whether  
the ‘underlying’ financial information is not otherwise misleading 
in the form and context in which it appears in the annual report. 
 Our findings We have no concerns regarding the basis of the 
‘underlying’ financial information or its calculation and found 
no indication of management bias in the way the Group managed 
forward foreign exchange contracts during the year. We consider 
that there is sufficient appropriate disclosure of the nature and 
amounts of the adjustments to allow shareholders to understand 
the implications of the two bases on the financial measures being 
presented. We consider that the ‘underlying’ financial information 
is useful to shareholders as an adjunct to the Adopted IFRS 
financial information particularly in the context of isolating 
trends resulting from trading performance from trends that 
result from other factors. We found the presentation of the 
‘underlying’ financial information to be balanced.
In addition to these key audit risks, we also focused on the 
recognition of revenue and profit on other long-term contracts; 
the implementation of a new consolidation system; warranties 
and guarantees; valuation of derivative contracts; valuation of 
post-retirement scheme liabilities; and the recoverability of tax 
assets and the adequacy of provisions for tax contingencies.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope  
of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was 
set at £86 million. This has been calculated with reference to a 
benchmark of profit before taxation (representing 4.9% of reported 
and ‘underlying’ profit before taxation) which we consider to be one 
of the principal considerations for members of the company in 
assessing the financial performance of the Group.
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it the following 
misstatements that we identified through our audit: (i) all material 
corrected misstatements; (ii) uncorrected misstatements with 
a value in excess of £4 million for income statement items 
(or £8 million for balance sheet reclassifications); and (iii) other 
misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
In order to gain appropriate audit coverage of the risks described 
above and of each individually significant reporting component:
(a) audits for Group reporting purposes were carried out at 13 key 
reporting components located in the following countries: United 
Kingdom (9 key reporting components), USA (1), Germany (2) and 
Norway (1). In addition, audits for Group reporting purposes were 
performed at a further 20 reporting components. Together these 
covered 90 per cent of revenue, 87 per cent of underlying profit 
before taxation and 85 per cent of total assets; and 
(b) specified reporting procedures were carried out over key risk 
areas at a further 12 reporting components, none of which are 
considered to be key. 
In total our procedures covered 98 per cent of revenue, 99 per cent 
of underlying profit before taxation and 94 per cent of total assets.
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2013 134 Other information
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT Detailed audit instructions were sent to the auditors of all these 
reporting components. These instructions covered the significant 
audit areas that should be covered by these audits (which included 
the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed above) and set 
out the information required to be reported back to the group audit 
team. The group audit team visited the following locations: United 
Kingdom, USA, Germany, Norway and Singapore. Telephone 
meetings were also held with the auditors at these locations and  
the majority of the other locations that were not physically visited.
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes at the 
reporting components were all performed to materiality levels set 
by, or agreed with, the group audit team. These materiality levels 
were set individually for each such component and ranged from 
£0.5 million to £50 million. 
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
 the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
 the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’  
report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
5 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which 
we are required to report by exception 
Under ISA (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based 
on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the annual report that contains a material 
inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial 
statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise 
misleading. In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
 the audit committee report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law  
are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 the directors’ statement, set out on page 72, in relation to going 
concern; and
 the part of the corporate governance report on page 39 relating  
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (2010) specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement

GROUP FIVE-YEAR REVIEW
For the years ended 31 December Foreign exchange
Foreign exchange rate movements influence the reported income 
statement, the cash flow and closing net cash balance. The average 
and spot rates for the principal trading currencies of the Group are 
shown in the table below:
2013 2012 Change
USD per GBP
Year end spot rate 1.65 1.63 +1%
Average spot rate 1.56 1.59 -2%
EUR per GBP
Year end spot rate 1.20 1.23 -2%
Average spot rate 1.18 1.23 -4%
The Group’s approach to managing its tax affairs 
The Board is involved in setting the Group’s tax policies which 
govern the way its tax affairs are managed. In summary, this means:
i)  the Group manages its tax costs through maximising the tax 
efficiency of business transactions. This includes taking 
advantage of available tax incentives and exemptions;
ii)  this must be done in a way which is aligned with the Group’s 
commercial objectives and meets its legal obligations and 
ethical standards;
iii)  the Group also has regard for the intention of the legislation 
concerned rather than just the wording itself;
iv)  the Group is committed to building constructive working 
relationships with tax authorities based on a policy of full 
disclosure in order to remove uncertainty in its business 
transactions and to allow the authorities to review possible risks;
v)  where appropriate and possible, the Group enters into 
consultation with tax authorities to help shape proposed 
legislation and future tax policy; and
vi)  the Group seeks to price transactions between Group companies 
as if they were between unrelated parties, in compliance with 
the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the laws of the 
relevant jurisdictions.
The Group’s global corporate income tax contribution
Over 95 per cent of the Group’s underlying profit before tax 
(excluding joint ventures) is generated in the United Kingdom, United 
States of America, Germany, Norway, Finland and Singapore. The 
remaining profits are generated across more than 40 other countries. 
This reflects the fact that the majority of the Group’s business is 
undertaken, and employees are based, in the above countries. 
In common with most multinational groups, the total of all profits  
in respect of which corporate tax is paid is not the same as the 
consolidated profit before tax reported on page 75. The main 
reasons for this are:
i)  the consolidated income statement is prepared under IFRS 
whereas tax is paid on the profits of each Group company, which 
are determined by local accounting rules;
ii)  accounting rules require certain income and costs relating to  
our commercial activities to be eliminated from, or added to,  
the aggregate of all the profits of the Group companies when 
preparing the consolidated income statement (‘consolidation 
adjustments’); and
iii)  specific tax rules including exemptions or incentives as 
determined by the tax laws in each country.
The Group’s total corporation tax payments in 2013 were 
£238 million. The level of tax paid in each country is impacted by  
the above. In most cases, (i) and (ii) are only a matter of timing and 
therefore tax will be paid in an earlier or later year. As a result they 
only have a negligible impact on the Group’s underlying tax rate 
which, excluding joint ventures, would be 27.1 per cent (the 
underlying tax rate including joint ventures can be found on 
page 12). This is due to deferred tax accounting, details of which can 
be found in note 5 to the financial statements. The impact of (iii) will 
often be permanent depending on the relevant tax law.
Investments and capital expenditure
The Group subjects all major investments and capital expenditure 
to a rigorous examination of risks and future cash flows to ensure 
that they create shareholder value. All major investments require 
Board approval.
The Group has a portfolio of projects at different stages of their  
life cycles. Discounted cash flow analysis of the remaining life of 
projects is performed on a regular basis.
Sales of engines in production are assessed against criteria in  
the original development programme to ensure that overall value  
is enhanced.
Financial risk management
The Board has established a structured approach to financial risk 
management. The Financial risk committee (Frc) is accountable for 
managing, reporting and mitigating the Group’s financial risks and 
exposures. These risks include the Group’s principal counterparty, 
currency, interest rate, commodity price, liquidity and credit rating 
risks outlined in more depth in note 17. The Frc is chaired by the 
Chief Financial Officer. The Group has a comprehensive financial risk 
policy that advocates the use of financial instruments to manage 
and hedge business operations risks that arise from movements  
in financial, commodities, credit or money markets. The Group’s 
policy is not to engage in speculative financial transactions. The  
Frc sits quarterly to review and assess the key risks and agree any 
mitigating actions required.

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Capital structure
£ million 2013
Restated
2012 
Total equity 6,303 5996
Cash flow hedges 68 63
Group capital 6,371 6,059
Net funds 1,939 1,317
Operations are funded through various shareholders’ funds, bank 
borrowings, bonds and notes. The capital structure of the Group 
reflects the judgement of the Board as to the appropriate balance  
of funding required.
Funding is secured by the Group’s continued access to the global 
debt markets. Borrowings are funded in various currencies using 
derivatives where appropriate to achieve a required currency and 
interest rate profile. The Board’s objective is to retain sufficient 
financial investments and undrawn facilities to ensure that the 
Group can both meet its medium-term operational commitments 
and cope with unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and short-term investments which, together 
with the undrawn committed facilities, enable it to manage its 
liquidity risk.
During the year, the Group issued €750 million 2.125% Notes 
maturing in 2021 and £375 million 3.375% Notes maturing in 2026.
At year end, the Group retained aggregate liquidity of £5.6 billion. This 
liquidity comprised net funds of £1.9 billion and aggregate borrowing 
facilities of £3.6 billion, of which £1.2 billion remained undrawn.
The maturity profile of the borrowing facilities is regularly reviewed 
to ensure that refinancing levels are manageable in the context  
of the business and market conditions. The only facility to mature  
in 2014 is a £200 million EIB loan. There are no rating triggers in any 
borrowing facility that would require the facility to be accelerated  
or repaid due to an adverse movement in the Group’s credit rating.
The Group conducts some of its business through a number of joint 
ventures. A major proportion of the debt of these joint ventures is 
secured on the assets of the respective companies and is non-
recourse to the Group. This debt is further outlined in note 11.
Credit rating
Rating Outlook Grade
Moody’s Investors Service A3 Stable Investment
Standard & Poor’s A Stable Investment
The Group subscribes to both Moody’s Investors Service and 
Standard & Poor’s for independent long-term credit ratings.  
At 31 December 2013, the Group maintained investment grade 
ratings from both agencies.
As a capital-intensive business making long-term commitments  
to our customers, the Group attaches significant importance  
to maintaining or improving the current investment grade  
credit ratings.
Accounting and regulatory
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
(IFRS), as adopted by the EU.
In 2013, the Group has adopted Amendments to IAS 19 Employee 
Benefits. There were no other revisions to IFRS that became 
applicable in 2013 which had a significant impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
A summary of changes which have not been adopted in 2013  
is included within the accounting policies in note 1.
As explained in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on page 11, 
following discussions with the Conduct Committee of the FRC,  
the Group has reassessed its policy for the recognition of entry  
fees received under RRSAs. 
Governments and regulators around the world continue to 
implement reforms to the financial markets with the aim of 
improving transparency and reducing systemic risk. Although the 
reforms are predominantly directed at financial institutions, they 
will also affect non-financial institutions such as the Group.
The primary concern was the reform of the over-the-counter (OTC) 
derivatives market, and in particular a proposal in the EU European 
Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) that parties to future OTC 
derivative transactions would be required to use an exchange to 
clear the transactions and post cash collateral to reduce counterparty 
risk. The proposal could have adversely affected the Group’s future 
funding requirements and made cash flow more volatile.
The final EMIR rules have now been released, which exempt 
non-financial institutions engaged in hedging activity from  
this requirement.
Share price
During the year, the share price increased by 46 per cent from 
873.5 pence to 1275 pence, compared to a 38 per cent increase in  
the FTSE aerospace and defence sector and 14 per cent increase  
in the FTSE 100. The Company’s share price ranged from 873.5 pence 
in January to 1275 pence in December.

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION Managing your shareholding
Your shareholding is managed by Computershare Investor 
Services PLC (the Registrar). When making contact with the 
Registrar please quote your Shareholder Reference Number (SRN), 
an 11-digit number that can be found on the right-hand side of 
your share certificate or in any other shareholder correspondence. 
It is very important that you keep your shareholding account 
details up to date by notifying the Registrar of any changes in 
your circumstances.
You can manage your shareholding at www.investorcentre.co.uk, 
speak to the Registrar on +44 (0)870 703 0162 (8.30am to 5.30pm 
Monday to Friday) or you can write to them at Computershare 
Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, 
Bristol BS13 8AE.
Payments to shareholders
The Company makes payments to shareholders by issuing 
redeemable C Shares of 0.1 pence each. You can still receive cash 
or additional ordinary shares from the Company providing you 
complete a payment instruction form, which is available from the 
Registrar. Once you have submitted your payment instruction form, 
you will receive cash or additional ordinary shares each time the 
Company issues C Shares. If you choose to receive cash we 
recommend that you include your bank details on the payment 
instruction form and have payments credited directly to your bank 
account. This removes the risk of a cheque going astray in the post 
and means that cleared payments will be credited to your bank 
account on the payment date. 
Share dealing
The Registrar offers existing shareholders an internet dealing 
service at www-uk.computershare.com/investor/sharedealing.asp 
and a telephone dealing service (+44 (0)870 703 0084). The service is 
available during market hours, 8.00am to 4.30pm, Monday to Friday 
excluding Bank holidays. The fee for internet dealing is 1 per cent of 
the transaction value subject to a minimum fee of £30. The fee for 
telephone dealing is 1 per cent of the transaction plus £35. Please 
note that, in addition to dealing fees, stamp duty of 0.5 per cent is 
payable on all purchases. Other share dealing facilities are available 
but we recommend that you only use a firm regulated by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). You can check the FCA register at 
www.fca.org.uk/register.
Your share certificate
If you sell or transfer your shares you must ensure that you have a 
valid share certificate in the name of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc.
If you place an instruction to sell your shares and cannot provide a 
valid share certificate the transaction cannot be completed and you 
will be liable for any costs incurred by the broker. Share certificates 
previously issued by either Rolls-Royce Group plc or Rolls-Royce plc 
are invalid and should be destroyed. If you are unable to locate your 
share certificates please inform the Registrar immediately. 
American Depositary Receipts (ADR)
ADR holders should contact the depositary, The Bank of New York 
Mellon by calling +1 888 269 2377 (toll free within the US) or 
emailing shrrelations@cpushareownerservices.com.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Warning to shareholders – boiler room fraud
We are aware that some shareholders might have received 
unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment 
matters. These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who offer 
to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares 
in US or UK investments. Such operations are known as ‘boiler 
rooms’ and these ‘brokers’ can be very persistent and extremely 
persuasive. You should always check that any firm calling you about 
investment opportunities is properly authorised by the FCA using 
the following web link www.fca.org.uk/register or by calling their 
Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 (overseas callers dial 
+44 20 7066 1000). If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will 
not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme. You will find lots of useful advice and 
information about protecting yourself from investment scams 
on the FCA website www.fca.org.uk/consumers.
Remember the golden rule – IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE 
IT PROBABLY IS.

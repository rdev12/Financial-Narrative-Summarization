JOHN BARTON, CHAIRMAN
Continuing to deliver
Returns to shareholders
Last year the Board announced its policy to increase the 
dividend payout ratio to 40% of profit after tax, in line with the 
broader market. After another successful year we are pleased  
to recommend a dividend for the year of 55.2 pence per share, 
an increase of 22%.
People
As always, our people have again made a significant contribution 
to the success of the business. I would particularly like to thank 
those on the front line, who sustained high standards of 
customer service throughout the year. We continue to dedicate 
resource to attracting the right people for the business and  
in the development and retention of our existing employees.  
It is the strength of our people that will enable us to meet  
our ambitious objectives for the future. 
On the Board, we have recently welcomed Andrew Findlay as 
our incoming Chief Financial Officer, joining the Company on  
2 October 2015. I would like to thank Chris Kennedy for his 
significant contribution to the successful growth of the Company 
in the last five years and wish him success in the future.
Conclusion
We believe that our business model and strategy will deliver 
long-term value to shareholders. Our clear focus is to fulfil our 
customers’ needs via a network of airports, routes, frequencies  
and slots that is unrivalled in European short-haul aviation. This, 
combined with our fleet expansion plans, gives us a significant 
opportunity for future profitable growth and increasing shareholder 
returns. We look forward to another 20 years of success.

Non-Executive Chairman
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
Reflecting another year of growth, I am pleased 
to report that your Company has delivered 
record profit for the fifth year in a row, with 
profit before tax up 18% to £686 million.
Celebrating 20 years as a business
easyJet celebrated its 20th birthday in November 2015. It is 
remarkable how far we have come in this short period of time. 
We have grown to become the second biggest short-haul airline 
in Europe, carrying almost 70 million passengers a year and we 
are now an established FTSE 100 company with £4.7 billion of 
revenue. Over the 20 years we have retained our entrepreneurial 
spirit and maintained our focus on providing customers with 
excellent service at a reasonable cost, the main reason for  
our success. 
Strategy
Our strategy remains focused on delivering market-leading 
innovation in customer service, whilst establishing a network  
of routes and frequencies that benefit from strong demand.  
We continue to see a number of opportunities to grow in a 
profitable and disciplined way and our announcement of an 
agreement with Airbus to take delivery of an additional 36  
A320 aircraft will help us to capitalise on these.
There have been several regulatory developments in the year. 
We are engaging with the European Union to address efficiency 
in a new EU Aviation strategy, including overall regulatory 
structure, air traffic control, regulated airports, levies and 
taxation. We were pleased with the Airports Commission’s  
final report in July recommending that the Government expand 
its aviation capacity in London. We are also encouraged to see 
the Government engaging on Air Passenger Duty, against a 
backdrop of evidence that clearly indicates that an increase  
in air passenger traffic is a contributor to economic growth. Strategic report Governance Accounts

Chief Executive’s review
This has been another year of record profits 
and delivering our strategy for easyJet. We 
carried an additional four million passengers 
to reach 68.6 million passengers; we grew 
revenue to £4,686 million; and we increased 
profit before tax for the fifth successive year 
to a record £686 million. Return on capital 
employed increased to 22.2%
(1)
, another 
record for the Company.
OVERVIEW
Our markets are strong, with favourable economic and consumer 
trends. Our core leisure customer is part of a market that is 
growing strongly every year as people take more holidays and 
city breaks, complemented by a business travel market that 
prizes both flexibility and value. 
easyJet has positioned its network and product to capitalise on 
these trends and has delivered again during the year. Our business 
model and strategy are continuing to deliver profitable growth  
and increasing annual returns to shareholders. 
In particular:
• Revenue increased by 3.5% to £4,686 million, with passenger 
volumes increasing by 6.0% and revenue per seat by 1.5% on a 
constant currency basis to £64.28, offset by currency headwinds. 
• Our passengers continue to be attracted by our model of having 
convenient airports and flights, available at good value. We 
finished the year strongly with record load factors in both July 
and August driving revenue per seat up by 3.2% in constant 
currency in the fourth quarter. 
• Load factor for the full year grew by 0.9 percentage  
points to 91.5%, demonstrating strong demand in a 
competitive environment. 
• We increased yield and revenue throughout the year with our 
market leading digital platform driving and fulfilling demand, 
supported by our best-in-class Revenue Management System.
• Our confidence, both in the demand environment and our 
structural growth opportunities within our markets has led us  
to secure an additional 36 aircraft between 2018 and 2021, 
comprising 30 Next Generation A320s and 6 Current Generation 
A320s, all in the 186 seat configuration. This will bring flexibility 
and secure further cost savings of £27 million.
• Cost per seat decreased by 3.4%, with benefits from both fuel  
and currency. Cost per seat at constant currency excluding fuel 
increased by 3.6%. We have experienced cost pressures that 
include regulated airport price increases, increased de-icing costs 
and significant disruption costs. We have mitigated this through 
£46 million of sustainable savings and we have a pipeline of 
structural cost improvement to deliver future savings.
• Profit before tax grew by £105 million to £686 million and we 
increased the profit before tax margin to 14.6% from 12.8%. 
• Return on capital employed
(1)
 increased by 1.7 percentage 
points to a record 22.2% (2014: 20.5%), with some benefits 
from our hedge positions, maintaining our strong market 
returns. We continue to drive capital efficiency with rigour and 
discipline, reallocating aircraft around the network to maximise 
return on capital employed. 
• We generated £895 million of operating cash flow, reducing  
our gearing to 14%, thus further strengthening our balance sheet. 
• Reflecting the strong financial performance during 2015, the 
Board has recommended a dividend of 55.2 pence per share, 
an increase of 21.6% from the prior year, in line with its policy 
of paying 40% of annual profit after tax to shareholders.

EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT
easyJet operates in the short-haul European aviation market, 
which has seen strong underlying demand throughout the year. 
easyJet’s focus is primarily in Western and Northern Europe, 
where there is a high propensity to travel and deep, rich markets. 
Economic trends are currently favourable, with GDP growth in 
our main markets. The UK is the strongest country in terms  
of absolute GDP performance in 2015 and we continue to see  
an improving outlook across all of our other major regions. In 
addition, consumer confidence is growing in those markets, 
which we expect to support growth in economic activity.  
These positive trends, combined with our market positioning,  
are reflected in strong demand for our services.
The total European short-haul market
(2)
 grew by 5% year-on-year 
in the 12 months to 30 September 2015, sustained in part by a 
continued low fuel price. Low cost carrier share of the short-haul 
market increased by around one percentage point to 42%. In the 
same period, easyJet’s competitors increased capacity by 7%  
in its markets, with particularly strong growth in the UK market. 
Over its financial year, easyJet increased capacity by 5%, with 
growth of 4% in the first half increasing to 6% in the second half.
Whilst the overall short-haul market has grown over the last 10 
years, the low-cost carriers have taken significant market share, 
as the legacy carriers have cut mainline capacity across their 
networks in order to address their lack of competitiveness.  
At the same time the legacy carriers are transferring capacity 
from their flag airlines to lower-cost subsidiaries such as Vueling, 
Eurowings and T ransavia. In its 20 years of existence, easyJet has 
grown its own market share as part of that low cost growth and 
now has an estimated 8% of the European short-haul market. 
We see a number of opportunities to increase our market share. 
easyJet has delivered a strong performance against this 
competitive backdrop, demonstrating the strength of its model 
and implementation of its strategy. With a track record of high 
growth across economic cycles, strong underlying demand,  
as well as our relatively low current market share, we continue to 
see opportunities to deliver further growth over the medium term.

BUILD STRONG NUMBER ONE  
AND TWO NETWORK POSITIONS
easyJet flies to a network of primary airports and routes that tap 
into deep, wealthy markets with populations that have a high 
propensity to fly. We have chosen to establish ourselves at the right 
airports, serving valuable catchment areas that represent Europe’s 
top markets by GDP , driving both leisure and business travel. This is 
also where strong markets already exist, built up over a period of 
time by legacy carriers. We have the opportunity both to capture 
further market share and to grow the overall market. 
Driven by strong underlying demand and an attractive customer 
proposition, we will continue to invest in growing our network.  
We operate more of the top 100 routes in Europe than any other 
airline and our route frequencies deliver choice and flexibility for  
our customers while increasing returns. Our competitive advantage 
is reinforced by the overall portfolio of peak time slots at airports 
where either total slot availability or availability at customer-friendly 
times is constrained. 
We regularly review the route network in order to maximise returns 
and exploit demand opportunities in the market. During the year we 
added a net 60 routes to the network, slightly more than last year. 
These were allocated to new bases, such as Amsterdam, Hamburg, 
Naples and Oporto, and to markets where we want to consolidate 
our position and grow our share, such as Switzerland and Italy.  
We have recently announced new base openings in Venice and 
Barcelona. Our plans for fleet expansion will help us to capitalise  
on expected demand in markets that we understand.
Over time, increased route maturity and greater numbers of 
frequencies have contributed to increasing profitability and returns. 
We continue to establish stronger leadership positions in all of our 
markets, to achieve the aim of holding the position of number  
one or number two in each market. We currently have 52% of  
our capacity in airports where we have the number one position  
by share and 83% as one of the top two. 
Progress in our main markets is as follows:
United Kingdom
easyJet is the UK’s largest short-haul airline, where we have a  
20% market share
(2)
. At year end the UK had 134 based aircraft. 
We are continuing to reinforce our already strong position in the  
UK market, both London-based and regional. easyJet remains the 
number one carrier by market share at almost all of its UK bases, 
including its major bases of London Gatwick, London Luton, Bristol, 
Belfast and Edinburgh. Our positioning, market share and airport 
bases are driving both leisure and business passengers. We 
increased capacity by 3% in the twelve months to 30 September 
2015, launching new routes such as London Gatwick to Stuttgart 
and London Luton to Essaouira, while continuing to increase 
frequencies on selected routes. Our competitors increased their 
capacity on our markets by 9%.
France
easyJet is France’s second largest short-haul airline with a 14% 
market share. At year end France had 26 based aircraft. 
We see opportunities to grow our market share in France, leveraging 
our competitive market position, adding capacity at Charles de 
Gaulle through up-gauging and strengthening our domestic network 
(we are the number one or two carrier after Air France in most of the 
airports where we operate). We increased capacity in France by 6% 
in the year, against competitor growth on our markets of 5%, 
launching eight new routes in the year such as T oulouse to Seville 
and Paris Orly to Split.
Italy
easyJet has a 12% market share in Italy. At year end Italy had  
29 based aircraft. 
We continue to target increasing market share in Italy, by 
reinforcing our existing strong positions and investing more in the 
higher value catchment areas. We are the biggest operator at Milan 
Malpensa with 22 touching aircraft, have recently opened a new 
base at Naples and will open a base in Venice early in 2016 (and we 
are already the number one airline at both). We are supporting this 
by redeploying aircraft and crew from Rome Fiumicino, which still 
remains an important part of our network with an expected two 
million passengers a year. During 2015 we increased capacity in  
Italy by 7% launching 23 new routes in the year, including Milan 
Malpensa to Munich, Milan Linate to Paris Charles de Gaulle and 
Milan Linate to Amsterdam.
Switzerland
easyJet is Switzerland’s second largest airline with a 23% total 
market share. At year end Switzerland had 23 based aircraft. 
easyJet is the number one operator at both Geneva and Basel 
airports, with the latter also part of the Zurich catchment area.  
We increased capacity by 9% in the twelve months to 30 
September 2015, building and reinforcing our leading positions  
at both airports. As the leading airline brand in Geneva and Basel 
easyJet’s strategy is to continue to build customer preference in  
the market. Competitor capacity growth on our markets was  
also 9%. easyJet launched eleven new routes in the year such  
as Geneva to Menorca and Basel to London Luton.
Germany
easyJet has 4% market share in Germany. At the year end Germany 
had 12 based aircraft. 
Germany is a large and attractive market, although with a more 
regional, federal structure than other European countries. easyJet  
is focused on its two bases at Berlin Schoenefeld, where it is the 
number one airline, and Hamburg, which opened in 2014. We target 
continued growth in Germany, taking share from the incumbent 
operators. We have increased capacity by 15% during the year. 
Competitor growth on our markets was 6%. We launched sixteen 
new routes in the year such as Hamburg to Lanzarote and 
Hamburg to Paris Orly.
Portugal/Spain
easyJet has 13% market share in Portugal and 8% market share in 
Spain. At year end Portugal had six based aircraft.
Portugal and Spain are principally an in-bound market for easyJet, 
with strong demand on key flows to the region from the rest of 
Europe. We increased capacity by 8% and 2% in Portugal and Spain 
respectively, reflecting in particular the investment in a new base in 
Oporto from where we launched six new routes to Luxembourg, 
Nantes, Stuttgart, Manchester, Bristol and London Luton airports. 
We also announced that a new base at Barcelona would be 
opening in February 2016. Competitor market growth on our 
markets was 10% in Portugal and 7% in Spain.
Netherlands
easyJet is the Netherlands’ second largest short-haul airline  
with a 9% market share. At year end the Netherlands had three 
based aircraft.
The Netherlands is a significant opportunity for easyJet, where 
we currently carry four million passengers a year. In March 2015 
we opened a new base at Schipol Airport, Amsterdam (where 
we are now the second biggest operator) and we are continuing 
to invest in growth of our market share. As a result we have 
increased capacity by 17% during the year against competitor 
growth on our markets of 9%. easyJet launched nine new routes 
in the year, such as Amsterdam to Nice. 12 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015

DRIVE DEMAND, CONVERSION  
AND YIELDS
Alongside the quality of its network, easyJet is able to drive 
profitable growth through its leading customer-focused 
proposition. In particular we are driving increasing levels  
of loyalty and attracting passengers through the quality  
and innovation of our digital platform.
Leading customer offering
easyJet’s strong relationship with its customers continues  
to develop, with passengers increasingly likely to travel  
with easyJet again after previously taking an easyJet flight. 
Increasing customer loyalty helps to create more sustainable 
long-term revenue.
In the last year, 74% of our seats were booked by returning 
customers, which is a six percentage point increase from 2010. 
All easyJet markets have seen an increase in customer loyalty, 
with France showing the biggest increase of 28% since 2011.  
The strength of the relationship was best illustrated during the 
very busy summer trading period, with approximately 80% of 
passengers who flew with easyJet being returning customers.
As part of the 20th Anniversary celebrations easyJet announced 
the launch of its new customer loyalty program. This aims to 
recognise and retain our high value and loyal customers with  
a scheme that makes travel with easyJet even easier. Very 
different to legacy frequent flyer programs, which are highly 
expensive and complex, we want to make the simple things easy 
for our customers. The programme offers a range of benefits 
such as free name changes, free booking changes and a low 
price promise, all reinforced by a dedicated customer support 
team. This is expected to be rolled out in early 2016.
Our combination of using primary airports in large economic 
markets, alongside high frequencies and attractive flight timings, 
also makes easyJet a logical choice for business passengers.  
We are focused on providing a bespoke business offering 
through distribution platforms, T ravel Management Companies 
and direct to small and medium sized enterprises. We signed  
up 100 corporate customers during the year. Despite a strong 
comparable benefit in 2014 due to the Air France strike, we 
nevertheless continued to increase the business yield premium 
during the year. Sales of business products performed well,  
with a 58% increase in the sale of flexible business fares when 
compared to 2014. Sales through Global Distribution Systems 
grew by 32% in the year as easyJet continued to leverage its 
relationships with the T ravel Management Companies. Bookings 
from corporate customers direct also went up by 30%.  
easyJet continues to see opportunities to sell its business 
product across Europe and we have recently strengthened  
our corporate sales capability through a new market,  
customer and industry structure. 
Innovation and digital leadership
Our digital platform is a key point of differentiation with our 
competitors. We believe that we have significant advantages in 
the capability of our web platform, our Customer Relationship 
Management (“CRM”) data and our mobile offering. During the 
year we had over 500 million visits across all platforms, an 18% 
increase in the last two years, and we grew web conversion by 
13% over the same period.
Our CRM enables our customers to benefit from increasing levels 
of personalisation across multiple channels, with examples such 
as saved passport details, targeted marketing campaigns via 
email and text message and bespoke offers from our affiliate 
partners. The user experience has been further developed over 
the year, with greater ease of interaction on the website and 
mobile and optimised layouts and design. 
We have put significant focus on the mobile offering over the 
past two years, with an award-winning app that enables mobile 
hosting through the airport, disruption notification live with the 
ability to change flights, and saved personal data such as 
payment details. We have seen very positive take-up of mobile 
as the platform for seat sales, almost doubling as a percentage 
over the last 12 months to over 8%.
The strength of this platform was recently demonstrated when 
our summer 2016 season tickets went on sale. On the day we 
were commanding 33% of all UK airline web traffic share. Across 
all channels we had 2.6 million visits, up 30% on the prior year, of 
which over 15% were on mobile. In the early moments we were 
selling 800 seats per minute, rising to a peak when we were 
selling out the equivalent of an A320 every seven seconds.
We will be investing substantially in our digital capability over  
the next three years, as we continue to innovate and maintain 
our leadership position in the sector. Our initial focus will be  
on enhancing the digital customer interface, to be delivered  
by summer 2016, followed by the development of support 
systems that will lead to easyJet having the first fully-integrated 
e-commerce platform in the airline industry. In the longer term 
we are committing to the acceleration of our use of data science 
to improve efficiency, increase revenue and drive greater 
customer satisfaction.
The digital programme will offer increasing amounts of 
personalisation, introducing a more relevant booking journey 
based on previous behaviour to drive higher footfall, higher 
conversion rates and higher attachment rates. It will also enable 
greater self-management capability through the entire journey 
chain, from booking to check-in, through the airport and in the 
event of disruption.
We are subsequently building an e-commerce platform that will 
give us a competitive advantage for the long term. Its primary 
objective is to give us significantly better flexibility and capability 
than we currently have, specifically around our ability to offer 
customers bespoke, attractive options.
Lastly, we have started to explore ways to innovate in other 
areas across the business. In June we showcased new 
technology such as engineering drones and prognostics 
software. Looking to the future, we are investing in research 
around Artificial Intelligence to exploit the large amounts of  
data generated by our operations. Strategic report Governance Accounts

MAINT AIN COST ADVANT AGE
easyJet has a strong cost-focused culture, with a number of 
structural advantages in key areas that enable it to combine  
the offering of a primary airport network with good value fares. 
Every year easyJet delivers substantial cost savings against 
underlying cost inflation, whilst in the longer term we have  
a pipeline of opportunities that will further improve our  
structural competitiveness.
In 2015 cost per seat decreased by 3.4%, primarily reflecting 
benefits from fuel and foreign currency. On a constant currency, 
ex-fuel basis cost per seat rose 3.6%. Part of this is the cost of 
doing business within our successful business model; part was 
due to one-off factors during the year. We have generated 
sustainable savings during the year of £46 million.
easyJet’s structural advantages are an integral part of our 
business model, with established benefits in fleet, airports  
and handling, engineering, pensions and overheads: 
• We operate an exclusively Airbus A320-family fleet. This 
delivers operational flexibility as well as efficiencies in 
engineering and maintenance, crew, ownership and fuel. As 
the second-largest operator of Airbus aircraft in the world we 
also benefit from significant economies of scale on acquisition. 
Between 2016 and 2021 we will derive a major benefit from 
up-gauging of our fleet, from a majority 156-seat A319 
composition to a fleet that is over 70% 186-seat A320s.  
This is expected to have a 13-14% cost per seat benefit,  
which translates into over £110 million of comparable savings.
• With significant positions in our airports, we are able to drive 
economies of scale from long term deals with the airport 
owners and operators, as well as with ground handling agents 
at those airports. We are now in our second year of a seven 
year contract with Gatwick airport, as the largest operator at 
the airport, and likewise at London Luton airport, where we 
have signed a 10 year contract. In Ground Handling we signed 
an arrangement with GH Italia covering all of the nine airports 
where we operate in Italy. We expect to agree a number of 
new contracts in both areas in 2016 and 2017. 
• During 2015 we completed our new component support 
arrangement with AJW Group, consolidating previous 
arrangements and again leveraging our increasing scale.  
This has been successfully implemented in October 2016  
and we expect to drive significant maintenance savings  
over the term of the contract.
• easyJet is not encumbered with significant historic costs  
that legacy carriers have. Our crew are more productive. We 
maintain a lean and efficient head office and we do not have 
expensive pension arrangements for current and previous 
employees. We believe we can leverage this position to drive 
incrementally profitable growth in the medium term.
We will relentlessly focus on delivering these initiatives in the next 
few years. Our experiences in 2015 have given us the impetus to 
increase our cost saving efforts. We plan to re-invigorate what 
has already been a hugely successful cost saving programme, 
leveraging our increasing scale and reviewing our cost 
management down to the lowest level.

DISCIPLINED USE OF CAPITAL
easyJet has a clear capital structure framework and a strategy 
which is intended to maximise shareholder returns. The Company 
maintains a strong balance sheet with low gearing, which gives 
us a strong competitive advantage through access to a lower 
cost of funding as well as operational flexibility.
Our objective is always to optimise our return on capital 
employed through the allocation of aircraft and capacity across 
the network, regularly moving them to airports and routes with 
better opportunities. In line with this strategy, we took the 
decision in June to close our base at Rome Fiumicino and will 
redistribute those eight based aircraft to other bases in Italy, 
including the opening of a new base in Venice. These actions 
reiterate our focus on returns and will increase the return on 
capital employed of the Company as a whole, as we have done 
regularly in the past and will do so in the future.
As we continue to add frequencies and commit to basing 
aircraft around the network in scale, we are able to maintain  
the very high fleet utilisation that sets us apart. In 2015 we 
maintained our asset utilisation across the network, at an 
average of 11 block hours per day (2014: 11 hours).
Fleet
We manage our fleet to provide flexibility in our planning 
arrangements, so that on the one hand we can maximise 
opportunities in a strong demand environment, whilst being able 
to manage our capacity as necessary. easyJet’s total fleet as at 
30 September 2015 comprised 241 aircraft and increased by a 
net 15 from 30 September 2014. 
Over the next five years we will reduce cost by changing the 
fleet mix and ownership structure. We took delivery of 20 A320 
aircraft in the 12 months to 30 September 2015, which provide  
a per seat cost saving of 7% to 8% over the A319, through 
up-gauging. Five A319 aircraft were retired and the average  
age of the fleet increased to 6.2 years (2014: 5.8 years). 14 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Chief Executive’s review continued
Agreement for 36 additional aircraft
Due to our continued robust trading, high demand for easyJet 
flights and the number of profitable opportunities we see in  
our markets, we are pleased to have secured an agreement with 
Airbus to take delivery of an additional 36 A320 aircraft between 
2018 and 2021, all in the 186 seat configuration. These aircraft will 
offer increased flexibility in fleet planning, including the faster 
replacement of some of our A319 aircraft, lower overall unit costs 
and ensure easyJet can continue to grow past 2019 to support 
increasing total shareholder return.
easyJet is exercising rights to 30 next generation A320 NEOs 
under the existing framework agreement signed in 2013
(3)
. The 
additional six aircraft are current generation A320 added to that 
agreement. We have secured an additional 30 A320 NEO 
purchase rights to replace those we are exercising. Funding is 
available. easyJet’s balance sheet and cash generation is strong 
with gearing at 30 September at 14%, marginally below the 
Board’s target of 15% – 30%. 
5
CULTURE, PEOPLE AND PLATFORM
easyJet is passionate about its people and we believe that it is 
what sets us apart. In particular we believe that our customer-
facing employees are the best in the industry and contribute 
significantly to the positive experience that our passengers enjoy, 
which in turn drives their loyalty and repeat business.
It is our people who continue to deliver the strategy for the 
business and will drive future success. Internally we continue to 
focus on recruiting the right people, helping them to understand 
the Company’s values and their role in the business and then 
giving them the tools to develop a high-performance culture. 
Our people are truly exceptional. They are passionate and  
driven to achieving a winning strategy. They have responded  
to recent tragic events with energy, care for our customers and 
unbelievable stamina. We couldn’t achieve these results without 
this orange spirit.
In line with the rest of the business we recruited during the year 
to help support our growth, adding over 290 pilots and 1,300 
cabin crew, as well as 390 people within the management, 
administration, engineering and maintenance departments. 
Retention rates remain good with employee turnover of  
6.6% (2014: 6.7%). 
DELIVERING SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
Our high revenue growth and good cost control have driven 
strong profit growth and this year we have recorded record 
profit for the fifth consecutive year. Our cash generation is also 
strong. We generated £895 million in operating cash, before 
investing £532 million, principally in the acquisition of 20 aircraft. 
easyJet ended the year with net cash of £435 million and 
gearing of 14%, marginally below the bottom end of the  
Board’s target range. 
Return on capital employed increased to 22.2% from 20.5% last 
year, as the increase in profit more than made up for the increase 
in fleet. As we embark on a new phase of fleet acquisition we 
expect this to reduce slightly in the next few years, whilst 
remaining among the higher performers in the market.
As we look forward, we expect that our ability to grow revenue 
and the renewed focus on cost will deliver strong earnings 
momentum and significant returns to shareholders.

• A $10 movement per metric tonne impacts the 2016 financial 
year fuel bill by $3.5 million.
• A one cent movement in £/$ impacts the 2016 financial year

• A one cent movement in £/€ impacts the 2016 financial year 
profit before tax by £0.7 million.
• A one cent movement in £/CHF impacts the 2016 financial 
year profit before tax by £0.4 million.
OUTLOOK
We remain confident in our ability to deliver growth and returns 
for shareholders as we continue to execute our strategy. For the 
year to 30 September 2016 we plan to increase capacity by c.7% 
and by c.8% in the first half of the year as we invest in profitable 
growth. We will continue to expand in our new bases of 
Hamburg, Amsterdam and Oporto as well as consolidating our 
strong market positions in the UK, Switzerland, France and Italy. 
Demand remains resilient and with forward bookings in line with 
last year, we view the future with confidence. 
Based on current market fuel prices we expect the unit fuel
(4)
 bill 
to decline by between £140 million and £160 million during the 
year to 30 September 2016. As you would expect, passengers 
will continue to benefit from the lower fuel cost and therefore 
we expect a slight decline in revenue per seat at constant 
currency during the first half of the year.
HEDGING POSITIONS
easyJet operates under a clear set of treasury policies agreed by the Board. The aim of easyJet’s hedging policy is to reduce short 
term earnings volatility. Therefore, easyJet hedges forward, on a rolling basis, between 65% and 85% of the next 12 months 
anticipated fuel and currency requirements and between 45% and 65% of the following 12 months anticipated requirements.
Details of current hedging arrangements are set out below:
Percentage of anticipated requirement hedged
Fuel 
requirement
US Dollar 
requirement
Euro 
surplus
CHF 
surplus
Six months to 31 March 2016 85% 89% 75% 69%
Average rate $852 /metric tonne $1.62 €1.20 CHF 1.46
Full year ending 30 September 2016 83% 81% 80% 67%
Average rate $830 /metric tonne $1.63 €1.22 CHF 1.46
Full year ending 30 September 2017 60% 61% 54% 51%
Average rate $664 /metric tonne $1.55 €1.33 CHF 1.43
We expect a slight decline in total cost per seat at constant 
currency including fuel for the full year of approximately 1%, based 
on jet fuel prices within a range of $450 per metric tonne to $556 
per metric tonne. Cost per seat excluding fuel and currency is 
expected to increase by approximately 2% for the full year. This 
will be weighted towards the first six months to 31 March 2016, 
primarily reflecting further increases in regulated airports costs and 
navigation charges, disruption costs and an expected cold winter. 
Exchange rate movements
(5)
 are likely to have an adverse impact 
of approximately £15 million in the first half year compared to the 
six months to 31 March 2015 and £40 million for the 12 months  
to 30 September 2016 compared to the 12 months to  
30 September 2015. Consequently market expectations are  
in line within the Board’s expectations for the full year.
We continue to see significant longer term opportunities to  
grow revenue, profit and shareholder returns. We expect market 
demand to remain strong and easyJet’s unique model and 
strategy are well-positioned to capture significant value from 
favourable trends in both leisure and business markets.

Year-on-year seats flown grew by 4.9%. T otal revenue per seat  
fell by 1.3% to £62.48. At constant currency, revenue per seat  
grew by 1.5% to £64.28. 
Excluding fuel, cost per seat decreased by 0.9% to £37.35, and 
increased by 3.6% at constant currency. This increase includes 
higher disruption costs following French ATC strikes in April and 
the impact of two fires at Rome Fiumicino airport. There were  
also additional costs due to increased airport charges, the early 
recruitment of crew in the winter to provide a resilient operation 
ahead of three crew base openings, and a one-off settlement of 
£8 million with Eurocontrol in the second half of the year.

ROCE for the year was 22.2%, an improvement of 1.7 percentage points on the prior year. The impact of hedging reserve movements 
on capital employed represents 0.8 percentage points of this increase. The acquisition of 20 aircraft during the year contributed  
to an overall 9.1% increase in capital employed which was more than compensated for by the increase in profit for the year. 
The combined effect of the profit for the year and the lower lease adjustment following the return of five leased aircraft, offset  
the impact of capital expenditure and the ordinary dividend payment, resulting in gearing of 14% (2014: 17%), which is marginally 
outside the target range of 15% to 30%.
EXCHANGE RATES
The strong performance of UK beach routes and the strengthening of sterling against Euro year-on-year resulted in an increase  
in the proportion of sales denominated in sterling. The relative weakness in the Euro was observable to a greater extent in cost  
than revenues due to the timing of the revenue and cost cash flows.

Cost per seat excluding fuel decreased by 0.9% to £37.35 but increased by 3.6% per seat at constant currency.
Airports and ground handling cost per seat decreased by 3.4% but increased by 2.4% at constant currency. This increase reflects 
higher charges at regulated airports, primarily in Italy, partially offset by savings from renegotiated airport contracts. Higher levels  
of de-icing costs in the first half of the year also contributed to the uplift. 
Crew cost per seat rose by 0.6% to £6.73, and by 3.8% at constant currency. This was driven by early recruitment of crew in  
the winter to provide a resilient operation ahead of three crew base openings together with the cost of regular pay increases.
Navigation costs decreased by 2.8% to £4.17 per seat but were up by 5.1% at constant currency due to annual price increases and  
a one-off £8 million settlement with Eurocontrol. 
Maintenance cost per seat increased by 3.1% to £3.06, and by 3.8% at constant currency. The 2014 financial year benefited from a 
reduction in the cost of heavy maintenance following a revised engine contract, a significant proportion of this reduction was one-off 
in nature and did not recur this year. This impact was partially offset by reduced maintenance from the return of five leased aircraft 
during the year and some benefits of a reduced maintenance contract in the year. Strategic report Governance Accounts
21 www.easyJet.com
Other costs per seat increased by 8.2% to £3.70 per seat, and by 9.6% at constant currency. There were increased disruption costs 
during the year due to the French ATC strikes in April and the two fires at Rome Fiumicino airport. Investment in the development  
of our digital customer proposition also contributed to the increased cost per seat.
Aircraft dry leasing cost per seat fell by 12.6% to £1.51 and by 9.7% at constant currency due to the return of five leased aircraft 
during the year and the extension of 12 aircraft leases at lower monthly rentals.
Depreciation costs have increased by 11.8% on a per seat basis. The increase is principally driven by the acquisition of 20 new  
A320 aircraft, which increased the average number of owned fleet by 9.7% from 150 in 2014 to 164 in 2015.

During the period the average market Jet fuel price fell by 36.4% to $619 per tonne from $973 per tonne in the previous year.  
The operation of easyJet’s fuel hedging policy meant that the average effective fuel price movement only saw a decrease of  
10.7% to $872 per tonne from $977 per tonne in the previous year.

(2014: £985 million) and borrowings of £504 million (2014: £563 million). After allowing for the impact of aircraft operating leases, 
adjusted net debt has decreased by £83 million to £363 million. As a result, gearing has decreased by three percentage points to 14%  
at 30 September 2015.
Net capital expenditure includes the acquisition of 20 aircraft (2014: nine aircraft), the purchase of life-limited parts used in engine 
restoration and pre-delivery payments relating to aircraft purchases.
easyJet made net corporation tax payments totalling £98 million during the 2015 financial year (2014: £96 million).
Cash and money market deposits as at 30 September 2015 were £939 million, a reduction of £46 million from the end of the prior 
financial year. At 30 September 2015, £619 million (2014: £572 million) of cash and money market deposits represented unearned 
revenue in relation to flight seats sold but not yet flown.
On 10 February 2015 easyJet signed a $500 million revolving credit facility with a minimum five-year term, and continues to have 
available funds in excess of its liquidity objective of £4 million per aircraft. 22 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Net assets increased by £77 million, with the adverse movement on the hedging reserve and the payment of the ordinary dividend more 
than off set by the profit and cash generated in the period. The movement on the hedging reserve was due to the adverse mark-to-
market movement on Jet fuel forward contracts offset to an extent by favourable movements on foreign currency forward contracts. 
The net book value of property, plant and equipment increased by £335 million, driven principally by the acquisition of 20 A320 
family aircraft, and pre-delivery payments relating to other aircraft purchases.

GOING CONCERN
easyJet’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future 
development and performance, are described in the strategic report on 
pages 1 to 45. Principal risks and uncertainties are described on pages 24  
to 29. Note 22 to the accounts sets out the Group’s objectives, policies and 
procedures for managing its capital and gives details of the risks related to 
financial instruments held by the Group.
The Group holds cash and cash equivalents of £650 million and money 
market deposits of £289 million as at 30 September 2015. T otal debt of  
£504 million is free from financial covenants, with £182 million due for 
repayment in the year to 30 September 2016.
Net current liabilities at 30 September 2015 were £489 million but included 
unearned revenue (payments made by customers for flights scheduled  
post year end) of £619 million.
The business is exposed to fluctuations in jet fuel prices and US dollar and 
euro exchange rates. The Group’s policy is to hedge between 65% and 85% 
of estimated exposures 12 months in advance, and 45% and 65% of 
estimated exposures from 13 up to 24 months in advance. The Group was 
compliant with this policy at the date of this Annual report and accounts.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group will be able to operate within the level of available 
facilities and cash and deposits for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,  
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Directors have assessed easyJet’s viability over a three-year period to 
September 2018. This is based on three years of the strategic plan, which  
gives greater certainty over the forecasting assumptions used.
In making their assessment, the Directors took account of easyJet’s current 
financial and operational positions and contracted capital expenditure. They 
also assessed the potential financial and operational impacts, in severe but 
plausible scenarios, of the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 
24 to 29 and the likely degree of effectiveness of current and available 
mitigating actions.
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet  
all their liabilities as they fall due up to September 2018. 
In making this statement, the Directors have also made the following key 
assumptions:
• funding for capital expenditure in the form of capital markets debt, bank 
debt or aircraft leases will be available in all plausible market conditions;
• there will not be a prolonged grounding of a substantial portion of  
the fleet; and
• in the event that the UK votes to leave the European Union, the terms  
of exit are such that easyJet would be able to continue to operate  
over broadly the same network as at present. Strategic report Governance Accounts

KEY STATISTICS 24 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Risk
Risk management framework
The Group faces a number of risks which, if they arise, could affect its ability to achieve 
its strategic objectives. The Board is responsible for determining the nature of these risks 
and ensuring appropriate mitigating actions are in place to manage them effectively.
Risk appetite
The level of risk it is considered appropriate to accept in 
achieving easyJet's strategic objectives is reviewed and validated 
by the Board on an annual basis. The appropriateness of the 
mitigating actions is determined in accordance with the Board 
approved risk appetite for the relevant area.
Risk management process
The diagram below sets out easyJet's risk management process. 
This is co-ordinated by the risk team, which reports to the  
Chief Financial Officer. The key elements of the process are:
• The risk management process begins with the identification of 
significant risks by each function. Risk identification workshops 
are run to identify matters which could materially impact on 
the functions or the wider business. These are attended by 
Executive Management T eam members and senior managers. 
• Risks are assessed taking into account the potential impact 
and likelihood of the risks occurring and the key mitigations 
identified. The current level of risk is compared to the Board's 
risk appetite to determine whether further mitigations are 
required. Risks specific to the function's activities are managed 
within the function on an ongoing basis with regular follow-up 
by the risk team. 
• The most significant risks from each function (based on 
materiality, cross-functional impact and/or those which have 
common themes across the business) are reviewed by the 
Risk Evaluation Group, which consists of members of senior 
management from each function. This Group's role is to 
debate, agree and prioritise the principal business risks. 
• These risks, which form the basis for the principal risks and 
uncertainties detailed in this section, are challenged and 
validated by the Executive Management T eam and the Board. 
• The principal business risks are monitored and managed 
throughout the year by the Executive Management T eam  
and the Board with the risk team. Risk reports are provided  
to the Board on a quarterly basis as a minimum.
• In addition to supporting the Board, the risk team supports the 
business in its management of risks relating to key projects, 
third parties, countries and bases.

The risks and uncertainties described below are considered, at this 
point in time, to have the greatest effect on easyJet's strategic 
objectives. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. Whilst easyJet 
can monitor risks and prepare for adverse scenarios, the ability  
to affect the core drivers of many risks is not within the Group's 
control, for example adverse weather, pandemics, acts of terrorism, 
changes in government regulation and macroeconomic issues.

Major safety incident
A major safety incident (such as a hull loss) 
could adversely affect easyJet's reputation and 
its operational and financial performance. The 
impact of such an incident would be heightened 
if easyJet failed to react promptly and deal with 
it effectively.

easyJet operates a Safety Management System using a leading software system 
(SafetyNet). This is used to:
• collect and analyse safety data (enabling potential areas of risk to be 
projected); and
• enable learning from easyJet and industry events/incidents to be captured  
and embedded into future risk mitigations.
A robust incident reporting process and 'Just Culture' are in place.

A Security Decision Making Group, comprising the Chairman, Chief Executive, 
appropriate members of the Executive Management T eam and other senior 
management, determines whether easyJet should continue to operate in 
countries or areas affected by security-related incidents. 
The Director of Safety and Security and the Head of Security work with 
authorities and governments around easyJet's network to assess whether 
security measures are effective and in compliance with regulatory requirements. 
A significant amount of work is carried out with the aim of enhancing: 
• early identification of developing and emerging security risks; 
• the active management of security risks; 
• the methods for reducing the impact of any security-related incident; and 
• the Group's security culture and awareness. 26 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
Risk description Mitigation
Significant network disruption
A number of factors could lead to widespread 
disruption to easyJet's network, including forces 
of nature (extreme weather, volcanic ash, etc.), 
terrorism, epidemics/pandemics or the closure 
of a key airport.
Significant disruption to the network could 
significantly adversely affect easyJet's reputation 
and its operational and financial performance. 
Link to strategy:
1 2 3 4
There are processes in place, and clear roles and responsibilities within teams 
across the business, to manage significant disruption.
A business disruption team, which includes senior management from relevant 
business areas, determines and initiates required action.
A business continuity programme is in place.
Board policy is to maintain target liquidity at £4 million per aircraft, which is 
supported by a $500 million (five-year) revolving credit facility provided by a 
group of 12 relationship banks. This allows the Group to better manage the 
impact of downturns in business or temporary curtailment of activities.
In addition, easyJet holds business disruption insurance.
Critical IT system failure and continuity  
of services
easyJet is dependent on a number of key 
IT systems and processes. 
A loss of critical systems or access to facilities, 
including the website, could lead to significant 
disruption and could have an adverse 
operational, reputational and financial impact.
Link to strategy:
2 3 5
Key systems are hosted across two data centres in two distinct locations, with 
failover arrangements between them, or within third-party provider locations,  
for which failover arrangements are contractually agreed with them.
IT disaster recovery plans are in place and tested regularly to identify areas  
for improvement in resilience.
An IT incident management team is in place to respond rapidly to any 
unforeseen incidents that may arise.
If there is a need to relocate critical staff due to the loss of facilities, alternative 
sites are available at short notice.
Delivery of projects supporting the  
business strategy
The business is undertaking a number of  
key projects and programmes to deliver  
key elements of the strategy. 
If these projects and programmes fail to deliver 
the business benefits and cost savings planned, 
easyJet could fall short of its planned  
financial results. 
Link to strategy:
1 2 3 4 5
A Steering Group, consisting of the Executive Management T eam and key  
senior management, provides challenge to project teams, monitors progress  
and ensures that decisions are made at the appropriate level.
Key IT projects or programmes have additional oversight through the IT 
Governance and Oversight Committee (a committee of the Board).

A portfolio management office is in place to oversee delivery of projects and 
programmes, and track budgets and realisation of benefits. 
A project management framework, which sets out the governance requirements, 
key processes and controls, is followed by all projects and programmes. 
Third-party service providers
easyJet has entered into agreements with 
third-party service providers for services 
covering a significant proportion of its 
operational and cost base. 
Failure to adequately manage third party 
performance could adversely affect easyJet's 
reputation and its operational and  
financial performance.

easyJet has a centralised procurement team which aims to provide the Group 
with competitive supply options. 
Following the supplier selection process the contract is managed according  
to easyJet's supplier management framework, whose key principles cover 
defined ownership and accountability, a governance framework and  
effective communication.
Alternative service providers are identified and assessed within the major markets 
in which easyJet operates.
Robust transition plans are agreed in the event of switching suppliers to enable 
an acceptable level of service to be maintained. Strategic report Governance Accounts

Risk description Mitigation
Industrial action
easyJet, and the aviation industry in general,  
has a significant number of employees who are 
members of trade unions. Industrial action taken 
by easyJet employees, or by the employees of 
key third-party service providers, could impact on 
easyJet's ability to maintain its flight schedules.
This could adversely affect easyJet's reputation 
and its operational and financial performance.
Link to strategy:
2 3 5
As easyJet operates across Europe there are 18 unions and nine representative 
bodies across eight countries of which crew are members. easyJet seeks to 
maintain positive working relationships with all trade unions and other 
representative bodies. 
Each of the countries in which easyJet operates has localised employment terms 
and conditions. This mitigates the risk of large-scale internal industrial action 
occurring at the same time.
Processes are in place to adapt to disruptions as a result of industrial action. 
Senior management succession 
easyJet's current and future success is reliant on 
having the right people with the right capabilities 
in key leadership positions.
Failure to develop and grow the capabilities  
and behaviours required of senior management 
so that there are clear successors for all key 
business roles, could adversely affect easyJet's 
ability to deliver its strategic objectives.

easyJet's aim is to develop talent from within. There are several talent 
development programmes in place for individuals who have been identified  
for fast-tracking into more senior roles as vacancies arise. 
In addition, a management development programme is in place to develop 
people management and senior leadership capabilities. These programmes 
operate at various levels within the organisation. 
There is an annual succession planning process.
Single fleet risk
easyJet is dependent on Airbus as its sole 
supplier for aircraft. 
There are significant cost and efficiency 
advantages of a single fleet, however,  
there are two main associated risks: 
• technical or mechanical issues that could 
ground the full fleet, or part of the fleet,  
which could cause negative perception; and
• valuation risks which crystallise when aircraft 
exit the fleet. The main exposure at this time 
is with the ageing A319 fleet, where easyJet  
is reliant on the future demand for second-
hand aircraft.
Link to strategy:
3 4
The Board considers that the efficiencies achieved by operating a single fleet 
type outweigh the risks associated with easyJet's single fleet strategy. 
The Airbus A320 family (which includes the A319) is one of the two primary fleets 
used for short-haul travel. There are approximately 6,000 A320 family aircraft 
operating with a proven track record for reliability. 
easyJet operates a rigorous established aircraft maintenance programme. 
T o mitigate the potential valuation risks, easyJet regularly reviews the second-
hand market and has a number of different options when looking at fleet  
exit strategies. Leasing facilitates the exit of A319 aircraft from the fleet by 
transferring residual value risk, and also provides flexibility in managing  
the fleet size.

Financial risk
easyJet is exposed to a variety of financial risks 
which could give rise to adverse pressure on  
the financial performance of the Company,  
e.g. costs, revenue.
• Market risks – significant/sudden increases in 
jet fuel prices, currency fluctuations or interest 
rates which have not been adequately 
protected through hedging
• Counterparty risk – non-performance of 
counterparties used for depositing surplus 
funds (e.g. money market funds,  
bank deposits)
• Liquidity risk – misjudgement in the level  
of liquidity resulting in inability to meet 
contractual/contingent financial obligations  
or the inability to fund the business  
when needed.

This includes: 
• a treasury policy setting out Board approved strategies for foreign exchange 
and fuel hedging, along with liquidity, interest rate management, counterparties 
and cash deposit limits; and
• reviewing and reporting on compliance with Board treasury policies.
The policy is to hedge within a percentage band for a rolling 24-month period.
Board policy is to maintain target liquidity at £4 million per aircraft, which is 
supported by a $500 million (five-year) revolving credit facility provided by  
a group of 12 relationship banks. This allows the Group to better manage  
the impact of downturns in business or temporary curtailment of activities. 
A strong balance sheet supports the business through fluctuations in

Major shareholder and brand  
owner relationship
easyJet has two major shareholders (easyGroup 
Holdings Limited and Polys Holding Limited) 
which, as a concert party, control 33.73% of  
its ordinary shares. Shareholder activism could 
adversely impact the reputation of easyJet  
and cause a distraction to management.
easyJet does not own its Company name or 
branding, which is licensed from easyGroup Ltd. 
The licence includes certain minimum service 
levels that easyJet must meet in order to retain 
the right to use the name and brand. The easyJet 
brand could also be impacted through the actions 
of easyGroup or other easyGroup licensees.

easyJet has an active shareholder engagement programme led by its investor 
relations team. As part of that programme easyJet engages with easyGroup 
Holdings Limited on a regular basis alongside its other major shareholders. 
In addition to engaging with easyGroup as part of the shareholder engagement 
programme, the Company has a relationship agreement with easyGroup and 
Polys Holdings in line with the controlling shareholder regime as set out in the 
Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules.

Representatives from the Board and senior management take collective 
responsibility for addressing issues arising from any activist approach adopted  
by the major shareholder. The objective is to proactively address issues before 
they arise and anticipate and plan for potential future activism.
The brand licence agreement with easyGroup Ltd provides for the regular 
meeting of senior representatives from both sides to actively manage brand-
related issues as they arise. Such meetings occur on a quarterly basis and have 
proven effective. easyJet also monitors compliance with brand licence service 
levels and has a right to take steps to remedy any instance of non-compliance.

Cyber threat and information security
easyJet receives most of its revenue through 
credit card transactions and operates as an 
e-commerce business. It faces both external 
cyber threats and internal risks to its data  
and systems.
A security breach could negatively impact 
easyJet's reputation and have an adverse 
operational and financial impact.
Link to strategy:

An Information Security Steering Group, chaired by the General Counsel, 
oversees any developments in data threats and controls and determines  
whether appropriate responses are being taken to them. 
There is a dedicated information security team to monitor and manage 
information security risk. The following controls are in place: 
• monitoring of secure systems against unauthorised access;
• reviewing the security of internal systems and easyJet.com through quarterly 
vulnerability scanning;
• periodic mandatory employee security training to maintain staff awareness;
• considering information security risks within procurement processes and  
the introduction of new systems and IT services; 
• monitoring and control of scanning software for fraudulent customer activity 
by the revenue protection team; and 
• providing robust physical security at head office buildings.
Given the nature of this risk the appropriateness of the controls is under 
continuous review.
Competition and industry consolidation
easyJet operates in competition with both  
flag carriers and other low-cost airlines. 
easyJet's key competitive advantages include  
its network, cost base, digital innovation and 
efficient and robust capital structure. Failure  
to retain these advantages or react quickly to 
competitor changes could have an adverse 
financial impact.
Industry consolidation could also affect the 
competitive environment in a number of 
markets. This could cause a loss of market 
position and erosion of revenue.
Link to strategy:
1 2 3
easyJet seeks to have a rapid response to any such activity that may impact 
easyJet's ability to grow the business. 
Competitor and consolidation activity is monitored, enabling key routes/positions 
to be readily defended.
The Network Development Forum, a cross-functional panel of senior executives, 
approves new bases and the allocation of assets around the network.
Fleet framework arrangements, together with the Group's leasing policy, provide 
easyJet with significant flexibility in respect of scaling the fleet according to 
business requirements.
Strong cost control is a key behaviour across the Company, with initiatives to 
drive cost reduction and improve efficiency in targeted areas.
Legislative and regulatory risks
easyJet is exposed to legislative and regulatory 
oversight across its network and all countries where 
it sells its product via a native language website. This 
will increase as easyJet grows geographically and 
the number of local language websites increases. 
Failure to comply with legislative and regulatory 
requirements (or interpretations thereof), such as 
local consumer laws, passenger compensation for 
certain long flight delays and cancellations, and 
environmental and airport regulations, in the 
jurisdictions in which easyJet operates could have 
an adverse reputational and financial impact.
In the event the UK votes to leave the European 
Union, the terms of exit could have implications  
for easyJet to continue to operate the network it 
does currently.

The Regulatory Affairs Group co-ordinates easyJet's role in influencing future  
and existing policy and regulations which affect the airline industry.
Country oversight Boards are established for easyJet's main markets, raising 
awareness of potential changes and impacts in the different countries. Industry 
bodies and legal advisers in-country are also used to understand and develop 
appropriate responses to new legislation.
easyJet has an in-house legal team to monitor compliance with formal  
regulatory requirements.

Corporate responsibility
How we run our business responsibly
CAROLYN MCCALL OBE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE
At easyJet we seek to be a responsible company 
and make a positive contribution to society. We 
want to do the right thing for our customers, our 
people, our partners, the communities in which 
we operate and the environment. This is very 
important to the continued success of the 
business. Everyone who has a relationship with 
easyJet expects the airline to act responsibly  
and continue to improve.
Safety is always easyJet's highest priority and comes before any of 
our other responsibilities. We continue to maintain comprehensive 
processes and structures to monitor and manage safety-related risk 
throughout the Company.
We remain passionate about making travel easy and affordable for 
our customers. Our Customer Charter has continued to be a guide 
for all our people. This year we have particularly focused on how we 
support customers when there is disruption to their journey. We have 
made improvements to our support at airports and in our 
communication to customers, including innovative use of digital 
technology such as the easyJet mobile app.
Our culture is an essential part of our success. Bringing the values of 
safety, pioneering, one team, passion, integrity and simplicity alive 
every day is important to all our people. So it is essential that easyJet 
continues to attract, develop and retain the right people. It is our 
people who will help to meet our ambition of being Europe's 
preferred short-haul airline. 
We value diversity and believe it contributes to our continued 
success. One aspect of this is female talent in our business. easyJet 
already focuses on ensuring there is a pipeline of women coming up 
through the organisation. The easyJet women's network started four 
years ago and has now got great momentum, which comes from 
the women across our airline. It strengthens this pipeline of talent.
As part of increasing the representation of women across the airline, 
we are now increasing our efforts to recruit female pilots. We 
recognise that the proportion of our pilots who are female is too low, 
though this is common in the airline industry. We want to encourage 
more women to join and stay in this interesting, highly-skilled and 
well-rewarded profession. We have set an initial target to double the 
proportion of female new entrant pilots over two years, as the first 
phase of a long-term strategy to increase the proportion of female 
pilots in the airline and bring more women into more senior ranks  
and management roles.
The nature of our business means that our carbon emissions will 
be our largest environmental impact for the foreseeable future. 
We continue to be an efficient airline, due to a modern fleet  
and high load factor. It is the right thing to continue to work to 
reduce our environmental impact, but it is also absolutely central 
to maintaining our cost advantage and wider business efficiency. 
In 2013 we set targets to reduce our carbon emissions per 
passenger kilometre by 5% by 2022 and we have already 
achieved a 3% reduction, so we have increased the target  
further to 8% by 2020. 
We also want to have strong, positive and effective relationships with 
our partners. We already have very good relationships with most of 
them. We have established a supplier relationship management 
framework, based on the easyJet values. This guides relationships 
and clearly sets out our partners' rights and responsibilities.
We are working to reduce and manage waste from our 
operations. A new project is being led by one of our Luton-based 
pilots who has also recently completed an MBA in business 
sustainability. The project will focus on reducing the amount  
of waste from on-board our aircraft, by engaging with our 
customers, our crew and our supply chain.
For the first time, this year we are including an independent 
report from Rt Hon the Lord Blunkett, Chair of the easyJet 
Special Assistance Advisory Group, in the annual report. This 
group has continued to provide valuable advice and challenge  
to easyJet on how we support people who need assistance 
when travelling. A visible sign of the progress this year is that 
every easyJet aircraft now has an on-board wheelchair.
I am very pleased that this year we have passed the milestone  
of £5 million in fundraising for Unicef. This is down to our crews' 
on-board appeals and the generosity of our customers. In light  
of this success, and our excellent relationship with Unicef, we 
decided this year to continue the partnership for a further three 
years. The renewed partnership aims to raise at least a further  
£5 million and increase the work between easyJet and Unicef  
in all key European markets.
Our customers and employees have told us that they value the 
Unicef partnership but they also want us to increase the 
contribution we make locally. We have recently expanded this 
work, initially in the Luton area around our head office, in 
partnership with a new organisation called Connecting 
Enterprising Women. They have partnered easyJet female 
managers with young women in education, to provide mentoring 
and careers advice. This complements easyJet's emphasis on 
mentoring within the business to support career and personal 
development. Over the next year we hope to develop this 
programme and look for other ways we can have a positive 
impact in the areas around some of our key bases.
easyJet has made good progress, as seen by the varied 
initiatives. Our people are energised and motivated by these 
priorities and we all recognise we can continue to do a lot more.

SAFETY FIRST
easyJet's highest priority is the safety of its 
passengers and people. Safety is a guiding 
principle and informs the decisions made by the 
Company. The airline continues to develop an 
open safety culture that promotes continuous 
improvements in safety performance. 
Comprehensive processes and structures are 
maintained to monitor and manage safety-related 
risk throughout the airline. The safety management 
structure is led from the top of the organisation. 
The Chief Executive of easyJet Airline Company Limited (EACL) 
and the Accountable Manager of easyJet Switzerland S.A. (EZS) 
are responsible for all aspects of safety delivery, including 
compliance obligations under the EACL Air Operator Certificate 
and the EZS Air Operator Certificate, respectively. The Company 
also has Nominated Persons responsible for safety in certain 
aspects of the airline's operations.
The Chief Executive chairs the Company's Safety Review Board 
which meets monthly to assess reports from the Safety Action 
Groups across the airline. This review and assessment process 
delivers monthly reports to both the UK Civil Aviation Authority 
and the easyJet Board.
T o further strengthen the safety structure and allow more 
in-depth review of safety matters, the easyJet Board established 
the Safety Committee in 2013. 
T urn to page: 52
For further information on the Safety Committee
No compromise on safety
easyJet does not compromise on safety. The Company has 
established a leading-edge Safety Management System and 
Fatigue Risk Management System which are well established and 
incorporate rigorous reporting processes. Through these systems 
easyJet works to drive safety performance improvements and 
reduce risks to its people, passengers and suppliers. 
easyJet has long pioneered innovative solutions to improve 
safety and continues to seek better ways to support our people 
to improve safety performance. In particular the airline continues 
to focus on developing its understanding of human factors to 
support this.
The airline's Fatigue Risk Management System provides analytical 
data to determine reliable methods of predicting fatigue and 
alertness in pilots. It was established over 10 years ago and is  
one of only two such systems approved for use by the UK Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA). easyJet has collaborated with the  
US National Aeronautics and Space Administration on fatigue 
research and analysis and is now working with the CAA to 
develop fatigue management principles which will be a 
benchmark for the rest of the aviation industry.
easyJet is now also able to use data from flights, following 
agreement from many pilot representative groups across  
Europe, to monitor flight behaviours and better understand  
any operational issues which should be considered in relation  
to this important area.
The Company's strong focus on safety has helped it meet  
the new regulatory compliance requirements prescribed by  
the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
easyJet continues to work closely with EASA on the 
development of future safety regulations. This has included 
easyJet's Director of Safety and Security being a member of 
EASA's EU taskforce following the Germanwings incident.
In advance of the recommendation of EASA and the CAA, 
easyJet implemented measures to ensure at least two crew  
are in the cockpit at all times during a flight. All easyJet pilots  
are licensed by their national regulator and as part of this are 
subject to extensive regular medical assessments. In addition,  
all easyJet's pilots are continually scrutinised and monitored  
from recruitment to training and operating to ensure they are 
fully fit to operate.
easyJet takes all incidents of disruptive behaviour on-board very 
seriously. The Company does not tolerate abusive or threatening 
behaviour on-board and seeks prosecutions where appropriate.  
It has established an internal working group on this issue and is 
also an active participant in the British Air T ransport Association 
group, which brings together airlines, airports, airport retailers 
and the police.
This year easyJet has also joined the Flight Safety Foundation,  
an international non-profit organisation whose purpose is to 
provide impartial, independent, expert safety guidance and 
resources for the aviation and aerospace industries.
This year easyJet appointed a new Director of Safety and 
Security. Geoff Want joined easyJet in October 2014, having 
previously been a non-executive aviation safety adviser to  
the Board since December 2012.
Geoff reports directly to the Chief Executive and Chairman 
and has a remit to act independently outside of other 
operational or commercial considerations.
Geoff is an aviation safety expert and previously held the role 
of Director of Safety, Security and Risk Management at British 
Airways during his over 30 year career at the airline. At British 
Airways he became a member of the airline's Executive 
Board, where he had responsibility for operational planning 
and delivery, whilst also developing the company's risk 
management system. He later became aviation safety adviser 
to Rio Tinto, the global mining company. Throughout his 
career Geoff has worked closely with aviation safety and 
regulatory bodies.

A RESPONSIBLE AND SUPPORTIVE EMPLOYER
easyJet wants to be an employer that attracts 
and retains the best people, values and promotes 
diversity, and seeks to support and develop its 
employees. It is on the strength of its people that 
it will be able to meet the Company's ambition  
to be Europe's preferred short-haul airline. 
The airline has a three-part people strategy to help deliver this:
A T THE GA TE
Making sure that the Company has the right people, in the right 
job, at the right time, equipped to succeed and supported by 
processes that work.
ON BOARD
Is about living the values, wanting to be part of the Company's 
success and knowing the part they play in delivering this.
ABLE TO FLY
Means promoting a high-performance culture where continuous 
improvement is expected, managed and rewarded so that all 
people achieve their potential and deliver success.
At the gate – ensuring easyJet has the right people
The significant growth of easyJet has meant it has been crucial 
to recruit high numbers of crew across Europe. Through a 
high-volume recruitment programme it has successfully 
maintained optimum employee levels and recruited over  
290 pilots and over 1,300 cabin crew during the year.
In addition, the Company has recruited 390 people within  
the management and administration and engineering and 
maintenance teams to support the growth of the business. In 
line with retention and development goals, 35% of these were 
recruited internally. As at 30 September 2015 easyJet employed 
10,388 (2014: 9,649) people across Europe. 
The Company's recruitment processes are supported by 
continued high retention rates. This year employee turnover  
was 6.6%, compared to 6.7% in the 2014 financial year. Within 
the different easyJet communities the turnover this year was: 
11.3% for management and administration and engineering and 
maintenance, 2.7% for pilots and 7.2% for cabin crew.
On board – living easyJet's values
Once on board easyJet works with its people to help them 
understand easyJet's values and their role in the business and  
to help them achieve their full potential. The Company does this 
in a number of ways.
Induction
On joining the business all new recruits receive a detailed 
induction programme to introduce them to the business,  
its values and their role within easyJet. Induction includes 
mandatory e-learning in key areas including ethics, safeguarding 
our reputation, our customers (with a focus on the Customer 
Charter) and about customers who have reduced mobility. In 
addition, new recruits attend face-to-face induction sessions 
where they come together to learn about the business through 
interactive exercises.
Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in Europe 
and there are a significant number of cardiac arrests on 
aircraft each year. According to the British Heart Foundation, 
after a cardiac arrest, every minute without cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation and defibrillation reduces someone's chance of 
survival by 10%.
All easyJet aircraft now have on-board defibrillators. These 
devices are simple to use and give crews and any medical 
professionals travelling as passengers another option if 
someone on-board is having severe heart problems.
Instruction on how to use defibrillators is now part of easyJet 
crew training, in addition to the regular first aid training.
Safety reporting 
Under easyJet's Air Operator Certificates it is required to 
regularly report operating safety performance to the National 
Aviation Authorities (NAAs) and to EASA.
Injuries that occur on-board easyJet aircraft are reported under 
NAA regulations. easyJet has updated its Operational Safety 
reporting system, SafetyNet, to ensure that RIDDOR (Reporting 
of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations) 
categories are accurately reflected and reviewed as part of the 
investigation process. easyJet continues to review and develop 
this process so that these categories are thoroughly investigated, 
reviewed and reported.
Protecting customers and employees 
easyJet's security team works to reduce vulnerability to security-
related risks. The team co-operates closely with government and 
regulatory agencies throughout the network, to ensure strict 
compliance with security regulations. Security risk assessments are 
conducted for each airport and country to which easyJet flies.  
The highest standards of vigilance are maintained regarding the 
current geopolitical situation within those countries to inform these 
assessments. easyJet implements measures to protect the  
Company from corporate and aviation security risks, ensuring  
internal governance of business-sensitive and personal data, vetting 
our people and asset protection. 
Safety in the supply chain
easyJet has established a new risk-based programme focused 
around appropriate safety standards throughout its supply chain, 
including for our ground handling agents. This has involved the 
promotion of improved communication and engagement on 
safety issues and the sharing and learning from best practice.

Local employment and employee representatives
easyJet employs people on local contracts in eight countries 
across Europe, complying with national laws. This has a higher 
cost than the approach taken by some other airlines who 
employ all their people on one contract, irrespective of where 
they may work. easyJet does this so that its roles are attractive 
locally and to reflect each country's employment practices.
Many of our employees are represented by unions or other 
representative bodies. easyJet recognises the importance of 
actively engaging with these bodies across its operations to 
promote the success of the business. It works with eighteen 
unions and nine representative bodies across eight countries, 
undertaking dialogue and negotiation on a regular basis. easyJet 
actively supports employee representatives by allowing them 
released employee representatives for a total of 4,397 days at  
an estimated cost of £1.6 million. 
Engagement
easyJet works to promote its values and maintain a positive 
culture within the business.
T o assess the impact of this activity on employee engagement 
easyJet conducts regular surveys. The survey results for 2015 show 
that easyJet outperforms the airline norm based on data from the 
survey provider Ipsos Mori, which aggregates employee survey 
data from its many airline clients to provide industry averages.
Survey highlights:
• Employee engagement index (an overall result, based on 
survey results) – 83% (2014: 83%)
• The extent to which employees understand and support  
what easyJet is trying to achieve as an organisation – 87% 
(2014: 86%)
• The extent to which employees enjoy what they do and make 
a positive contribution to the organisation – 80% (2014: 80%)
• The extent to which the organisation is a good place to work 
and that employees want to continue being part of that – 84% 
(2014: 83%)
Following the survey easyJet has identified two main focus areas 
for improvement. It will respond to employee feedback on 
rosters and develop a plan to improve this process. easyJet  
will also consider how it engages with its employees at London 
Gatwick, the airline's largest base. This is particularly important  
as the engagement of easyJet's people and operational 
performance at London Gatwick have a significant impact on  
the airline's network as a whole.
easyJet's people continue to show a high level of commitment 
to working at easyJet, demonstrated by high employee 
attendance, which was 96.2% this year.
Able to fly – developing a high-performance culture
Learning and development
Supporting people to develop to their full potential and ensuring 
they have the right skills for their role is an essential part of 
maintaining a high-performance culture. 
easyJet provides significant new entrant and ongoing training  
for its pilots and cabin crew. T o meet the airline's future training 
needs it has this year opened a new training centre at London 
Gatwick Airport, which will be used by crew from across the 
easyJet network.
The airline has an established pilot cadet programme, in 
partnership with CTC Aviation and CAE Oxford Aviation 
Academy, to train people for their first full-time flying role.  
This year 223 cadets have completed their training with  
these providers and are now flying with easyJet.
In addition to role-specific training, easyJet also offers learning 
and development opportunities to all of its people. This year  
it offered 115 face-to-face training sessions, which had over  
1,200 participants, as well as 100 e-learning options.

easyJet has an apprenticeship programme within its engineering 
team, with currently 14 apprentices in the airline. The apprentices 
receive 8 months' classroom training, followed by 16 months with 
easyJet in a mix of aircraft maintenance and office-based roles. 
On completion of the programme the apprentices receive an 
NVQ Level 3 in aeronautical engineering and an 'A licence' to 
carry out standard maintenance tasks on aircraft.
easyJet's graduate programme currently has 38 participants from 
across Europe. The graduates spend two years in different parts 
of the airline to develop their skills and increase their knowledge.
easyJet also uses mentoring as a way to develop people, with 
benefits for both the mentee and mentor. All easyJet pilots are 
mentored by a more senior colleague and mentoring also takes 
place within the Company's management and administration 
community.
One team value
easyJet holds an annual 'Spirit Awards' event which celebrates the 
work of employees who live the easyJet values in their behaviour. 
easyJet managers decide which employees will get a ticket to  
the celebration event, which is attended by over 500 people.
easyJet bases and its head office also have culture teams in 
which employees volunteer to arrange activities such as team 
social events.
easyJet continues to support its managers through the 
Company's people management development programme, 
which aims to provide people managers with the skills and 
knowledge they need to effectively manage their direct reports. 
This programme is accredited by the University of Bedfordshire 
and counts towards ongoing study for an MBA. A total of 247 
managers have now completed this course, including 72 this year.
Connected crew
Connected crew is a programme to engage pilots more closely 
with the business by improving communication and offering 
further learning and development opportunities. Pilot focus 
groups are carried out to give pilots the opportunity to ask 
questions and provide feedback to the management team 
face-to-face. Since the programme began in 2013 sessions have 
been held at London Gatwick, Milan, Paris Charles de Gaulle, 
Bristol and Manchester and attended by over 980 pilots.
Command leadership training has been enhanced, so that it 
covers leadership and commercial awareness for new and 
existing captains. Since the programme began in 2013 over  
1,200 captains have received the training.
A culture of wellbeing
The physical and psychological health of the Company's people 
is important for its continued success and growth. easyJet's 
overall aim is to keep its people happy, healthy and in work.  
By analysing management information that comes from its 
specialist providers the airline has been seeking to improve 
existing services and provide targeted help and support for 
employees. Findings indicate that although it is necessary to 
continue to support and promote good physical health, there  
is a need to provide additional focus on people's psychological 
health. Current initiatives in this area include developing a peer 
support network, as well as improved training on mental health 
for all of its people.
easyJet is working with its new occupational health and 
employee assistance provider to further develop the support  
it offers to its employees. easyJet staff can now complete a 
health risk assessment, which gives a personalised health report 
and suggestions for positive lifestyle changes. There are also 
podcasts, factsheets and 'ask the expert' forums for our people 
to access information on a wide range of topics covering mental 
health, physical health and life skills such as parenting, 
relationships and debt management.
Recognition and reward
easyJet's approach to reward is critical to its ability to attract 
and retain people. The Company offers a competitive reward 
package designed to deliver a performance culture, with the 
emphasis on cash and variable pay rather than fixed benefits. 
The reward package includes an annual performance-driven 
bonus (based on personal and Group performance) and share 
awards (based on the financial performance of the Group).
easyJet is committed to being a Living Wage employer. All direct 
employees of easyJet in the UK are already paid above the  
'UK Living Wage', established by the Living Wage Foundation,  
which is currently £7.85 per hour and is above the UK National 
Minimum Wage. easyJet is working with the Living Wage 
Foundation to discuss considerations for the airline sector, such 
as variable pay for pilots and cabin crew, as well as the potential 
to extend the Living Wage to employees of airline suppliers.
Employee benefits
All easyJet employees, with a minimum amount of service, have 
the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company. At  
30 September 2015 they held interests in 12.6 million shares 
between them worth £224 million.
All employees can join easyJet's Save As You Earn scheme, 
which allows employees to save money from their salary with  
the option to purchase shares. All UK employees can take part  
in the Buy As You Earn scheme, in which employees can buy 
shares from their salary each month and easyJet buys matching 
shares. The UK schemes are approved by Her Majesty's Revenue 
& Customs. easyJet also awards Performance (Free) Shares  
to employees.
easyJet employees may, subject to their holdings and the share 
price performance, be able to realise gains in share value. For 
example, 1.5 million Performance (Free) Shares vested during  
the year and the Save As You Earn scheme, which matured 
during 2015, had an exercise price of £4.18. The share price  
at 30 September 2015 was £17.77.
easyJet also offers a small number of associated airline benefits 
in line with the Company's cost-focused approach. These include 
insurances and access to travel on easyJet services at cost price.
easyJet contributes towards a group personal pension plan in 
the UK and, where negotiated, to pension arrangements for 
employees in Germany and Portugal. 
easyJet aims to provide flexible working arrangements, part-time 
working and job sharing that fit its business model and the 
personal circumstances of its people. As at 30 September 2015 
there were 1,382 easyJet employees who worked part-time 
(working fewer than 35 hours per week), making up over 13%  
of the employee population.  Strategic report Governance Accounts

Equality and diversity
easyJet is an equal opportunities employer and the Company 
always treats its employees and applicants fairly regardless of  
their age, gender, sexuality, full or part-time status, disability  
and marital status.
easyJet values diversity and inclusivity and believes this 
contributes to the continued success of the Company, by 
attracting and retaining a workforce which reflects the airline's 
customer base and can engage with passengers as individuals.
easyJet employs people of 50 different nationalities. These people 
are predominantly from countries in which easyJet operates, 
which provides valuable insight about different markets.
As at 30 September 2015, the chart shows the 12 nationalities 
where easyJet has more than 50 employees. There are a further 
38 nationalities in the easyJet employee community which are 
grouped together. easyJet employs people in some countries 
where it is not legal to store employee nationality information,  
so these employees are not included in this data. easyJet holds 
records for 670 employees where their nationality is not recorded.

Gender equality
easyJet works hard to create an environment where women  
have the opportunity to build careers in all communities and at  
all management levels of the organisation, by ensuring there is  
a pipeline of women coming up through the organisation.
The Company believes that a significant issue for women in 
business is the lack of female executives at senior management 
level. Currently too many women are leaving work and the business 
community is losing a lot of talent before enough women get  
to executive positions.

FEMALE REPRESENT A TION
easyJet is a signatory to the “think, act, report” campaign which 
promotes equal opportunities for women in the workplace. The 
campaign provides a simple step-by-step framework to help 
companies think about gender equality in their workforces, 
particularly in relation to recruitment, retention, promotion and pay.
The Company has two female Directors on its Board: the Chief 
Executive and the Chairs of the Audit and Finance Committees.  
The Board continues to have a 20% female make-up.
As shown on page 50, 45% (5 of 11) of easyJet's Executive 
Management T eam are women, up from 4 of 11 in 2014.
Middle managers will provide the pipeline for future senior managers 
and increasing the number of women in this group is an important 
part of our strategy to grow the number of women in our Senior 
Management T eam. 
• Senior Management T eam – As at 30 September 2015, 15 people 
out of 65 total were female (23%). This is a year-on-year increase 
of one percentage point.
• Middle management – As at 30 September 2015, this group 
was 33.3% female. 
As at 30 September 2015, the overall easyJet workforce was 
45% female. (2014: 46%). 36 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Gender pay
easyJet welcomes the UK's Government's commitment to 
address the gender pay gap. The Company agrees that greater 
transparency would encourage organisations to give more 
consideration to gender pay and help to close the gender pay 
gap. However, to be meaningful the pay gap comparisons need 
to be made by type of role. Otherwise the statistics, which 
should be a useful guide for companies and employees, risk 
becoming distorted and losing their value.
As an illustration, female pay as a percentage of male pay  
at easyJet – irrespective of the type of role or any other 
consideration – is 38.6%. This is based on full-time equivalent 
basic salary of active UK employees. This is influenced by  
the salaries and gender make up of easyJet's two largest 
communities, its pilots and cabin crew. Pilots are predominantly 
male and their salaries are higher than for cabin crew, the 
majority of who are female.
However, easyJet salaries for equivalent roles are broadly equal 
across the genders, reflecting the Company's commitment  
to gender equality. Salaries for pilots and cabin crew are 
collectively agreed, meaning for example that a female captain's 
basic salary will be 100% that of a male captain and a female 
cabin crew member's basic salary will be 100% that of a male 
cabin crew member.
Within easyJet's management and administration community 
female pay as a percentage of male pay is 97% when comparing 
equivalent roles.
Disability
easyJet treats applicants with disabilities equally and supports 
current employees who become disabled. This includes offering 
flexibility and making reasonable adjustments to the workplace 
to ensure they can achieve their full potential. However, for 
easyJet's two largest communities, pilots and cabin crew,  
there are a range of regulatory requirements on health and 
physical ability which all applicants and current employees  
must comply with.
People reporting
easyJet is currently carrying out a project to improve its 
employee data management system. The Company does not 
hold sufficient data to report on other aspects of the diversity  
of its workforce, such as ethnicity, sexuality, gender identity  
or disability. 
In the meantime, easyJet is working with its employees and their 
representative groups to carry out voluntary surveys on diversity 
to better understand the make-up of its workforce and how the 
Company can further support its people, particularly those who 
may be part of minority groups.
T o assist this work, easyJet has recently begun working with 
OUTStanding, an organisation which promotes equality and 
inclusion for people of all sexualities in the workplace.
WOMEN'S NETWORK
easyJet's Women's Network 
started four years ago and this 
year it has been re-launched 
with a range of new activities. 
The group has a mission to 
empower and inspire women 
across the airline. A large event 
was held with the Chief 
Executive and members of the 
airline's Executive Management 
T eam. The group has also 
heard from a range of external 
speakers and female leaders 
within the airline. Strategic report Governance Accounts

EASYJET'S COMMITMENT ON HUMAN RIGHTS
easyJet has a responsibility to conduct business  
in an ethical and transparent way. The Company 
has in place policies to support recognised human 
rights principles. These include policies on non-
discrimination, health and safety, anti-bribery  
and environmental issues. The Company also 
maintains a zero tolerance approach to bribery 
and corruption.
easyJet seeks to comply with all relevant laws in the countries  
in which it operates, and co-operates with the efforts of national 
law enforcement agencies and border agencies to combat 
human rights abuses and crimes such as human trafficking. It 
adheres to a set of business principles including a commitment 
to internationally proclaimed human rights standards.
These standards apply for the individuals working within the 
organisation and its customers. The Company's policies seek  
to respect and maintain the human rights standards defined in  
the International Bill of Human Rights. The Company observes  
the principles set out by the International Labour Organisation 
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (the 
'ILO Declaration'). It accepts its corporate responsibility to respect 
human rights, as set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights (the 'UN Guiding Principles'). 
Employees: easyJet conducts its employment practices in an 
ethical and socially responsible manner. It respects the human 
rights of its employees as established in the four principles of  
the ILO Declaration:
• Freedom of association and the effective recognition of the 
right to collective bargaining: easyJet recognises and respects 
its employees' right to join associations and choose 
representative organisations for the purpose of engaging in 
collective bargaining in a manner consistent with applicable 
laws, rules and regulations.
• Elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour: 
easyJet does not utilise forced or compulsory labour. It recruits 
its employees and provides working conditions, including 
payment of wages and benefits, which comply with applicable 
laws and regulations. 
• Effective abolition of child labour: all easyJet employees  
are above the legal employment age in the country of  
their employment.
• Elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and 
occupation: easyJet has committed human resources policies 
including non-discrimination and health and safety policies.
Customers: easyJet is committed to making travel easy and 
affordable for all of its customers. It upholds the equal treatment 
of all passengers regardless of their personal characteristics or 
social status. This commitment is supported by the advice of 
stakeholders within easyJet and the continued involvement of 
the easyJet Special Assistance Advisory Group (ESAAG) in policy 
and product development.
Suppliers and third parties: easyJet will never knowingly infringe 
the human rights of others. It seeks to prevent or mitigate any 
adverse human rights impact directly linked to its business 
relationships through obtaining appropriate contractual 
commitments. It expects third parties who deal on its behalf  
easyJet recognises that the proportion of its pilots who  
are female is too low, though this is common in the airline 
industry. The Company wants to encourage more women  
to join and stay in this interesting, highly-skilled and well-
rewarded profession. 
easyJet has recently established a new initiative to increase the 
proportion of new entrant easyJet pilots who are female. This is 
part of a new strategy to encourage the development of female 
pilots at all ranks and positions and which will widen the pipeline 
of women who enter easyJet's pilot community.
Currently 5% of the over 2,600 pilots employed by easyJet are 
female and women make up 5% of easyJet's new entrant pilots. 
The airline plans to more than double the proportion of female 
new entrants to 12% over the next two years.
easyJet will highlight the opportunities of pilot careers to female 
audiences such as school groups and other youth organisations, 
through presentations by easyJet pilots and managers, building 
on the work easyJet already does in mentoring young women. 
easyJet will also work in partnership with organisations which 
promote female take-up of STEM (science, technology, 
engineering and maths) subjects.
easyJet will work with its pilot training providers to attract more 
women to apply for the cadet programme and offer 10 places 
for women each year on a pilot training programme with the 
training loan of around £100,000 underwritten by easyJet.
In addition to the current mentoring for all pilots, easyJet will 
introduce enhanced mentoring for female pilots. Female 
captains will be given further development support so they can 
take on leadership roles such as training and base management 
roles. easyJet will also introduce training loan underwriting for 
A320 type ratings for female pilots entering from other airlines.
FEMALE PILOTS

Rights, the ILO Declaration and the UN Guiding Principles.
Bribery and corruption
easyJet has a Company-wide anti-bribery and corruption policy 
which is strictly enforced. There is also a gifts and hospitality policy 
and online register to record all gifts and hospitality that are 
accepted by employees. 
It is compulsory for all management and administration employees 
to complete anti-bribery and ethics training and pass an online 
test. As at 30 September 2015 the test has been successfully 
completed by 100% of all relevant employees and contractors. 38 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015

CHARITY AND COMMUNITY
easyJet remains strongly committed to engaging 
with the local communities in which it operates 
and harnessing the fundraising powers of its 
employees and significant customer base. The 
airline's fundraising activities are directed through 
its 'Change for Good' partnership with Unicef, the 
world's leading organisation focusing on children 
and their rights.
Unicef – Our pan-European charity partner
The 'Change for Good' partnership offers easyJet customers the 
opportunity to support some of the world's most vulnerable 
children by donating their spare change and leftover foreign 
currency whilst on board. This year the partnership added a third 
standard collection period in spring 2015, in addition to the existing 
summer and winter periods.
Thanks to the generosity of its passengers and efforts of its crew, 
easyJet's partnership with Unicef this year reached the significant 
milestone of raising £5 million since it was established in 2012 and 
the overall total has now exceeded £6 million. The funds have 
primarily supported Unicef's vaccination work to keep children safe 
from deadly diseases, with a recent focus on supporting the global 
eradication of polio. The partnership has also supported Unicef's 
urgent appeals for children in danger from emergencies. 
T o build on this success, easyJet and Unicef have agreed to 
continue the partnership for a further three years, with the aim  
of raising a further £5 million. 
This decision was the subject of a structured review process which 
also considered the option to move to another charity partner. The 
decision was made to renew the Unicef partnership for a further 
three years, reflecting the strong, successful existing partnership 
and Unicef's international recognition across all easyJet markets. 
The two organisations will work together to further increase the 
fundraising for Unicef, the engagement of easyJet's employees, 
and the profile of the charity partnership across Europe.
This year the partnership raised over £1.2 million through the 
regular on-board collections and a further £1.2 million through 
emergency appeals. The total funds raised through the 
partnership, including corporate donations and other fundraising 
activities, were £2.5 million this year.
In addition to fundraising for Unicef, easyJet has also helped to 
raise awareness of the charity and its work for children. Examples 
include an easyJet aircraft that has a special 'Change for Good' 
Unicef livery, featuring Unicef in the inflight magazine 'T raveller', 
and making announcements about Unicef's work on-board 
flights during collection periods.
easyJet's Chief Executive, Carolyn McCall, is a member of the 
Advisory Board for Unicef UK's Children in Danger campaign that 
aims to raise funds and awareness for the millions of children in 
danger from violence, war, disaster, disease and hunger.
easyJet people see Unicef's work
In March 2015 five easyJet people visited the Gambia to witness 
first-hand how Unicef is helping to keep children safe from polio.
easyJet cabin crew member James Baron took part in the  
trip and said:
“ This experience brought home to  
me how important partnerships like 
Unicef and easyJet's are. The funds 
raised by easyJet crew continue to 
help support efforts to eradicate polio 
from the world by 2019. No mean 
feat, but one that is within reaching 
distance, if the funding continues. 
easyJet and Unicef's Change for 
Good partnership is crucial to enable 
this to happen. I am proud to be a 
part of the on-board crew working to 
raise these funds; we must realise our 
goal of global eradication of polio  
and protect every child in danger.”

Emergency appeals with Unicef
This year easyJet and Unicef worked quickly and effectively 
together to launch three special collections in response to 
international emergencies. easyJet also made a corporate donation 
to start each appeal, totalling £40,000 over the three appeals.
• Ebola, November/December 2014 – The two-week on-board 
collection raised over £200,000, including aid match funding 
for Unicef from the UK Government. This helped Unicef's 
overall response which provided psychological care and 
support for more than 52,000 children, supplied over 500,000 
ebola protection suits, and distributed hygiene kits for almost 
four million schoolchildren.
• Nepal earthquake, April/May 2015 – The four-week on-board 
collection, established within 48 hours of the earthquake, 
raised over £660,000. This helped Unicef's overall response 
which supplied more than 650,000 people with clean, safe 
water, delivered school supplies for over 200,000 children, 
and provided psychological care for more than 85,000 
children and parents.
“ Our partnership with easyJet has already achieved 
so much in the past three years, helping to 
vaccinate 5.3 million mothers and babies against 
deadly diseases, helping to keep 2 million children 
safe from polio and now purchasing approximately 
4 million doses of polio vaccines to protect even 
more children. easyJet and their passengers have 
also provided vital support for Unicef's emergency 
work reaching children and families affected by 
the crisis in Syria and the surrounding region, 
T yphoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the Ebola crisis, 
and the Nepal earthquakes earlier this year.
We're incredibly proud to have renewed our 
partnership with easyJet for another three years, 
and remain hugely grateful to easyJet and their 
passengers who are together making a real and 
tangible difference to the lives of millions of 
children around the world.”

• Refugee and migrant crisis, September 2015 – The two-week 
on-board collection raised over £395,000. This helped Unicef's 
work with children affected by the crisis in Syria and 
neighbouring countries. Donations will provide life-saving 
supplies such as clean water and medicine, after an estimated 
more than two million Syrian children have been forced to 
abandon their homes.
Charity Committee
easyJet has a Charity Committee made up of airline employees 
which provides support, funded by the Company, to charitable 
activities by the Company's employees or to charities which are 
important to staff. These tend to be smaller charities in the areas 
where easyJet's employees live. 
This year the Committee has made 138 awards of flight vouchers 
or financial donations, each to the value of £250 or €300. These 
donations, reflecting the priorities of easyJet's staff, have most 
often been made to health charities, in particular cancer 
charities, and organisations which support children.
Supporting local communities
easyJet wants to make a positive contribution in the communities 
in which it operates. This is particularly important to the 
Company's employees who also live in these areas. 
easyJet already has strong links around its head office in Luton 
and it is also identifying partner organisations which could help 
easyJet to make a larger contribution in specific local areas, 
starting with Connecting Enterprising Women in the Luton area. 
The Luton community around easyJet's head office
easyJet's links are particularly strong in the Luton area, where  
a large number of employees are based. The airline's first flight  
20 years ago was from Luton Airport and easyJet continues  
to proudly call Luton its home.
easyJet is a long-term supporter of Luton T own Football Club 
and in the 2014/15 football season easyJet was the main shirt 
sponsor of the team. The Company has since refocused its work 
with Luton T own by providing funding for the team's children's 
sport project, which also helps the club to access additional 
match funding from the national football associations. The Luton 
T own 'easyJet Free School Visit' project offers every primary 
school in Luton and Bedfordshire a free physical education 
session with the club. Additionally, with easyJet's support  
the club has recently extended this to offer female coaching 
sessions at every high school and further education college  
in Bedfordshire.
easyJet has also continued to be a patron of Love Luton, an 
organisation which seeks to promote and improve the town.
Connecting Enterprising Women
easyJet has established a new community partnership with 
Connecting Enterprising Women, to support the Company's 
work to promote and encourage opportunities for women. 
The partnership, currently focused on Luton and the surrounding 
area, matches female professionals with young women to 
provide mentoring support and career guidance. 
Initially 10 young women at four local schools have been 
matched with easyJet female managers. They meet to  
discuss education, personal development and careers. 
THE GLOBAL WORK TO END POLIO
Aerobility, which offers disabled people the opportunity to  
fly small aircraft and participate in aviation activities, is a 
charity which has resonance within easyJet's pilot community, 
and they have supported the charity for a number of years.
This year easyJet operated a flight to view the Northern 
Lights, to raise funds for the charity. The flight, which was 
provided without charge by easyJet, featured on-board live 
music and a commentary from entertainer Jon Culshaw, 
scientist Dr Helen Czerski and Neil Parker, formerly of the 
Royal Greenwich Observatory. All passengers on the flight 
were able to view the Aurora Borealis and the flight raised 
£18,500 to support Aerobility's work.
AEROBILITY FLIGHT
In 1988 polio was endemic in 125 countries but today it 
remains in just two countries – Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
easyJet is proud to be a part of the global fight to eradicate 
polio forever. In September 2015 it was announced that polio 
is no longer endemic in Nigeria. If global immunisation efforts 
continue, Unicef believe there is a real chance that polio could 
be eradicated by 2019.
Most recently, funds raised through the easyJet on-board 
collections have been allocated to purchase approximately 
four million doses of polio vaccines for a major polio campaign 
in Afghanistan.

ENVIRONMENT
easyJet continues to seek ways to reduce the 
impact of its operations on the environment. 
easyJet's largest cost and biggest impact on the 
environment is its fuel and the associated carbon 
emissions. This means that easyJet's continued 
efforts to reduce its fuel usage and costs also 
have the effect of reducing the airline's impact  
on the environment.
Environmental concerns have an influence on 
public policy towards aviation across Europe,  
such as restrictions on airport expansion and 
levels of passenger taxes. It is therefore also in  
the Company's interest to ensure that both 
easyJet and the wider industry properly  
address environmental concerns.
Climate change
The whole airline industry will continue to rely on the use of  
fossil fuels in the short and medium-term. Unlike some other 
industries, aviation does not have a clear alternative to jet fuel in 
the coming years. easyJet believes the industry must show that 
it is making continual improvements in efficiency and optimising 
the use of these fossil fuels, whilst also supporting the longer-
term technological change necessary to deliver more  
sustainable flying.
Sustainable Aviation, a UK body made up of airlines, aviation 
manufacturers, air traffic control providers and other 
organisations in the sector, supports efforts to reduce carbon 
emissions and has produced a carbon emissions roadmap.  
This shows that UK aviation is able to accommodate significant 
growth to 2050 without a substantial increase in absolute 
carbon emissions through a number of measures to improve 
aircraft fuel efficiency and international carbon trading. 
easyJet plays an active role in the delivery of this carbon 
emissions roadmap. easyJet's efficient business model means 
that the airline has a continued focus on reducing emissions and 
fuel burn for each aircraft. It has a young, efficient fleet which 
features advanced technology and is flown efficiently.
easyJet's ongoing programme to reduce emissions and increase 
fuel efficiency is overseen by the airline's Fuel Board, which leads 
the airline's work to use fuel efficiently. The programme includes:
• The introduction of lightweight Recaro seats that make each 
aircraft almost 600kg lighter, a 26% seat weight reduction. 
These seats have been a standard feature of aircraft delivered 
to easyJet since April 2013 and are now fitted in 37 aircraft.
• 'Sharklet' wing tips which make the aircraft more fuel efficient. 
This technology delivers up to 4% savings in fuel consumption 
and consequent reductions in CO
2
 emissions. These have been 
standard on aircraft delivered to easyJet since August 2013 
and have also been retrofitted to six existing aircraft, so are 
now a feature of 38 easyJet aircraft.
• easyJet's pilots have implemented measures to save fuel whilst 
still operating the aircraft safely and effectively, such as one 
engine taxiing, delayed engine starts, continuous descent 
approaches and minimum use of the auxiliary power unit  
when on the ground.
• easyJet's cockpits became paperless in May 2014 and its entire 
fleet is now fitted with Panasonic T oughpads which replaced 
laptops and printed navigational charts. This has removed 27kg 
of paper per aircraft per flight, equating to a reduction of over 
1,900 tonnes of CO
2
 emissions for easyJet as a whole per year.
• The airline's enhanced maintenance programme washes the 
engine's compressors routinely to ensure they operate as 
efficiently as possible.
Although some of these measures reduce CO
2
 emissions per 
flight by relatively small amounts, easyJet's large number of 
flights per day means the total savings are significant.
easyJet was also among the first supporters of aviation's entry 
into the European Union's Emission T rading System (ETS), an 
important step to ensuring that aviation is helping to tackle climate 
change. easyJet continues to support efforts to ensure that all 
aviation is brought into a scheme to tackle emissions globally.
Investing in an efficient fleet
An important factor in easyJet's carbon emissions reduction  
and fuel efficiency will be the introduction of the new generation 
of Airbus short-haul aircraft. In 2013 easyJet confirmed an order 
for 100 new generation Airbus A320neo aircraft for delivery from 
2017 to 2022 and has taken purchase rights on a further 100 
aircraft. These aircraft, equipped with CFM LEAP-1A engines  
and wing 'Sharklets', will be 13% to 15% more fuel efficient  
than existing aircraft types.
easyJet has also worked with Airbus on a new cabin design  
for A320 family aircraft, which will add a further six seats, whilst 
maintaining the current level of passenger comfort. The first new 
aircraft with this cabin design is due to be delivered by Airbus in 
May 2016 and the cabin layout is planned to be retrofitted to 
existing A320 aircraft between autumn 2016 and spring 2018. 
This will create the opportunity for easyJet to further increase 
the number of passengers on each aircraft, contributing to 
increased environmental efficiency.
T o further reduce emissions in the longer term, significant progress 
in the development of a new generation of aircraft will be 
necessary. While there has been some progress in the short-haul 
market, a further step change in efficiency is necessary. easyJet 
will continue to press the manufacturers to deliver this and 
supports the establishment of international minimum standards

 emissions
easyJet's CO
2
 emissions this year were 6.1 million tonnes, 
compared to 5.9 million tonnes for the 2014 financial year,  
an increase of 3.4%.
The increase in overall emissions has been due to the continued 
expansion of easyJet's operations, as this year easyJet's 
passenger numbers increased by 6% compared to 2014.
easyJet's calculation of emissions is based on fuel burn 
measurement, which is verified to comply with the European 
Union's Emission T rading System requirements. CO
2 
equivalents 
from emissions of other greenhouse gases are not included as 
there are no conversion factors available for these emissions 
from aircraft fuel burn.
easyJet's route network primarily overlaps with legacy airlines, 
which tend to operate older and less efficient fleets. easyJet 
aircraft on average carry more passengers than aircraft of many 
other airlines operating on similar routes, which means carbon 
emissions per passenger are lower. This transfer of passengers 
from less efficient airlines means that easyJet is contributing to 
the reduction of aviation carbon emissions. 
T o obtain a better understanding of how efficiently easyJet 
carries its passengers the airline also monitors emissions per 
passenger kilometre. 
This year easyJet's carbon emissions per passenger kilometre, 
the standard industry measure of efficiency, were 81.05 grams 
per passenger kilometre, down from 82.03 grams per passenger 
kilometre in financial year 2014. 
In 2013, easyJet set targets for the reduction of its carbon 
emissions per passenger kilometre of 2.5% by 2017 and 5% by 
2022. easyJet has already exceeded the 2017 target, with per 
passenger kilometre emissions already 3.2% lower in 2015 than 
2013, and is on track to exceed the 2022 target.
As easyJet expects to exceed its current emissions reduction 
target and plans to increase the number of passengers on each 
aircraft, it has increased its target. easyJet's new target is to 
reduce its carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by 8% by 
2020 compared to 2013. easyJet's progress towards this new 
target will be overseen by the airline's Fuel Board.
Local air quality
Local air quality impact arises from nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
emissions during aircraft take-offs and landings. easyJet's new 
engines feature a tech insertion which reduces NOx emissions  
by around 25%. These are in use in 67.8% of easyJet's aircraft.
Noise
easyJet wants to be a good neighbour in the communities around 
the airports where it operates and the impact of aircraft noise on 
residents is an important consideration. The airline complies with 
local rules that govern noise at airports (such as curfews and 
routings to avoid built-up areas). easyJet aircraft meet the tightest 
international noise standards (ICAO Chapter 4). easyJet also works 
locally with airports and air traffic control to put in place noise 
mitigation activities that best fit each airport.
easyJet's work to improve the efficiency of flying has also 
reduced the noise impact. For example, a change in the flap 
settings used for landings has improved fuel efficiency and 
reduced noise levels at landing. At London Gatwick, easyJet's 
largest base, the airline is a leader in the use of Continuous 
Descent Approaches in which aircraft descend more efficiently 
and quietly.
This year the Company has worked to further reduce aircraft 
noise in response to comments from local residents about the 
A320 family aircraft of all airlines, particularly at London Gatwick. 
All new aircraft delivered to easyJet since June 2014 are fitted 
with 'vortex generators' to prevent a particular sound due to 
airflow under the wing. From November 2015 easyJet will begin 
an engineering programme to modify 197 existing aircraft with 
vortex generators. It expects to complete the programme by 
March 2018.
Waste management
easyJet seeks to recycle as much waste as possible. On board, 
easyJet has a two-bag waste collection system which separates 
recyclable material such as newspapers, plastic bottles and 
metal cans from general waste. The airline does not have control 
of the final management of on-board waste which is dependent 
on the facilities at each airport where waste is collected by local 
cleaning and ground handling contractors. easyJet also has 
recycling in place in its offices and hangars around its network.
This year a working group has been established to look at how 
easyJet can reduce waste across the airline's operations. This  
is being led by Captain Stuart Green, an easyJet pilot based  
in Luton who has completed an MBA with a focus on airline 
sustainability. The working group is considering all aspects of 
easyJet's operations and in particular on-board waste. This 
includes working with easyJet's supply chain, including with 
Airbus on potential on-board solutions and Gate Gourmet  
to reduce waste arising from the sale of on board food and 
beverages. The group is seeking improvements which will also 
engage staff and customers in the process of waste reduction.

EASYJET'S CUSTOMERS
easyJet's cause is to make travel easy and 
affordable. It wants to provide its customers with 
a good and safe service, with an emphasis on a 
friendly experience. easyJet wants to be open and 
honest with its customers, to build lasting 
relationships with them. 
Customer Charter
easyJet's Customer Charter, co-created with over 300 
employees including pilots, cabin crew and contact centre 
employees, was published in 2013 and sets out what customers 
should expect when they travel with easyJet:
• Safety first, we never compromise
• On your side, we see it from your point of view
• A big smile, friendly service is our passion
• Make it easy, at every step
• Open and upfront, we will always be straight with you
• Customer at the heart of easyJet
This year easyJet has continued to work to embed its Customer 
Charter commitments across the Company. 
Employee research suggests the Customer Charter is well 
established amongst easyJet employees. 84% of over 4,000 
people who took part in easyJet's employee engagement survey 
agreed that they understood how they can deliver the promises 
in the Customer Charter.
This year easyJet has focused on how the airline applies the 
Customer Charter during times of disruption. In March easyJet 
Customer Champions came together from across the airline for 
the annual Customer Meeting, a forum for knowledge and idea 
sharing. They created an internal set of guidelines defining how 
easyJet employees should support customers during disruption 
in the airline's airports. These behaviours have also since been 
communicated to easyJet's ground crews across the airline's 
network.
easyJet has also improved how it communicates with customers 
when their travel plans have been disrupted. T o ensure timely and 
relevant information is sent to customers, a new team has been 
established in the Operations Control Centre in Luton, solely 
focusing on customer communications during disruption. This 
team provides information to customers through text messages, 
emails and live updates on easyJet's Flight T racker tool. 
Using digital technology to enhance the customer experience
easyJet uses digital technology to improve the customer 
experience. This year it launched further innovations to help 
make it easier to book, manage travel and fly with easyJet. 
Its digital platform is a key point of differentiation. easyJet 
believes it has significant advantages in the capability of its web 
platform, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) data and 
mobile offering. During the year easyJet had over 500 million 
visits across all platforms, an 18% increase in the last two years, 
and grew web conversion by 13% over the same period.
easyJet's CRM enables its customers to benefit from increasing 
levels of personalisation across several channels, with examples 
such as saved passport details, targeted marketing campaigns 
via email and text message and bespoke offers from its affiliate 
partners. The user experience has been further developed over 
the year, with greater ease of interaction on the website and 
mobile and optimised layouts and design. The customer help 
web pages were also re-launched, as part of easyJet's strategy 
to make it easier for customers to resolve simple queries and 
encourage self-service.
easyJet continues to run its Fearless Flyer programme to help 
those who either have a fear or nervousness of flying, to 
overcome them. The course consists of two parts; in the first 
part an experienced easyJet captain deals with any 
misconceptions that participants may have about flying. In 
addition, phobia expert Lawrence Leyton teaches people 
proven techniques to help overcome the anxieties and 
concerns nervous flyers typically have. In the second part, 
participants and travelling companions go on an 'experience 
flight' operated by easyJet.
Since 2013 more than 2,500 people have completed the 
course and flown on an experience flight.
FEARLESS FLYER
ENHANCING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE Strategic report Governance Accounts
43 www.easyJet.com
easyJet has put significant focus on the mobile offering over the 
past two years, with an award-winning app that enables mobile 
hosting through the airport, disruption notification live with the 
ability to change flights, and saved personal data such as 
payment details. Recently added features include a passport 
scanning function to add passenger information and the use of 
Apple's finger print 'T ouch ID' technology to retrieve previously 
submitted information. easyJet also created an Apple Watch app 
to coincide with Apple's launch of the device, extending the 
functionality of the easyJet app.
easyJet will be investing substantially in its digital platform over 
the next three years, as it continues to innovate and maintain its 
leadership position in the sector. easyJet is working to develop 
the first fully-integrated e-commerce platform in the airline 
industry.
easyJet has also continued to innovate in other areas across the 
business. In June easyJet showcased new technology such as 
engineering drones and prognostics software. easyJet is also 
investing in research around Artificial Intelligence to exploit the 
large amounts of data generated by our operations.
On-time performance
easyJet is focused on delivering solid operational performance. 
This is reflected in all its operating procedures, without 
compromising safety. easyJet recognises departing and arriving 
on time is the main influence on customer satisfaction. It 
therefore considers ways to improve how it delivers the best 
performance and can meet its aim of being a leading airline for 
performance and customer service. For example, easyJet's 
customer experience improvement plan, T riple C – Customer, 
Communication, and Consistency involves working with its 
ground handling partners to improve the boarding process, 
which is an important factor in achieving punctuality and 
customer satisfaction. 
This year on-time performance (arrivals within 15 minutes of the 
scheduled time) was 80%, despite an operationally challenging 
year which included many external events outside of easyJet's 
control. The growth in demand for air travel has led to an 
increase in airport and airspace congestion which has caused 
delays. This has put pressure on easyJet's busy operation, 
particularly at London Gatwick and in the Greek islands. A fire in 
the Rome Fiumicino terminal in May 2015 also heavily affected 
the operation, as well as other airlines' operation, due to 
restrictions on capacity applied by the authorities. easyJet was 
required to cancel over 1,000 flights and other flights had to be 
temporarily transferred to Ciampino, Rome's secondary airport. 
Overall, the weather was less disruptive than previous years, with 
a relatively mild and calm winter and less volatile summer storms. 
The operation was also adversely affected by air traffic control 
strike action mainly in the French and Italian airspace, most 
notably the French strike in April 2015 which led to over 600 
flight cancellations over the two-day period.
Customer satisfaction
easyJet runs an extensive 'voice of the customer' programme, 
based on customer satisfaction surveys (which customers are 
invited to complete shortly after taking a flight) and the online 
community of customers.

The customer satisfaction survey covers all aspects of the 
customer journey from the booking experience through to

online community has over 900 members: over 500 in the UK, 
more than 150 each in France and Italy, and over 120 in 
Switzerland. easyJet has gathered feedback from community 
members on over 50 topics about many aspects of the 
customer experience.
This year has seen periods of lower on-time performance, 
including instances due to factors outside of easyJet's control, 
such as industrial action by air traffic controllers. This has  
resulted in a fall in customer satisfaction to 75% at the end  
of September 2015.
easyJet has launched a new survey for customers whose flights 
are disrupted by a long delay, a diversion or cancellation. It  
wants to better understand how to improve the management  
of these incidents and minimise the impact on the overall 
customer experience.

EASYJET'S SUPPLIERS
easyJet's suppliers have an important role in 
making travel easy and affordable for the airline's 
customers. The Company seeks to have an open, 
constructive and effective relationship with all 
suppliers, to contribute to its success.
easyJet has established a supplier relationship management 
framework, which gives guidance to easyJet managers who  
lead relationships with suppliers. The management framework  
is developed around easyJet's core values and is based on  
the principle that suppliers are managed in the same way  
that easyJet manages its people, and that suppliers' rights  
and responsibilities are clearly set out.
Airbus is one of easyJet's most 
important suppliers and this is 
reflected in the close and 
transparent relationship maintained 
during the assembly and delivery  
of each aircraft. Using on-line tools, 
Airbus is able to provide easyJet 
with near real-time data for each 
delivery which allows the airline to 
ensure quality is maintained at each 
stage of the build process. This 
partnership has developed over  
12 years of aircraft deliveries and 
specific measurements have been 
introduced providing easyJet with 
full oversight at each stage. This 
efficient interface allows the airline 
to comment, question or challenge 
within a short time scale, minimising 
any impact on the overall delivery 
process. easyJet took delivery of  
its 250th Airbus family aircraft in 
spring 2015.
AIRBUS
CLEANING SUPPLIERS
easyJet relies on its on-board cleaning suppliers to ensure 
that each aircraft is well presented for passengers and ready 
in time for its first flight of the day. T o engage with these 
suppliers easyJet has introduced a monthly cleaning 
newsletter, showing customer satisfaction with cleanliness 
and delays attributed to cleaning at each base, as well as 
updates on current priorities.
When tendering for new suppliers, easyJet seeks information 
from suppliers on factors including quality, health and safety, 
environmental practices, sub-contracting arrangements and  
tax compliance. Strategic report Governance Accounts
45 www.easyJet.com
The easyJet Special Assistance Advisory Group (ESAAG)  
was established in 2012 to provide feedback and guidance  
to easyJet on the services it provides to passengers who 
require special assistance.
The group is made up of experts in disability issues and 
accessible travel. We meet regularly with easyJet managers to 
discuss the Company's forward proposals, best practice and 
emerging issues. Crucially, oversight and regular reporting 
back on the rolling programme of training at every level has 
helped to support staff in doing a better job with greater job 
satisfaction. The group takes a pan-European approach and 
includes members from key easyJet markets: the UK, France, 
Switzerland and, most recently, Italy. One of our meetings 
was hosted in Paris by the French disability organisation 
Association pour Adultes et Jeunes Handicapes.
easyJet carries more than 400,000 passengers who need 
special assistance every year. This is a growing number and as 
societies across Europe age it is very likely that more people 
will need this assistance in the future. easyJet wants to be an 
airline for everyone, including people with disabilities and 
those with a variety of challenges requiring additional support.
Over the last year ESAAG has helped easyJet to introduce 
on-board wheelchairs across its fleet. The group has also been 
involved in changes to cabin layout, which includes a newly 
designed accessible toilet. ESAAG has also had a role in wider 
easyJet projects, such as the consolidation of easyJet 
operations at London Gatwick into the North T erminal and 
digital developments such as improved information and 
advice, the ongoing reconfiguration of the easyJet website 
and apps for use in navigating airports. 
The customer satisfaction amongst easyJet passengers with 
reduced mobility was 87.4% this year, which was higher than 
for customers in general. We believe this reflects the focus 
easyJet and ESAAG give to providing the right support to 
passengers who need special assistance. 
ESAAG is seeking to improve the whole journey for 
passengers who need special assistance. Customers 
understandably expect that when they book assistance  
this will be done seamlessly between the airline, assistance 
provider and the relevant airports.
EASYJET SPECIAL ASSIST ANCE ADVISORY GROUP
ESAAG sees its task as facilitating a speedier and more 
customer friendly experience for all passengers and the 
improvement in reputation and therefore customer 
satisfaction. But considerable emphasis is needed on  
the different commercial elements, which make up that 
experience and for which under European regulation the 
airline, as far as the customer is concerned, is responsible. 
This is why ESAAG has this year produced a pan-European 
charter on meeting the needs of air travellers with disabilities. 
The Charter recommends best practice for all aspects of 
aviation special assistance. It was launched at the European 
Parliament and has since been discussed at a UK aviation 
industry session jointly hosted by ESAAG and the UK CAA. 
ESAAG will continue to use the Charter to engage with 
stakeholders across Europe. 
I would like to thank the members of ESAAG for their work 
and easyJet for continuing to engage with and support the 
group. ESAAG is helping to deliver real improvements for 
passengers and is driving competition within the industry  
to improve the service offered to travellers.
We look forward to continuing this work.

OF BRIGHTSIDE AND HILLSBOROUGH 46 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Chairman’s statement on corporate governance
Committed to maintaining high standards
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
At easyJet, we are committed to maintaining high standards  
of corporate governance to enhance performance and for the 
protection of our shareholders. I would like to highlight, in particular, 
the following key areas of governance during 2015:
Strategy
As a Board, we need to be confident that our strategy remains 
appropriate and that we are identifying appropriate strategic 
priorities. This year the Board held meetings in March and 
September at which we challenged and shaped the strategic 
priorities brought by management.
Board and Committee composition
There were a number of changes to the Board during the year. 
After five years at easyJet Chris Kennedy left on 1 September 
2015 to become Chief Financial Officer at ARM Holdings.
After nine years of service, David Bennett retired from the Board 
on 1 October 2014 and Professor Rigas Doganis retired from the 
Board on 1 December 2014, although he continues to chair the 
Safety Committee until 29 February 2016. John Browett has 
announced his decision to step down from the Board on  
31 December 2015 after almost nine years.
I would like to thank all of them on behalf of the Board  
for their commitment and contribution. 
I am delighted to welcome Andrew Findlay, who joined as  
Chief Financial Officer on 2 October 2015 and Chris Browne who 
will join the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 January 2016. 
The membership of the Board’s Committees as at 30 September 
2015 can be found on pages 47-49.
Board effectiveness
Each year, the Board undertakes a formal evaluation of its 
effectiveness. This year we have had this process externally 
facilitated by Independent Audit Limited. In addition, Charles 
Gurassa, the Senior Independent Director, has also led a review 
of my performance with input from the other Non-Executive 
Directors. Further details of the evaluation process are provided 
on page 61. Following this review, I am satisfied that the Board 
and its Committees are performing effectively and that there is 
the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and 
knowledge of the Group to enable the Directors to discharge 
their respective duties and responsibilities effectively. I am  
also satisfied that the members of the Board, in particular the 
Non-Executive Directors, have sufficient time to undertake their 
roles at Board and Committee level with the Company, so as  
to be able to discharge their responsibilities effectively.
Board Committees 
The Board delegates certain of its responsibilities to the Board 
Committees to enable it to carry out its functions effectively.  
A diagram of the Board governance structure is set out on  
page 52. 
The Audit Committee, chaired by Adèle Anderson, led a  
robust competitive tender process, leading to the Board’s 
recommendation to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  
as the Company’s auditors. The Board will recommend to  
the shareholders at the 2016 Annual General Meeting the 
reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors for 
the year ending 30 September 2016. Further details of the audit 
tender process are provided in the Audit Committee report on 
pages 54 to 57.
Structure of Corporate Governance Report
The Corporate Governance Report which follows is intended to 
give shareholders an understanding of the Company’s corporate 
governance arrangements and how they operated during the 
year. The Corporate Governance Report includes reports from 
each of the Committee Chairs to provide details on key matters 
addressed by the Committees during the year.
We have also set out a separate section (on pages 60 to 62) to 
provide a detailed description of how the Company has complied 
with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
 
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
The Board considers that it and the Company have, 
throughout the year, complied without exception with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(September 2014), which is the version of the Code which 
applies to the Company for its 2015 financial year. The Code 
is issued by the Financial Reporting Council and is available 
for review on the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC’s)

The Remuneration Committee’s focus was firstly on putting 
forward a revised Long T erm Incentive Plan in its remuneration 
policy for shareholder approval at the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting. The remuneration policy has been designed to be 
straightforward and transparent, in alignment with the 
Company’s principle of having a simple and cost-effective 
approach. The second area of focus was recommending a 
package for the incoming Chief Financial Officer which aligned 
with our policy.

• François Rubichon
Independent safety reports from the Director of Safety and 
Security are presented at every Board meeting. The Committee 
ensures that both internal and relevant external events are fully 
investigated and that appropriate actions have been taken 
where necessary.
The Director of Safety and Security has a direct reporting line  
to the Chairman which reinforces the independence of safety 
oversight. In addition, the Chairman of the Committee has 
reported to the Board with his own assessment of safety 
management within the airline. 
Further information on the Safety Management System is 
provided on page 31.
Highlights of the 2015 financial year
A range of safety-related matters have been reviewed by the 
Committee during the 2015 financial year involving all areas – 
flight operations, cabin crew, ground services and engineering. 
Some of these reviews followed requests from the Board to 
carry out detailed assessment of specific operational incidents; 
others were reports of safety actions taken by easyJet 
operational departments. These included a review of the 
processes, identification and use of pattern recognition for 
safety purposes, and also a review of the cyber security threats 
to easyJet’s operations and the mitigations in place to counter 
such threats. 
Changes to the Committee
Although Professor Rigas Doganis stepped down from the  
Board of easyJet as a Non-Executive Director on 1 December 
2014, he remains as Chairman of the Safety Committee until  
29 February 2016.
As reported in last year’s annual report, in October 2014 the 
Committee’s former Independent Safety Expert, Geoff Want, 
joined easyJet as the Director of Safety and Security. With 
considerable and wide-spread previous experience in aviation 
safety, he has made an invaluable contribution in ensuring  
that the Company maintains the highest safety standards  
and procedures.
The safety team has been further strengthened by the 
appointment of a specialist in human factors.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
ADÈLE ANDERSON, 
CHAIR OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
During the year, the Audit Committee has continued to 
devote significant time to reviewing the Group’s system  
of risk management, internal controls, the integrity of the 
Group’s financial reporting and the effectiveness of both 
internal and external audit. In addition, the Committee has 
led a competitive tender for external audit services which 
followed best practice guidance, resulting in the 
recommendation to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
as the Group auditors.
The Committee welcomes the changes to the revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code, and the FRC’s Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial  
and Business Reporting, published in September 2014.  
These changes apply to the Group for the first time this  
year and have been areas of focus for the committee.

the integrity of the financial statements and related 
formal announcements, and the significant financial 
reporting issues and judgements which they contain 
Review of the financial statements and announcements relating to the financial 
performance and governance of the Group at year end and half year.
The Committee also considered the material areas in which significant

management systems and control processes, through an evaluation of:
• the risk and assurance plans;
• Internal Audit reports;
• risk assessments;
• information security and business continuity;
• control themes; and
• internal financial control assessments.
the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Audit 
function and its activities
The Committee undertook an assessment of the effectiveness and 
independence of the Internal Audit function, which included consideration of:
• key Internal Audit reports; 
• stakeholder feedback on the quality of Internal Audit activity;
• Internal Audit’s compliance with prevailing professional standards; and 
• closure of Internal Audit recommendations.

reports on non-compliance
During the year, the Committee reviewed: 
• whistleblower reports;
• reports on anti-bribery and corruption procedures;
• reports on procedures on fraud and loss prevention; and 
• reports on credit card fraud monitoring and investigations.
Other duties of the Audit Committee include:
• annually reviewing their terms of reference;
• assessing potential conflicts of interest of Directors 
on behalf of the Board; and
• as requested by the Board, providing advice on 
whether the annual report and accounts are fair, 
balanced and understandable.
The Committee reviewed its terms of reference and concluded that  
they did not require updating. 
There were no potential conflicts to be considered during the year.
Further information on the Committee’s role on providing advice on whether 
the annual report and accounts is fair, balanced and understandable is 
provided in the Financial reporting and significant financial issues section. 56 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Corporate governance report continued
Specific items which the Committee looked at during the financial 
year as part of and in addition to its main activities included:
• the treasury function and accounting treatment of  
hedging transactions;
• the accounting treatment for property, plant and equipment;
• the accounting treatment of share-based payments;
• the management of change initiatives in the business;
• information security capabilities, policies and procedures, 
including mitigations around cyber attacks and incidents; and
• the preparation for making a viability statement.
Financial reporting and significant financial judgements
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements. For example, during the 
financial year, the Committee reviews the level of provisions and 
accruals recorded which are judgemental in nature. The 
Committee reviews accounting papers prepared by management 
which provide details on significant financial reporting judgements. 
The Committee also reviews reports by the external auditors on 
the full year and half year results which highlight any issues with 
respect to the work undertaken on the audit.
The Committee reviews financial issues through discussion with 
management and the external auditors and comparison to other 
organisations. The number of such issues currently considered as 
significant are, however, limited given easyJet’s relatively simple 
business model and group structure which are unencumbered 
with legacy issues. The significant issues considered in relation  
to the accounts are detailed below:
• The Committee reviewed the maintenance provision at the 
year end. A number of judgements are used in the calculation 
of the provision, primarily pricing, utilisation of aircraft and 
timing of maintenance checks. The Committee addressed 
these matters using reports received from management  
which underpin the basis of assumptions used. The Committee 
also discussed with the external auditors their review of the 
assumptions underlying the estimates used.
• The Committee considered whether the carrying value  
of goodwill and landing rights held by easyJet should be 
impaired. The judgement in relation to impairment largely 
relates to the assumptions underlying the calculation of the 
value in use of the business being tested for impairment; 
primarily whether the strategic plan is achievable and the 
overall macroeconomic assumptions which underlie the 
valuation process. The Committee addressed these matters 
using reports received from management outlining the basis 
for assumptions used. The strategic plan used in the 
calculation was presented to the Board. 
• The Committee considered the key treasury transactions, and 
the application of hedge accounting. easyJet hedges forward, 
on a rolling basis, between 65% and 85% of the next 12 
months anticipated fuel and currency requirements and 
between 45% and 65% of the next 12 months’ anticipated 
requirements. Significant exposure relating to the acquisition 
cost of aircraft is also managed through the use of foreign 
currency forward exchange contracts where 90% of the next 
two years forecast requirement is hedged. easyJet does not 
operate any other significant derivative financial instruments. 
However, this area remains significant due to the quantity of 
fuel and exchange rate hedges.
• The Committee reviewed the level and calculations of key 
accruals and provisions which are judgemental in nature. 
Specifically the area of customer claims in respect of flight 
delays, cancellations and Air Passenger Duty.
The Committee is satisfied that the judgements made by 
management are reasonable, and that appropriate disclosures 
have been included in the accounts.
At the request of the Board, the Committee also considered 
whether the Annual report and accounts was fair, balanced  
and understandable and whether it provided the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. The Committee is 
satisfied that, taken as a whole, the Annual report and accounts 
is fair, balanced and understandable. In reaching this conclusion, 
the Committee considered the overall review and confirmation 
process around the Annual report and accounts, including: 
• the input of subject matter experts, the Executive 
Management T eam and other senior management and,  
where applicable, the Board and its Committees;
• the processes and controls which underpin the overall review 
and confirmation process, including the verification process 
being carried out by an internal financial controls specialist 
(independent of the Finance function);
• Internal Audit providing assurance over the audit trail for 
material data points relating to the non-financial statement 
aspects of the Annual report and accounts, and external  
audit providing assurance over the accounts; and
• the Committee itself, as part of a continuous improvement 
process, emphasising to contributors the importance of 
providing a balanced view, especially in relation to the more 
subjective areas.
The Committee was provided with, and commented on, a draft 
copy of the Annual report and accounts. 
In carrying out the above processes, key considerations included 
ensuring that there was consistency between the accounts and 
the narrative provided in the front half of the annual report, and 
there was an appropriate balance between the reporting of 
weaknesses, difficulties and challenges, as well as successes,  
in an open and honest manner.
Risk management and internal control
The Board, as a whole, including the Audit Committee members, 
consider the nature and extent of easyJet’s risk management 
framework and the risk profile that is acceptable in order  
to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives. The Audit 
Committee has reviewed the work done by management,  
the Committee itself and the Board on the assessment of the 
Company’s principal risks, including their impact on the prospects 
of the Company. As a result, it is considered that the Board  
has fulfilled its obligations under the Code in relation to risk 
management and internal controls. Further details on the 
Company’s principal risks and uncertainties and their impact  
on the prospects of the Company are set out on page 24-29. 
easyJet’s system of internal controls, along with its design  
and operating effectiveness is subject to review by the Audit 
Committee, through reports received from management, along 
with those from both internal and external auditors. Any controls 
deficiencies identified are followed up with action plans tracked 
by the Committee. Further details of risk management and 
internal control are set out on page 63. Strategic report Governance Accounts

Internal Audit
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the work of 
the Internal Audit function. It reviews and approves the scope of 
the Internal Audit annual plan and assesses the quality of Internal 
Audit reports, along with management’s actions relating to 
findings and the closure of recommended actions. The Audit 
Committee also considers stakeholder feedback on the quality 
of Internal Audit’s work. Further information on the Internal Audit 
function is provided on page 63. In order to safeguard the 
independence of the Internal Audit functions, the Head of 
Internal Audit is given the opportunity to meet privately with  
the Audit Committee without any other members of 
management present. 
External auditors and effectiveness of external audit process
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were reappointed auditors of  
the Company at the 2015 Annual General Meeting. Senior 
management monitors the auditors’ performance, behaviour and 
effectiveness during the exercise of their duties, which informs 
the Audit Committee’s decision to recommend reappointment 
on an annual basis. 
Audit tendering
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were first appointed to audit  
the Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 
September 2006, and have therefore served a ten year term. 
Under EU audit reform legislation, companies are required to 
have a mandatory rotation of auditors after ten years, or  
20 years if there is a compulsory retender at ten years.
During the early summer of 2015, the Committee led a tender 
process for external audit services for the year ending 30 
September 2016. 
Management met with the top 10 UK audit firms by fee income, 
which were then assessed by a common set of criteria. 
Following this assessment, a number of firms were ruled out 
due to irresolvable conflicts of interests/independence issues or 
a lack of demonstrable appetite to become the external auditor 
to a company of our size and scale. As part of this process a 
number of firms met with the Audit Committee Chair and the 
outgoing Chief Financial Officer.
Our largest investors were invited to discuss our approach  
to the audit tender and three of these investors took up  
the invitation and contributed to our considerations. 
In May the Audit Committee reviewed the investor feedback 
and the feedback from the meetings with the firms. It was 
concluded that two firms should be invited to tender on  
the basis that:
• both firms had extensive experience in delivering quality 
audit services;
• both firms demonstrated having the high calibre resources 
needed to deliver quality audit services;
• each firm demonstrated a willingness to participate in  
the audit tender and to deliver the audit services;
• both firms had significant experience in auditing FTSE 100 
organisations and/or organisations of comparable size  
and complexity to easyJet; and
• neither easyJet nor the firm were aware of any apparent 
conflicts of interest or independence issues.
Once the Request For Proposal had been issued to both 
firms, each was invited to put forward potential lead audit 
partners at a meeting with the Audit Committee Chair. 
Following feedback by the Company on the preferred lead 
audit partners, each firm was invited to attend “working  
with easyJet” meetings to ensure they fully understood our 
external audit requirements and to give an opportunity to 
assess the cultural fit. The lead audit partner and senior team 
members from each firm also met with the incoming CFO, 
Andrew Findlay.
Each firm submitted a formal audit proposal document which 
was reviewed by management and the Audit Committee. On 
6 July each firm presented at meetings with easyJet 
management. At this meeting each firm was given a technical 
question which they had to consider and include in their final 
presentation to the Audit Committee on 20 July. As part of 
this process, the Audit committee met with each firm without 
management present.
The Audit Committee met on 22 July and concluded that 
both firms were capable of providing the services required  
by the Company and could be put forward to the Board.  
The Audit Committee agreed to recommend that the Board 
reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as, on balance,  
they performed better against the committees pre-agreed 
selection and assessment criteria. 
The Audit Committee also assesses the effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity of the external auditors by, 
amongst other things:
• considering all key external auditor plans and reports;
• having regular engagement with the external auditor during 
Committee meetings and ad hoc meetings (when required), 
including meetings without any member of management 
being present; 
• the Committee Chair having discussions with the Senior 
Statutory Auditor ahead of each Committee meeting; and
• following the end of the financial year, each Committee 
member completing an auditor effectiveness review 
questionnaire. 
Non-audit services
In the 2015 financial year, easyJet did not incur any costs with 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in respect of non-audit services 
(2014: £nil). In order to preserve objectivity and independence, 
the external auditors are not asked to provide consulting services 
unless this is in the best interests of the Company, in accordance 
with easyJet’s non-audit services policy which is available in the 
governance section of easyJet’s corporate website,

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE 
JOHN BARTON, 
CHAIR OF THE NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
Key responsibilities
• Keeping under review the composition, structure and size of, 
and succession to, the Board and its Committees.
• Succession planning for senior executives and the Board.
• Identifying and nominating, for the approval of the Board, 
candidates to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise.
• Evaluation of the balance of skills, knowledge, experience  
and diversity on the Board.
Highlights of the 2015 financial year
• Overseeing the selection process and appointment of the  
new Chief Financial Officer and a new Non-Executive Director.
• Consideration of the appointments to the Board Committees 
following the change in Board composition.
• Reviewing management’s succession plans for senior  
executive positions.
Board appointments process
The Committee adopts a formal and transparent procedure  
for the appointment of new Directors to the Board. 
The Board’s practice is to use external recruitment consultants 
for appointing Directors and as such, terms were negotiated with 
JCA Group Limited (JCA) to act as easyJet’s search consultants 
for the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer. Other than 
providing search consultancy services, JCA has no connection 
with the Company. JCA was provided with a brief of the desired 
candidate profile based on merit and against objective criteria, 
and their services were used to conduct a search to identify 
suitable candidates. A list of potential candidates was assessed 
against these criteria and a number were interviewed by 
members of the Board and Executive Management T eam. 
Andrew Findlay was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, 
effective 2 October 2015.
While the Board’s practice is to use external search consultants 
for appointing Directors, there are occasions where an individual 
with particular relevant qualifications is identified as a potential 
candidate to join the Board as a Non-Executive Director. This 
was the case with Chris Browne and therefore no external search 
consultancy or open advertising was used. Once the committee 
became aware of her availability, it reviewed her experience and 
skills and she was interviewed by members of the Board. She 
was appointed to become a Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 1 January 2016.
Diversity
The Board recognises the benefits of having diversity across  
all areas of the Group and believes that this supports easyJet’s 
continued success and advantage. When considering the 
optimum make-up of the Board, the benefits of diversity of the 
Board are appropriately reviewed and balanced where possible, 
including in terms of differences in skills, industry experience, 
business model experiences, gender, race, disability, age, 
nationality, background and other contributions that individuals 
may make. The Committee continues to encourage diversity of 
business skills and experience, recognising that Directors with 
varying skill sets, capabilities and experience gained from 
different geographic and cultural backgrounds enhance the 
Board. In identifying suitable candidates the Committee will seek 
candidates from a range of backgrounds, with the final decision 
being based on merit against objective criteria. 
The Company has two female Directors, one being the Chief 
Executive. Following the appointment of Chris Browne, the Board 
will have 30% female representation from 1 January 2016. The 
Company’s policy on diversity applies across all levels of the 
organisation, and further details can be found in the Corporate 
responsibility section on pages 35 to 36.
During the year the Committee undertook a search for a new 
Chief Financial Officer, reviewing the make-up of the Board 
Committees given the new Board make up at the beginning 
of the year, ensuring that the newly appointed NEDs were 
embedded in the Board and continuing to review succession 
plans within the Board and the Executive Management T eam.

Corporate governance report continued
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Company has, throughout the 2015 financial year, complied 
without exception with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued in September 2014 (the Code), which is  
the version of the Code which applies to its 2015 financial year. The 
section below details how the Company has complied with the Code, 
available at www.frc.org.uk. The following disclosures are ordered into 
the sections as they appear in the Code.
A. Leadership
A.1 Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for providing effective leadership to the 
airline. It does this by setting strategic priorities and overseeing 
their delivery in a way that enables sustainable long-term growth, 
while maintaining a balanced approach to risk within a 
framework of effective controls.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision which is available in the governance section of easyJet’s 
corporate website: http://corporate.easyJet.com. Day-to-day 
management responsibility rests with the Executive Management 
T eam, listed on pages 50 to 51. These individuals are also the 
Directors and Company Secretary of the principal operating 
company, easyJet Airline Company Limited.
The Board meets regularly, with nine scheduled meetings having 
been held during the year. The Directors’ attendance records at 
those meetings and Board Committee meetings held during the 
year are shown in the table below. In addition to those scheduled 
meetings, four ad hoc Board meetings were also arranged  
to deal with matters arising between scheduled meetings as 
appropriate. Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged  
to communicate directly with senior management between 
Board meetings.
A.2 Division of responsibilities
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, set  
out in writing, clearly defined, and approved by the Board. They 
are available on easyJet’s corporate website: http://corporate.
easyJet.com. The Chairman’s role is to lead the Board and 
ensure that it operates effectively. The Chief Executive’s role  
is the day-to-day running of the Group’s businesses and the 
development and implementation of strategy.
A.3 The Chairman
The Chairman, John Barton, sets the Board’s agenda and ensures 
that adequate time is available for discussion of all agenda items, 
in particular strategic issues. On his appointment in May 2013, the 
Board considered John Barton to be independent in character  
and judgement in accordance with the Code.
A.4 Non-Executive Directors
Charles Gurassa is Senior Independent Director and Deputy 
Chairman. In this role, Charles provides advice and additional 
support and experience to the Chairman as required, and is 
available to act as an intermediary for the other Directors if 
necessary. Charles is also available to address shareholders’ 
concerns that have not been resolved through the normal 
channels of communication with the Chairman, Chief Executive 
or other Executive Directors, and leads the appraisal of the 
Chairman’s performance annually in consultation with the other 
Non-Executive Directors in a meeting without the Chairman 
being present. The Non-Executive Directors, together with the 
Chairman, have also met without any Executive Directors present 
during the year. During the year, there were no unresolved 
concerns regarding the running of the Company.

B. Effectiveness
B.1 Composition of the Board
As at 30 September 2015, the Board comprised eight Non-
Executive Directors (including the Chairman) and one Executive 
Director, Chris Kennedy having left the Company on 1 September 
2015. The number of Executive Directors increased to two when 
Andrew Findlay joined on 2 October 2015. 
After giving thorough consideration to the matter, the Board 
considers Adèle Anderson, Dr. Andreas Bierwirth, John Browett, 
Charles Gurassa, Keith Hamill, Andy Martin and François 
Rubichon to be Non-Executive Directors who are independent  
in character and judgement. 
B.2 Appointments to the Board
For information on the procedure for the appointment of  
new Directors to the Board, and the role of the Nominations 
Committee in this process, refer to the Nominations Committee 
report on page 58.
B.3 Commitment
Following the Board evaluation process, detailed further below, 
the Board is satisfied that each of the Directors is able to  
allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively.
Contracts and letters of appointment with Directors are made 
available at the Annual General Meeting or on request. The 
standard terms and conditions of the appointment of Non-
Executive Directors are also available in the governance section  
of easyJet’s corporate website: http://corporate.easyJet.com.
Executive Directors are encouraged to take up non-executive 
positions in other companies or organisations. Carolyn McCall, the 
Chief Executive, has acted as Non-Executive Director at Burberry 
Group plc since September 2014. Appointment to such positions  
is subject to the approval of the Board which considers, amongst 
other things, the time commitment required. The Executive 
Management T eam are permitted to hold one appointment on  
a Board or committee of a listed company so long as this is not 
thought to interfere with the business of the Group.
B.4 Development
On joining the Board, new members receive a tailored induction, 
organised by the Company Secretary, which covers amongst 
other things:
• the business of the Group;
• their legal and regulatory responsibilities as Directors;
• briefings and presentations from relevant executives; and
• opportunities to visit and experience easyJet’s business 
operations.
T o update the Directors’ skills, knowledge and familiarity with the 
Group, visits to bases are organised for the Board periodically,  
to assist its understanding of the operational issues that the 
business faces. The Board were invited to attend a country 
review Board and also observe the innovation day which was  
run in Milan in June 2015. A briefing paper is provided to Board 
members to update them on relevant developments in law, 
regulation and best practice, usually two to four times per year. 
Directors are encouraged to highlight specific areas where they 
feel their skills or knowledge would benefit from development  
as part of the annual Board evaluation process. The Board is 
confident that all its members have the knowledge, ability and 
experience to perform the functions required of a Director of  
a listed company.
B.5 Information and Support
All members of the Board are supplied with appropriate, clear  
and accurate information in a timely manner covering matters 
which are to be considered at forthcoming Board or  
Committee meetings.
Should Directors judge it necessary to seek independent legal 
advice about the performance of their duties with the Company, 
they are entitled to do so at the Company’s expense. Directors 
also have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary who is responsible for advising the Board on all 
governance matters and ensuring that Board procedures  
are complied with.
The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is  
a matter requiring Board approval.
B.6 Evaluation
A performance review of the Board, its Committees and Directors 
was undertaken with the assistance of an external facilitator, 
Independent Audit Limited, during the period. Independent Audit 
has no connection with the Company beyond evaluating the 
Board. It is intended to hold an externally facilitated review every 
three years. 
The evaluation process took place in the summer and involved 
interviews with each Director and a number of the Executive 
Management T eam. Independent Audit Limited also reviewed the 
Board and committee papers over the past year and attended 
and observed the July Board meeting.
The review extended to all aspects of Board and committee 
performance including composition and dynamics, the Chairman’s 
leadership, agenda and focus, clarity as to role with particular 
focus on its effectiveness in relation to strategic development, 
oversight of risk and succession planning, and priorities for 
change. Independent Audit Limited provided a report to the 
Board, which was included in the papers for the Board’s 
September meeting. 
Charles Gurassa, as Senior Independent Director, led a review of 
the Chairman’s performance and held a private meeting of the 
Non-Executive Directors without the Chairman present to discuss 
the Chairman’s performance. The Executive Directors and the 
Non-Executive Directors also reviewed and were satisfied with  
the Chairman’s time commitment to the Board and the business.
The Chairman conducted a process of evaluating the 
performance and contribution of each Director which included  
a one-to-one performance evaluation and feedback discussion 
with each of them.
The Board has started to determine appropriate actions in 
response to the areas highlighted in these reviews. It will also 
continue to review its procedures, effectiveness and development 
objectives in the year ahead.
The Board considers that the performance review shows that 
each Director continues to contribute effectively and demonstrate 
commitment to the role (including commitment of time for Board 
and Committee meetings and any other duties).
B.7 Re-election
The Company’s Articles of Association require the Directors to 
submit themselves for re-election by shareholders at least once 
every three years. However, the Board has decided that all 
Directors will stand for re-election or election at each Annual 
General Meeting in accordance with the Code. 62 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015

C. Accountability
C.1 Financial and Business Reporting
Please refer to:
• page 84 for the Board’s statement on the Annual report  
and accounts being fair, balanced and understandable;
• page 22 for the statement on the status of the Company  
and the Group as a going concern; and
• the Strategic report on pages 6-15 for an explanation of the 
Company’s business model and the strategy for delivering  
the objectives of the Company.
C.2 Risk Management and Internal Control
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Company and how those risks affect the 
prospects of the Company. Please refer to pages 24-29 for 
further information on the Company’s principal risks and 
uncertainties and page 22 for their impact on the prospects  
of the Company.
The overall responsibility for easyJet’s systems of internal control 
and for reviewing their effectiveness rests with the Board. The 
Board has conducted an annual review of the effectiveness  
of the systems of internal control during the year, under the 
auspices of the Audit Committee. Further information on the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems is 
given on page 63.
C.3 Audit Committee and Auditors
For further information on the Company’s compliance with the 
Code provisions relating to the Audit Committee and auditors, 
please refer to the Audit Committee report on pages 54-57.
D. Remuneration
For further information on the Company’s compliance with the 
Code provisions relating to remuneration, please refer to:
• the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 64-83 for the  
level and components of remuneration (D.1); and
• page 53 (the Remuneration Committee Report) for the 
procedure relating to remuneration (D.2).
E. Relations with shareholders
E.1 Dialogue with Shareholders
The Company actively engages with investors and solicits their 
feedback. The Chairman met with shareholders to help maintain  
a balanced understanding of their issues and concerns. He has 
updated the Board on the opinions of investors. The views of 
shareholders and market perceptions are also regularly 
communicated to the Board via verbal briefings. 
easyJet has an investor relations department which runs an 
active programme to facilitate engagement with investors based 
around the financial reporting calendar.
This year the programme has included one-to-one meetings  
with institutional investors, road shows and conferences. There  
is also regular communication with institutional investors on  
key business issues.
During the course of the year the Chairman and Chief Executive 
have both met with a representative of easyGroup Holdings 
Limited, the Company’s largest shareholder, to discuss relevant 
matters. The Chief Financial Officer, Chris Kennedy, has also met 
separately with representatives of easyGroup Ltd (an affiliate of 
easyGroup Holdings Limited) to discuss matters relating to the 
management and protection of the “easyJet” and “easy” brands.
E.2 Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting gives all shareholders the 
opportunity to communicate directly with the Board and 
encourages their participation. Shareholders are given the 
opportunity to raise issues formally at the Annual General 
Meeting or informally with Directors after the meeting. All 
Directors normally attend the Annual General Meeting and the 
Chairs of the Committees are available to answer questions at 
the Annual General Meeting. Strategic report Governance Accounts
63 www.easyJet.com
RISK MANAGEMENT AND  
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board has overall responsibility for easyJet’s risk 
management and systems of internal control.
Risk management
easyJet has an established risk management process to ensure 
that significant risks are identified and mitigated where possible. 
For further details of the risk management process, the principal 
risks and uncertainties faced by the Group and the associated 
mitigating actions, please refer to pages 24-29.
In order that risks are managed effectively, a number of activities 
are undertaken:
• ongoing risk management and assurance is provided through 
the various monitoring reviews and reporting mechanisms that 
are embedded into the business operations;
• regular operational (including safety), commercial, financial and 
IT functional meetings are held to review performance and to 
consider key risks and issues; (please refer to pages 52-53 for 
details of the Safety Committee); and
• the Executive Management T eam meets regularly to consider 
significant risks and overall business performance.
T o mitigate any significant risks identified, the Directors review 
the effectiveness of internal controls, including operating, 
financial and compliance controls, by the following:
• review by management of controls, which mitigate or minimise 
high-level risks, to ensure that they are in operation. The results 
of this review are reported to the Audit Committee and the 
Board which considers whether these high-level risks are being 
effectively controlled; and
• discussions with senior personnel throughout the Company.  
This ensures key issues are escalated through the management 
team and, as appropriate, ultimately to the Board.
The Audit Committee undertakes an annual review of the 
appropriateness of the risk management processes to ensure 
that they are sufficiently robust to meet the needs of the  
Group (please refer to pages 54-57 for details of the Audit 
Committee’s responsibilities).
Internal control
The responsibility for establishing and operating detailed control 
procedures lies with the Chief Executive. The internal control 
systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives. By their nature, they  
can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board has conducted an annual review of the effectiveness 
of the systems of internal control during the year, under the 
auspices of the Audit Committee. This included reviews of 
systems and controls relating to financial reporting processes 
and the preparation of the accounts. The internal financial 
control monitoring programme, administered by Internal Audit, 
has continued to enhance the review process. 
The internal control regime is supported by the operation of  
a whistleblower reporting function. The system is operated by  
a specialist external third-party service provider and allows 
employees to report concerns anonymously and in confidence. 
The Audit Committee has approved the processes and reporting 
structure for the function, and receives regular reports on  
its operation.
Internal audit
The Internal Audit function’s key objectives are to provide 
independent and objective assurance on risks and controls to the 
Board, Audit Committee and senior management, and to assist 
the Board in meeting its corporate governance and regulatory 
responsibilities. Its work is summarised in a risk-based audit plan, 
which is approved by the Audit Committee and updated on a 
rolling basis.
Internal Audit reviews the extent to which systems of internal control:
• are designed and operating effectively;
• are adequate to manage easyJet’s key risks; and
• safeguard the Group’s assets.
The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Head of Risk and T ax 
and has direct access to the Chief Executive and the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. The Head of Internal Audit is invited to, 
and attends, Audit Committee meetings throughout the year 
and reports regularly on Internal Audit reviews to the Executive 
Management T eam.
During the year, the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function 
was assessed by the Audit Committee. The role of the Internal 
Audit function and the scope of its work both continue to evolve 
to take account of changes within the business and emerging 
best practice. A formal audit charter is in place. 64 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Directors’ remuneration report
Annual st a tement by the  
chair of the remunera tion committee
CHARLES GURASSA,
CHAIR OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Performance of the Group in the 2015 financial year
easyJet has continued to deliver sustainable returns and growth 
for its shareholders. The key highlights are as follows:
• profit before tax up by 18% to £686 million;
• 1.7 percentage point growth in return on capital employed 
(ROCE) (including lease adjustments) from 20.5% in 2014 to 
22.2% in 2015;
• increased ordinary dividend with a proposed ordinary dividend 
of 55.2 pence per share;
• on-time performance was 80%, marginally above the threshold 
for the year; and
• total cost per seat (excluding fuel at constant currency) and 
customer satisfaction outcomes for the year were below 
bonus thresholds for the year.
Aligning remuneration policy with Company principles
Simple and cost-effective approach – In line with our low-cost 
and efficient business model, the Committee has chosen to  
set a simple pay package against the market. For example, our 
Executive Directors do not receive the Executive benefits that 
can be found in most organisations (see page 66).
Support the stated business strategy of growth and returns –  
Performance is assessed against a range of financial, operational 
and longer-term targets ensuring value is delivered to shareholders, 
and Directors are rewarded for the successful delivery of the key 
strategic objectives of the Company.
Pay for performance – Remuneration is heavily weighted towards 
variable pay, dependent on performance. This ensures that there 
is a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the 
amount paid to our Executive Directors.
Key pay outcomes in respect of the 2015 financial year – Annual 
bonuses are based on profit before tax and key operational and 
financial targets. A bonus of 66% of the maximum was awarded 
to the Chief Executive in respect of the 2015 financial year. This 
reflects the strong results the Group has achieved. One-third of 
the bonus earned is subject to compulsory deferral for three 
years. In light of the resignation during the year of Chris Kennedy, 
the Chief Financial Officer, he is not eligible to receive a bonus 
award in respect of the 2015 financial year.
Under the Long T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP), Performance Share 
Awards made in December 2012 are due to vest in December 
2015. These awards are based on a combination of average 
ROCE performance (including lease adjustments) and relative 
total shareholder return (TSR) compared to FTSE 51-150 
companies for the three financial years ended 30 September 
2015. The Group achieved average ROCE performance (including 
lease adjustments) of 20.0%, and the Company was ranked in the 
top decile in terms of TSR relative to FTSE 51-150 companies, 
reflecting exceptional performance over the period. This level of 
performance, reflecting a return of 236% for investment in easyJet 
shares, resulted in 100% of the awards vesting successfully, 
subject to continued employment to the vesting date.
Remuneration policy for the 2016 financial year
The Company’s remuneration policy was approved by 
shareholders at last year’s AGM in February 2015 and the current 
intention is that it will apply until the 2018 AGM. As such, we will 
not be asking shareholders to vote on the policy at the 2016 
AGM. In reviewing the policy last year, one key conclusion of  
the Committee was that the Company’s remuneration policy 
should continue to be aligned with easyJet’s principles and the 
Committee is of the view that this remains the case. In line  
with our principles, and taking full account of the ‘best practice’ 
expectations of investors, we took the opportunity of simplifying 
our arrangements and 2015 was therefore the last time that we 
made Matching Share Awards under the LTIP. From 2016, awards 
will be made as Performance Shares only. The Committee 
remains confident that the policy is appropriate and that it 
satisfies our objective to operate a remuneration structure which 
successfully promotes the long-term success of the Company.
The Committee has further reviewed the LTIP and has recalibrated 
the targets in line with the current key strategic focus and 
projected additional capital expenditure within the business. This 
has led to a rebalancing of the current performance metric from 
an equal split of ROCE and relative TSR to a condition based 70% 
on ROCE and 30% on TSR. The target range continues to be set 
taking into account internal projections and external views. The 
range is the same as last year with a small enhancement to pay 
out on achieving target expectations. This has been the subject  
of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders and the 
leading shareholder advisory bodies. The Committee believe  
these to be appropriate and demanding targets. 
In summary, our relatively straightforward remuneration consists 
of a base salary, pension contribution of 7%, benefit provision 
and, subject to stretching performance conditions, an annual 
bonus plan, part paid in cash and part deferred into shares,  
and shares awarded under an LTIP. Incentive pay is subject to 
clawback provisions, a post-vesting holding period operates for 
LTIP awards and significant share ownership guidelines apply.
The basic salary of the Chief Executive increased by 1%, in line 
with the typical rate of increase being awarded across the 
Group. The increase will be effective from 1 January 2016.
Changes to the Board
We announced in January 2015 that our CFO, Chris Kennedy, 
would be leaving to take up another role. Chris subsequently 
stepped down from the Board and left the Company on 1 
September 2015. We are delighted that Andrew Findlay has 
joined us as CFO from 2 October 2015.
Chris Kennedy worked the majority of his notice period and will 
not receive any payment in lieu of the balance of his notice 
period after leaving the Company. In line with the Company’s 
remuneration policy, following his resignation, Chris was not 
eligible to receive a bonus for the 2015 financial year. Under  
the rules of the LTIP, any unvested LTIP awards after the date  
of departure lapsed, and all benefits also ceased. Strategic report Governance Accounts
65 www.easyJet.com
On joining the Board on 2 October 2015, Andrew Findlay’s base 
salary was set at £425,000. The intention on joining was to set 
the salary at a discount to the market level but with a view that 
it would be brought up to the mid-market level as he gained 
experience in the role. The Committee therefore intends to 
increase his salary to £500,000 in equal increments over the 
next two to three years subject to individual and Company 
performance. The Committee has taken account of easyJet’s 
policy of providing benefits and pension at modest levels and 
the weighting on variable pay in the overall package in 
determining the salary level. Andrew will also receive a cash 
alternative to pension of 7% of salary, annual bonus opportunity 
of 175% of salary, annual LTIP award of 200% of salary, and  
some modest benefits. This package is consistent with our 
remuneration policy. In addition, in order to secure the 
appointment, certain buy-out arrangements have been agreed, 
to compensate Andrew for incentive awards forfeited from his 
previous employer. The Committee has taken particular care in 
ensuring that these arrangements are appropriate in light of our 
policy, the expectations of institutional investors, where a 
buy-out takes place, and replicate, as closely as possible, the 
expected value, form and time horizons of the forfeited awards.
Shareholder feedback
easyJet is committed to maintaining an open and transparent 
dialogue with shareholders. The objective of this report is to 
communicate clearly how much the Executive Directors are 
earning and how this is linked to performance. As always, I 
welcome any comments you may have.
CHARLES GURASSA
Chair of the Remuneration Committee

OUR REMUNERATION POLICY
What is the role of our Remuneration Committee? 
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining 
remuneration for the Executive Directors and the Chairman of 
the Board. The Committee also reviews the remuneration of the 
Group’s most senior executives in consultation with the Chief 
Executive. The Committee takes into account the need to  
recruit and retain executives and ensure that they are properly 
motivated to perform in the interests of the Company and  
its shareholders, while paying no more than is necessary.
What does the Committee consider when setting 
remuneration?
When setting the policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration, 
the Committee takes into account total remuneration levels 
operating in companies of a similar size and complexity, the 
responsibilities of each individual role, individual performance  
and an individual’s experience. Our overall policy, having had due 
regard to the factors noted, is to weight remuneration towards 
variable pay. This is typically achieved through setting base pay 
at up to market median levels, offering very modest pension and 
benefits, and above-market variable pay opportunities linked to 
the achievement of demanding performance targets.
In setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee takes note of the overall approach to reward for 
employees in the Group. Salary increases will ordinarily be (in 
percentage of salary terms) in line with those of the wider 
workforce. The Committee does not formally consult directly 
with employees on executive pay but does receive periodic 
updates from the Group People Director.
The Committee also considers developments in institutional 
investors’ best practice expectations and the views expressed  
by shareholders during any dialogue.
How do we take into account the views of shareholders when 
we determine the remuneration policy?
easyJet remains committed to shareholder dialogue and takes 
an active interest in voting outcomes. We consult extensively 
with our major shareholders when setting our remuneration 
policy. If any of these shareholders were to be opposed to our 
policy, we would endeavour to meet with them, as appropriate, 
to understand and respond to any issues they may have.
The policy set out below applies to awards granted from the 
2013 financial year onwards. Awards granted under the previous 
policy are subject to different performance measures (typically 
Return on Equity (ROE) or ROCE as the sole performance 
measure), have different award levels and may be earned in  
line with the terms of their grant in due course. Details of all  
the outstanding share awards granted to existing Executive 
Directors are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
WHAT IS IN THIS REPORT?
This report sets out easyJet’s remuneration policy for 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors, describes the 
implementation of that policy and discloses the amounts 
earned relating to the year ended 30 September 2015.
The report complies with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013. The report has been 
prepared in line with the recommendations of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the requirements of the 
UKLA Listing Rules.
The Directors’ remuneration policy was approved by 
shareholders in a binding vote at the 2015 AGM on 12 February 
2015. The policy took formal effect from the date of approval 
and the intention is that it will apply until the 2018 AGM. A 
summary of the policy has again been included in this report 
(set out on pages 61 to 67) for the purposes of clarity  
and transparency. 
The Annual Statement by the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee (set out on pages 64 to 65) and 
the Annual Report on Remuneration (set out on pages 71 to 
80) will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM. 66 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Salary
T o provide the core 
reward for the role.
Sufficient level to recruit 
and retain individuals of 
the necessary calibre to 
execute the Company’s 
business strategy
Base salaries are normally reviewed annually, with changes effective 
from 1 January.
Salaries are typically set after considering salary levels in companies 
of a similar size and complexity, the responsibilities of each individual 
role, progression within the role, individual performance and an 
individual’s experience. Our overall policy, having had due regard  
to the factors noted, is normally to target salaries at the market 
median level.
Salaries may be adjusted and any increase will ordinarily be (in 
percentage of salary terms) in line with those of the wider workforce.
Increases beyond those granted to the wider workforce  
(in percentage of salary terms) may be awarded in certain 
circumstances such as where there is a change in responsibility, 
progression in the role, experience or a significant increase in the 
scale of the role and/or size, value and/or complexity of the Group.
Salary levels for current incumbents, effective from 1 January 2016, 
are as follows:
• Chief Executive: £705,600.
• Chief Financial Officer: £425,000
The Committee considers 
individual salaries at the 
appropriate Committee 
meeting each year after having 
due regard to the factors noted 
in operating the salary policy.
No recovery provisions apply  
to salary.
Benefits
In line with the 
Company’s policy to  
keep remuneration  
simple and consistent.
Executive Directors receive modest personal accident and life 
assurance cover (0.5 x salary), at similar levels as the wider UK 
workforce. The cost to the Company of providing these benefits  
may vary from year to year depending on the level of the  
associated premium.
Executive Directors receive no other conventional executive  
company benefits.
Executive Directors can pay for voluntary benefits, where Company 
purchasing power may provide an advantage to employees.
Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in any all-employee 
share plans operated by the Company, in line with HMRC guidelines 
currently prevailing (where relevant), on the same basis as for other 
eligible employees.
Should it be appropriate to recruit a Director from overseas, flexibility 
is retained to provide benefits that take account of those typically 
provided in their country of residence (e.g. it may be appropriate  
to provide benefits that are tailored to the unique circumstances  
of such an appointment as opposed to providing the benefits 
detailed above).
Necessary expenses incurred undertaking Company business are 
reimbursed so that Executive Directors are not worse off on a net  
of tax basis for fulfilling Company duties.
Not applicable.
No recovery provisions apply  
to benefits.
Pension
T o provide employees 
with long-term savings 
via pension provisions in 
line with the Company’s 
strategy to keep 
remuneration simple  
and consistent.
Defined contribution plan with the same monthly employer 
contributions as those offered to eligible employees in the  
wider UK workforce, of 7% of base salary. A cash alternative  
may be considered.
While individuals are not obliged to make contributions, easyJet 
operates a pension salary sacrifice arrangement whereby individuals 
can exchange part of their salary for Company paid pension 
contributions. Where individuals exchange salary this reduces 
employer National Insurance contributions. easyJet credits half of this 
reduction (currently 6.9% of the salary exchanged) to the individual’s 
pension plan.
Not applicable.
No recovery provisions apply to 
employer pension contributions.

Rewards the achievement 
of annual financial and 
operational goals.
Compulsory deferral 
provides alignment  
with shareholders.
Maximum opportunity of 200% of salary for 
Chief Executive and 175% of salary for other 
Executive Directors.
One-third of the bonus earned is subject to 
compulsory deferral into shares (or equivalent) 
in a Deferred Annual Bonus Plan (DABP), 
typically for a period of three years, and is 
normally subject to continued employment. 
The remainder of the bonus is paid in cash. 
Dividend equivalent payments may be made  
(in cash or shares) under the DABP, at the time 
of vesting and may assume the reinvestment  
of dividends.
All bonus payments are at the discretion of  
the Committee, as shown following this table.
Bonuses are based on stretching financial, 
operational and, in some cases, personal/ 
departmental performance measures, as set and 
assessed by the Committee in its discretion. Financial 
measures (e.g. profit before tax) will represent the 
majority of bonus, with other measures representing 
the balance. A graduated scale of targets is set for 
each measure, with 10% of each element being 
payable for achieving the relevant threshold hurdle.
Safety underpins all of the operational activities  
of the Group and the bonus plan includes provision 
that enables the Remuneration Committee to scale 
back the bonus earned in the event that there is a 
safety event which it considers warrants the use  
of such discretion.
The cash and deferred elements of bonuses are 
subject to provisions which enable the Committee  
to recover the cash paid (clawback) or to lapse the 
associated deferred shares (malus) in the event of  
a misstatement of results for the financial year to 
which the bonus relates, or an error in determining 
the cash bonus or the number of shares comprising 
a deferred share award, within three years of the 
payment of the cash bonus.
LTIP Performance Share 
Award
T o incentivise and 
recognise execution of 
the business strategy 
over the longer term.
Rewards strong financial 
performance and 
sustained increase in 
shareholder value.
Each year LTIP awards may be granted subject 
to the achievement of performance targets. 
Awards normally vest over a three-year period.
The maximum opportunity contained within  
the plan rules for Performance Share Awards  
is 250% of salary (with awards up to 300%  
of salary eligible to be made in exceptional 
circumstances, such as recruitment).
The normal maximum face value of annual 
awards will be 250% of salary for the Chief 
Executive and 200% of salary for other 
Executive Directors.
A dividend equivalent provision exists which 
allows the Committee to pay dividends on 
vested shares (in cash or shares) at the time of 
vesting and may assume the reinvestment of 
dividends. A holding period applies to share 
awards granted in the financial year ended  
30 September 2015 and beyond. The holding 
period will require the Executive Directors  
to retain the after-tax value of shares for  
24 months from the vesting date.
LTIP awards vest based on three-year performance 
against a stretching range of financial targets and 
relative TSR performance set and assessed by the 
Committee in its discretion. Financial targets will 
determine vesting in relation to at least 50%  
of awards.
In order for the TSR portion of the award to be 
earned, the Company’s absolute TSR performance 
must also be positive over the performance period.
25% of each element vests for achieving the 
threshold performance target with 100% of the 
awards being earned for maximum performance. 
(There is straight-line vesting between these points).
The LTIP includes provisions which enable the 
Committee to recover value in the event of a 
misstatement of results for the financial year to 
which the vesting of awards related, or an error in 
calculation when determining the vesting result 
within three years of the vesting (i.e. clawback 
provisions apply). The mechanism through which  
the clawback can be implemented enables the 
Committee to: (i) reduce the outstanding LTIP share 
awards (i.e. malus provisions may be used to effect  
a clawback), or (ii) for the Committee to require that 
a net of tax balancing cash payment be made.
Share ownership
T o ensure alignment 
between the interests of 
Executive Directors and 
shareholders.
200% of salary holding required for the Chief 
Executive and 175% of salary for the Chief 
Financial Officer which is expected to be 
reached within five years of appointment.
Executive Directors are required to retain half  
of the post-tax shares vesting under the LTIP 
until the guideline is met.

What discretion is retained by the Committee in operating  
its incentive plans?
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan, LTIP and 
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan according to their respective rules 
(or relevant documents) and in accordance with the Listing Rules 
where relevant. The Committee retains discretion, consistent 
with market practice, in a number of regards to the operation 
and administration of these plans. These include, but are not 
limited to, the following in relation to the LTIP and Deferred 
Annual Bonus Plan:
• the participants;
• the timing of grant of an award;
• the size of an award;
• the determination of vesting;
• discretion required when dealing with a change of control  
or restructuring of the Group;
• determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules 
of the plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
• adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights 
issues, corporate restructuring events and special dividends); 
and
• the annual review of performance measures and weighting, 
and targets for the LTIP from year to year.
 In relation to the annual bonus plan, the Committee retains 
discretion over:
• the participants;
• the timing of grant of a payment;
• the determination of the bonus payment;
• dealing with a change of control;
• determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules 
of the plan and the appropriate treatment chosen; and
• the annual review of performance measures and weighting, 
and targets for the annual bonus plan from year to year.
 In relation to both the Company’s LTIP and annual bonus plan, 
the Committee retains the ability to adjust the targets and/or set 
different measures if events occur which cause it to determine 
that the conditions are no longer appropriate (e.g. material 
acquisition and/or divestment of a Group business), and the 
amendment is required so that the conditions achieve their 
original purpose and are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would be explained in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration and may be the subject of 
consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
The use of discretion in relation to the Company’s Save As You 
Earn and Share Incentive Plans will be as permitted under HMRC 
rules and the Listing Rules.
Details of share awards granted to existing Executive Directors 
are set out on page 75 of the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
These remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms.
How were the performance metrics chosen and how were 
the performance targets set?
The performance metrics used for the annual bonus plan  
and LTIP have been selected to reflect the Group’s key  
performance indicators.
Profit before tax is used to assess annual performance as this 
reflects how successful the Company has been in managing 
operations effectively (e.g. in maximising profit per seat whilst 
maintaining a high load factor). The balance is determined based 
on how well the Company performs against other specific key 
performance indicators set annually (e.g. on-time performance 
and customer satisfaction) to ensure that Executive Directors  
are motivated to deliver across a scorecard of objectives.
Since safety is of central importance to the business, the  
award of any bonus is subject to an underpin that enables the 
Remuneration Committee to reduce the bonus earned in the 
event that there is a safety event that it considers warrants  
the use of such discretion.
LTIP awards are earned for delivering performance against ROCE 
and relative TSR targets. These seek to assess the underlying 
financial performance of the business while maintaining clear 
alignment between shareholders and Executive Directors. T argets 
are set based on a sliding scale that takes account of relevant 
commercial factors.
Only modest awards are available for delivering threshold 
performance levels with maximum awards requiring substantial 
outperformance of challenging plans.
No performance targets are set for Save As You Earn and Share 
Incentive Plan awards since these form part of all-employee 
arrangements that are purposefully designed to encourage 
employees across the Group to purchase shares in the Company.
Have LTIP Awards always been granted subject to the same 
performance targets?
The LTIP, under which the Performance and Matching Share 
Awards are granted, was approved by shareholders in 2008. 
Further details on how the awards are structured and operated 
are set out in the plan rules which are available, on request, from 
the Company.
How does the executive pay policy differ from that for other 
easyJet employees?
The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more 
heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees, 
to make a greater part of their pay conditional on the successful 
delivery of business strategy. This aims to create a clear link 
between the value created for shareholders and the 
remuneration received by the Executive Directors. However, in 
line with the Company’s policy to keep remuneration simple and 
consistent, the benefit and pension arrangements for the current 
Executive Directors are on the same terms as those offered to 
eligible employees in the wider workforce.
Directors’ remuneration report continued Strategic report Governance Accounts

How much could the Executive Directors earn under the 
remuneration policy?
A significant proportion of remuneration is linked to performance, 
particularly at maximum performance levels. The charts below show 
how much the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer could earn 
under easyJet’s remuneration policy (as detailed above) under 
different performance scenarios (based on their salaries as at 2 
October 2015 – Chief Financial Officer’s date of joining). The following 
assumptions have been made:
Minimum (performance below threshold) – Fixed pay only with  
no vesting under any of easyJet’s incentive plans.
In line with expectations – Fixed pay plus a bonus at the mid-point  
of the range (giving 50% of the maximum opportunity) and vesting 
of 37.5% of the maximum under the L TIP .
Maximum (performance meets or exceeds maximum) – Fixed pay 
plus maximum bonus and maximum vesting under the LTIP. 
Fixed pay comprises:
• salaries – salary effective as at 2 October 2015;
• benefits – amount received by each Executive Director in  
the 2015 financial year;
• pension – employer contributions or cash-equivalent payments 
received by each Executive Director in the 2015 financial year; 
and
• Free and Matching Shares under the all-employee share 
incentive plan.
The scenarios do not include any share price growth or  
dividend assumptions.

It should be noted that since the analysis above shows what 
could be earned by the Executive Directors based on the 
remuneration policy described above (ignoring the potential 
impact of share price growth), the numbers will be different  
to the values included in the table on page 73 detailing what  
was actually earned by the Executive Directors in relation to  
the financial year ended 30 September 2015, since these values 
are based on the actual levels of performance achieved to  
30 September 2015 and include the impact of share price 
growth in relation to share awards.
What are the Executive Directors’ terms of employment?
Under the Executive Directors’ service contracts both parties are 
required to give 12 months’ notice of termination of employment.
For Executive Directors, if notice is served by either party, the 
Executive Director can continue to receive basic salary, benefits 
and pension for the duration of their notice period during which 
time the Company may require the individual to continue to fulfil 
their current duties or may assign a period of garden leave.
The policy for a new hire would be based on similar terms and 
will also include the ability for easyJet to make a payment in lieu 
of notice of up to 12 monthly instalments which would be 
reduced if alternative employment was taken up.
Under the current Chief Executive’s contract, the Company, by 
mutual consent, may elect to make a payment in lieu of notice 
equivalent in value to 12 months’ basic salary, payable in monthly 
instalments which would be subject to mitigation if alternative 
employment is taken up during this time. Alternatively, this 
payment may be paid as a lump sum. Bonus payments may be 
made, payable in cash, on a pro-rata basis, but only for the 
period of time served from the start of the financial year to the 
date of termination and not for any period in lieu of notice. Any 
bonus paid would be subject to the normal bonus targets, tested 
at the end of the financial year. The current Chief Executive has 
a contractual entitlement to such a pro-rated payment under  
her service contract, other than in the cases of resignation or 
termination resulting from gross misconduct. These provisions  
do not apply to the Chief Financial Officer.
In relation to a termination of employment, the Committee  
may make any statutory entitlements or payments to settle  
or compromise claims in connection with a termination of  
any existing or future Executive Director as necessary. The 
Committee also retains the discretion to reimburse reasonable 
legal expenses incurred in relation to a termination of employment 
and to meet any outplacement costs if deemed necessary.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and the Non- 
Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are available for 
inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office.
What is the policy when an Executive Director leaves or there 
is a takeover?
The rules of both schemes (LTIP and Deferred Annual Bonus 
Plan) set out what happens to awards if a participant ceases  
to be an employee or Director of easyJet before the end of the 
vesting period. Generally, any outstanding share awards will lapse 
on such cessation, except in certain circumstances.
If an Executive Director ceases to be an employee or Director  
of easyJet as a result of death, injury, retirement, the sale of the 
business or company that employs the individual, or any other 
reason at the discretion of the Committee, then they will be 
treated as a ‘good leaver’ under the relevant plan’s rules. Under 
the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, the shares for a good leaver will 
normally vest in full on the normal vesting date (or on cessation 
of employment in the case of death) and if the award is in the 
form of an option, there is a 12-month window in which the 
award can be exercised. Awards structured as options which 
have vested prior to cessation can be exercised within 12 months 
of cessation of office or employment. 70 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Under the LTIP, a good leaver’s unvested awards will vest (either 
on the normal vesting date or the relevant date of cessation,  
as determined by the Committee) subject to achievement of 
any relevant performance conditions, with a pro-rata reduction 
to reflect the proportion of the vesting period served. The 
Committee has the discretion to disapply time pro-rating if it 
considers it appropriate to do so. A good leaver may exercise 
their vested awards structured as options for a period of  
12 months following the individual’s cessation of office or 
employment, whereas unvested awards may be exercised  
within 12 months of vesting.
In determining whether an Executive Director should be treated 
as a good leaver, and the extent to which their award may vest, 
the Committee will take into account the circumstances of an 
individual’s departure. 
In the event of a takeover or winding-up of easyJet plc (which  
is not part of an internal reorganisation of the easyJet Group,  
in circumstances where equivalent replacement awards are  
not granted) all awards will vest subject to, in the case of LTIP 
awards, the achievement of any relevant performance conditions 
with a pro-rata reduction to reflect the proportion of the vesting 
period served. The Committee has discretion to disapply time 
pro-rating if it considers it appropriate to do so. In the event of  
a takeover, the Committee may determine, with the agreement 
of the acquiring company, that awards will be exchanged for 
equivalent awards in another company.
What is the policy on Executive Directors holding  
external appointments?
Executive Directors are permitted to accept one appointment on 
a board or committee of a listed company so long as this is not 
thought to interfere with the business of the Group. Any fees 
received in respect of these appointments are retained directly 
by the relevant Executive Director.
What would the remuneration policy be if a new Director  
was appointed?
Base salary levels will be set in accordance with easyJet’s 
remuneration policy, taking into account the experience and 
calibre of the individual (e.g. typically up to market median levels 
but salaries above or below this level may be set dependent 
upon the level of the individual). Where it is appropriate to offer 
a lower salary initially, a series of increases to achieve the desired 
salary positioning may be given over the following few years 
subject to individual performance. Benefits will be provided in line 
with those offered to other employees, with relocation expenses/ 
arrangements provided if necessary. easyJet may offer a cash 
amount on recruitment, payment of which may be staggered,  
to reflect the value of benefits a new recruit may have received 
from a former employer.
Should it be appropriate to recruit a Director from overseas, 
flexibility is retained to provide benefits that take account of 
those typically provided in their country of residence (e.g. it may 
be appropriate to provide benefits that are tailored to the unique 
circumstances of such an appointment).
The maximum level of variable pay that may be offered on  
an ongoing basis and the structure of remuneration will be in 
accordance with the approved policy detailed above, i.e. at an 
aggregate maximum of up to 450% of salary (200% annual 
bonus and 250% Performance Shares under the LTIP), taking 
into account annual and long-term variable pay. This limit  
does not include the value of any buy-out arrangements.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the 
annual bonus, taking into account the responsibilities of the 
individual, and the point in the financial year that they joined.  
Any incentive offered above this limit would be contingent on 
the Company receiving shareholder approval for an amendment 
to its approved policy at its next General Meeting.
The above policy applies to both an internal promotion to the 
Board or an external hire.
In the case of an external hire, if it is necessary to buy out 
incentive pay or benefit arrangements (which would be forfeited 
on leaving the previous employer), this would be provided  
for taking into account the form (cash or shares), timing  
and expected value (i.e. likelihood of meeting any existing 
performance criteria) of the remuneration being forfeited. 
Replacement share awards, if used, will be granted using 
easyJet’s share plans to the extent possible, although awards 
may also be granted outside these schemes if necessary and  
as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal promotion, any outstanding variable 
pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be paid 
according to its terms of grant (adjusted as relevant to take  
into account the Board appointment).
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, fees will be set taking into account the experience  
and calibre of the individual. Where specific cash or share 
arrangements are delivered to Non-Executive Directors, these will 
not include share options or other performance-related elements.
How are the Non-Executive Directors paid?
The Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 
receive an annual fee (paid in monthly instalments). The fee for 
the Chairman is set by the Remuneration Committee and the 
fees for the Deputy Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are 
approved by the Board, on the recommendation of the 
Chairman and Chief Executive.
What are the terms of appointment of the Non-Executive

Fees
T o attract and retain a high- 
calibre Chairman, Deputy 
Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors by offering market- 
competitive fee levels.
The Chairman is paid an all-inclusive fee for all Board responsibilities.
The other Non-Executive Directors receive a basic Board fee, with 
supplementary fees payable for additional Board Committee responsibilities.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the 
Company’s incentive arrangements.
Fee levels are reviewed on a periodic basis, and may be increased, taking into 
account factors such as the time commitment of the role and market levels  
in companies of comparable size and complexity.
Flexibility is retained to exceed current fee levels if it is necessary to do so  
in order to appoint a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director of an 
appropriate calibre.
Necessary expenses incurred undertaking Company business will be 
reimbursed so that the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not  
worse off, on a net of tax basis, for fulfilling Company duties.
No other benefits or remuneration are provided to the Chairman or  
Non-Executive Directors.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
Who is on the Company’s Remuneration Committee?
As at 30 September 2015, the members of the Committee were: 
Charles Gurassa (Chair), François Rubichon and John Browett. 
David Bennett stepped down from the Committee on 1 October 
2014 and Professor Rigas Doganis stepped down from the 
Committee on 1 December 2014 following their retirement from 
the Board. The responsibilities of the Committee are set out in 
the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report on  
page 53.
The Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation and assists 
the Committee in its deliberations as appropriate. The 
Committee also receives assistance from the Group People 
Director and the Group Head of Reward. The Group Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. No Directors are 
involved in deciding their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee is advised by Hewitt New  
Bridge Street (HNBS), (an AON company). A sister company  
in the AON Group also provides pension and flexible benefits 
administration services to the company. HNBS was appointed  
by the Committee in 2004. HNBS advises the Committee on 
developments in executive pay and on the operation of easyJet’s 
incentive plans. T otal fees paid to HNBS in respect of services to 
the Committee during the 2015 financial year were £133,000. 
HNBS is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Group 
Code of Conduct. The Committee has reviewed the operating 
processes in place at HNBS and is satisfied that the advice it 
receives is independent and objective.
How has the new CFO’s package been set?
Andrew Findlay’s package is in line with that applicable to the 
previous CFO, and is in line with our policy, other than salary on 
appointment which has been set at £425,000 (with the previous 
CFO’s salary set at £430,800 at the time of his departure). 
In addition, certain performance related buy-out arrangements 
have been agreed to compensate Andrew Findlay for bonus and 
long-term incentive awards forfeited from his previous employer. 
The approach to the buy-out is in line with the Company’s policy 
on buy-out arrangements (and the expectations of institutional 
investors where a buy-out takes place). The payment was 
performance related in that it has been calculated so as to 
replicate the likely value and time horizons associated with  
the awards at the previous employer. 
The buy-out comprised:
1.  A cash payment of equivalent value to the bonus he would 
have been eligible to receive from his previous employer in 
relation to the year of his departure. The payment was 
performance related in that the amount of the bonus was 
determined based on his former company’s reported 
disclosures of how the company performed against its bonus 
targets. The cash payment, amounting to £311,837, was paid in 
October 2015. The Committee was comfortable with providing 
this form and level of compensation since it replicated the 
amount of value forfeit in connection with joining easyJet. 72 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015
2.  A performance adjusted award of 22,762 easyJet shares will 
be made to compensate for the forfeiture of the long-term 
incentive award he received in August 2013 from his previous 
employer. Since around two-thirds of the vesting period for 
this award had already run its course, the Committee assessed 
the extent to which the performance targets were likely to  
be met (based on current market forecasts) in respect of the 
shares comprising two-thirds of the award and converted this 
number of shares into an equivalent value of easyJet shares 
on joining. These will vest, subject to continued employment 
with easyJet, on 7 August 2016, so as to mirror the original 
time horizon of the award. A further award of 14,625 easyJet 
shares relating to the forfeiture of the August 2013 award was 
also granted. This award was calculated based on the value of 
one-third of the award at the time of joining easyJet, but these 
shares will only vest to the extent that the performance 
targets set for the 2013 easyJet LTIP award are met and 
continued employment to 17 December 2016. The Committee 
was comfortable with providing this form and level of 
compensation since it replicated its assessment of the value 
forfeit and also, in part, switched into easyJet performance  
on a pro-rata basis for part of the award. 
3.  An award of 39,923 easyJet shares will be made to 
compensate for the forfeiture of the award granted to the 
individual in August 2014. This award comprised an exchange 
of the maximum number of shares that could vest under his 
previous employers’ award which were then converted to 
easyJet shares on joining. These shares will only vest based on 
the extent to which the performance targets applying to the 
2014 easyJet LTIP award are met and the individual remaining 
in employment until 19 December 2017, being the ordinary 
vesting date for the easyJet award and later than the vesting 
date of the original award at his former employer. The 
Committee was comfortable with providing this form of 
compensation given the performance period at the individual’s 
previous employer for this award had only recently 
commenced and so switching to an equivalent value in 
performance related easyJet shares resulted in alignment 
being achieved with the wider executive team at easyJet. 
Each of the replacement share awards detailed above will be 
subject to easyJet’s shareholding guidelines whereby Andrew 
Findlay will be required to retain at least half of the (after tax) 
number of shares exercised from the awards until he has built  
a shareholding that, when aggregated with his other easyJet 
shareholdings, is of equivalent value to 175% of salary. 
How will the remuneration policy be applied for the 2016 
financial year?
What are the Executive Directors’ current salaries?
The current and proposed salaries of the Executive Directors are:
1 January 2016 
salary
1 January 2015 
or on 
appointment 
to the Board 
salary Change
CEO £705,600 £698,600 1%
CFO
(1)
£425,000 £425,000 0%
(1)  The current CFO, Andrew Findlay, was appointed to the Board on  
2 October 2015. His base salary on appointment was set at £425,000  
and no increase will be awarded in the 2016 financial year. The salary  
of former CFO, Chris Kennedy, was £430,800.
The increase to be awarded to the Chief Executive is consistent 
with the typical rate of increase being awarded across the Group.
What bonus will be awarded in respect of performance in the 
2016 financial year?
The maximum bonus opportunity remains at 200% of salary for 
the Chief Executive and at 175% for the Chief Financial Officer. 
The measures have been selected to reflect a range of financial 
and operational goals that support the key strategic objectives 
of the Company.
The performance measures and weightings will be as follows:
As a percentage of maximum 
bonus opportunity
Measure CEO CFO
Profit before tax 70% 60%
On-time performance 10% 10%
Customer satisfaction 10% 10%
Operating costs (excluding fuel)  
per seat at constant currency 10% 10%
Departmental objectives – 10%
The proposed target levels for the 2016 financial year have been 
set to be challenging relative to the business plan.
The Committee is comfortable that the bonus targets for both 
Executive Directors are appropriately demanding in light of their 
respective bonus opportunities.
The targets themselves, as they relate to the 2016 financial year, 
are commercially sensitive. However, retrospective disclosure of 
the targets and performance against them will be provided in 
next year’s remuneration report unless they remain commercially 
sensitive. The safety of our customers and people underpins  
all of the operational activities of the Group and the bonus plan 
includes a provision that enables the Remuneration Committee 
to scale back the bonus earned in the event that there is a 
safety event that occurs that it considers warrants the use of 
such discretion.
How will the LTIP be operated in relation to the 2016 financial year 
awards?
The 2015 financial year was the last time that LTIP awards were 
made via a combination of Performance and Matching Share 
Awards. Matching Share Awards will no longer operate from  
the 2016 financial year onwards and LTIP awards will be made  
as Performance Shares only.
The award levels for the Executive Directors in the 2016 financial 
year will be 250% of salary for the Chief Executive and 200% of 
salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
The 2016 financial year LTIP awards will be subject to the 
following performance conditions:
Below 
threshold  
(0% vesting)

Directors’ remuneration report continued Strategic report Governance Accounts
73 www.easyJet.com
Awards vest on a straight-line basis from threshold to on-target 
and from on-target to maximum. As with the awards granted  
in the 2015 financial year, ROCE targets are based on average 
ROCE over a three-year performance period, commencing on  
1 October 2015. TSR targets are based on relative TSR compared 
to companies ranked FTSE 31-130 at the start of the 
performance period, where the average share price is calculated 
over three months at the start and end of the period. In addition, 
in order for the TSR-based awards to vest, easyJet must have 
achieved positive absolute TSR over the performance period.  
The weighting on ROCE and TSR has been rebalanced for the 
2016 financial year from an equal split to a 70/30 split in  
favour of ROCE.
T argets are set taking account of management’s strategic plan, 
market consensus and the Board’s strong focus on driving value 
from its increasing capital base. The ROCE target range is the 
same as last year but with a small enhancement for achieving 
target expectations within the range. The Committee considers 
the range of ROCE targets set to be at least as demanding as 
those set in prior years, given that the level of return required to 
be created for vesting to take place will be calculated from  
a significantly higher capital base reflecting the growth and 
replacement of in the Company’s fleet during the period  
through to 30 September 2018. 
How will the Non-Executive Directors be paid in the 2016  
financial year?
The fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will  
be as follows:
Chairman £300,000
Basic fee for other Non-Executive Directors £60,000
Fees for Deputy Chairman and SID role
(1)
£25,000
Chair of the Audit, Safety and Remuneration

*  Bonus payments were not triggered for customer satisfaction and

A sliding scale of targets for each objective was set at the  
start of the financial year. 10% of each element is payable for 
achieving the threshold target, increasing to 50% for on-target 
performance and 100% for achieving maximum performance. 
Achievements between these points are calculated on a 
straight-line basis.
Performance highlights during the year were:
• profit before tax increased by 18% to £686 million and pre-tax 
profit margins grew by 1.8 percentage points to 14.6%;
• on-time performance was 80%, marginally above the threshold 
for the year; and
• total cost per seat (excluding fuel at constant plan currency) 
and customer satisfaction target threshold levels were not met.
66% of the maximum bonus was awarded to the Chief Executive 
in respect of performance for the year ended 30 September 
2015. This resulted in a bonus payment of £917,098 to the Chief 
Executive. One-third of the bonus is compulsorily deferred into 
shares for three years and subject to continued employment. 
No bonus was payable to the Chief Financial Officer in light of  
his resignation and cessation of employment during the year.
The Committee is satisfied with the overall payments in light  
of the level of performance achieved.
LTIP
The awards made to Executive Directors in December 2012  
were subject to a combination of average ROCE (including  
lease adjustments) and relative TSR compared to FTSE 51-150 
companies performance conditions measured over the three 
financial years ended 30 September 2015. The percentage  
which could be earned was determined using the following 
vesting schedule:
Threshold 
(25% vesting)
Maximum
(100% vesting)
ROCE awards  
(50% of total awards) 12% 16%
TSR awards  
(50% of total awards) Median Upper quartile
Three-year average ROCE (including lease adjustments) to  
30 September 2015 was 20.0% and the Company was ranked  
at top decile in terms of TSR relative to FTSE 51-150 companies; 
correspondingly 100% of awards of Performance Shares and 
Matching Shares are due to vest in December 2015, subject to 
continued service. Chris Kennedy’s awards lapsed following his 
cessation of employment on 1 September 2015.

Have there been any payments to past Directors? (Audited)
A payment of £20,833 was paid to Professor Rigas Doganis since he retired from the Board on 1 December 2014, for continuing  
to chair the Safety Committee. There have been no other payments made to past Directors during the year.
Have there been any payments for loss of office? (Audited)
No payments for loss of office have been made to Directors during the year. 
Chris Kennedy announced his decision on 8 January 2015 to leave easyJet in order to become Chief Financial Officer of ARM 
Holdings plc. Following his resignation, no payments were made in connection with his notice period following the agreement of  
a mutually convenient leaving date. In line with the Company’s remuneration policy, this was not as a good leaver for incentive  
plan purposes, he was not eligible to receive an annual bonus award in connection with the 2015 financial year and all outstanding 
share awards lapsed on his cessation of employment.

Notes:
Note 1: The number of shares is calculated according to the scheme rules of individual plans based on the middle-market closing share price of the day prior to 
grant. As is usual market practice, the option price for SAYE awards is determined by the Committee in advance of the award by reference to the share price 
following announcement of half year results.
Note 2: For LTIP awards made in March 2011, vesting was based on ROCE (excluding operating leases adjustment) performance for the year to 30 September 
2013. Actual ROCE for the year was 23% and therefore 100% of the awards vested in March 2014.

Note 4: For LTIP awards made in December 2012, 50% of vesting is based on three-year average ROCE (including lease adjustment) performance for the three 
financial years ending 30 September 2015. This was the first award where ROCE calculations included operating leases and this is the basis for all subsequent 
rewards. 50% of vesting is based on relative TSR performance compared to companies ranked FTSE 51-150. Three year average ROCE (including lease 
adjustments) was 20.0% and the Company was ranked at the 94th percentile versus FTSE 51-150 companies in terms of TSR; correspondingly 100% of these 
awards will vest in December 2015. The following targets applied for these awards:

What are the shareholding guidelines for Directors?
The Chief Executive is required to build up a shareholding of 200% of salary and the Chief Financial Officer is required to build  
a shareholding of 175% of salary, to be built up over five years from the adoption of the policy (27 September 2012) or their 
appointment, if later. Until the guideline is met, they are required to retain 50% of net vested shares from the LTIP.
The Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman of the Board, are required to build up a shareholding of 100% of annual  
fees over a period of three years from the adoption of the policy or date of appointment, if later.

Position against dilution limits
easyJet complies with the Principles of Remuneration with regard to dilution limits. These principles require that commitments under 
all of the Company’s share ownership schemes must not exceed 10% of the issued share capital in any rolling 10 year period. The 
requirement for shares under all current share incentive schemes (LTIP, Save As you Earn and Share Incentive Plan) will be satisfied 
with share purchases on the market. The Company’s current position against its dilution limit is therefore under the maximum  
10% limit.
The Company regularly reviews its position against the dilution guidelines and, should there be insufficient headroom within which to 
grant new awards which could be satisfied by issuing new shares, it is the intention of the Company to continue its current practice 
of satisfying such awards with shares purchased on the market. This would include, in relation to the guidance, the 5% in 10 year 
dilution limit which relates to discretionary share plans.
Employee share plan participation
easyJet encourages share ownership throughout the Group by the use of Performance (Free) Shares and Matching Shares within  
a Share Incentive Plan and a Save As You Earn scheme. All staff subject to minimum service were granted shares during the year. 
Executive Directors may also participate in these plans on the same terms as other eligible staff. They are summarised in the 
Corporate Responsibility report on page 34.

its network, regardless of political affiliation. easyJet believes in 
the rights of individuals to engage in the democratic process, 
however easyJet does not make any political donations and 
does not incur any political expenditure.
Dividend
The Directors are recommending an ordinary dividend, with a 
payout ratio of 40% of profit after tax, resulting in a dividend  
of £219 million or 55.2 pence per share. The ordinary dividend  
is subject to shareholder approval at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 11 February 2016.
Appointment and retirement of Directors
Subject to applicable law, a Director may be appointed by an 
ordinary resolution of shareholders in general meeting following 
nomination by the Board or a member (or members) entitled to 
vote at such meeting, or following retirement by rotation if the 
Director chooses to seek re-election at a general meeting. In 
addition, the Directors may appoint a Director to fill a vacancy  
or as an additional Director, provided that the individual retires  
at the next Annual General Meeting. A Director may be removed 
by the Company as provided for by applicable law, in certain 
circumstances set out in the Company’s Articles of Association 
(for example bankruptcy or resignation), or by an ordinary 
resolution of the Company in general meeting. All Directors 
stand for election at the Annual General Meeting following  
their appointment, and stand for re-election on an annual basis.
Powers conferred on the Directors in relation to issuing  
or buying back shares
Subject to applicable law and the Company’s Articles of 
Association the Directors may exercise all powers of the 
Company, including the power to authorise the issue and/or 
market purchase of the Company’s shares (subject to an 
appropriate authority being given to the Directors by shareholders 
in general meeting and any conditions attaching to such 
authority). The shareholders delegated the following powers  
in relation to the issuing or market purchase by the Company  
of its shares at the Company’s 2015 Annual General Meeting: 
• authority to allot equity securities with a nominal value of  
up to approximately 10% of its issued share capital; 
• authority to allot equity securities, without first offering them 
to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings, with  
a nominal value of up to approximately 5% of its issued share 
capital; and
• authority to make market purchases of its own shares, up to  
a maximum of approximately 10% of the Company’s issued 
share capital. 
These standard authorities will expire on 12 May 2016, or at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2016, whichever is 
the earlier. The Directors will seek to renew the authorities at the 
Annual General Meeting in 2016. As at 13 November 2015, none 
of these authorities had been exercised.
During the 2015 financial year, 350,998 ordinary shares in the 
Company were issued for cash to satisfy the exercise of options 
granted under the Company’s Discretionary Share Option 
Scheme before it lapsed in December 2014 (see note 18 to the 
accounts). However, these do not count against the allotment 
authority granted by shareholders in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
The Directors present the Directors’ report, together with the 
audited accounts for the year ended 30 September 2015. The

Directors’ indemnities
Directors’ and officers’ insurance cover has been established for all 
Directors to provide cover against their reasonable actions on behalf 
of the Company. A deed was executed in 2007 indemnifying each 
of the Directors of the Company and/or its subsidiaries as a 
supplement to the directors’ and officers’ insurance cover. The 
indemnities, which constitute a qualifying third party indemnity 
provision as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006, 
were in force during the 2015 financial year and remain in force for 
all current and past Directors of the Company.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they 
have, or may have, interests that conflict with those of easyJet, 
unless that conflict is first authorised by the Board. The 
Company has in place procedures for managing conflicts of 
interest. The Company’s Articles of Association also contain 
provisions to allow the Directors to authorise potential conflicts 
of interest so that a Director is not in breach of his/her duty 
under company law. Should a Director become aware that he/
she has an interest, directly or indirectly, in an existing or 
proposed transaction with easyJet, he/she should notify  
the Board in line with the Company’s Articles of Association. 
Directors have a continuing duty to update any changes to  
their conflicts of interest.
Share capital and rights attaching to shares
Details of the movements in authorised and issued share capital 
during the year are provided in note 17 to the accounts on  
page 108. 
On 30 September 2015 there was a single class of 397,208,133 
ordinary shares of 27 2/7 pence in issue, each with one vote. 
There were no shares held in treasury at that date.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares are set out in its Articles of Association. Holders of 
ordinary shares are entitled, subject to any applicable law  
and the Company’s Articles of Association, to:
• have shareholder documents made available to them, 
including notice of any general meeting;
• attend, speak and exercise voting rights at general meetings, 
either in person or by proxy; and
• participate in any distribution of income or capital.
Voting rights and restrictions on transfer of shares
None of the ordinary shares carry any special rights with regard 
to control of the Company. There are no restrictions on transfers 
of shares other than:
• certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed 
by laws or regulations such as those relating to insider dealing;
• pursuant to the Company’s Share Dealing Code, whereby the 
Directors and designated employees require approval to deal 
in the Company’s shares;
• where a person with an interest in the Company’s shares  
has been served with a disclosure notice and has failed to 
provide the Company with information concerning interests  
in those shares;
• where a proposed transferee of the Company’s shares has 
failed to furnish to the Directors a declaration of nationality 
(together with such evidence as the Directors may require)  
as required by the Company’s Articles of Association; and
• the powers given to the Directors by the Company’s Articles 
of Association to limit the ownership of the Company’s shares 
by non-UK nationals and powers to enforce this limitation 
including the right to force a sale of any affected shares.
There are no restrictions on exercising voting rights save in 
situations where the Company is legally entitled to impose such 
a restriction (for example under the Articles of Association where 
amounts remain unpaid in the shares after request, or the holder 
is otherwise in default of an obligation to the Company).  
The Company is not aware of any arrangements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer  
of securities or voting rights.
Employee share schemes – rights of control
The trustee of the easyJet UK Share Incentive Plan (the Plan) 
will, on receipt of any offer, compromise, arrangement or 
scheme which affects ordinary shares held in the Plan, or  
in relation to any resolutions proposed at a general meeting 
(including the Annual General Meeting), invite participants to 
direct the trustee on the exercise of any voting rights attaching 
to the ordinary shares held by the trustee on their behalf and/or 
direct how the trustee shall act in relation to those ordinary 
shares. The trustee shall take no action in respect of ordinary 
shares for which it has received no direction to vote, or ordinary 
shares which are unallocated. On a poll, the trustee shall vote in 
accordance with directions given by participants. In the absence 
of directions, or on a show of hands, the trustee shall not vote.
The trustee of the easyJet plc Employee Benefit T rust (the 
T rust), which is used to acquire and hold shares in the Company 
for the benefit of employees, including in connection with the 
easyJet Long T erm Incentive Plan, the International Share 
Incentive Plan and Sharesave plans, has the power to vote or not 
vote, at its absolute discretion in respect of any shares in the 
Company held unallocated in the T rust. However, in accordance 
with good practice, the trustee adopts a policy of not voting in 
respect of such shares.
Both the trustees of the easyJet UK Share Incentive Plan and  
the easyJet plc Employee Benefit T rust have a dividend waiver  
in place in respect of shares which are the beneficial property  
of each of the trusts.
Amendment of the Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended  
by a special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders.
Change of control provisions
The Company is party to a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) which 
contains change of control provisions. The effect of a change of 
control would be that unless otherwise agreed by the Company 
and the agent of the lenders:
• a lender would not be obliged to fund a utilisation of  
the facility;
• the commitment of the lenders would be cancelled; and
• all amounts accrued would become immediately due  
and payable. Strategic report Governance Accounts
83 www.easyJet.com
As at 13 November no amounts had been drawn down  
under the RCF .
The Company does not have agreements with any Director  
or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office 
or employment resulting from a change of control on takeover, 
except that provisions of the Company’s share schemes and 
plans may cause options and awards granted to employees 
under such schemes and plans to vest on a takeover.

Independent auditors
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
auditors of the Company will be put to shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Relationship agreement with controlling shareholders
Any person who exercises or controls on their own or together 
with any person with whom they are acting in concert, 30%  
or more of the votes able to be cast on all or substantially  
all matters at general meetings of a company are known as 
‘controlling shareholders’. The Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Listing Rules require companies with controlling shareholders  
to enter into a written and legally binding agreement which is 
intended to ensure that the controlling shareholder complies  
with certain independence provisions. The agreement must 
contain undertakings that:
(a)  transactions and arrangements with the controlling 
shareholder (and/or any of its associates) will be conducted 
at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms;
(b)  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates 
will take any action that would have the effect of preventing 
the listed company from complying with its obligations under 
the Listing Rules; and
(c)  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates 
will propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder 
resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to 
circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.
The Board confirms that, in accordance with the Listing Rules,  
on 14 November 2014, the Company entered into such an 
agreement with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou (easyJet’s founder) and 
easyGroup Holdings Limited, an entity in which Sir Stelios holds  
a beneficial interest and which holds shares in the Company on 
behalf of Sir Stelios (the ‘Relationship Agreement’). Under the 
terms of the Relationship Agreement, Sir Stelios and easyGroup 
Holdings Limited have agreed to procure the compliance of 
Polys and Clelia Haji-Ioannou with the independence obligations 
contained in the Relationship Agreement. Sir Stelios, easyGroup, 
Polys and Clelia Haji-Ioannou together comprise controlling 
shareholders of the Company who have a combined total 
holding of approximately 33.73% of the Company’s voting rights.
The Board confirms that, since the entry into the Relationship 
Agreement on 14 November 2014 until 13 November 2015, being 
the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Annual 
report and accounts:
(i)   the Company has complied with the independence provisions 
included in the Relationship Agreement;
(ii)  so far as the Company is aware, the independence provisions 
included in the Relationship Agreement have been complied 
with by Sir Stelios, easyGroup, and Clelia and Polys Haji-
Ioannou and their associates; and
(iii)  so far as the Company is aware, the procurement obligation 
included in the Relationship Agreement has been complied 
with by Sir Stelios and easyGroup Holdings Limited. 84 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report,  
the Directors’ remuneration report and the accounts in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare accounts for 
each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Company accounts in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union (EU). Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and  
the Company for that period. In preparing these accounts,  
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the accounts; and
• prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it  
is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue  
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s and  
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy  
at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the accounts and the Directors’ 
remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group accounts, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of, amongst other things, the financial and corporate governance 
information provided on the easyJet website (http://corporate.
easyJet.com). Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of accounts may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s and the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
on pages 48 and 49 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group and Company accounts, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group and Company; and
• the Strategic report, included in the annual report, includes  
a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, 
each Director in office at the date the Directors’ report is 
approved, confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have  
taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware  
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
The annual report on pages 1 to 84 was approved by the Board 
of Directors and authorised for issue on 16 November 2015

Our audit approach
Context
The scope of our audit was tailored to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to give an opinion on the accounts 
as a whole, taking into account the geographic and operational structure of the Group, the accounting systems, processes  
and controls, and the industry and regulatory environment in which the Group operates. 
Overview Materiality
Overall Group materiality: £34 million which represents 5% of profit before tax.
Audit scope
•  The Group operates through the Company and its trading subsidiaries; and the Group 
accounts are a consolidation of these entities.
•  The accounting for these entities, along with the Group consolidation, is largely centralised  
in the UK.
•  Our audit scope comprises an audit of the complete financial information of the trading 
subsidiaries and the Company.
Areas of focus
Our areas of focus have not substantively changed from last year and comprised:
• Aircraft maintenance provisions.
• T reasury operations. 
• Accruals and other provisions.
• Goodwill and landing rights impairment assessment.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement in the accounts. In particular, 
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, 
for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that 
are inherently uncertain. 
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there 
was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk  
of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, 
are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also 
set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas 
in order to provide an opinion on the accounts as a whole, and 
any comments we make on the results of our procedures should 
be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks 
identified by our audit. The Audit Committee’s report on those 
matters below that they considered to be significant issues in 
relation to the accounts is set out on page 56.

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Aircraft maintenance provisions
The Group operates aircraft which are owned or held under finance  
or operating lease arrangements. Liabilities for maintenance costs are 
incurred during the term of the lease in respect of aircraft leased under 
operating leases. These arise from legal and contractual obligations 
relating to the condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the lessor.
Maintenance provisions of £205 million for aircraft maintenance 
costs in respect of aircraft leased under operating leases were 
recorded in the accounts at 30 September 2015 (refer to notes  
1 and 16 to the accounts).
At each balance sheet date, the maintenance provision is calculated 
using a model that incorporates a number of variable factors and 
assumptions including: likely utilisation of the aircraft; the expected cost 
of the heavy maintenance check at the time it is expected to occur; 
the condition of the aircraft; and the lifespan of life-limited parts.
We focused on this area because of an inherent level of management 
judgement required in calculating the amount of provision needed as  
a result of the complex and subjective elements around these variable 
factors and assumptions.
We evaluated the maintenance provision model and tested 
the calculations therein. This included assessing the process by 
which the variable factors within the provision were estimated, 
evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions, testing the 
input data and reperforming calculations. We found no 
material exceptions from these procedures.
In particular, we challenged the key assumptions that were 
based on the Group’s internal data, such as business plans and 
maintenance contract terms. We performed sensitivity analysis 
around the key drivers of the model. We also evaluated the 
provision and the key assumptions in the light of actual 
utilisation in the year. We found no material exceptions from 
these assessments and comparisons.
Having ascertained the magnitude of movements in those key 
assumptions, that either individually or collectively would be 
required for the provision to be misstated, we considered the 
likelihood of such movements arising and any impact on the 
overall level of aircraft maintenance provisions recorded in the 
accounts. Our assessment as to likelihood and magnitude did 
not identify any material exceptions.
T reasury operations 
The Group holds significant net funds, comprising cash and money 
market deposits and borrowings through bank loans and finance lease 
obligations. Given the nature of the business, the Group also makes use 
of derivative financial instruments. These derivative financial instruments 
include foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign 
currency risks on transactions denominated in US dollars, euros, Swiss 
francs and South African rand. These transactions primarily affect 
revenue, fuel and aircraft dry leasing costs, and the carrying value of 
owned aircraft. The Group also uses jet fuel forward contracts to hedge 
fuel price risks.
At 30 September 2015, cash and money market deposits amounted  
to £939 million, borrowings were £504 million, derivative financial assets 
amounted to £172 million and derivative financial liabilities were £469 
million. Further details are set out in notes 1, 12, 14, 20, 21 and 22 to  
the accounts.
We focused on these balances because of their materiality to  
the financial position of the Group, the volume of transactions  
passing through the respective accounts and the number of 
counterparties involved.
We evaluated and assessed the processes, procedures and 
controls in respect of the Group’s treasury and other 
management functions which directly impact the relevant 
account balances and transactions. We tested management’s 
year end account reconciliation process. The results of this work 
allowed us to focus on substantiating the year-end positions 
recorded in the accounts. We did not identify any material 
exceptions from this work.
We independently obtained third-party confirmations from 
counterparties of the year end positions. We assessed the 
appropriateness of hedge accounting for the derivative financial 
instruments and tested, using independent data-feeds, the fair 
values being ascribed to those instruments at the year end. 
These procedures did not identify any material exceptions.
We also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in  
the accounts in respect of both non-derivative and derivative 
financial instruments. Based on our work, we considered  
the disclosures to be appropriate.
Accruals and other provisions
The Group records a number of accrual balances and other 
provisions which are specific to the business and its operations.  
At 30 September 2015, the aggregate of all accruals is £310 million 
(refer to notes 1 and 13 to the accounts) and the aggregate of  
all other provisions is £21 million (refer to notes 1 and 16 to the 
accounts). Whilst some accruals and other provisions are easily and 
ordinarily calculated and processed, others contain an element of 
judgement and are more complex in nature, for example customer 
claims in respect of flight delays and cancellations and refunds of  
air passenger duty or similar charges.
We focused on this area because of an inherent level of complexity 
in management estimating certain accruals and other provisions as  
a result of the judgements that need to be made. These types of 
accrual and other provisions were not individually material but may, 
under certain circumstances, be material in the aggregate.
We evaluated the systems, processes and controls in place  
over accrual and other provision balances and also assessed  
key account reconciliation processes. Amongst other testing, 
we sought evidence of post year end cash and other account 
movements which provided evidence as to the validity of  
the accruals and provisions at the year end and we undertook 
analytical procedures over the related income statement  
cost categories. We found no material exceptions from  
these procedures.
We tested and challenged the reasonableness of the key 
assumptions underlying certain accruals and provisions, which 
included passenger claim history and levels, flight disruptions, 
no-show passengers and time periods. We also tested the 
accruals and provisions input data, reperformed calculations 
and performed sensitivity analysis around the key drivers, as  
well as considering the likelihood of material movements to 
such drivers. We found no material exceptions from these tests. Strategic report Governance Accounts

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Goodwill and landing rights impairment assessment 
Goodwill arises from acquisitions in previous years and has an indefinite 
expected useful life. Landing rights (which are an intangible asset)  
are considered by management to have an indefinite useful life as  
they will remain available for use for the foreseeable future.
Goodwill and landing rights are tested for impairment at least annually 
at the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) level. The Group has one CGU, 
being its route network, to which all goodwill and landing rights relate. 
At 30 September 2015, they amounted, in aggregate, to £459 million 
(refer to notes 1 and 8 to the accounts). 
We focused on this assessment as the impairment test involves a 
number of subjective judgements and estimates by management, 
many of which are forward-looking. These estimates include key 
assumptions surrounding the strategic plan through to 2020, fuel 
prices, exchange rates, long-term economic growth rates and  
discount rates.
We evaluated and challenged the future cash flow 
forecasts of the CGU, and the process by which they 
were drawn up, and tested the underlying value in use 
calculations. In doing this, we compared the forecast to 
the latest strategic plan presented to the Board, along 
with comparing prior year budget to actual data, as this 
informed as to the quality of the forecasting process.  
The results of our evaluation proved to be satisfactory.
We also challenged the key assumptions for fuel prices, 
exchange rates and long-term growth rates in the 
forecasts by comparing them to economic and industry 
forecasts; and the discount rate by assessing the cost of 
capital for the Company and comparable organisations. 
We found no material exceptions from these comparisons 
and assessments.
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key 
assumptions above to ascertain the extent of change  
in those assumptions that either individually or collectively 
would be required for the goodwill and landing rights  
to be impaired. We found no material exceptions from  
this analysis.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the accounts as  
a whole, taking into account the geographic and operational 
structure of the Group, the accounting systems, processes and 
controls, and the industry and regulatory environment in which 
the Group operates. 
The Group operates through the Company and its trading 
subsidiary undertakings as set out on page 121 and the Group 
accounts are a consolidation of these entities. The accounting 
for these entities is largely centralised in the UK and our audit 
scope comprises an audit of their complete financial information. 
These procedures gave us the evidence that we needed for  
our opinion on the Group’s accounts as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures on the individual account line 
items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and on the accounts as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality 
for the accounts as a whole as follows:
Overall group 
materiality
£34 million (2014: £29 million).
How we 
determined it
5% of profit before tax.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
We applied this benchmark, a generally accepted 
auditing practice, in the absence of indicators 
that an alternative benchmark would be  
more appropriate.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
them misstatements identified during our audit above £2 million 
(2014: £2 million) as well as misstatements below that amount 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement, set out on page 22, in relation to going concern.  
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are also required to report to you  
if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to  
in relation to the Directors’ statement about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the accounts. We have nothing material to add or  
to draw attention to.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the accounts. The going concern basis 
presumes that the Group and Company have adequate 
resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend 
them to do so, for at least one year from the date the accounts 
were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 88 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015

the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the 
Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our 
audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review. Strategic report Governance Accounts

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE ACCOUNTS  
AND THE AUDIT
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 84, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the accounts and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
accounts in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no 
other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it  
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent  
in writing.
What an audit of accounts involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the accounts sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the accounts are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and
• the overall presentation of the accounts. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the accounts.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain 
audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited accounts and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course  
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

Notes to the accounts

1. Significant accounting policies 
Statement of compliance 
easyJet plc (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘easyJet’ or the ‘Group’ as applicable) is a low-cost airline carrier operating principally in 
Europe. The Company is a public limited company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol EZJ  
and is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its registered office is Hangar 89, London Luton Airport, Luton, 
Bedfordshire, LU2 9PF.  
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union,  
taking into account IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRSIC) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable  
to companies reporting under IFRS.  
Basis of preparation 
The accounts are prepared based on the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative 
financial instruments that are measured at fair value.  
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in these accounts. 
easyJet’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development and performance, are described in the strategic 
report on pages 1 to 45. Principal risks and uncertainties are described on pages 24 to 29. Note 22 to the accounts sets out the Group’s 
objectives, policies and procedures for managing its capital and gives details of the risks related to financial instruments held by the Group. 
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. Details on going concern are provided on page 22. 
Significant judgements, estimates and critical accounting policies 
The preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of income and expenses 
during the reporting period. Although these amounts are based on management’s best estimates of the amount, events or actions may 
mean that actual results ultimately differ from those estimates, and these differences may be material. The estimates and the underlying 
assumptions are reviewed regularly. 
The following three accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies as they require a significant amount of management 
judgement and the results are material to easyJet’s accounts. 
Aircraft maintenance provisions (Note 16) 
easyJet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of aircraft leased under operating leases during the term of the lease. These arise 
from legal and constructive contractual obligations relating to the condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the lessor. To discharge 
these obligations, easyJet will also normally need to carry out one heavy maintenance check on each of the engines and the airframe  
during the lease term.  
A charge is made in the income statement, based on hours or cycles flown, to provide for the cost of these obligations. Estimates required 
include the likely utilisation of the aircraft, the expected cost of the heavy maintenance check at the time it is expected to occur, the 
condition of the aircraft and the lifespan of life-limited parts. 
The bases of all estimates are reviewed annually, and also when information becomes available that is capable of causing a material change 
to an estimate, such as renegotiation of end of lease return conditions, increased or decreased utilisation, or changes in the cost of heavy 
maintenance services. 
Other provisions (Note 16) 
easyJet incurs liabilities for amounts payable to customers who make claims in respect of flight delays and cancellations, and refunds of  
air passenger duty or similar charges. Estimates required include passenger claim history, level of claims made and period of time over  
which claims are made. The bases of all estimates are reviewed at least annually and also when information becomes available that is 
capable of causing a material change to the estimate. 
Goodwill and landing rights (Note 8) 
Goodwill and landing rights are tested for impairment at least annually. easyJet has one cash-generating unit, being its route network.  
In making this assessment, easyJet has considered the manner in which the business is managed including the centralised nature of  
its operations and the ability to open or close routes and redeploy aircraft and crew across the whole route network.  
The value in use of the cash-generating unit is determined by discounting future cashflows to their present value. When applying this 
method, easyJet relies on a number of estimates including its strategic plans, fuel prices, exchange rates, long-term economic growth  
rates for the principal countries in which it operates, and its pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.  96 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015

1. Significant accounting policies continued 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated accounts incorporate those of easyJet plc and its subsidiaries for the years ended 30 September 2014 and 2015. 
A full list of subsidiaries can be found in the notes to the Company accounts on page 121. 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by easyJet. Control is achieved when easyJet is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power, directly or indirectly, over the investee. 
Intragroup balances, transactions and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the 
consolidated accounts. 
Foreign currencies 
The primary economic environment in which a subsidiary operates determines its functional currency. The consolidated accounts of easyJet 
are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest £million, which is the Company’s functional currency and the Group’s presentation 
currency. Certain subsidiaries have operations that are primarily influenced by a currency other than sterling. Exchange differences arising  
on the translation of these foreign operations are taken to shareholders’ equity until all or part of the interest is sold, when the relevant 
portion of the accumulated exchange gains or losses is recognised in the income statement. Profits and losses of foreign operations are 
translated into sterling at average rates of exchange during the year, since this approximates the rates on the dates of the transactions. 
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date  
and (except where the asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge) the gains or losses on translation are included in the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates  
ruling at the dates the transactions were effected. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue comprises seat revenue, being the value of airline services (net of air passenger duty and similar charges, VAT and discounts),  
and non-seat revenue. 
Seat revenue arises from the sale of flight seats, including the provision of checked baggage, allocated seating, administration, credit card 
and change fees. Seat revenue is recognised when the service is provided. This is generally when the flight takes place, but in the following 
cases, this is at the time of booking: 
� administration and credit card fees as they are contractually non-refundable; and 
� change fees as the service provided is that of allowing customers to change bookings. 
Amounts paid by ‘no-show’ customers are recognised as seat revenue when the booked service is provided as such customers are not 
generally entitled to change flights or seek refunds once a flight has departed. 
Unearned revenue represents flight seats, including the provision of checked baggage and allocated seating, sold but not yet flown and  
is held in the statement of financial position until it is realised in the income statement when the service is provided. 
Non-seat revenue arises from commissions earned from services sold on behalf of partners and is recognised when the service is provided. 
This is generally when the related flight takes place. In the case of commission earned from travel insurance, revenue is recognised at the 
time of booking as easyJet acts solely as appointed representative of the insurance company. 
Business combinations  
Business combinations in prior years were accounted for by applying the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed plus any costs directly attributable 
to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.  
There have been no business combinations since the effective date of IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised). 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over easyJet’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. It has an indefinite expected useful life and is tested for impairment  
at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment. 
Landing rights are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. They are considered to have an indefinite useful life as they will 
remain available for use for the foreseeable future provided minimum utilisation requirements are observed, and are tested for impairment 
at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment. 
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation, which is calculated to write off their cost, less estimated residual 
value, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. Expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually.

Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less 
estimated residual value of assets, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. Expected useful lives are reviewed annually. 
 
Expected useful life 
Aircraft 23 years 
Aircraft spares 14 years 
Aircraft – prepaid maintenance 7-10 years 
Leasehold improvements 5-10 years or the length of lease if shorter 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 years or length of lease of property where equipment is used if shorter 
Computer hardware 5 years 
Aircraft held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their expected useful lives, as shown above. 
Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date for equivalently aged 
assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis. The carrying value is reviewed for impairment if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
An element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed on acquisition to prepaid maintenance and is depreciated over a period ranging from 
seven to ten years from the date of manufacture. Subsequent costs incurred which lend enhancement to future periods, such as long-term 
scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft and engines, are capitalised and depreciated over the length of period benefiting 
from these enhancements. All other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
Pre-delivery and option payments made in respect of aircraft are recorded in property, plant and equipment at cost. These amounts are  
not depreciated. 
Gains and losses on disposals (other than aircraft sale and leaseback transactions) are determined by comparing the net proceeds with  
the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment of non-current assets 
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its 
value in use. Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed. Impairment losses recognised on assets other than goodwill are 
only reversed where changes in the estimates used result in an increase in recoverable amount.  
Leases 
easyJet enters into sale and leaseback transactions whereby it sells either new or mid-life aircraft to a third party and immediately leases it 
back under an operating lease. Surpluses arising on disposal, where the price that the aircraft is sold for is above fair value, are recognised  
in deferred income and amortised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. 
In some operating sale and leaseback arrangements, receipt of part of the proceeds is deferred until the end of the lease, the amount of 
which is recorded as deferred consideration within non-current or current assets as appropriate. 
Additionally, in some cases, receipt of part of the sales proceeds due is exchanged for a reduction in future lease rentals, which 
consequently are below market price. As a result, the proceeds received on sale and leaseback are lower than the fair value of the aircraft 
sold. The resulting shortfall is deferred within non-current or current assets as appropriate, and amortised on a straight-line basis in the 
income statement over the expected lease term. 
Non-contingent operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. A number of 
operating leases require easyJet to make contingent rental payments based on variable interest rates; these are expensed as incurred. 
Finance leases, which transfer to easyJet substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are recognised at 
the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Any directly 
attributable costs of entering into financing sale and leasebacks are included in the value of the asset recognised. Lease payments are 
apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are included in interest payable and other financing charges. 
Financial instruments 
Financial instruments are recognised when easyJet becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and 
derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions. 
Where market values are not available, the fair value of financial instruments is calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest 
rates and by applying year end exchange rates. 
Non-derivative financial assets 
Non-derivative financial assets are recorded at amortised cost and include trade receivables and cash and money market deposits. 
Investments in equity instruments are carried at cost where fair value cannot be reliably measured due to significant variability in the  
range of reasonable fair value estimates.  98 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Notes to the accounts continued 
 
98 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015 
1. Significant accounting policies continued 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held in bank accounts with no access restrictions and money market deposits, bank deposits and 
tri-party repos repayable on demand or maturing within three months of inception. Interest income on cash and money market deposits is 
recognised using the effective interest method. Restricted cash comprises cash deposits which have restrictions governing their use and is 
classified as a current or non-current asset based on the estimated remaining length of the restriction. 
Impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has 
been incurred. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of future 
cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
If, subsequently, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event that occurred after 
the impairment was recognised, the appropriate portion of the loss is reversed. Both impairment losses and reversals are recognised in the 
income statement as components of net finance charges. 
Non-derivative financial liabilities 
Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised 
cost, and include trade and other payables, borrowings and provisions. Interest expense on borrowings is recognised using the effective 
interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the balance sheet date. 
Derivative financial instruments and cash flow hedging 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. Hedge accounting is applied to those derivative financial instruments that are 
designated as cash flow hedges. 
easyJet uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency risks on transactions denominated in US dollars, 
Euros, Swiss francs and South African rand. These transactions primarily affect revenue, fuel, aircraft dry leasing costs, and the carrying 
value of owned aircraft. easyJet uses jet fuel forward contracts to hedge fuel price risks. 
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
deferred in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are determined to be effective. All other changes in fair value are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.  
When the hedged forecast transaction relates to an item of property, plant and equipment, the relevant accumulated gains and losses are 
transferred from the hedging reserve and included in the initial carrying amount of that purchased asset. Otherwise they are recognised in 
the income statement in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects the income statement. 
In the event that a hedged forecast transaction is no longer considered highly probable, any related gains and losses are immediately 
transferred from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is derecognised (e.g. through expiry or disposal), or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. Where the hedged item remains a highly probable forecast transaction, the related gains and losses remain deferred in 
the hedging reserve until the transaction takes place. 
Financial guarantees 
If a claim on a financial guarantee given to a third party becomes probable, the obligation is recognised at fair value. For subsequent 
measurement, the carrying amount is the higher of initial measurement and best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the reporting date. 
Tax 
Tax expense in the income statement consists of current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except when it 
relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income or shareholders’ equity, in which case it is recognised in other 
comprehensive income or shareholders’ equity. The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for income that  
is exempt and expenses that are not deductible using tax rates that are applicable to the taxable income.  
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences relating to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, where it is probable that  
the recovery or settlement will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future, with the following exceptions: 
� where the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable income nor accounting profit; and 
� deferred tax arising on investments in subsidiaries is not recognised where easyJet is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities 
are expected to take place, based on tax rates or laws enacted or substantively enacted at the date of the statement of financial position. 
Deferred tax assets represent amounts recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, losses and tax credits 
carried forwards. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which 
they can be deducted.   Strategic report Governance Accounts
99 www.easyJet.com
 
 
 www.easyJet.com 99 
Deferred tax liabilities represent the amount of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis. 
Aircraft maintenance provisions 
The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned and finance-leased aircraft is 
described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment. 
easyJet has contractual obligations to maintain aircraft held under operating leases. Provisions are created over the term of the lease based 
on the estimated future costs of major airframe checks, engine shop visits and end of lease liabilities. These costs are discounted to present 
value where the amount of the discount is considered material. 
Where an aircraft is sold and leased back, other than when first delivered to easyJet, a liability to undertake future maintenance activities, 
resulting from past flying activity, arises at the point the lease agreement is signed. This liability is treated as part of the surplus or shortfall 
arising on the sale and leaseback, the accounting treatment of which is described in the leases accounting policy. 
A number of leases also require easyJet to pay recoverable supplemental rent to the lessor. The purpose of these payments is to provide 
the lessor with collateral should an aircraft be returned in a condition that does not meet the requirements of the lease. This recoverable 
supplemental rent is included in trade and other receivables within current assets and other non-current assets, as applicable, and is 
refunded when qualifying heavy maintenance is performed, or is offset against the costs incurred at the end of the lease. 
Employee benefits 
easyJet contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of employees. easyJet has no further payment obligations 
once the contributions have been paid. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of easyJet in independently administered 
funds. easyJet’s contributions are charged to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred. 
The expected cost of compensated holidays is recognised at the time that the related employees’ services are provided. 
Share capital and dividend distribution 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.  
Where any Group company or employee benefit trust purchases the Company’s equity shares, the consideration paid and any directly 
attributable incremental costs are deducted from retained earnings until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Proceeds from re-issue are 
shown as a credit to retained earnings. 
easyJet settles share awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan, the Save As You Earn scheme and the Share Incentive Plans by 
purchasing its own shares on the market through employee benefit trusts. The cost of such purchases is deducted from retained earnings 
in the period that the transaction occurs. 
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders. 
Share-based payments 
easyJet has a number of equity-settled share incentive schemes. The fair value of share options granted under the Save As You Earn 
scheme is measured at the date of grant using the Binomial Lattice option pricing model. The fair value of grants under the Long Term 
Incentive Plan is measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model for awards based on ROCE performance targets, and the 
Stochastic model (also known as the Monte Carlo model) for awards based on TSR performance targets. The fair value of all other awards 
is the share price at the date of grant. 
The fair value of the estimated number of options and awards that are expected to vest is expensed to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period that employees’ services are rendered, with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity. Where non-
market performance criteria (such as ROCE) attached to the share options and awards are not met, any cumulative expense previously 
recognised is reversed. For awards with market-related performance criteria (such as TSR), an expense is recognised irrespective of whether 
the market condition is satisfied. 
The social security obligations payable in connection with grant of the share options are an integral part of the grant itself and the charge is 
treated as a cash-settled transaction. 
Segmental disclosures 
easyJet has one operating segment, being its route network, based on management information provided to the Executive Management 
Team, which is easyJet’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. Resource allocation decisions are made for the benefit of the route network as a 
whole, rather than for individual routes within the network. Performance of the network is assessed based on the consolidated profit or loss 
before tax for the year. 
Revenue is allocated to geographic segments on the following bases: 
� revenue earned from passengers is allocated according to the location of the first departure airport on each booking; and 
� commission revenue earned from partners is allocated according to the domicile of each partner.

It is estimated that deferred tax assets of approximately £50 million (2014: deferred tax assets of £24 million) will reverse during the  
next financial year. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority. As a result the net  
UK deferred tax liability is £176 million (2014: £194 million). The net overseas deferred tax asset is £nil (2014: £8 million). 
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be payable in  
the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of easyJet. 
6. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of shares in issue during 
the year after adjusting for shares held in employee benefit trusts. 
To calculate diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential shares. Share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary 
shares during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares. Where share options are exercisable based on performance criteria and 
those performance criteria have been met during the year, these options are included in the calculation of dilutive potential shares. 
Earnings per share is based on:

£ million

Profit for the year  548  450

7. Dividends 
An ordinary dividend in respect of the year ended 30 September 2015 of 55.2 pence per share, or £219 million, is to be proposed at  
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. These accounts do not reflect this proposed dividend. 
An ordinary dividend of 45.4 pence per share, or £180 million, in respect of the year ended 30 September 2014 was paid in the year ended 
30 September 2015. An ordinary dividend of 33.5 pence per share, or £133 million, and a special dividend of 44.1 pence per share, or  
£175 million, in respect of the year ended 30 September 2013 were both paid in the year ended 30 September 2014.

easyJet has one cash-generating unit, being its route network. The recoverable amount of goodwill and other assets with indefinite 
expected useful lives has been determined based on value in use calculations of the route network. 
Pre-tax cash flow projections have been derived from the strategic plan presented to the Board for the period up to 2020, using  
the following key assumptions: 
Pre-tax discount rate (derived from weighted average cost of capital) 12%
Fuel price (US dollars per metric tonne) 650 – 1,000
Exchange rates: 
US dollar 1.50
Euro 1.30
Swiss franc 1.40
 
   Strategic report Governance Accounts
105 www.easyJet.com
 
 
 www.easyJet.com 105 
Both fuel price and exchange rates are volatile in nature, and the assumptions used represent management’s view of reasonable average 
rates. Operating margins are sensitive to significant changes in these rates. 
Cash flow projections beyond the forecast period have been extrapolated using growth rate scenarios ranging from zero up to an 
estimated average of long-term economic growth rates for the principal countries in which easyJet operates. No impairment resulted  
from any of these scenarios. 
No reasonably possible combination of changes to the key assumptions above would result in the carrying value of the cash-generating  
unit exceeding its recoverable amount.

The net book value of aircraft includes £275 million (2014: £322 million) relating to advance and option payments for future deliveries.  
This amount is not depreciated. 
Aircraft with a net book value of £583 million (2014: £597 million) are mortgaged to lenders as loan security. 
Aircraft with a net book value of £149 million (2014: £142 million) are held under finance leases. 
easyJet is contractually committed to the acquisition of 150 (2014: 170) Airbus A320 family aircraft, with a total list price of US$13.0 billion 
(2014: US$14.6 billion) before escalations and discounts for delivery in 2016 (20 aircraft), between 2017 and 2018 (30 aircraft) and between 
2017 and 2022 (100 new generation aircraft).  
On 16 November 2015, easyJet secured an agreement with Airbus to take delivery of an additional 36 aircraft (of which 30 are new 
generation) with a total list price of $3.2 billion, based on January 2012 list prices.

obligations will not be met. Amounts due from trade receivables are short-term in nature and largely comprise credit card receivables due 
from financial institutions with credit ratings of at least A and, accordingly, the possibility of significant default is considered to be unlikely.

Bank loans, which bear interest at variable rates linked to LIBOR, were drawn down to finance the acquisition of aircraft that have been 
mortgaged to the lender to provide security. None of the agreements contain financial covenants required to be met. 
Finance lease obligations relate to aircraft and bear interest partly at fixed rates and partly at variable rates linked to LIBOR. 
The maturity profile of borrowings is set out in note 22. 
On 10 February 2015 easyJet signed a $500 million revolving credit facility with a minimum five-year term. As at 16 November 2015 no amounts 
had been drawn down under this facility.

Save As You Earn scheme  2.3 
Discretionary schemes 
All awards have a three year vesting period and performance conditions based on growth in earnings per share. All options expired this year, 
ten years after grant. 
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The plan is open, by invitation, to Executive Directors and senior management, and provides for annual awards of Performance Shares 
worth up to 250% (200% up to 31 December 2014) of salary each year and matching shares linked to the investment of up to 50% of 
annual bonus in easyJet shares. Matching Share Awards will no longer operate for Executive Directors from the 2016 financial year onwards 
and LTIP awards will be made as Performance shares only. For awards granted in the 2015 financial year, the vesting of these shares is 
dependent on return on capital employed (ROCE) targets and total shareholder return (TSR) targets compared to FTSE 31-130 ranked 
companies at the start of the performance period. For awards made prior to the 2015 financial year, the vesting of these shares is 
dependent on return on capital employed (ROCE) targets and a positive total shareholder return (TSR) compared to FTSE 51-150  
companies performance conditions measured over the three financial years ended 30 September 2015. 
Save As You Earn scheme 
The scheme is open to all employees on the UK payroll. Participants may elect to save up to £500 per month (2014: £350 per month) 
under a three year savings contract. An option is granted by the Company to buy shares at a discount of 20% from market price at  
the time of the grant. At the end of the savings period the option becomes exercisable for a period of six months.  
Employees who are not paid through the UK payroll may save under similar terms and conditions, albeit without the same tax benefits. 
Share Incentive Plans 
The plan is open to all employees on the UK payroll. Participants may invest up to £1,800 (2014: £1,800) of their pre-tax salary each year  
to purchase partnership shares in easyJet. For each partnership share acquired easyJet purchases a matching share up to a maximum 
value of £1,500 per annum. Employees must remain with easyJet for three years from the date of purchase of each partnership share in 
order to qualify for the matching share, and for five years for the shares to be transferred to them tax free. The employee is entitled to 
dividends and to vote at shareholder meetings.  
Subject to Company performance, easyJet also issues free shares under a new approved share incentive plan of up to £3,000 in value. 
There is a similar unapproved scheme for international employees.

The fair value of grants under the Save As You Earn scheme are calculated by applying the Binomial Lattice option pricing model. The fair 
value of grants under the TSR based Long Term Incentive Plan is estimated under the Stochastic model (also known as the Monte Carlo 
model). The fair value of grants under all other schemes is the share price on the date of grant. The following assumptions are used:

Share price is the closing share price from the last working day prior to the date of grant.  
Exercise price for the Save As You Earn scheme is set at a 20% discount from the share price at grant date. 
Expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period comparable to the expected life of each type of option. 
Levels of early exercises and forfeitures are estimated using historical averages. 
The weighted average fair value of matching shares granted under the Share Incentive Plan during the year was £16.69 (2014: £14.61). 
For grants under the Save As You Earn scheme scheme after 30 September 2011, the dividend yield assumption is calculated based on  
the actual yield at the date the options are granted. For the options granted in 2012 to 2014, the dividend yield assumption was 2% and  
this increased to 2.75% in 2015.

For the financial instruments for which fair value is disclosed in the tables above, the fair value is classified as level 2 of the IFRS13 ‘Fair Value 
Measurement’ fair value hierarchy. Level 2 is defined as being the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market 
(for example, over-the-counter derivatives) and which are determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable 
market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are 
observable, the instrument is classified as level 2. 
Amounts disclosed in the ‘Other’ column are items that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument. They are disclosed to facilitate 
reconciliation of the carrying values of financial instruments to line items presented in the statement of financial position.  112 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015

21. Financial instruments continued 
Fair value calculation methodology 
Derivative financial instruments are forward contracts that are valued based on market rates and market-accepted models. Fair value for 
financial instruments held at amortised cost has been estimated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year 
end exchange rates.

The hedged transactions are expected to occur on various dates mainly within the next two years. Accumulated gains and losses deferred 
in the hedging reserve will be recognised in the income statement in the periods that the hedged transaction affects the income statement. 
This will generally be within two years of the end of the reporting period save where the gain or loss is included in the initial amount 
recognised for the purchase of aircraft in which case recognition will be over a period of up to 23 years in the form of depreciation of  
the purchased asset.

22. Financial risk and capital management 
easyJet is exposed to financial risks including fluctuations in exchange rates, jet fuel prices and interest rates. Financial risk management 
aims to limit these market risks with selected derivative hedging instruments being used for this purpose. easyJet policy is not to trade in 
derivatives but to use the instruments to hedge anticipated exposure. As such, easyJet is not exposed to market risk by using derivatives  
as any gains and losses arising are offset by the outcome of the underlying exposure being hedged. In addition to market risks, easyJet is 
exposed to credit and liquidity risk. 
The Board is responsible for setting financial risk and capital management policies and objectives which are implemented by the treasury 
function on a day-to-day basis. The policy outlines the approach to risk management and also states the instruments and time periods 
which the treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks. The policy is regularly reviewed to ensure best practice,  
however there have been no significant changes during the current year. 
Capital employed 
Capital employed comprises shareholders’ equity, borrowings, cash and money market deposits (excluding restricted cash) and an 
adjustment for the capital implicit in aircraft operating lease arrangements. The adjustment is calculated by multiplying the annual charge  
for aircraft dry leasing by a factor of seven. 
Normalised operating profit is adjusted for the implied interest incorporated in the charge for aircraft dry leasing. 
Consequently, the capital employed at the end of the current and prior year and the return earned during those years were as follows: 
   
2015 
£ million  
2014 
£ million
Shareholders’ equity   2,249  2,172
Borrowings   504  563
Cash and money market deposits (excluding restricted cash)   (939) (985)
Reported capital employed  1,814  1,750
Operating leases adjustment  798  868
Capital employed including operating leases adjustment  2,612  2,618
    
Operating profit – reported  688  581
Implied interest in operating lease costs  38  41
Operating profit – adjusted  726  622
Operating profit after tax – adjusted   581  491
     
Return on capital employed    22.2%  20.5%
Return on capital employed is calculated by dividing the adjusted operating profit after tax by the average of the opening and closing 
capital employed, including the operating leases adjustment.  
The percentage of operating leased aircraft at 30 September 2015 was 28% (2014: 32%).  
Capital management 
The objective of capital management is to ensure that easyJet is able to continue as a going concern whilst delivering shareholder 
expectations of a strong capital base as well as returning benefits for other stakeholders. 
easyJet manages its capital structure in response to changes in both economic conditions and strategic objectives. The cash and net debt 
position, together with the maturity profile of existing debt, is monitored to ensure the continuity of funding.  
The principal measure used by easyJet to manage capital risk is the gearing ratio of debt to capital employed. Debt is defined as reported 
net debt plus seven times aircraft operating lease payments, less cash (including money market deposits but excluding restricted cash). 
Capital employed is defined as shareholders’ equity plus debt as previously defined. Gearing has decreased to 14% (2014: 17%). 
Liquidity risk management 
The objective of easyJet’s liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient cash resources and the availability of funding as required. easyJet 
holds financial assets either for which there is a liquid market or which are expected to generate cash inflows that are available to meet 
liquidity needs.  
easyJet continues to hold significant cash and liquid funds to mitigate the impact of potential business disruption events as well as a $500m 
revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility was agreed during the year ended 30 September 2015, for a minimum of five years, and 
was undrawn at 30 September 2015. easyJet has a target minimum liquidity requirement of £4 million per aircraft in the fleet. This requires 
the revolving credit facility to be taken into consideration in assessing this liquidity metric. Total cash (excluding restricted cash) and money 
market deposits at 30 September 2015 was £939 million (2014: £985 million).  
Surplus funds are invested in high quality short-term liquid instruments, usually money market funds, bank deposits or tri-party repos.  114 easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2015

The maturity profile has been calculated based on spot rates for the US dollar, Euro, Swiss franc, South African rand and jet fuel at close  
of business on 30 September each year. 
Credit risk management 
easyJet is exposed to credit risk arising from cash and money market deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade and other 
receivables. Credit risk management aims to reduce the risk of default by setting limits on credit exposure to counterparties based on their 
respective credit ratings. Credit ratings also determine the maximum period of investment when placing funds on deposit. Credit risk is 
limited to the carrying amount in the statement of financial position at each year end.  
Counterparties for cash investments, currency forward contracts and jet fuel forward contracts are required to have a credit rating of A- or 
better at contract inception. Exposures to those counterparties are regularly reviewed and, when the market view of a counterparty’s credit 
quality changes, adjusted as considered appropriate. Accordingly, in normal market conditions, the probability of material loss due to non-
performance by counterparties is considered to be low.  
Disclosure relating to the credit quality of trade and other receivables is given in note 11 to the accounts. 
Foreign currency risk management 
The principal exposure to currency exchange rates arises from fluctuations in the US dollar, Euro and Swiss franc exchange rates which can 
significantly impact easyJet’s results, cash flows or financial position. The aim of foreign currency risk management is to reduce the impact 
of these fluctuations.  
Significant exposure in the income statement is managed through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts where, in line 
with board approved policy, between 65% – 85% of the next 12 months’ forecast surplus which is hedged on a rolling basis, and 45% – 65% 
of the following 12 months forecast surplus which is hedged on a rolling basis. 
Significant exposure relating to the acquisition cost of aircraft is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward exchange 
contracts where 90% of the next two years forecast requirement is hedged. In addition, easyJet has substantial borrowings and other 
liabilities denominated in US dollars, which are largely offset by holding US dollar cash and money market deposits. 
Financing and interest rate risk management 
Interest rate cash flow risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash investments. 
Interest rate risk management policy aims to provide certainty in a proportion of financing while retaining the opportunity to benefit from 
interest rate reductions. All borrowings are at floating interest rates repricing every three to six months. A significant proportion of US dollar 
loans by value are matched with US dollar cash. Operating leases are a mix of fixed and floating rates. Of the 67 operating leases in place  
at 30 September 2015 (2014: 72), 75% were based on fixed interest rates and 25% were based on floating interest rates (2014: 71% fixed, 
29% floating).  
All debt is asset related, reflecting the capital intensive nature of the airline industry and the attractiveness of aircraft as security to lenders. 
These factors are also reflected in the medium-term profile of easyJet’s borrowings and operating leases. At 30 September 2015, the 
Company had 114 (2014: 94) unencumbered aircraft.  
Fuel price risk management 
easyJet is exposed to fuel price risk. The objective of the fuel price risk management policy is to provide protection against sudden and 
significant increases in jet fuel prices, thus mitigating volatility in the income statement in the short-term. In order to manage the risk 
exposure, forward contracts are used in line with Board approved policy to hedge between 65% and 85% of estimated exposures up to  
12 months in advance which is hedged on a rolling basis, and to hedge between 45% and 65% of estimated exposures from 13 up to  
24 months in advance which is hedged on a rolling basis. In exceptional market conditions, the Board may accelerate or limit the 
implementation of the hedging policy.  Strategic report Governance Accounts

Market risk sensitivity analysis 
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, money market deposits, trade and other receivables, trade and other 
payables and derivative financial instruments. The following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in 
relevant foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices. It should be noted that the analysis reflects the impact on profit or loss after 
tax for the year and other comprehensive income on financial instruments held at the reporting date. It does not reflect changes in revenue 
or costs that may result from changing currency rates, interest rates or fuel prices. Sensitivity is calculated based on all other variables 
remaining constant. The analysis is considered representative of easyJet’s exposure over the 12 month period. 
The currency sensitivity analysis is based on easyJet’s foreign currency financial instruments held at each statement of financial position 
date taking into account forward exchange contracts that offset effects from changes in currency exchange rates.  
The interest rate analysis assumes a 1% change in interest rates over the reporting year applied to end of year financial instruments. 
The fuel price sensitivity analysis is based on easyJet’s fuel related derivative financial instruments held at the end of each reporting period.  
The impact of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% increase in the fuel price is disclosed. A corresponding decrease results in an equal 
and opposite impact on the income statement and other comprehensive income in both reporting periods. 
Sensitivities are calculated based on a reasonably possible change in the rate applied to the value of financial instruments held at each

24. Contingent liabilities 
easyJet is involved in a number of disputes and litigation which arose in the normal course of business. The likely outcome of these disputes 
and litigation cannot be predicted, and in complex cases reliable estimates of any potential obligation may not be possible. 
Having reviewed the information currently available, management considers that the ultimate resolution of these disputes and litigation  
is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on easyJet’s results, cash flows or financial position. 
At 30 September 2015 easyJet had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds totalling £44 million (2014: £39 million), of  
which £33 million (2014: £34 million) expires within one year. The fair value of these instruments at each year end was negligible. 
No amount is recognised on the statement of financial position in respect of any of these financial instruments as it is not probable  
that there will be an outflow of resources.

Southern Europe comprises countries lying wholly or mainly south of the border between Italy and Switzerland, plus France.  
easyJet’s non-current assets principally comprise its fleet of 163 owned and 11 finance leased aircraft. A further 67 aircraft are held under 
operating leases, giving a total fleet of 241 at 30 September 2015 (2014: 226). All of these aircraft are registered in the United Kingdom 
except for 24 (2014: 23) registered in Switzerland. These assets are used flexibly across the entire route network, and accordingly there  
is no suitable basis for allocating them to geographic segments.

26. Related party transactions 
The Company licenses the easyJet brand from easyGroup Limited (‘easyGroup’), a wholly owned subsidiary of easyGroup Holdings Limited, 
an entity in which easyJet’s founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, holds a beneficial controlling interest. The Haji-Ioannou family concert party 
shareholding (being easyGroup Holdings Limited and Polys Holding Limited) holds, in total, 33.73% of the issued share capital of easyJet plc 
as at 30 September 2015. 
Under the Amended Brand Licence signed in October 2010 and approved by the shareholders of easyJet plc in December 2010, an  
annual royalty of 0.25% of total revenue is payable by easyJet to easyGroup for a minimum term of 10 years. The full term of agreement  
is 50 years. 
easyJet and easyGroup established a fund to meet the annual costs of protecting the ‘easy’ (and related marks) and the ‘easyJet’ brands. 
easyJet contributes up to £1 million per annum to this fund and easyGroup contributes up to £100,000 per annum. Beyond the first £1.1 
million of costs, easyJet can commit up to an aggregate £5.5 million annually to meet brand protection costs, with easyGroup continuing  
to meet its share of costs on a 10:1 ratio. easyJet must meet 100% of any brand protection costs it wishes to incur above this limit. 
A separate agreement was entered with Sir Stelios (‘the Comfort Letter’), dated 9 October 2010, under which, in return for certain non-
compete obligations, easyJet made payment of a fee of £300,000, adjusted annually per the UK Retail Price index, each year for five years 
(or until the expiry of the longest subsisting restriction, whichever is later). All of the obligations in the Comfort Letter have now expired and 
no further payments will be made under it.  
The amounts included in the income statement for these items were as follows:

a) Significant accounting policies 
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Company accounts are the same as those set out in note 1 to  
the consolidated accounts with the addition of the following. 
Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment. Where subsidiary undertakings incur charges for share-
based payments in respect of share options and awards granted by the Company, a capital contribution in the same amount is recognised 
as an investment in subsidiary undertakings with a corresponding credit to shareholders’ equity. 
b) Income statement and statement of total comprehensive income 
In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income 
statement and statement of comprehensive income. The Company’s profit for the year was £221 million (2014: £667 million). Included in this 
amount are cash dividends received of £199 million (2014: £650 million – in-specie), which are recognised when the right to receive payment 
is established. The Company recognised no other income or expenses in either the current or prior year, other than the profit for each year. 
The Company has eight employees at 30 September 2015 (2014: ten). These are the Non-Executive Directors of easyJet plc; their 
remuneration is paid by easyJet Airline Company Limited. The Executive Directors of easyJet plc are employed and paid by easyJet Airline 
Company Limited. Details of Directors’ remuneration are disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated accounts and in the Directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 64 to 80.

Switzerland S.A. is  a subsidiary on the basis that the Company exercises a dominant influence over the undertaking. A non-controlling 
interest has not been reflected in the consolidated accounts on the basis that holders of the remaining 51% of the shares have no 
entitlement to any dividends from that holding and the Company has an option to acquire those shares for a predetermined  
minimal consideration.

No amount is recognised on the Company statement of financial position in respect to any of these guarantees as it is not probable that 
there will be an outflow of resources

length basis. Outstanding balances are placed on intercompany accounts with no specified credit period, are unsecured, and bear market 
rates of interest.

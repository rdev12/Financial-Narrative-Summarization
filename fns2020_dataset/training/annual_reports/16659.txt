c eramics and electronics divisions and net sales value for 
the precious metals division
Free cash flow is used to assess the underlying  
cash generation of the Group
One of the factors driving the generation of free cash 
flow is the average working capital to sales ratio, which 
indicates the level of working capital used in the business
used to assess the underlying financial performance and 
earnings capacity of the Group as a whole
used to assess the underlying trading performance of 
Group businesses
Both ratios are used to assess the financial position of the 
Group and its ability to fund future growth

CHAIRmAN’S STATEmENT
JeFF HARRis
“I have been consistently impressed with the calibre and commitment of my 
colleagues throughout the organisation and the quality of our operations 
and customer relationships.”
i was very pleased to be asked to succeed Bob Beeston 
as chairman, following the Annual General meeting in 
may last year. i judged that cookson was a company 
with great prospects and i am delighted to see that this 
is now being demonstrated.
A number of factors have changed during the last 
twelve months. Our end-markets have improved 
from the unprecedented recession of 2008/09, 
although there is still further recovery to be seen. 
Our performance has improved as a result of firm 
management actions to lower our cost base, expansion 
in the higher growth, emerging markets and focus on 
product innovation. those actions will continue. Our 
prospects are improved as we benefit from strong 
market positions in recovering economies. Our share 
price performance has been encouraging with an 
increase of more than 50% during 2010.
t hese improvements have led to the Group reporting 
record levels of revenue (£2.55bn) and headline 
profit before tax (£222m); our employee numbers are 
gradually increasing as we recruit to meet increasing 
demand; and we are now recommending a return to 
dividend payments to our shareholders.
i am confident that the Group can continue to deliver 
further improvements in performance, as reflected by 
the three-year targets announced in January 2011 and 
detailed in the chief executive’s s tatement.
INITIAL ImPRESSIONS
Following my appointment in may, i have travelled 
extensively to visit cookson facilities in the Americas, 
europe and Asia. i have been consistently impressed 
with the calibre and commitment of my colleagues 
throughout the organisation and the quality of our 
operations and customer relationships. this was 
exemplified by our operations in china, which is now 
our largest country in terms of employees and earnings 
and where we have excellent, modern facilities with 
further new factories currently under construction to 
meet the strong market growth.
in terms of the functioning of the Board and its 
committees, i have been reassured to see the strong 
commitment to high standards of governance, a 
focused approach to risk management and a genuine 
attention to corporate social responsibility and, in 
particular, health and safety.
i also held meetings with our main institutional 
shareholders to hear their views on our business, 
management, governance and strategy. i am pleased to 
report that the feedback was both positive and supportive. 
FINANCIAL PERFORmANCE
Revenue of £2.55bn was 30% higher than that reported 
in 2009. Headline profit before tax nearly trebled to 
£222.1m and headline earnings per share more than 
trebled to 61.5p. Overall, post-exceptional items, we 
reported a profit for the year of £150.9m compared 
with a loss of £44.7m reported for 2009. net debt at  
31 December 2010 stood at £330m, a reduction of 
£41m from a year earlier.
DIVIDEND AND DIVIDEND POLICY
no interim dividend was paid during the year and the 
last dividend paid was an interim dividend of 8.8p 
in October 2008. As a consequence of the Group’s 
improved financial position and prospects, the Board 
is now recommending to shareholders a final dividend 
payment in respect of 2010 of 11.5p per ordinary share. 
As part of its three-year Group performance targets, 
the Board is targeting growing dividends from this 
base at least in line with the growth in earnings, with 
the next payment expected to be an interim dividend 
in October 2011.
BOARD AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
the Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
strategy and monitoring its performance. in February 
2010, the Board was strengthened with the appointment 
of two additional members: peter Hill as a non-executive 
Director and François Wanecq, chief executive Officer of 
our c eramics division, as an executive Director.
Barry perry, who has been a non-executive Director 
since 2002, has decided not to stand for re-election at 
the next AGm and will therefore resign from the Board 
in may 2011. i would like to thank Barry for his valuable 
insight and the outstanding contribution he has made 
over the past nine years.
OUTLOOK
c onfidence in the sustainability of the global economic 
recovery is increasing and fears of a “double-dip” 
receding. i therefore expect the Group’s performance 
in 2011 will be well ahead of 2010. 04

CHIEF ExECUTIVE’S STATEmENT
nicK sALmOn
t he Group’s performance improved very significantly 
in 2010. this is the result of the actions taken to 
radically restructure in late 2008 and the first half of 
2009, coupled with the continued market penetration 
of newly-developed products and the further 
expansion of our presence in emerging markets, 
which positioned our businesses favourably to benefit 
from the continued recovery in our end-markets. We 
see considerable potential for further improvement 
and in January 2011 we announced new three-year 
performance targets, setting out our ambitions and 
strategy for further strong progress.
TRADING PERFORmANCE
Group revenue of £2,546m was 30% higher than 2009 
as reported, and 23% higher on an underlying basis, 
that is to say at constant currency and eliminating 
the impact of passing through significantly higher 
commodity metals prices (tin, silver and gold). t rading 
profit of £252.1m was £140.4m (126%) higher than 
that reported for 2009 and the return on sales margin 
improved strongly to 9.9% (2009: 5.7%). the Group’s 
end-markets have continued to recover from the 
impact of the global economic crisis but generally 
remain below the levels experienced in the first half of 
2008 prior to the crisis. 
t he ceramics division’s revenue of £1,495m was 32% 
higher than that reported in 2009 and up 27% on an 
underlying basis. the global steel production end-
market accounts for almost 60% of the division’s 
revenue. According to the World steel Association, 
global steel production in 2010 was 15% higher than 
in 2009 and, excluding china, the rest of the world 
showed an increase of 20%. t he division’s steel-related 
businesses, steel Flow control and Linings, reported 
revenue for the year of, respectively, £494m and 
£486m, underlying increases of 32% and 19% on the 
prior year and approaching 2008 levels, indicating 
continued market share gains. the recovery in the 
division’s other main end-market, foundry castings, 
gained momentum through the year. Accordingly, 
the Foundry product line’s revenue of £440m was up 
33% on 2009 but was still some 17% below 2008 on an 
underlying basis. Lastly, the Fused silica product line’s 
revenue of £75m was up an underlying 29% on prior 
year, reflecting the strong recovery in the photovoltaic 
wafer production end-market. in total, the division’s 
trading profit of £177.4m was £106.5m (150%) higher 
than the prior year, and the return on sales margin was 
11.9% (2009: 6.3%).
the electronics division’s revenue of £721m was 36% 
higher than 2009, as reported. in part, this increase was 
due to the pass through of higher tin and silver commodity 
prices in our solder product sales and higher gold prices 
in our plating chemicals sales, which had the effect of 
increasing revenue by about £84m compared with the 
prior year when commodity prices were considerably 
lower. On an underlying basis, revenue increased by 18%, 
reflecting the continued strong recovery in electronics 
end-markets, particularly in the high-end consumer 
segment, and continuing market penetration of new, 
higher margin, products. the division’s trading profit of 
£71.0m was £31.8m (81%) higher than the prior year and 
the return on sales margin was 9.8% (2009: 7.4%). the 
effect on revenue of passing through higher commodity 
metals prices than those prevailing in 2009 reduced the 
reported margin by about 1.3 percentage points.
the precious metals division’s net sales value (being 
revenue excluding the precious metals content) of 
£134m was broadly unchanged from the prior year. 
Weak retail markets continued to be offset by strong 
levels of reclaim business in europe and gold and 
silver coin blank sales to the us m int. trading profit of 
£12.7m was £3.8m (43%) higher than the prior year, 
reflecting the full year benefits of the restructuring 
completed in the first half of 2009 and improved sales 
mix with higher levels of reclaim and coins.
ExCEPTIONAL ITEmS
A net charge, pre-tax, of £32.7m was incurred, principally 
due to restructuring charges (£17.3m) and amortisation 
of intangible assets (£17.7m), partially offset by a gain 
relating to the closure of the uK defined benefit pension 
plan to future benefit accrual (£4.7m). the equivalent 
charge in 2009 was £96.6m, reflecting the major cost 
reduction/restructuring programme implemented in 
the face of the economic crisis.
TAxATION
the headline effective tax rate for 2010 was 21.1%, a 
significant improvement on the 2009 rate of 35.2%. 
t his improvement reflects the return to a more normal 
geographic distribution of profitability, combined 
with the benefit of a number of non-recurring credits 
recognised in the year. these credits related to the 
recognition of some previously unrecorded tax losses 
combined with a number of adjustments arising from 
the finalisation of prior year tax liabilities. t he underlying 
tax rate for 2010, excluding the benefit of these non-
recurring credits, was around 24%. An underlying tax 
rate of between 23% and 24% is anticipated for 2011 
and 2012.
“We see considerable potential for further improvement and in January 2011
we announced new three-year performance targets, setting out our ambitions 
and strategy for further strong progress.”

ATTRIBUTABLE PROFITS AND EARNINGS
Headline attributable profit was £169.8m (2009: 
£45.6m) and headline earnings per share was 61.5p 
(2009: 18.0p).
After taking into account all exceptional items, the 
Group recorded a profit for the year of £145.3m 
compared with a loss of £48.5m for 2009.
FINANCIAL POSITION
net debt at 31 December 2010 was £330m, £41m lower 
than a year earlier. t he Group has very substantial liquidity 
headroom within its committed debt facilities which total 
£855m. in December 2010, we successfully completed the 
issue of $250m of us p rivate placement loan notes with an 
average fixed interest rate of 4.6% and average duration of 
just under nine years. the principal maturities under the 
existing bank facility are in late 2012 and our intention is 
to refinance this facility by the end of 2011.
At 31 December 2010, the ratio of net debt to eBitDA  
was 1.1 times, very comfortably within the debt 
covenant level of 3.0 times and the interest cover ratio 
was 13.8 times.
OUTLOOK FOR 2011
For 2011, based on a number of third party forecasts, 
we are expecting global steel production growth to 
be at mid-single digit levels, slightly higher growth 
in electronic equipment production and double digit 
growth rates in our foundry castings and fused silica 
end-markets. t he significant cost reduction measures 
implemented in the first half of 2009, the continuing 
market penetration of new, higher margin products, 
and the production capacity expansion projects 
completed in 2010 and currently under way, mean 
that the Group is well positioned to benefit from these 
positive end-market growth trends. 
Accordingly, we continue to expect that the Group’s 
performance in 2011 will be well ahead of 2010. 
TARGETS AND STRATEGY
On 26 January 2011, we gave an extensive capital markets presentation setting out our targets for 
performance improvement over the coming three years and our strategy for achieving those targets. t he 
full presentation is available on our website. t he targets are:
	 average annual revenue growth to exceed 1.5 times global GDp growth;
	 return on sales margin of 12% by year 2013;
	 double digit average annual headline earnings growth;
	 dividend growth at least in line with earnings growth;
	 return on investment increasingly ahead of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital; and
	 maintaining a strong financial position with a leverage ratio (year-end net debt to eBitDA ratio) of not 
more than 1.5 times.
in setting these targets we are not assuming any significant acquisitions, but some bolt-on acquisitions are 
possible. Also, no major disposals are anticipated but any opportunities to create value will be considered 
objectively.
We see the achievement of these targets being underpinned by:
	 leading global market positions, supplying consumables to essential industries — steel, foundry and 
electronics;
	 track record of market share gains with new, enhanced technology, higher margin products — increased 
R&D capability and spending;
	 significant emerging market exposure (c.50% of revenue; >60% of trading profit);
	 considerable further recovery potential in mature markets where cost base significantly reduced; and
	 opportunities to leverage further organic growth through bolt-on acquisitions. 06

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Long-term customer satisfaction is recognised as being essential to the attainment of Group goals, 
as is maintaining a reputation for integrity in all business and other dealings both with customers 
and suppliers.
CONTEx T
c ookson employs some 15,500 people with manufacturing facilities in over 
35 countries serving customers in more than 100 countries worldwide. We 
supply our customers with consumable products which they use in their 
manufacturing processes, for example in the production of steel, foundry 
castings, electronics and jewellery products. We operate in “just in time” 
supply chains with short lead times from order to delivery. We therefore 
have a relatively large number of small and medium sized facilities located 
close to our customers throughout the world’s major economic regions, 
rather than large centralised factories supplying customers worldwide. 
Our manufacturing processes are not energy intensive (total energy costs 
are approximately 2% of revenue) and do not produce large quantities of 
hazardous or other wastes and emissions.
POLICY
cookson recognises that its operations impact a wide community of 
stakeholders, including investors, employees, customers, business 
associates and local communities, and that appropriate attention to the 
fulfilment of its corporate responsibilities can enhance overall performance. 
in structuring its approach to the various aspects of corporate social 
responsibility, the company takes account of guidelines and statements 
issued by stakeholder representatives and other regulatory bodies from 
around the world. social, environmental and ethical matters are reviewed 
by the Board, including the impact such matters may have on the Group’s 
management of risk.
particular emphasis is focused on the following areas:
 Code of Conduct: requiring all c ookson’s businesses and employees 
to comply with the highest standards of legal and ethical behaviour.
 Health, Safety and Environment: protecting the health and safety 
of our employees, contractors, customers and the general public and 
reducing energy consumption and waste in our operations.
 Products and Services: developing innovative products and services 
which promote sustainability in our customers’ production processes 
and products. 
CODE OF CONDUCT
the company has a code of conduct (“the cookson code”), which has 
been distributed throughout the Group in 25 languages and by which all 
our businesses are required to operate. the cookson code emphasises 
the c ompany’s commitment to compliance with the highest standards of 
legal and ethical behaviour. t he c ookson c ode is reproduced in full on the 
c ompany’s website — www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
t he c ookson c ode sets out clear and simple principles covering: c ustomers 
and suppliers; employees; investors; society and Local communities; 
Health, safety and environment; c onflicts of interest; and c ompetitors.
Long-term customer satisfaction is recognised as being essential to the 
attainment of Group goals, as is maintaining a reputation for integrity in 
all business and other dealings both with customers and suppliers. the 
c ookson c ode defines how we must compete vigorously and honestly.
t he Group believes it can only achieve its goals through the efforts of its 
employees. Job satisfaction requires working environments that motivate 
employees, together with opportunities for training and development to 
maximise personal potential. Wherever they work, employees have the

EmPLOYEE HELPLINE
cookson has a 24-hour employee Business concern Helpline telephone 
and e-mail facility. this is an independent and confidential service 
through which employees worldwide may register any concerns about 
any incorrect or irregular practices they perceive in c ookson’s workplaces.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONmENT (“HS&E”)
c ookson regards Hs&e matters as mainstream management responsibilities. 
the Board has overall responsibility for the cookson Hs&e policy and for 
monitoring its implementation. executives and line managers at all levels 
are directly responsible through the normal management structure for 
Hs&e matters in the operations under their control. particular emphasis is 
focused on the following areas:
 Safety Performance: work-related injuries and illnesses.
 Regulatory Compliance: compliance with permitted air, water, waste 
and noise emissions criteria.
 Energy Usage: reducing electricity and gas consumed in our 
operations and hence carbon dioxide (“c O
2
”) emissions. 
the Group’s Hs&e policy and related information can be found on the 
Group’s website — www.cooksongroup.co.uk.
A reporting system is in place to collect details of all Hs&e-related 
incidents throughout the Group and to produce quarterly reports 
including the Kpis covering work-related injury and illness rates. t hese 
reports and related performance improvement plans are regularly 
reviewed by the chief executive with divisional management as part of 
the normal business review cycle. 07

the Board reviews Hs&e performance as a formal agenda item at least 
once per year including the Kpis covering work-related injury and illness 
rates and total energy consumption. Any significant incidents are reported 
to the chief executive and the Board as they occur.
cookson’s larger manufacturing locations are progressively being 
qualified for certification under isO 14001, the international standard for 
environmental management systems. those facilities handling potentially 
more hazardous materials are progressively being qualified for certification 
under the international occupational health and safety management 
system, OHsAs 18001. c ertification to these international standards is not 
appropriate for all facilities, particularly smaller ones and those with very 
limited environmental impact.
t he Group now has 74 locations certified to isO 14001 and 34 locations 
certified to OHsAs 18001.
SAFETY PERFORmANCE
cookson’s goal is zero work-related injuries and illnesses. the principal 
indicators of occupational safety and health performance that are used are 
based on the us Occupational s afety and Health Administration recording 
requirements. cookson operations worldwide report the “days away” 
incident rate — the number of work-related illnesses or injuries, per 100 
employees, that resulted in an employee being absent from work for at least 
one day. We also track the “recordable” incident rate — the number of work-
related injuries and illnesses, per 100 employees, that resulted in medical 
treatment beyond first aid.
c ookson’s “days away” injury and illness rate has fallen from 2.40 in 2004 to 
0.80 in 2010. t he Group’s “recordable” incident rate has improved to 1.7 in 
2010 from greater than 4 in 2004.
REGULATORY COmPLIANCE
Regulatory actions against cookson companies have been at a low 
level for several years. this is indicative of the emphasis on continuous 
Hs&e performance improvement across c ookson in relation to statutory 
obligations. A small number of enforcement notices were issued to c ookson 
companies in 2010, including several that assessed minor penalties.
cookson companies began implementing the european regulation for 
the Registration, evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of chemicals 
(“ReAcH”) in 2008. each of the Group’s businesses which manufacture 
chemicals filed appropriate pre-registrations by the statutory deadline and 
has otherwise complied, as applicable, with the regulatory requirements 
for the registration of chemical substances.
Like many manufacturers, some Group companies have potential 
environmental liabilities because of past operations at their current 
or former sites. Where remediation is required, we work with external 
specialists and with government authorities to ensure that remediation is 
conducted effectively and efficiently.

REDUCING ENERGY USE AND CO
2
 EmISSIONS
since 2004, cookson has operated a programme aimed at reducing 
energy use and hence the associated emissions of cO
2
. t he programme 
trains employees to understand energy use and conservation principles 
and introduces energy audits to assist high-use sites in identifying and 
implementing conservation measures.
t he following chart shows c ookson’s electricity and gas consumption over 
the last seven years.
From 2005 to 2007 energy use was reduced markedly as a result of 
these initiatives, notwithstanding growing revenue over the period. in 
2008 energy use increased relative to 2007, due to the acquisition of the 
Foseco operations. energy use in 2008, excluding Foseco, is shown on the 
graph below illustrating further reductions in the rest of the Group. in 
2009 gas use fell by 3% (including Foseco) due to the drop in the Group’s 
activity. in 2010 electricity use reduced marginally compared with 2009 
and gas usage reduced by 8%, notwithstanding the increased level of 
manufacturing activity.
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
cookson’s products and services can significantly reduce the 
environmental impact of our customers’ operations. We believe that 
by continuing to develop innovative products and services we can 
create leading market positions in profitable businesses which promote 
sustainability. We therefore maintain R&D spending at a high level and 
monitor this as a Group level Kpi.
For example, our c eramics division’s steel flow control, linings and foundry 
products reduce the levels of energy usage and material wastage in the 
production of steel and foundry castings, markets where we are the 
world’s leading supplier of consumable ceramics used to handle molten 
metal. similarly, our electronics division is a market leader in the supply of 
lead-free and halogen-free materials used in the production of electronic 
equipment.
in the renewable energy field, the c eramics division is the leading supplier 
of crucibles used in the production of multi-crystalline photovoltaic 
wafers used to make solar cells and the electronics division has introduced 
new products for improved solar cell connectivity.
in recent years we have developed significant metal recycling operations 
in both our precious metals and electronics divisions. Here we recover and 
refine our own and customers’ scrap solder and precious metals/jewellery 
products to produce high purity silver, gold, tin and lead products which 
can be reintroduced into the supply chain. t his has involved building new 
recycling facilities in the us and china and expanding recycling capacity 
in europe. in both precious metals and electronics markets there is an 
increasing focus on the traceability of these metals to ensure they are 
obtained from environmentally and ethically sound sources, for example 
the “Green Gold” and “c onflict metals” programmes. We work closely with 
our customers and suppliers in support of these initiatives.

2010
2010 was marked by continuing strong recovery in the 
performance of the Group’s businesses, which started 
towards the end of the first half of 2009, although trading 
is generally still not back to the levels experienced prior 
to the onset of the global economic crisis.
Group revenue in 2010 of £2,546m was 26% higher 
than 2009 at constant currency and 30% higher at 
reported exchange rates. underlying revenue (being 
revenue at constant currency adjusted for the impact 
of differences in commodity metal prices) was 23% 
higher than 2009. 2010 saw a gradual improvement 
in a number of the Group’s key end-markets as the 
year progressed, notably for foundry castings and 
electronics, and underlying revenue in the second half 
of 2010 was 6% higher than the first half. Revenue for 
the Group was well balanced geographically with 34% 
coming from sales to customers in europe, 31% from 
Asia-pacific, 25% from nAFt A and 10% from the Rest 
of the World.
Following the extensive cost reduction measures 
implemented since the fourth quarter of 2008, the 
majority of which were completed by mid-2009, profit 
“drop-through” from the increased revenue in 2010 
has been strong. As a result, trading profit in 2010 
more than doubled to £252.1m (2009: £111.7m), with 
significant improvements in all three divisions. t rading 
profit in the second half of 2010 was also 10% higher 
than the first half (at both constant currency and 
reported exchange rates). 
the return on sales margin in 2010 was 9.9%, 
significantly higher than the 5.7% reported in 2009. 
the impact of higher metal prices, which increased 
reported revenue in the electronics and precious 
metals divisions without any impact on profitability, 
reduced the return on sales in 2010 by around 0.5 
percentage points.
Headline profit attributable to owners of the parent of 
£169.8m was over three and a half times higher than 
the £45.6m reported in 2009, reflecting the higher 
trading profit, lower finance charges and a significantly 
lower effective tax rate. Headline earnings per share 
more than trebled to 61.5p, notwithstanding a 9% 
increase in the weighted average number of shares as 
a result of the full year effect of the march 2009 rights 
issue. 
exceptional charges (net of tax), excluded from 
headline results, totalled £23.3m, significantly lower 
than the £90.7m incurred in 2009 which included 
£75.6m of restructuring costs.
net debt as at 31 December 2010 was £330m  
(31 December 2009: £371m) resulting in a net debt to 
eBitDA ratio at year-end of 1.1 times.

in 2010 the ceramics division experienced a 
continuation of the improvement in the majority of its 
end-markets which had started towards the end of the 
first half of 2009. Revenue of £1,495m was 27% higher 
than 2009 at constant currency (32% at reported 
exchange rates). Revenue in the second half of 2010 
was 5% higher than the first half (at constant currency). 
As a result of the higher revenue, trading profit in 2010 
rose significantly to £177.4m (2009: £70.9m), being 
£99.9m higher at constant currency and £106.5m at 
reported exchange rates. t rading profit was 5% higher 
in the second half of 2010 compared to the first half (at 
constant currency). t he return on sales margin in 2010 
was 11.9%, significantly higher than the 6.3% reported 
in 2009. 
Steel end-market: Global steel production is the 
division’s main end-market corresponding to a little 
over half of its total revenue. According to the World 
steel Association, global steel production was 1,414m 
tonnes in 2010, a 15% increase compared to 2009 and 
a record level of global steel production. Global steel 
production was marginally lower (by 3%) in the second 
half compared to the first half. 
Within these totals, steel production in china (which 
now accounts for 44% of global steel production) 
grew 9% in 2010 compared to 2009. chinese steel 
production grew strongly in the first half, but then fell 
by 6% in the second half compared to the first half as 
a result of short-term government measures to restrict 
energy usage. However, market trends outside of 
china are more significant for the c eramics division 
in the short term as china currently accounts for less 
than 10% of the division’s steel-related revenue. A large 
part of steel production in china is not yet based on 
the enclosed continuous casting technology which 
uses Vesuvius’ steel Flow control products. t he use of 
enclosed continuous casting is expected to increase 
over time as the chinese steel industry continues to 
modernise and demand for higher grade “flat” steel 
product increases. in the Linings product line, there 
is only modest revenue arising in china as yet as this 
market has only recently been addressed.
excluding china, global steel production in 2010 was 
20% higher than 2009. Following the unprecedented 
collapse in steel production in the fourth quarter of 
2008, production levels started to recover from may 
2009 onward with the recovery continuing throughout 
the first half of 2010. steel production fell marginally 
in the third quarter, reflecting the normal seasonal 
slowdown in production notably in europe, but then 
recovered in the fourth quarter. As a result, steel 
production was unchanged between the first and 
second halves. Whilst the overall improvement in steel 
production is encouraging, production levels in most 
regions are still materially below the levels seen prior to 
the economic downturn. Global production (excluding 
china) in the fourth quarter of 2010 represented 
only 90% of the production levels seen in the second 
quarter of 2008. 
Foundry castings end-market: this market, which 
represents around one-third of the division’s revenue, 
produces castings which are used in a wide variety of 
engineered products. Approximately 40% of castings 
(and therefore a similar percentage of the revenue 
for the Foundry product line) are produced for the 
vehicle sector, being 25% for cars and light trucks 
(“automotive”) and 14% for heavy trucks. Other end-
markets for foundry castings include construction, 
agriculture and mining machinery; power generation 
equipment, pipes and valves; railroad, and general 
engineering equipment. t he foundry castings market 
deteriorated significantly towards the end of 2008 
with the unprecedented reduction in automotive and 
heavy truck production (particularly in the us and 
europe) and the widespread cut in production of other 
engineering products. 
Automotive production improved in the second half 
of 2009, stimulated by government sponsored vehicle 
replacement schemes, whilst global truck production 
remained at very low levels throughout the year. 
2010 saw further growth in automotive production 
according to JD power, with 38% growth in north 
America, 13% growth in europe and 23% growth in the 
Rest of the World (excluding china). truck production 
grew very strongly in 2010, albeit from low levels, 
with growth of 23% in north America, 57% in europe 
and 60% in the Rest of the World (excluding china). 
the other end-markets mentioned above typically 
exhibit more “late-cycle” characteristics. Given the 
extended period of de-stocking through the supply 
chain, other than for some specific regional markets, 
it was only towards the end of the first half of 2010 
that the Foundry product line started to experience a 
more generally positive impact on its revenue with this 
improvement continuing as the year progressed. 
Solar and glass end-markets: the principal products in 
Vesuvius’ Fused silica product line are solar crucibles™, 
which are used in the production of photovoltaic

(“solar”) panels, and tempering rollers used mainly in 
the production of glass for construction and automotive 
applications. Both products experienced very weak trading 
conditions in 2009 with weak end-markets exacerbated by 
a sharp de-stocking of solar panels, particularly in china. 
However , the significant improvement in demand for s olar 
crucibles™, which started in the fourth quarter of 2009 
as the de-stocking phase ended, continued throughout 
2010. Demand for tempering rollers started to recover 
midway through 2010. 
In the product line analysis below, all of the financial 
information is presented at constant currency. References 
to profitability of individual product lines (i.e. “profit 
contribution” or “contribution margin”) refer to the 
relative contribution they make to divisional trading 
profit before centralised divisional costs. 
STEEL FLOw CONTROL
The Steel Flow Control product line provides a full 
range of products and services to control, regulate and 
protect the flow of steel in the enclosed continuous 
casting process. Products include VISO™ and VAPEX™ 
products, slide-gate and tube changer systems and 
refractories, gas purging and temperature control 
devices, and mould and tundish fluxes.
Global steel production represents almost 100% of 
the end-market for steel Flow control products and 
services. Revenue of £494m was 32% higher compared 
to 2009. t his growth rate was ahead of the increase in 
steel production in the key markets in which Vesuvius 
operates, reflecting favourable product mix, including 
increased market penetration of the new, higher 
value-added, tundish tube changer and ladle shroud 
products, and some limited inventory restocking of 
Vesuvius products by customers in the first half of the 
year. Revenue was broadly consistent between the 
first and second halves of 2010, reflecting the trends 
in steel production. Revenue in the second half of 2010 
represented 95% of the revenue achieved in the first 
half of 2008, the last half year period prior to the impact 
of the global economic downturn. 
profit contribution nearly doubled compared to 2009 
with a strong profit contribution drop-through of around 
one-third on the additional revenue. 
During 2010, capacity was increased in the chinese 
and indian facilities in order to meet the continuing 
growth in demand in these countries. in china, during 
the first half of the year capacity was expanded at the 
main facility in suzhou, whilst production restarted at 
the tianjin facility. the tianjin facility had previously 
been decommissioned following its acquisition with 
Foseco in April 2008. the expansion of the Wuhan 
facility, part of the joint venture with Wuhan iron & 
steel c orporation (china’s third largest steel producer), 
and the project to double capacity at the indian facility 
in Kolkata have now also been completed. 
LININGS
Linings includes products and services that enable 
customers’ plants to withstand the effects of extreme 
temperatures or erosive chemical attack. The 
business manufactures castables, gunning materials, 
ramming mixes, pre-cast shapes, tap hole clay, 
bricks and mortars, and provides construction and 
installation services.
Global iron and steel production represents more 
than 75% of the end-market for Linings products and 
services with the remainder arising from a variety 
of non-steel markets including the cement, lime, 
aluminium, power generation, petrochemical and 
waste incineration industries. 
Revenue of £486m represented an increase of 19% 
compared to 2009. the growth reflected increased 
levels of maintenance as steel producers restarted or 
increased production and was broadly in line with the 
level of steel production growth in our key markets. 
the level of activity in non-steel markets remained 
subdued throughout 2010. 
profit contribution increased by one-half compared to 
2009. the contribution margin in 2010 was just over 
two percentage points lower than for the first half of 
2008, as a consequence of revenue in the second half 
of 2010 still being only 94% of that achieved in the first 
half of 2008.
A project to increase production capacity by around 
one-half at the chinese brick-lining business, BR c, was 
completed at the end of 2010. t he Linings facility in s ao 
paulo is being relocated to a larger site to serve better 
the growing demands of the Brazilian steel market. t he 
relocation is expected to be completed by the end of 
the first half of 2011.

FOUNDRY
The Foundry business is a leading supplier of 
products, services and solutions to the foundry 
industry worldwide and trades under the Foseco 
brand name. Products include feeding systems, 
filters, metal treatments, metal transfer systems, 
crucibles, stoppers, sand binders, coatings and 
moulding materials.
Revenue of £440m represented an increase of 33% 
compared to 2009. the end-markets for the Foundry 
product line have more “late-cycle” characteristics 
and this, combined with significant de-stocking in 
the supply chain, resulted in only modest recovery 
in revenue during 2009. However, the beginning of 
2010 saw strong and progressive revenue growth 
in certain regional markets, including Japan, china 
and Brazil, driven by recovery in their automotive 
and truck sectors. Revenue growth also started to be 
evident towards the middle of 2010 in europe and 
north America, which constitute around two-thirds of 
the Foundry product line’s global market. As a result,  
revenue for the Foundry product line in the second 
half was 10% higher than for the first half. Whilst these 
trends are encouraging, revenue in the second half was 
still only 83% of the revenue achieved in the first half of 
2008 (pro forma for Foseco). 
profit contribution increased by just under four times 
compared to 2009, reflecting very strong profit drop-
through of just over 40% on the additional revenue. 
the contribution margin in 2010 reached low-teens, 
but was still three percentage points lower than for the 
first half of 2008.
t he closure of the Foundry product line’s manufacturing 
facility in chambery, France has been announced and is 
expected to be completed by mid-2011, with production 
transferring to existing facilities in poland and india. 
t he chinese foundry castings end-market is expected 
to grow strongly over the next few years. in anticipation 
of this growth, a project has been initiated to construct 
a new production facility near shanghai, planned for 
completion by the end of 2012. Building work should 
start in the first half of 2011, on completion of site 
acquisition and environmental permitting.
FUSED SILICA
The principal products in the Fused Silica product 
line are Solar Crucibles™ used in the manufacture 
of photovoltaic (“solar”) panels and tempering rolls 
used in the glass industry.
Revenue of £75m represented a 29% increase 
compared to 2009, principally driven by a strong 
recovery in the photovoltaic end-market. 
solar crucible™ revenue, which represents around 
60% of total Fused silica revenue, increased by 39% 
compared to 2009 reflecting the end of the severe de-
stocking of solar panels, particularly in china, during 
the first three quarters of 2009. For tempering rollers 
and other speciality products used in the manufacture 
of glass, revenue increased by 15% compared to 2009 
as the construction sector started to recover in the 
second half of the year.
profit contribution more than doubled compared to 
2009, reflecting the very strong profit drop-through 
on the additional solar crucible™ revenue. the 
contribution margin in 2010 was only just below that 
achieved in the first half of 2008.
in late 2008, a new solar crucible™ production 
facility in china was completed, but as demand 
was then falling rapidly the plant was immediately 
mothballed. Following the strong pick-up in demand, 
this facility was commissioned during 2010 with 
commercial production starting in the first quarter of 
2011. construction of an additional solar crucible™ 
production facility in moravia, c zech Republic has also 
been recently initiated with completion expected in 
2012. in the second half of 2010, a new line at skawina, 
poland was completed for the production of “ready to 
use” (“Rtu ”) solar c rucibles™. Rtu solar c rucibles™ are 
crucibles pre-coated with a patented solution which 
increases customers’ manufacturing productivity. 
As a result of very strong demand for this product, a 
project has been initiated to double capacity of Rtu 
solar crucibles™ from this facility for completion by 
mid-2011.

Return on sales
%
Revenue of £721m was 33% higher than 2009 at 
constant exchange rates (36% higher at reported 
exchange rates). the higher revenue partially reflects 
the “pass through” to customers of higher tin and 
silver prices, the Assembly materials product line’s 
major raw materials. in 2010, the average prices 
of tin and silver were, respectively, 53% and 36% 
higher than 2009, such that approximately £65m 
of the division’s revenue increase was as a result of 
these higher metal prices. excluding both the impact 
of higher metal prices in Assembly materials and 
precious metal sales in chemistry, underlying revenue 
was 18% higher than 2009. electronics end-markets 
(which make up three-quarters of the division’s 
revenue) progressively improved during the year with 
particularly strong growth in demand for personal 
computers (“pcs”), mobile phones and automotive 
electronics. According to estimates from Henderson 
Ventures, global production of electronic equipment 
(measured in us dollars at constant currency) grew 
in 2010 by 17%, following the 11% decrease in 2009. 
Global pc unit shipments (both traditional and tablet 
pcs) were estimated to be 21% higher, whilst global 
unit shipments of mobile phones increased 29%. Other 
strong areas of growth within consumer electronics 
included flat screen t Vs, games consoles and e-readers. 
Automotive markets have similarly shown good 
improvement, although industrial end-markets have 
generally remained subdued.
underlying revenue was 23% higher in the first half 
of 2010 compared with the first half of 2009 but then 
increased 5% in the second half compared to the 
first half of 2010, reflecting both the improvement in 
trading conditions and also the normal seasonality of 
the business. 
trading profit for 2010 rose significantly to £71.0m 
(2009: £39.2m), being £30.7m higher at constant 
currency and £31.8m higher at reported exchange 
rates. t he trading profit in the second half of 2010 of 
£39.7m was £8.4m higher than the £31.3m achieved in 
the first half of 2010, principally reflecting the normal 
seasonality of the business and the improved end-
market conditions. t he return on sales margin in 2010 
was 9.8%, well ahead of the 7.4% achieved in 2009. t his 
2.4 percentage point increase in margin was achieved 
notwithstanding higher commodity metal prices 
and precious metal sales in 2010 which significantly 
increased revenue but had relatively little impact on 
trading profit. On an underlying basis, the margin 
increase was even stronger at 3.7 percentage points. 
Asia-pacific, the division’s largest region, accounted for 
45% of revenue in 2010 (by location of customer), two 
percentage points ahead of 2009.
References to profitability of product lines below (i.e. 
“profit contribution” or “contribution margin”) refer to 
the relative contribution they make to divisional trading 
profit before centralised divisional costs. 
ASSEmBLY mATERIALS
Assembly Materials is a leading global supplier of 
materials to assemblers of printed circuit boards 
(“PCBs”), the semi-conductor packaging industry and 
to certain non-electronics markets such as plumbing, 
automotive and water treatment under the trade 
names of Alpha and Fry. In PCB assembly, its products 
include solder (which is available in bar, paste, 
powder and sphere form and in no-clean, water-
soluble and lead-free options), fluxes, adhesives, 
cleaning chemistries and stencils.
Revenue for the year at £447m was 40% higher than 
2009 at constant exchange rates (45% higher at 
reported exchange rates). excluding the impact of 
passing through higher tin and silver prices, underlying 
revenue was 17% higher than last year, reflecting the 
strong growth in the global production of electronic 
equipment, combined with the continuation of 
the strategy to focus on higher margin, enhanced 
technology products. For solder products, which 
account for three-quarters of Assembly materials’ 
revenue, sales of higher margin, more value-added 
products such as solder paste (for which volumes 
were up 30%) have been stronger than the more 
commoditised products such as bar solder (up 
10%), partially reflecting the continuing shift from 
wave soldering to surface mount technology for the 
production of pcBs.

underlying revenue was 21% higher in the first half of 
2010 compared with the first half of 2009 and increased 
by 5% in the second half compared to the first half of 
2010, reflecting both the continued improvement in

business. trading profit for 2010 was just under 70% 
higher than for 2009 (at constant exchange rates).
CHEmISTRY
The Chemistry product line manufactures speciality 
electro-plating chemicals for the electronics, 
automotive and surface metal finishing industries 
under the trade name Enthone.
Revenue for the year at £274m was 22% higher than 
2009 at constant exchange rates (23% higher at 
reported exchange rates). underlying revenue was 21% 
higher than in 2009. sales of plating-on-plastics and 
corrosion and wear-resistant products for automotive 
and industrial applications were up 18% compared to 
2009, whilst sales of surface coating products serving 
the pcB fabrication market were up 15%. copper 
damascene sales into the semi-conductor market were 
up by one-third compared to 2009. 
underlying revenue was 26% higher in the first half of 
2010 compared with the first half of 2009 and increased 
by 5% in the second half compared to the first half of 
2010, reflecting both the improvement in electronic 
materials end-markets and normal seasonality. t rading 
profit for 2010 was 86% higher than for 2009 (at 
constant exchange rates). 
With the continued growth of china’s electronic 
materials, automotive and industrial end-markets, 
the construction of the new £14m chemistry facility 
in shanghai was started in the first quarter of 2010. 
expected completion is in late 2011. currently the 
china market is served from cookson facilities in 
shenzen, t ianjin and singapore.

Return on net

%
the precious metals division operates in two distinct 
geographic regions: the us, which constitutes 43% of 
the total net sales value (being revenue excluding the 
precious metals content) for the division, and europe 
(focused on the uK, France and spain). 
Demand for finished jewellery products is influenced 
to a large extent by both consumer confidence 
and consumer preferences. consumer confidence 
remained weak during the year, particularly in the us, 
and the shift in customers’ discretionary spend over 
the last few years away from jewellery products more 
towards consumer electronic products such as mobile 
phones and mp3 players has continued. 
t he preference of buyers and wearers of jewellery for 
white metals and gemstones, a trend experienced 
over the last few years, continues. t he price of precious 
metals, in particular gold, also has an impact on 
jewellery demand — as prices increase, the weight 
of gold in the finished product is typically reduced 
to meet retailer price points. in addition, retailers are 
reluctant to hold inventory when prices are volatile. 
Average precious metal prices in 2010 have been 
significantly higher than 2009, being approximately 
25% higher for gold, 36% for silver and 35% for platinum. 
net sales value of £134m in 2010 was 2% higher 
at constant exchange rates (1% higher at reported 
exchange rates) compared to 2009. this reflected 
continuing weak retail jewellery markets, particularly 
in the us, being more than offset by strong sales to the 
us m int of gold and silver coin blanks and higher levels 
of precious metal reclaim in europe, stimulated by the 
high price of gold. 
trading profit in 2010 at £12.7m was £4.1m above 
2009 at constant currency (£3.8m higher at reported 
exchange rates) principally due to improved profits in 
europe reflecting the high level of reclaim business, 
particularly in spain. Given the continued weak retail 
jewellery market in the us, further restructuring was 
initiated in november 2010 to reduce permanent 
headcount in the us by around 10%. t he return on net 
sales value for the division was 9.5%, well ahead of the 
6.7% achieved in 2009.

As described in detail in the Operating Review, most of the Group’s 
businesses experienced significantly improved end-market conditions 
during 2010 and, as a result, the trading profit in 2010 of £252.1m was more 
than double that achieved in 2009. 
After net finance costs (pre-exceptional items) of £30.4m, headline 
profit before tax was £222.1m. the Group’s effective tax rate decreased 
significantly in 2010 to 21.1% (2009: 35.2%) reflecting the return to a more 
normal geographic distribution of profitability combined with the benefit 
of a number of non-recurring credits recognised in the year. t hese credits 
related to the recognition of some previously unrecognised tax losses 
combined with a number of adjustments arising from the finalisation 
of prior year tax liabilities. the underlying tax rate for 2010, excluding 
the benefit of these non-recurring credits, was around 24%. A tax rate of 
between 23% and 24% is anticipated for 2011 and 2012.
t he increase in the Group’s trading profit combined with the lower finance 
costs and lower effective tax rate, resulted in headline profit after tax 
of £175.4m, over three and a half times that for 2009. similarly, headline 
earnings per share of 61.5p was just under three and a half times the 18.0p 
in 2009, reflecting the higher headline profit after tax, partly offset by a 9% 
increase in the weighted average number of shares arising from the full year 
effect of the march 2009 rights issue.
During 2010 the Group experienced a significant improvement in its key 
end-markets and trading performance. this, together with the Board’s 
current expectations of the likely trading environment in 2011, has resulted 
in the Board recommending to shareholders a final dividend for 2010 of 
11.5p per share.
net debt as at 31 December 2010 was £329.7m, a £41.7m reduction from  
31 December 2009, resulting in a leverage ratio (net debt to eBitDA) of 1.1 times.

Headline profit before tax
Headline profit before tax was £222.1m for 2010, which was £146.4m higher 
than for 2009. t he increase in headline profit before tax arose as follows:

Headline profit before tax 222.1 75.7 146.4 193%
t he £6.6m lower charge for net finance costs (interest) principally comprised 
£6.0m of lower interest on borrowings, due mainly to a decrease in the 
average level of borrowings throughout the year, and £1.2m lower pension 
interest cost. the lower average level of borrowings reflects the positive 
operating cash flow in the year and the full year benefit of the proceeds (net 
of expenses) of £241m from the rights issue in march 2009.
Items excluded from headline profit before tax
A net charge of £32.7m was incurred in 2010 (2009: £96.6m) for the following 
items excluded from headline profit before tax:
Amortisation of intangible assets: costs of £17.7m (2009: £17.6m) were 
incurred in 2010 relating to customer relationships, intellectual property 
rights and the Foseco trade name, arising on the acquisition of Foseco in 
April 2008. t hese intangible assets are being amortised over lives varying 
between 10 and 20 years. 
Restructuring and integration charges: Of the total charge of £17.3m (2009: 
£75.6m), £16.4m related principally to redundancies where there will be a 
short-term cash cost and £0.9m to non-cash asset write-offs. t he principal 
items included in the charge for 2010 were as follows:
 £9.6m arose in the ceramics division, of which the principal element 
was £4.6m related to the closure of the Foundry product line’s 
manufacturing facility in chambery, France. t his closure is expected to 
be completed by mid-2011; and
 £5.5m in the electronics division, of which the principal element was 
£3.2m for restructuring and redundancy costs in the chemistry product 
line in europe. 
Restructuring charges of between £5m and £10m are expected to be 
incurred in 2011.

Profit/(loss) relating to non-current assets: t he net profit of £0.6m (2009: loss 
of £2.8m) arose mainly on the disposal of surplus property and investments. 
Gains relating to employee benefits plans: Of the total non-cash credit of 
£5.3m (2009: £9.7m), £4.7m related to the closure of the uK defined benefit 
plan to future benefit accrual. A new Group personal pension plan has 
been established in place of both that plan and the former uK defined 
contribution plan to provide defined contribution benefits for all eligible 
uK employees.
Finance costs — exceptional items: costs of £3.0m (2009: £14.0m) were 
incurred in 2010 principally relating to the close-out of interest rate swaps.  
in December 2010, following receipt of the proceeds from the issuance 
of $250m of us private placement Loan notes, the Group was required to 
prepay certain of its borrowings under its existing syndicated bank facilities.  
Following these transactions, the Group closed out a number of interest rate 
swaps that had originally been taken out to hedge the interest payments 
relating to these borrowings.
Net (loss)/profit on disposal of continuing operations: A net loss of £0.6m (2009: 
profit of £3.7m) was incurred in 2010 relating to the disposal of the electronics 
division’s semi-conductor packaging operations, a small non-core business 
based in singapore manufacturing epoxy mould compounds for encapsulating 
semi-conductors, and trailing costs related to prior year disposals.
Group profit before tax and after the items noted above was £189.4m for 
2010 compared to a loss before tax of £20.9m in 2009.
Taxation
t he tax charge on ordinary activities was £46.7m on a headline profit before 
tax of £222.1m, an effective tax rate (before share of post-tax profit from 
joint ventures) of 21.1% (2009: 35.2%). For the full year 2009, the effective 
tax rate was negatively impacted by the Group’s low level of profit before 
tax which meant that the Group reported profit before tax in a number of 
tax-paying jurisdictions (such as china and india), whilst incurring losses 
before tax in jurisdictions (notably the us) where it was not appropriate 
to record a tax credit. t he significantly higher level of profit before tax in 
2010 has meant that this situation has not repeated. in addition, the Group 
has benefited in 2010 from non-recurring credits arising both from the 
recognition of tax losses in a number of countries where a deferred tax 
asset for those items had not previously been recorded, and from a number 
of adjustments arising from the finalisation of prior year tax liabilities. t he 
underlying tax rate for 2010, excluding the benefit of these non-recurring 
credits, was around 24%. Whilst the Group’s effective tax rate going forward 
will be affected by the geographic split of profit before tax, it is currently 
expected that the effective tax rate for 2011 and 2012 will be between 23% 
and 24%. 
A tax credit of £9.4m (2009: £5.9m) arose in relation to all the items excluded 
from headline profit before tax noted above. 
Discontinued operations
A charge of £1.2m (2009: £3.4m) was incurred in 2010 in respect of additional 
costs for operations discontinued in prior years.
Profit attributable to owners of the parent
Headline profit attributable to owners of the parent for 2010 was £169.8m 
(2009: £45.6m), with the £124.2m increase over 2009 principally arising from 
the significant increase in headline profit before tax and the lower effective 
tax rate. profit attributable to non-controlling interests of £5.6m was £1.8m 
higher than for 2009. 
After taking account of all items excluded from headline profit before tax 
noted above (net of the related tax impact) and the charge relating to 
discontinued operations, the Group recorded a profit of £150.9m for 2010, 
£195.6m higher than the £44.7m loss recorded in 2009. 
Return on investment (“ROI”)
t he Group’s post-tax ROi in 2010 was 9.6%, well ahead of the 3.4% reported 
in 2009, reflecting the significant improvement in trading performance 
during the year. 
Earnings per share (“EPS”)
Headline eps, based on the headline profit attributable to owners of the 
parent divided by the average number of shares in issue, amounted to 61.5p 
per share in 2010, compared to headline eps of 18.0p per share in 2009. t he 
Board believes this basis of calculating eps is an important measure of the 
underlying earnings per share of the Group. Basic eps, based on the net profit 
from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent, was 53.0p 
(2009: loss per share of 17.8p). 
the average number of shares in issue during 2010 was 276.2m, 23.4m 
higher than for 2009, principally reflecting the full year effect of the 
issue of 255.1m new shares as a result of the rights issue in march 2009. 
in accordance with iAs 33, the average number of shares in issue used 
in the calculation of eps for all periods prior to the rights issue has been 
multiplied by an adjustment factor to reflect the bonus element in the 
new shares issued. the adjustment factor used was 6.6391. the average 
number of shares also reflects the share consolidation in may 2009 whereby 
shareholders exchanged 10 existing shares for 1 new share. 
Dividend
Dividends have been suspended since the end of 2008 as a result of the 
economic downturn. However, end-market conditions and the Group’s 
trading performance have shown a significant improvement in 2010 
compared to 2009. this, together with the Board’s current expectations 
of the likely trading environment in 2011, has resulted in the Board 
recommending a final dividend for 2010 of 11.5p per share which, if 
approved, is to be paid on 6 June 2011 to shareholders on the register on 
20 may 2011. 18

t he cash outflow of £92.4m from trade and other working capital reflects 
the strong increase in underlying revenue in 2010. Whilst the absolute 
level of trade working capital rose during 2010, the ratio of average trade 
working capital to sales in 2010 of 21.1%, improved 0.3 percentage points 
from that achieved in 2009. 
cash outflow for restructuring and integration was £23.8m, of which the 
majority related to trailing costs from the cost-saving initiatives in the 
ceramics and electronics divisions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008 
and the first half of 2009. A cash outflow for restructuring and integration of 
around £15m is expected in 2011.
the cash outflow for additional pension plan funding contributions 
included the following: 
US defined benefit pension plans: An amount of £8.7m was paid in march 2010 
to ensure continued compliance with the minimum funding levels required 
under the us pension protection Act. With effect from the beginning of 
2011, additional top-up payments of approximately £6m per annum are 
expected to be made into the us pension plan.
UK defined benefit pension plan (“the UK Plan”): payments totalling £2.9m 
were made into the uK plan in 2010. A new funding valuation for the uK 
plan as at the end of 2009 was completed in July 2010, based upon which 
cookson and the trustee agreed a new schedule of contributions of £7m 
per annum commencing in August 2010. t he level of “top-up” payments will 
be reviewed based on the uK plan’s next triennial valuation as of December 
2012, which should be available in mid-2013. 
Net cash flows from investing activities
Capital expenditure: payments to acquire property, plant and equipment 
in 2010 were £57.2m, £22.2m higher than 2009 and representing 106% of 
depreciation (2009: 65%). A cash outflow for capital expenditure of around 
£90m is expected in 2011 principally reflecting the expansion of production 
capacity in the emerging markets of china, india and Brazil and customer 
installations in the c eramics and electronics divisions. 
 Proceeds from the sale of investments: net cash inflow from the sale of surplus 
trade investments was £4.6m (2009: £0.1m).
Acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures: net cash outflow in 2010 
was £3.9m (2009: £5.9m), principally relating to the ceramics division’s 
investment in the Linings joint venture in china with Angang s teel, one of 
china’s largest steel producers.
Disposal of subsidiaries and joint ventures: net cash inflow in 2010 was £6.2m 
(2009: £6.2m), principally relating to the disposal by the electronics division 
of its epoxy mould compound business, based in singapore. 
Settlement of closed-out interest rate swaps: net cash outflow in 2010 was 
£6.5m (2009: £4.0m) and related to interest rate swaps that had been 
closed-out in 2009.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities after 
net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment 
and dividends received from joint ventures and paid to non-controlling 
shareholders, but before additional funding contributions to Group pension 
plans.
Free cash inflow for 2010 was £63.7m, £93.6m lower than 2009, principally 
due to the £74.1m decrease in net cash flow from operating activities for the 
reasons described above, combined with the £22.2m increase in purchases 
of property, plant and equipment. 
the Group traditionally experiences weaker free cash inflows in the first 
half of the year compared with the second half, due to the seasonality of 
trade working capital cash flows. in 2009, the marked reduction in revenue 
coupled with continued management focus on cash generation resulted in 
strong free cash flow in both the first and second halves of 2009. in 2010, a 
more normal trade working capital seasonality was experienced, resulting 
in much stronger free cash flow in the second half of the year compared 
to the first half (first half 2010: £14.9m outflow; second half 2010: £78.6m 
inflow). this normal trade working capital seasonality is expected to 
continue in 2011. 
Net cash flow before financing
net cash inflow before financing for 2010 was £51.8m, £90.7m lower than 
2009 due principally to the decrease in cash flow from operating activities 
described above.
Cash flow from financing activities
net cash outflow from financing activities (before movement in borrowings) 
was £6.9m (2009: inflow of £198.3m), principally comprising a cash outflow 
of £3.3m relating to the settlement during the year of forward foreign 
exchange contracts, in particular those relating to the chinese renminbi. 
these forward foreign exchange contracts had been taken out to align 
broadly the currency profile of the Group’s borrowings with the net assets 
of the Group and formed part of the hedge on investments of the Group’s 
foreign operations. the cash inflow in 2009 arose principally from the 
proceeds (net of expenses) of £240.7m from the rights issue in march 2009. 19

Net cash inflow and movement in net debt
net cash inflow for 2010 (before movement in borrowings) was £44.9m, 
£295.9m lower than 2009.
With a £1.6m negative foreign exchange adjustment and £1.6m in other 
non-cash movements, this resulted in a decrease in net debt from £371.4m 
at 31 December 2009 to £329.7m at 31 December 2010.
Net debt
t he net debt of £329.7m as at 31 December 2010 was primarily drawn on 
available committed facilities of £855m. t he Group’s net debt comprised the 
following:
    31 Dec  31 Dec 
    2010 2009 
    £m £m 
us p rivate placement Loan notes    282.2 201.3
c ommitted bank facility   223.2  324.9
Lease financing    3.8  3.6
Other    7.2  1.8
Gross borrowings   516.4  531.6
c ash and short-term deposits   (186.7)  (160.2)
Net debt   329.7  371.4 
On 16 December 2010, the Group issued $250m of new us private 
placement Loan notes. t he notes were issued in two series: $110m at a fixed 
interest rate of 4.16% maturing in December 2017, and $140m at a fixed 
interest rate of 4.87% maturing in December 2020. t he average weighted 
interest rate on the new notes is 4.57% and the average weighted duration 
from issuance is 8.7 years. t he remaining $190m of us private placement 
Loan notes are repayable in may 2012.
in October 2007, the Group entered into a multi-currency, committed bank 
facility which now totals £573m. t his facility is repayable in three tranches: 
£62m in April 2011; £38m and €19m in October 2011; and £425m and €38m 
in October 2012.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group’s ratio of eBitDA to interest on 
borrowings was 13.8 times (as compared with not less than 4.0 times for 
bank covenant purposes) and the ratio of net debt to eBitDA was 1.1 times 
(as compared with not more than 3.0 times for bank covenant purposes). 
Based on these covenant ratios, the Group will pay a margin of 65bps over 
LiBOR on its borrowings under the committed bank facility.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group had undrawn committed debt facilities 
totalling around £350m. 
in January 2010, the Group entered into a number of interest rate swaps 
which, together with the impact of the us private placement Loan notes 
issued in December 2010, results in around three quarters of the Group’s 
current gross borrowings now being at fixed interest rates for an average 
period of just under four and a half years from December 2010.
Currency
During 2010, sterling weakened against the majority of currencies (by 3% 
against the us dollar and 7% against the chinese renminbi). t he principal 
exception was the euro, against which sterling strengthened by 4%. Overall, 
the relative weakness of sterling during the year meant that the average 
exchange rates used to translate the Group’s overseas results into sterling 
for 2010 and 2009 had a minor positive impact on the Group’s reported 
results. Between these years, the average exchange rates for sterling 
weakened against the us dollar by 1% and the chinese renminbi by 2%, but 
strengthened against the euro by 4%. 
in 2010, the net translation impact of currency changes compared to 2009 
was to increase 2009 revenue by £54m and 2009 trading profit by £7m. 
During the course of the second half of 2008, the majority of the currency-
denominated borrowings under both the us private placement Loan 
notes and the syndicated bank facility were switched into sterling such 
that changes in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the 
level of gross borrowings. Following the significant improvement in the 
Group’s financial position since the beginning of 2010, there has been a 
progressive return to the previous policy of broadly matching the currency 
of borrowings to the currency of operating activities. c urrently, around 75% 
of the Group’s gross borrowings are non-sterling denominated, principally 
in us dollars, euros and chinese renminbi.
Pension fund and other post-retirement obligations
the Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension 
plans, principally in the uK, the us and Germany. i n addition, the Group has 
various other post-retirement defined benefit (“pRB”) arrangements, being 
principally healthcare arrangements in the us. the Group’s two principal 
defined benefit pension plans in the us are closed to new members and to 
further accruals for existing members. Following the closure of the uK plan 
and the uK defined contribution plan to future benefit accrual with effect 
from 31 July 2010 a new Group personal pension plan has been established 
in their place to provide defined contribution benefits for all eligible uK 
employees.
the total charge to the income statement in 2010 for all pension plans 
(including defined contribution plans) was £20.5m, an increase of £5.7m 
over 2009. Of this charge, £22.2m (2009: £18.9m) has been deducted in 
arriving at trading profit and £3.6m (2009: £4.8m) has been included within 
net finance charges. in addition, an exceptional credit of £5.3m was reported 
(2009: £9.7m) relating mainly to the termination of future benefit accrual in 
the uK plan. total pension cash contributions amounted to £40.5m in 2010 
(2009: £36.2m), which included additional cash funding contributions into 
the uK plan of £2.9m and a funding contribution into the us plans of £8.7m. 20

FINANCIAL REVIEw continued
As at 31 December 2010, a net deficit of £113.8m was recognised in respect 
of employee benefits. the reduction of £23.9m from the net deficit as at  
31 December 2009 of £137.7m primarily arose due to a £25.8m improvement 
in respect of the uK arrangements. t his improvement principally arose  from 
actuarial gains on the uK plan assets of £29.7m and a curtailment gain of 
£4.7m in connection with the uK plan closure. t he deficit in the Group’s us 
pension arrangements increased by £3.8m to £57.9m, despite additional 
contributions into the plans of £8.7m. the main contributing factor was 
increased liabilities (£14.0m) resulting primarily from a reduction in the 
applicable discount rate. t he net deficit in the plans in the remainder of the 
Group were marginally (£1.9m) lower than at the end of 2009. 
the total Group net deficit comprises a surplus of £4.3m relating to 
the uK plan and deficits of £57.9m relating to the Group’s defined 
benefit pension plans in the us, £35.0m to plans in Germany, £15.5m to 
pension arrangements in other countries, and £9.7m to unfunded post-
retirement defined benefit arrangements, being mainly healthcare benefit 
arrangements in the us. 
During 2009 it was agreed, in consultation with the trustee of the uK plan, 
to reduce the level of “top-up” payments (made in addition to normal cash 
contributions) from £14.0m per annum such that, with effect from 1 February 
2009, no further additional payments would be made until August 2010. A 
new triennial funding valuation for the uK plan as at the end of 2009 was 
completed in July 2010, based upon which the c ompany and t rustee agreed 
a new schedule of contributions to commence in August 2010 whereby, 
whilst the company will make no further normal cash contributions, it will 
make “top-up” payments of £7.0m per annum until February 2016, targeted 
at eliminating the deficit in the uK plan by that date. “top-up” payments of 
£2.9m were made in 2010 (2009: £1.2m). t he level of  “top-up” payments will 
be reviewed based on the uK plan’s next triennial valuation as of December 
2012, which should be available in mid-2013. 
t he uK plan has, since 2006, operated a hedging strategy to mitigate the 
impact of interest rate and inflation rate movements on the value of its 
projected liabilities for meeting future pension payments (the uK plan’s 
“economic liabilities”), the value of which is related more to interest rate 
and inflation rate swap yields than to corporate bond yields, upon which 
the discount rate used for iAs 19 valuation purposes is based. When the 
relationship between the relevant swap yields and corporate bond yields 
is stable, the uK plan’s hedging strategy should deliver a broadly stable 
“funding ratio” (the ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities) not just in relation to 
the uK plan’s economic liabilities, but also under an iAs 19 basis of valuation. 
As at 31 December 2010, the estimated funding position (incorporating the 
uK plan’s economic liabilities) showed a funding ratio of 92%, while the iAs 
19 valuation reflected a funding ratio of 101%. t his represents a valuation 
difference of £41m. t he Group continues to fund the uK plan with reference 
to its economic funding position.
in July 2010, the uK government announced changes to the inflation 
index used for statutory pension increases (both for pensions in payment 
and pensions in deferment) to apply to private sector pension schemes. 
t he company and the uK plan trustee and their respective legal advisers 
are currently working to clarify how this impacts the uK plan and will 
communicate with any affected members in 2011, at which time any 
resulting liability reduction will be reflected in the Group financial 
statements.
in march 2010, the Group made a “top-up” payment of £8.7m into the us 
defined benefit pension plans to ensure continued compliance with the 
minimum funding levels required under the us pension protection Act. 
With effect from the beginning of 2011, additional “top-up” payments 
of approximately £6m per annum are expected to be made into the us 
pension plans. 21

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Details are set out in the narrative below of the company’s corporate 
governance procedures and application of the principles of the combined 
c ode on c orporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting c ouncil in 
June 2008 (“the code”). t he company has complied with the provisions of 
the c ode throughout the year ended 31 December 2010.
THE BOARD
ultimate responsibility for the management of cookson rests with the 
Board of Directors. t he Board focuses primarily upon strategic and policy 
issues. it approves the Group’s strategy, oversees the allocation of resources 
and monitors the performance of the Group in pursuit of this.
mEmBERSHIP
the Board currently has nine Directors, comprising the non-executive 
chairman, Jeff Harris; the chief executive, n ick salmon; the Group Finance 
Director, mike Butterworth; the chief executive Officer of the c eramics 
Division, François Wanecq and five non-executive Directors. the Board 
considers each of the non-executive Directors, namely Jeff Hewitt, peter 
Hill, Jan Oosterveld, Barry perry and John sussens, to be independent of 
management and free from any business or other relationship which 
could affect the exercise of their independent judgement. in addition,  
Jeff Harris was considered on his appointment date, 1 April 2010, to meet 
the independence criteria set out in the c ode.
the company has reviewed the availability of the non-executive Directors 
and considers that each of them is able to, and in practice does, devote the 
necessary amount of time to the company’s business. t he Board nominates 
one of the non-executive Directors to act as s enior independent Director and 
provide an alternative contact at Board level, other than the chairman, to 
whom shareholder matters can be addressed. mr sussens continues to hold 
this position. t he biographical details of the Directors are set out on page 21.
t he new uK c orporate Governance c ode issued by the Financial Reporting 
c ouncil in may 2010 recommends that all Directors of Ftse 350 companies 
be subject to annual election by shareholders. With the exception of mr 
perry, who is retiring from the Board at the close of the Annual General 
meeting (“AGm”), all the Directors will therefore be offering themselves for 
election at this year’s AGm as set out in the notice of AGm and on page 31. 
Responsibilities and meetings
the Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and delegates 
certain matters to committees as outlined below. t he Board convened on 
eight formal scheduled occasions during 2010 as well as holding a number 
of ad hoc committee meetings to consider non-routine business. in addition,  
the chairman and the other non-executive Directors meet routinely on 
their own without the executive Directors present and at least once each 
year the non-executive Directors meet without the chairman present to 
discuss matters such as the chairman’s performance.
specific matters reserved for the Board include: reviewing Group and 
divisional performance; approving significant transactions including 
acquisitions, divestments, capital expenditure and changes to the Group’s 
capital structure; setting and approving the Group’s strategy and annual 
budget; approving the Group’s financing and treasury policies; succession 
planning and approving Board appointments and the remuneration of the 
non-executive Directors. i n addition, the Board considers health, safety and 
environmental matters and reviews the Group’s risk management processes.
the division of responsibilities between the chairman and the chief 
executive has been agreed by the Board and is set out in writing. the 
chairman leads the Board and meets routinely with the chief executive 
and Group secretary to discuss matters relating to its efficient functioning. 
t he chairman also serves as chairman of Filtrona plc. t he Board considers 
that the chairman is able to and does devote sufficient time to his duties  
at c ookson.
the attendance of Directors who served during the year at Board and 
principal committee meetings during the year, together with the maximum 
number of meetings in the period when the individual was a Board member 
(as shown in brackets), was as follows:

papers are provided to the Directors in advance of the relevant Board or 
committee meeting to enable them to make further enquiries about any 
matters prior to the meeting should they so wish. the Group secretary 
oversees the distribution of these papers and ensures that there is an 
appropriate level of communication between the Board and its committees 
and between senior management and the non-executive Directors. He also 
keeps the Board apprised of relevant developments in corporate governance.
Performance evaluation
in accordance with the provisions of the code, the Board undertakes a 
formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance and effectiveness 
and assesses the performance of its committees and individual Board 
members on an annual basis. the precise scope of the evaluation varies 
from year to year and is agreed in advance with the full Board. t he chairman 
leads the evaluation process with the assistance of the Group secretary. 
the performance of the chairman is included in the review and takes into 
account the views of both the executive and non-executive Directors. the 
chairman’s evaluation is conducted by the s enior independent Director who 
provides feedback to the chairman. As part of the chairman’s evaluation the 
non-executive Directors meet separately with the s enior independent Director. 
the 2010 Board evaluation process was designed to be more “forward 
looking”. it focused upon key aspects of Board performance, including 
strategy review, succession planning and latest appointments to the Board. 
participants were requested to identify their own competencies and to give 
their perception of their peers’ effectiveness and contribution. t his enabled 
a skills matrix to be developed.
consistent with previous years, the review was carried out with the 
assistance of an external facilitator (who has no other connection with the 
c ompany) and involved the use of a specially designed questionnaire which 
was completed by the Directors and the Group secretary with the results 
being collated and summarised by the external facilitator. each Director 
received a copy of the report prepared by the external facilitator, which 
summarised and analysed all responses on a non-attributable basis. 
t he process also involved individual meetings between the chairman and 
members of the Board and the Group s ecretary to discuss any issues arising 
from the evaluation. the full Board then considered the report with the 
chairman and s enior independent Director adding their own comments 
based on the outcome of their separate discussions.
the new chairman was judged to have performed well against all the 
measured criteria during the first months of his tenure. the Board also 
concluded that overall it functioned effectively and that all Directors, 
including the Directors appointed during 2010, performed well, each of 
them making a significant contribution to the company. the quality of 
discussion at Board meetings was judged to be good, with an appropriate 
level of challenge.
the Board agreed a number of specific action items as a result of the 
evaluation exercise. t hese included a refinement to the Board’s approach to 
risk evaluation and mitigation and greater attention to succession planning. 
it was also agreed that commensurate with the increased scale of the 
Group’s activities in emerging markets, the risks and opportunities for the 
Group’s businesses in these countries would feature more prominently on 
the Board’s agenda in the future.
the chairmen of each of the Audit, nomination and Remuneration 
c ommittees also discussed the results of the evaluation of each committee 
with committee members. t hese reviews concluded that each committee 
continued to operate effectively. 
Induction and training
the Group secretary ensures that a comprehensive induction programme 
is provided to all new Directors, including visits to manufacturing facilities, 
meetings with key Group executives and introductions to the company’s 
principal external advisers, as appropriate. new Directors are also advised of 
their legal and other duties and obligations as Directors of a listed company. 
t his is supplemented by reference materials, which are updated as required, 
including information about the Board, its committees, Directors’ duties, 
procedures for dealing in the company’s shares and other regulatory and 
governance matters. Directors are provided with details of seminars and 
training courses relevant to their role. t hey are encouraged to attend these 
as they consider appropriate and are supported by the c ompany in so doing. 
Where a general training need is identified, in-house training is provided to 
the entire Board. in 2010 updates were given to the Board on developments in 
various areas of governance and regulation, including changes to institutional 
and regulatory codes on corporate governance and remuneration, 
forthcoming accounting changes and progress with the enactment of the 
uK Bribery Bill. During the year Directors also attended external seminars and 
other functions relevant to specific areas of their responsibility.
Relations with shareholders
t he company has an established investor relations programme managed 
by the chief executive and Group Finance Director. t he company reports 
its financial results to shareholders twice a year, with the publication of 
its Annual and Half-Yearly Financial Reports. in conjunction with these 
announcements presentations are made to institutional investors and 
analysts, copies of which are posted on the Group’s website — www.
cooksongroup.co.uk. in addition, in 2010 the company issued interim 
management statements in April and november. 
t he c ompany maintains a regular dialogue with major institutional investors 
and regular updates on shareholder issues and discussions are provided to 
the Board. Board members also receive copies of significant analysts’ notes 
issued on the c ompany. All Directors normally attend the c ompany’s AGm, 
providing shareholders with the opportunity to question them about issues 
relating to the Group, either during the meeting or informally afterwards. 24

the Group Head of internal Audit reports directly to the committee 
chairman and the c ommittee reviews and approves the internal audit work 
programme for each year. 
During the year under review, the c ommittee met four times and reviewed, 
amongst other matters, the company’s published financial results; internal 
audit reports and management control issues; the scope of the external 
audit and its cost-effectiveness; the performance of the Auditor; and the 
extent to which the Auditor’s remuneration for non-audit services might 
affect its independence and objectivity in carrying out the audit. in respect 
of all matters considered by the committee, it believes that it received 
sufficient, reliable and timely information from management to enable it to 
fulfil its responsibilities.
more specifically, the responsibilities of the committee were discharged  
as follows:
	 at its meetings in July 2010 and February 2011, the c ommittee reviewed 
the company’s Half-Yearly Report and Annual Results Announcement/
Annual Report and Accounts, respectively. On both occasions, the 
committee received reports from management on significant aspects 
of the Group’s financial statements, including amounts reported at fair 
value, off-balance sheet items and contingent liabilities, and received 
reports from the Auditor identifying any accounting or judgemental 
issues thereon requiring its attention;
	 at each of the four meetings, the committee received a report from the 
Group Head of internal Audit covering, amongst other things, the work 
undertaken by the internal Audit function and management responses 
to proposals made in the audit reports issued by the function during 
the year. in addition, at the October 2010 meeting the committee 
reviewed the results of an assessment which had been undertaken of the 
performance of the internal Audit function and at the December 2010 
meeting, the committee reviewed the internal audit plan, submitted by 
the Group Head of internal Audit for 2011.
	 at each of the four meetings, the committee reviewed the Auditor’s 
control findings;
	 at the July 2010 meeting, the committee reviewed the results of an 
assessment which had been undertaken of the performance of the 
Auditor and reviewed and agreed the audit plan presented by the 
Auditor, which detailed the approach and scope of the work to be 
undertaken and the level of fee to be charged; 
	 at its meetings in December 2010 and February 2011 the committee 
reviewed both the risk management process operated by management 
designed to identify the key risks facing each business and how those 
risks were being managed;
	 at its meeting in February 2011 the committee reviewed a report from 
management which addressed the appropriateness of the production of 
the Group and c ompany financial statements on a going concern basis; 25

	 from time to time, executives were required to make presentations to 
the committee or to the full Board on the identification, management 
and control of specific areas of risk which impact the c ompany and the 
Group; and
	 as a matter of routine, the c ommittee was presented with information 
on any significant litigation involving the Group.
As noted above, one of the duties of the committee is to make 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of the Auditor. 
in undertaking this duty, the committee takes into consideration a number 
of factors concerning the Auditor and the Group’s current activity, including: 
the quality both of reports provided by the Auditor to the committee and 
the Board, and of advice given; the level of understanding demonstrated  
of the Group’ s businesses; the objectivity of the Auditor’ s views on the controls 
throughout the Group; its ability to coordinate a global audit, working to tight 
deadlines; the cost-competitiveness of the Auditor in relation to the audit 
costs of comparable uK companies; the tenure of the incumbent Auditor; and 
the periodic rotation of the senior audit management assigned to the audit 
of the company. Having considered the aforementioned factors in 2010, the 
c ommittee decided to recommend the Auditor for reappointment.
t he terms on which the Auditor is engaged do not include any contractual 
obligations which would prevent the Directors appointing a different audit 
firm should this be considered appropriate.
t he c ommittee has put in place safeguards to ensure that the independence 
of the external audit is not compromised. t hese safeguards include:
	 seeking confirmation that the Auditor is independent of the company 
in its own professional judgement; and
	 considering all the relationships between the Auditor and the Group, 
including those relating to the provision of non-audit services and 
whether these impair, or appear to impair, the Auditor’s judgement or 
independence.
the company has a policy governing the Group-wide conduct of non-
audit work by the Auditor. under that policy the Auditor is prohibited from 
performing services where it:
	 may be required to audit its own work;
	 would participate in activities that would normally be undertaken by 
management;
	 is remunerated through a “success fee” structure; or
	 acts in an advocacy role for the Group.
Other than the above, the company does not impose an automatic 
prohibition on the Auditor undertaking non-audit work. the Auditor is 
permitted to provide non-audit services that are not, or are not perceived 
to be, in conflict with Auditor independence, provided it has the skill, 
competence and integrity to carry out the work in the best interests of the 
Group. Details of the amounts paid to the Auditor during the year for audit 
and other services are set out in note 8 on page 70.
the chairman of the Audit committee reports the outcome of the 
c ommittee meetings to the Board and all members of the Board receive the 
agenda, papers and minutes of Audit c ommittee meetings.
REmUNERATION COmmITTEE
the Remuneration committee members are the non-executive Directors, 
namely Jeff Hewitt, peter Hill, Jan Oosterveld, Barry perry and John sussens 
who chairs the committee. mr Hill joined the committee following his 
appointment to the Board on 1 February 2010. t he committee’s principal 
roles are to set the appropriate remuneration for the chairman, the 
executive Directors and the Group secretary, and to recommend and 
monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior management, 
being the first layer of management below Board level. Further details of 
the activities of the Remuneration c ommittee are provided in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 35 to 44.
t he chairman of the Remuneration c ommittee reports the outcome of the 
c ommittee meetings to the Board. 
NOmINATIONS COmmITTEE
the nominations committee advises the Board on appointments 
to, and retirements and resignations from, the Board. the members 
of the committee are the chairman, the chief executive and any 
three non-executive Directors. the committee meets as and when 
required and is chaired by the chairman or a non-executive Director.  
t he chairman would not act as chairman of the c ommittee where it was 
dealing with the appointment of his successor. Formal meetings are held 
to consider standing items of business; there is also a significant level of ad 
hoc discussion between members of the committee, particularly when a 
recruitment exercise is taking place.
On 1 February 2010, a new executive Director and a new non-executive 
Director were appointed to the Board and on 1 April 2010 a new chairman 
was appointed to the Board. When considering the appointment of 
these new Directors, the committee drew up specifications, taking into 
consideration the diversity of the Board including the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience and the ongoing requirements of the Group. 
it utilised the services of an external recruitment consultant to identify 
appropriate candidates for the roles of chairman and non-executive 
Director. the senior independent Director and the chief executive met 
with the short-listed candidates for the role of chairman and the remaining 
Directors then met with the preferred two candidates. With respect to the 
appointment of the new non-executive Director, the chairman and chief 
executive met with the short-listed candidates and the remaining Directors 
then met with the preferred candidate. t he c ommittee subsequently made 
recommendations for each appointment to the full Board. care is taken to 
ensure that all proposed appointees have sufficient time available to devote 
to the role and do not have any conflicts of interest.
t he nominations c ommittee reviews the company’s succession plans. t he 
Board as a whole also considers this subject. each of cookson’s divisions 
submits detailed succession plans in respect of senior divisional executives 
to the Board for review each year. the Board also considers succession  26

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT continued
planning for senior c orporate executives, with the nominations c ommittee 
focusing in turn, specifically on succession planning for members of the 
Board. t he chairman of the nominations c ommittee reports the outcome 
of the c ommittee meetings to the Board.
FINANCE AND SHARE SCHEmES COmmITTEES
the Board delegates certain responsibilities on an ad hoc basis to the 
Finance and share s chemes committees.
the Finance committee is chaired by the chairman, its other members 
being the chief executive, Group Finance Director and Group treasurer. 
the committee meets as and when required to consider the approval of 
treasury-related matters.
t he share s chemes c ommittee’s membership consists of any two Directors. 
it meets as and when required to undertake administrative matters in 
relation to the c ompany’s share schemes.
CENTRAL ExECUTIVE
in addition to the committees of the Board described above, specific 
authority has been delegated to the central executive comprising the 
chief executive, Group Finance Director and Group s ecretary. t he central 
executive is responsible for reviewing and approving capital expenditure, 
acquisitions and disposals at certain levels as determined by the Board. 
Responsibility for day-to-day operational management rests with the 
divisional chief executives.
INTERNAL CONTROL
t he Directors are responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the 
Group’s system of internal control.
the company has complied with the provisions of the code relating to 
internal control which require that the Directors review the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls, and risk management systems. t his review covers 
the Group’s financial reporting process, including that for the preparation 
of the company’s consolidated financial statements, which incorporates 
the dissemination and use of common accounting policies and procedures 
and financial reporting software. Whilst no system of internal control 
can provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, 
the Group’s system is designed to provide the Directors with reasonable 
assurance that problems are identified on a timely basis and are dealt with 
appropriately. since the date of the review, there have been no significant 
changes in internal controls or other matters which could significantly affect 
them.
there is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
any significant risks faced by cookson. Group management operates a 
risk management process designed to identify the key risks facing each 
business and reports to the Board on how those risks are being managed. 
As a basis for this report, each of the Group’s major business units produces 
a “risk map” which identifies their key risks and assesses the likelihood of 
those risks occurring, their impact if they do occur and the actions being 
taken to manage those risks to a desired level. 
the internal control system is monitored and supported by the Group’s 
internal Audit function, which operates on a global basis. t his function assists 
management and the Board in the effective discharge of their responsibility 
for internal control by conducting reviews of cookson businesses and 
reporting objectively both on the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
system of internal control in place and as to whether those businesses are 
in compliance with applicable Group policies and procedures. the Group 
Head of internal Audit is responsible for developing the function, within the 
framework of common Group policies and standards, and for carrying out 
assignments in accordance with an annual audit plan approved by the Audit 
c ommittee. t he Audit c ommittee receives reports from the Group Head of 
internal Audit on a regular basis and reports to the Board on the results of 
its review. 
As part of the Board’s process for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of 
internal control, it delegates the following matters to the Audit c ommittee 
to be carried out during the year: 
	 review of external and internal audit work plans; 
	 consideration of reports from management, internal audit and external 
audit on the system of internal control and any material control 
weaknesses; and 
	 discussions with management on the actions taken on problem areas 
identified by Board members, in internal audit reports or in external 
audit management letters. 
in addition to the above, the Board considers significant financing and 
investment decisions concerning the Group, including the giving of 
guarantees and indemnities, and monitors policy and control mechanisms for 
managing treasury risk. t he Board also reviews the role of insurance and other 
measures used in managing risks across the Group, receives regular reports 
on any major issues that have arisen during the year and makes an annual 
assessment of how the risks have changed over the period under review. 
At the year-end, following the review by the Audit committee of internal 
financial controls and of the processes covering other controls, the Board 
evaluates the results of the internal control and risk management procedures 
conducted by senior management. t his includes a self-certification exercise 
by which senior financial and operational management throughout the 
Group certify the effectiveness of the system of internal controls within the 
businesses for which they are responsible, together with their compliance 
throughout the year with the Group’s policies and procedures.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
As described in the corporate Governance Report, there is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing any significant risks faced 
by cookson. Group management operates a risk management process designed to identify the key risks facing each business and reports to the Audit 
committee on how those risks are being managed. t he Board also reviews the role of insurance and other measures used in managing risks across the 
Group, receives regular reports on any major issues that have arisen during the year and makes an annual assessment of how the risks have changed over 
the period under review.
throughout its global operations, cookson faces various risks, both internal and external, which could have a material impact on the Group’s long-term 
performance. cookson manages the risks inherent in its operations in order to mitigate exposure to all forms of risk, where practical, and to transfer risk to 
insurers, where cost-effective. t he risks below are not the only ones that the Group will face. some risks are not yet known and some that are not currently 
deemed material could later become material. All of these risks could materially affect the Group, its businesses, results of future operations or financial condition.
RISK AND ImPACT
The financial performance and financial position of Cookson may be 
adversely affected by a significant weakening in demand in its core end-
markets.
end-market conditions, and the Group’s trading performance, have improved 
markedly during 2010 following the economic downturn which started in 
the fourth quarter of 2008 and persisted through much of 2009. Whilst the 
recovery has been strong, end-markets (and Group underlying revenue) 
are typically still not yet back to pre-crisis levels. the economic outlook for 
2011 remains unclear. For example, whilst concerns about a “double-dip” 
recession have largely abated, there are still concerns about slowing growth 
in china, sluggish growth in the developed world, plus the potential impact 
of a sovereign debt crisis affecting the eurozone. the Group’s end-markets 
are historically somewhat cyclical in nature and the 2008/09 financial crisis, 
which affected all end-markets simultaneously, resulted in a very pronounced 
deterioration in the Group’s trading performance. 
cookson’s divisions predominantly supply consumable products, on short 
lead times, to the global steel, foundry, electronics and precious metals 
industries. As such the Group’s expectations of future trading are based 
upon the Directors’ assessment of end-market conditions, which conditions 
are subject to some uncertainty. in the event that end-market conditions 
suffer further significant deterioration, cookson may experience further 
reductions in trading activity, a lower share price, the financial failure of 
one or more of its key customers and suppliers, asset impairments, lower 
profitability and a material adverse impact on its financial position.
Should Cookson be unable to refinance its main banking facilities on 
acceptable commercial terms as they fall due, this could limit Cookson’s 
operational flexibility.
cookson’s borrowing requirements are met by us private placement Loan  
notes (“uspp ”) and a multi-currency committed syndicated bank facility. 
$250m of uspp were issued in December 2010 with seven ($110m) or ten 
($140m) year durations. t he current syndicated bank facility expires at the end 
of 2012. if c ookson is unable to refinance its banking facility on commercially 
acceptable terms, this could: limit flexibility in the management of the 
Group; limit flexibility in making acquisitions; place c ookson at a competitive 
disadvantage to competitors; and increase cookson’s vulnerability to a 
significant resumption of adverse economic and industry conditions. 
mITIGATION
t he Board regularly reviews Group strategy, which determines the markets 
in which the Group operates. the current spread of the Group’s major 
businesses, both geographically and by end-market served, provides 
some protection to the Group should conditions, in particular markets, 
deteriorate. Further, the reduction in the Group’s cost base — which resulted 
from the cost-saving initiatives introduced by management in late 2008 and 
early 2009 as the recent recessionary market conditions began to develop 
— provides additional insulation to the adverse impact of any near-term 
market downturn. Also, in view of the extent of the de-stocking which took 
place during 2009 in the Group’s end-markets, the Directors believe that any 
downturn in its end-markets is likely to be less severe than that experienced in 
2009. Following the cost-reduction initiatives and equity raising successfully 
completed during 2009 and the debt refinancing recently completed in 
2010, the Directors believe that the Group is well positioned financially 
to sustain a further downturn in end-market activity should this occur. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cookson’s total committed debt facilities as at 31 December 2010 
were £855m, of which £350m was undrawn. total Group net debt as at  
31 December 2010 was £330m, of which £223m was financed out of the 
syndicated banking facility which expires in the fourth quarter of 2012.
t he Group intends to refinance its bank facility no later than the end of 2011. 
Based on the favourable market response to the Group’s recent uspp issue, 
the recent marked recovery in the Group’s trading performance and its 
strong financial position, the Board is confident that this will be achievable.   28

RISK AND ImPACT
A withdrawal or reduction of precious metal consignment arrangements, 
or increased precious metal prices resulting in consignment lines being 
fully utilised, may cause a shortage of raw materials requiring the 
business to be restructured and downsized and may result in a short-term 
material increase in the Group’s financial indebtedness.
the Group’s precious metal fabrication operations utilise significant 
quantities of precious metals, primarily gold by value. t hese metals are held 
predominantly on consignment under contractual arrangements whereby 
the consignor retains title to the metal and the associated risks and benefits 
of ownership, with the result that the physical metal so held is not recorded 
in the Group balance sheet. c ertain of these arrangements are uncommitted 
in that the consignor has the right, with limited or in some cases no notice, 
to demand physical return or purchase of its consigned metal. t he utilisation 
of consigned precious metals is established practice in the precious metals 
industry. should precious metals consignors decide to reduce or withdraw 
the facilities for whatever reason, or require a return of the consigned metal, 
or increased metal prices lead to the consignment arrangements becoming 
fully utilised, the Group’s precious metal fabrication operations may suffer 
shortages of raw materials requiring the business to be restructured and 
downsized in order to be able to operate within its available consignment 
facilities. in the short term this may require precious metals to be purchased, 
which could materially increase the Group’s financial indebtedness pending 
completion of the downsizing.
The Group’s worldwide operations and businesses may be adversely 
affected by various political, legal, regulatory and other developments in 
countries in which it operates.
t he Group is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those 
covering taxation and environmental matters; and political risks including 
the imposition of trade barriers, changes of regulatory requirements, lack 
of protection for intellectual property rights and the volatility of input 
costs, selling prices, taxes and currencies. in particular, operating within 
the rapidly evolving emerging nations can expose the Group’s businesses 
to significant local risks and challenges. Future global political, legal or 
regulatory developments concerning Group businesses may affect their 
ability to operate and to operate profitably in the affected jurisdictions. 
should Group businesses fail to comply with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements, this may result in a financial loss or restriction on their ability 
to operate.
the Group’s businesses are subject to a variety of operational risks, 
including natural catastrophe, terrorist action, theft, fraud and, particularly 
in emerging nations, insufficient supply of high-quality local management 
and technical personnel. if any of the operational risks materialise to a 
significant extent, this could result in a substantial interruption to a facility, 
loss of future insurance cover, a potential loss of customers and revenue 
and financial loss.
 mITIGATION
 
 
 
 
cookson has successfully maintained precious metal consignment 
arrangements of this nature for over 20 years. the Group has close 
commercial relationships with its group of consignor banks. management 
seeks to operate the business at all times with appropriate headroom within 
the consignment facilities, taking account of anticipated levels of business 
activity and precious metals prices. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As part of its planning process before entering a new market or territory, 
or expanding in an existing market or territory, the Group undertakes a 
rigorous assessment of the risks involved. in addition, the spread of the 
Group’s major businesses, both geographically and by end-market served, 
provides some protection to the Group should any of its businesses be 
adversely impacted by legal, regulatory or other changes in an individual 
market or territory.
t he Group has in place an insurance programme covering all of its businesses 
which provides an acceptable level of coverage for the operational risks 
which they face.

RISK AND ImPACT
The Group’ s financial position and trading results may be adversely affected 
by fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates or the rate of inflation.
the Group has no control over changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates, or inflation and interest rates. in the normal course of business, many 
transactions are carried out by Group businesses in currencies other than 
their reporting currency, leading to transactional foreign exchange risk, 
although this is not material for the Group overall. t he Group is exposed to 
the effect of translating the results and net assets of its overseas subsidiaries 
into sterling. significant fluctuations in the value of currencies in which it 
operates, in interest rates, or in rates of inflation may adversely impact the 
Group’s financial position, results of operations and ability to comply with 
its financial covenants. 
The Group may lose customers to competitors with new or alternative 
technologies if its businesses either do not adequately adapt to market 
developments or are unable to protect, maintain and enforce their 
intellectual property.
t he markets in which many of the Group’s businesses operate can experience 
rapid changes due to the introduction of new technologies. the Group’s 
continued success depends upon its ability to continue to develop and produce 
new and enhanced products and services on a cost-effective and timely basis 
in accordance with customer demands. if the Group fails to adequately adapt 
to market developments related to new products and technology, it could 
lose customers to suppliers with better or less costly products. throughout 
its operations, the Group relies on a combination of trade secrets, patents, 
confidentiality procedures and agreements, and copyright and trade mark 
laws to protect its proprietary rights. if the Group fails to or is unable to protect, 
maintain and enforce its existing intellectual property, this may result in the 
loss of the Group’s exclusive right to use technologies and processes which 
are included or used in its businesses. in addition, the laws of certain foreign 
countries in which the Group operates may not protect proprietary rights to 
the same extent as those of, for example, the uK or the us.
The Group’s financial condition may be materially adversely affected by 
any significant liabilities for any defects of its products or services.
if a product of the Group or of one of the Group’s industrial customers does 
not conform to agreed specifications or is otherwise defective, the Group may 
be subject to claims by its customers arising from end-product defects, injury 
to individuals or other such claims. Legal claims have been brought against 
certain Group companies by third parties alleging that persons have been 
harmed by exposure to hazardous materials used by those companies in the 
manufacture of industrial and consumer products, and further claims may be 
brought in the future. certain of the Group’s subsidiaries are subject to suits, 
predominantly in the us, relating to a small number of products containing 
asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by the 
Group. these suits usually also name many other product manufacturers. to 
date, the Group is not aware of there being any liability verdicts against any of 
these subsidiaries. 
mITIGATION
t he Group attempts to manage transactional and balance sheet translation 
risks associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations through its 
hedging and funding policies and it is Group policy that foreign currency 
transaction exposures that are material at an individual operating unit 
level are hedged using appropriate instruments such as forward foreign 
exchange contracts. For its key operating currencies, the Group broadly 
matches the currency profile of its borrowings with the currencies of its asset 
base, but does not hedge translational impact on the income statements of 
overseas subsidiaries. Where appropriate, the Group manages its interest 
rate exposures using interest rate swaps or other instruments.
 
 
cookson invests significant amounts in research and development and 
endeavours to sustain its competitive advantage and take appropriate action 
to ensure that its cost base remains competitive. in 2010, total research and 
development spend was £38.1m, equivalent to 1.5% of revenue.
the Group applies for patents over its major products, technologies and 
processes in a number of jurisdictions, including in europe and the us. 
new product and service offerings by competitors are regularly monitored 
and any perceived breach of a Group patent is vigorously challenged. to 
the extent possible, the Group avoids holding key intellectual property in 
countries which do not afford an acceptable degree of legal protection to 
the Group.
 
 
 
 
 
the Board believes that, taking into account legal advice received, the 
Group’s insurance arrangements, indemnification provided by former 
owners of certain of the subsidiaries impacted and financial provisions, 
none of the currently pending or potential claims will, either individually 
or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on the Group’s financial 
position and results of operations.  30

cash balances and borrowings are included in notes 18, 19 and 36 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
t he Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the Group for a period 
in excess of twelve months from the date of approval of the 2010 financial 
statements. these forecasts reflect an assessment of current and future 
end-market conditions and their impact on the Group’s future trading 
performance. the forecasts completed on this basis show that the Group 
will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and 
show continued compliance with the company’s financial covenants. 
On the basis of the exercise described above and the Group’s available 
committed debt facilities, the Directors consider that the Group and 
c ompany have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the forseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the c ompany.
DIVIDENDS
the Board is recommending a final dividend in respect of 2010 of  
11.5p per ordinary share which, if approved, will be paid on 6 June 2011 to 
shareholders on the register at 20 may 2011. no final dividend for the 2009 
financial year was recommended to shareholders and no interim dividend 
was declared for 2009 or 2010. 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
A responsibility statement of the Directors and a statement by the

c ompany and to authorise the Directors to determine its remuneration are 
to be proposed at the AGm.
REmUNERATION mATTERS
t he Directors’ Remuneration Report appears on pages 35 to 44. none of the 
executive Directors’ contracts contains any change of control provisions.
REmUNERATION OF THE CHAIRmAN AND  
NON-ExECUTIVE DIRECTORS
the Board considers the remuneration policy for the non-executive 
Directors. non-executive Directors’ fees have not been increased during 
the year and remain at £40,000 per annum. A supplementary fee is payable 
to the chairman of the Audit c ommittee of £15,000 per annum and the 
chairman of the Remuneration c ommittee receives a supplementary fee 
of £10,000 per annum. A supplementary fee of £5,000 per annum is also

to the supplementary fees payable. t he chairman is paid a fee of £164,000 
p.a. the chairman’s remuneration, which is subject to periodic review, is 
determined by the Remuneration committee. there has been no change 
to the chairman’s remuneration since his appointment to the role in may 
2010. neither the chairman, who is not an executive Director, nor the other 
non-executive Directors are members of the Group’s pension plans, nor do 
they participate in the Group’s incentive schemes.
DIRECTORS
messrs Beeston, Butterworth, Harris, Hewitt, Hill, Oosterveld, perry, salmon, 
sussens and Wanecq all served as Directors of the c ompany during the year. 
mr Beeston retired from the Board at the close of the AGm on 13 may 2010. 
messrs Hill and Wanecq were appointed as Directors on 1 February 2010 
and mr Harris was appointed on 1 April 2010. Biographical information 
for all the current Directors of the company is given on page 21. All the 
Directors will retire at the AGm and, with the exception of mr perry, all will 
offer themselves for election. mr perry will step down from the Board at the 
close of the AGm. Further information on the contractual arrangements of 
the executive Directors is given on page 41. t he non-executive Directors do 
not have service agreements.
LEGAL mATTERS
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group secretary. t here 
is also an agreed procedure in place for Directors, in the furtherance of their 
duties, to take independent legal advice if necessary, at the c ompany’ s expense.
DIRECTORS’ INDEmNITIES
to the extent permitted by section 236 of the companies Act 2006, the 
Directors have been granted Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
by the company and the Directors of the Group’s uK pension plan trustee 
Board have been granted Qualifying pension scheme indemnity provisions 
by cookson pension plans trustees Ltd. these indemnities were in force 
throughout the last financial year and remain in force.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
provisions in the company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to 
consider and, if thought fit, to authorise situations where a Director has 
an interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the 
c ompany (“situational c onflicts”). t he Board has established a formal system 
for Directors to declare situational c onflicts so that they can be considered 
for authorisation by the remaining members of the Board. in deciding 
whether to authorise a situational c onflict, the non-conflicted Directors are 
required to act in the way they consider would be most likely to promote 
the success of the company, and they may impose limits or conditions 
when giving authorisation or subsequently if they think this is appropriate. 
t he Group secretary minutes the consideration of any conflict and records 
any authorisations granted. the Board believes that the systems it has in 
place for reporting situational c onflicts continue to operate effectively.
EmPLOYmENT POLICIES
A fundamental concept embodied in the c ompany’s c ode of c onduct is that 
c ookson’ s goals can only be met through the efforts of its employees. c ookson 
recognises that job satisfaction requires working environments that motivate 
employees to be productive and innovative and provide opportunities for 
employee training and development to maximise personal potential and 
develop careers within the Group. cookson is managed on a decentralised 
basis and within each division it is the responsibility of the relevant divisional 
chief executive to adopt employment policies and practices that best suit the 
size, style and geographical location of their operations.
this management structure allows the Group’s operations to respond 
competitively to changes in the marketplace and to develop and retain 
a strong sense of identity whilst benefiting from being a part of a major 
international Group. c ookson values the involvement of its employees and 
keeps them informed on matters affecting them as employees and factors 
relevant to Group performance. it is established policy throughout c ookson 
that decisions on recruitment, career development, training, promotion 
and other employment-related issues are made solely on the grounds of 
individual ability, achievement, expertise and conduct. these principles 
are operated on a non-discriminatory basis. cookson gives full and fair 
consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons. 
should an employee become disabled during their employment with 
c ookson, every effort is made to enable them to continue their service with 
the Group. 32

DIRECTORS’ REPORT continued
PENSIONS
in each country in which the Group operates, the pension arrangements 
in place are considered to be consistent with good employment  
practice in that particular area. independent advisers are used to ensure that 
the plans are operated in accordance with local legislation and the rules of 
each plan. Group policy prohibits direct investment of pension fund assets 
in the company’s shares. Outside the uK, us, Germany, the netherlands 
and Belgium, the majority of pension plans in the Group are of a defined 
contribution nature.
t he Group’s main us defined benefit plans are closed to new entrants and 
have ceased providing future benefits accrual, with all eligible employees 
instead being provided with benefits through a defined contribution plan.
During 2010, the uK defined benefit and defined contribution plans were 
closed to future benefit accrual and a new Group personal pension plan was 
implemented in their place to provide defined contribution benefits for all 
eligible uK employees.
For the Group’s closed uK defined benefit and defined contribution plans 
a trustee Board exists comprising employees, former employees and an 
independent trustee. t he Board currently comprises seven trustee directors, 
of whom three are member nominated. t he administration of each plan is 
outsourced. t he company is mindful of its obligations under the pensions 
Act 2004 and of the need to comply with the guidance issued by the pensions 
Regulator. Regular dialogue is maintained between the company and the 
t rustee Board of the uK plans to ensure that both c ompany and t rustee are 
apprised of the same financial and other information about the Group and 
the plans. t his is pertinent to each being able to contribute to the effective 
functioning of the plans. t he c ompany currently has in place a schedule of 
contributions, agreed with the t rustee Board, which aims to reduce to zero 
the deficit existing on the uK defined benefit plan as at 31 December 2009 
by February 2016. t he adequacy of this schedule of contributions will be 
monitored over time, so as to assess the need for it to be modified in the 
light of changes in the deficit position. All us retirement plan assets are held 
in trust for the exclusive benefit of plan participants and their beneficiaries. 
An independent financial institution acts as the t rustee. t he trust assets are 
protected by law and by Federal Government Regulation and are subject to 
annual audit by an independent accountant, the internal Revenue service 
and the Department of Labor. Further details of pension arrangements are 
given in note 38 on pages 91 to 98.
DONATIONS
Donations in the uK and Group for charitable purposes each totalled £nil 
(2009: £nil). in accordance with c ompany policy, no political donations were 
made in either 2010 or 2009.
CREDITOR PAYmENT POLICY
each operating company in the Group is responsible for agreeing the terms 
and conditions under which business transactions with their suppliers 
are conducted. it is Group policy that payments to suppliers are made in 
accordance with these terms, provided that the supplier is also complying 
with all relevant terms and conditions.
in the accounts of the company as at 31 December 2010, the number of 
days’ purchases outstanding was 18 (2009: 16 days).
ESSENTIAL CONTRACTS OR ARRANGEmENTS wITH CUSTOmERS, 
CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS
t he c ompany is required to disclose any contractual or other arrangements 
with customers, contractors and suppliers which it considers are essential 
to its business. the company has a number of contractual arrangements 
in support of its business activities. Whilst the loss of some of these 
arrangements may cause temporary disruption, none is considered to be 
essential in the context of c ookson’s business as a whole. 
CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS
t he terms of the Group’s committed bank facility and us private placement 
Loan notes contain provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise 
termination or other rights in the event of a change of control on takeover 
of the company. A number of other arrangements to which the company 
and its subsidiaries are party, such as other debt arrangements and share 
incentive plans, may alter or terminate on a change of control in the event of 
a takeover. in the context of the Group as a whole, these other arrangements 
are not considered to be significant. 
SHARE CAPITAL
As at the date of this report, the company had an issued share capital of 
276,435,881 ordinary shares of £1 each, being the total number of c ookson 
Group plc shares with voting rights. t he company currently has only one 
class of shares.
in 2009 the company conducted a rights issue. Ordinary shareholders on 
the share register at the close of business on 13 February 2009 were offered, 
by way of a rights issue, 2,551m 10p ordinary shares on the basis of 12 new 
10p ordinary shares for each existing 10p ordinary share held. t hese shares 
were fully subscribed, resulting in total proceeds on issue of £241m, net of 
expenses.
Following the increase in the company’s issued share capital as a result 
of the rights issue, the Directors considered it desirable to consolidate 
the ordinary shares of the company. At the company’s AGm in 2009, 
shareholders approved a share consolidation, which took effect following 
the close of business on that same date. the 2,763.9m existing ordinary 
shares of 10p in issue were consolidated into new ordinary shares on the 
basis of ten 10p ordinary shares for one new ordinary share, to create 276m 
new ordinary shares of £1 each.  33

Details of movements in the c ompany’s issued share capital during 2010 are 
given in note 13 to the c ompany financial statements on page 111.
the company operates a number of share-based incentive plans (further 
details about these are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report). For the 
majority of these plans the company can satisfy entitlements either by the 
acquisition of existing shares or by the issue of new shares. existing shares are 
held in an employee share ownership trust (“esOp”). t he trustee of the esOp 
purchases shares in the open market as required, to enable the company to 
meet liabilities for the provision of existing shares to satisfy awards that vest. 
t he trustee does not register votes in respect of these shares.
Adjustments were made to outstanding share-based incentives as 
appropriate following the rights issue, including to the number of shares 
granted under options and awards and to the exercise price, if any, of 
those options and awards, and any relevant performance conditions. such 
adjustments were made in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan 
and, where required by the relevant plan rules, adjustments were made with 
the prior approval of Hm Revenue & c ustoms and/or the c ompany’s Auditor. 
since the year-end, 4,541 ordinary shares have been issued as a result of 
exercises of options granted under the company’s share option schemes. 
Resolutions giving the Directors the authority to allot further shares and 
make allotments of shares to persons other than existing shareholders in 
certain circumstances will again be proposed at the AGm.
ADDITIONAL INFORmATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS
set out below is a summary of certain provisions of the c ompany’s current 
Articles of Association (“Articles”) and applicable english law concerning 
companies (the companies Act 2006, the “companies Act”). this is a 
summary only and the relevant provisions of the Articles or the c ompanies 
Act should be consulted if further information is required.
AUTHORITY FOR PURCHASE OF OwN SHARES
subject to the provisions of company law and any other applicable 
regulations, the company may purchase its own shares. At the 2010 AGm, 
shareholders gave the company renewed authority to make market 
purchases of up to a maximum of 10% at that time of the company’s issued 
ordinary share capital. As at the date of this report, the c ompany has made no 
such purchases under this authority. t he Directors believe it advisable to seek 
renewal of this authority at each AGm. t he company’s Articles specify that, 
subject to the authorisation of an appropriate resolution passed by a general 
meeting of the c ompany, Directors can allot relevant securities under s ection 
551 of the c ompanies Act, up to the aggregate nominal amount specified by 
that Act. in addition, the Articles state that the Directors can seek the authority 
of shareholders in general meeting to allot equity securities for cash without 
first being required to offer such shares to existing ordinary shareholders in 
proportion to their existing holdings in connection with a rights issue and 
in other circumstances up to an aggregate nominal amount as specified in 
section 561 of the c ompanies Act.
TRANSFER OF SHARES
All transfers of shares which are in certificated form may be effected by transfer 
in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form acceptable to 
the Directors and may be under hand only. t he instrument of transfer shall 
be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and (except in the case of fully 
paid shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. t he transferor will remain the 
holder of the shares concerned until the name of the transferee is entered 
in the share register. All instruments of transfer which are registered may be 
retained by the company. t he Directors may dispense with the execution of 
the instrument of transfer by the transferee in any case in which they think fit 
in their discretion to do so. All transfers of shares which are in uncertificated 
form may be effected by means of the cRest system. 
t he Directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer relating 
to shares in certificated form unless it is in respect of only one class of share 
and is lodged (duly stamped if required) at the place where the c ompany’s 
share register is located accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) 
and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show 
the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if the instrument of 
transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that 
person so to do). in the case of a transfer by a recognised clearing house, or 
by a nominee of a recognised clearing house or of a recognised investment 
exchange, the lodgement of share certificates will only be necessary if and 
to the extent that certificates have been issued in respect of the shares in 
question. the Directors may, in the case of shares in certificated form, in 
their absolute discretion refuse to register any transfer of shares (not being 
fully paid shares) provided that such discretion may not be exercised in such 
a way as to prevent dealings in the shares of that class from taking place 
on an open and proper basis. t he Directors may also refuse to register an 
allotment or transfer of shares (whether fully paid or not) in favour of more 
than four persons jointly. if the Directors refuse to register an allotment or 
transfer of shares they shall within two months after the date on which the 
letter of allotment or instrument of transfer was lodged with the c ompany 
or the operator instruction was received by the company (in the case of 
shares held in uncertificated form) send to the allottee or transferee notice 
of the refusal.
A shareholder does not generally need to obtain the approval of the 
company, or of other shareholders of shares in the c ompany, for a transfer 
to take place.
t he Articles contain certain restrictions on the number of us persons who 
hold shares in the c ompany so as to have enabled the c ompany to suspend 
its obligations under the us s ecurities exchange Act of 1934 and to prevent 
any such obligations from arising again in the future. 34

VOTING RIGHTS
subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or restrictions 
attached to any class of shares, at a shareholders’ meeting, every shareholder 
who is present in person and every duly appointed proxy shall have one 
vote on a show of hands, and on a poll every shareholder who is present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share of which he or 
she is the holder. in the case of joint holders of a share the vote of the senior 
holder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted 
to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders and for this purpose 
seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the 
share register. A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at a shareholders’ 
meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy or proxies to exercise all or any of his 
or her rights to attend and speak and vote in his or her place. A shareholder 
may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting provided 
that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different 
share or shares held by the shareholder. proxies need not be shareholders of 
the company. For the purposes of determining which persons are entitled 
to attend or vote at a meeting and how many votes such person may cast, 
the c ompany may specify in the notice of the meeting a time, not more than 
48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting, by which a person must be 
entered on the share register in order to have the right to attend or vote at 
the meeting.
RESTRICTIONS ON SHARES
t he Board may withhold payment of all or any part of dividends or other 
monies payable in respect of the company’s shares from a person with 
0.25% interest or more if such person has been served with a notice after 
failure to provide the company with information concerning interest in 
those shares required to be provided under the c ompanies Act.
VARIATION OF RIGHTS
subject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached to any class of 
shares may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not less than 
three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the 
sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the 
holders of those shares. At every such separate general meeting the quorum 
shall be two persons holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in 
nominal value of the issued shares of the class. t he rights conferred upon 
the holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in 
the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation 
or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING
no shareholder shall, unless the Directors otherwise determine, be entitled 
in respect of any share held by him or her to vote either personally or by 
proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to exercise any other right conferred 
by membership in relation to shareholders’ meetings if any call or other 
sum presently payable by him or her to the company in respect of that 
share remains unpaid. in addition, if any shareholder, or any other person 
appearing to be interested in shares held by such shareholder, has been 
duly served with a notice to provide the company with information under 
section 793 of the companies Act and has failed to do so within 14 days, 
then (unless the Directors otherwise determine) the shareholder shall not 
(for so long as the default continues) be entitled to attend or vote either 
personally or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to exercise any other 
right conferred by membership in relation to shareholders’ meetings.
APPOINTmENT AND REPLACEmENT OF DIRECTORS

Any such Director shall only hold office until the next AGm and shall then 
be eligible for election.

DIRECTORS’ REmUNERATION REPORT
t he Remuneration c ommittee (“the c ommittee”) is responsible for setting the appropriate remuneration for the chairman, the executive Directors and the 
Group s ecretary, and recommending and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management, being the first layer of management 
below Board level. it also oversees the operation of the Group’s executive share incentive plans. A copy of the c ommittee’s terms of Reference is available 
on the c ompany’s website, www.cooksongroup.co.uk. 
t he current members of the committee are all the non-executive Directors, namely Jeff Hewitt, peter Hill, Jan Oosterveld, Barry perry and John sussens, 
who also chairs the committee. messrs Hewitt, Oosterveld, perry and sussens served as members of the c ommittee throughout 2010. mr Hill joined the 
c ommittee upon his appointment to the Board on 1 February 2010. All the members of the c ommittee are deemed to be independent. t he Group s ecretary 
acts as c ommittee secretary. t he chairman, chief executive and Group Finance Director are invited to attend c ommittee meetings as appropriate but do 
not participate in discussions of their own remuneration. 
in formulating its policies and deciding individual remuneration levels, the c ommittee was advised during the year by the chief executive and the Group 
s ecretary, by the external advisers Kepler Associates (“Kepler”), Hewitt new Bridge s treet (“HnBs ”) and towers Watson (“towers”), and the law firms clifford 
chance LLp (“cc ”) and mcDermott Will & emery uK LLp (“mWe”). Kepler, HnBs and mWe were appointed directly by the c ommittee and cc and t owers were 
appointed by the company on the committee’s behalf. towers’ advice to the committee related specifically to the provision of remuneration data for the 
role of ceO, c eramics division. in addition, towers provides remuneration advice to the c eramics division. HnBs provides share award valuation advice to 
the c ompany and cc provides legal advice to the c ompany. mWe and Kepler provide no other services to the company. 
REmUNERATION POLICY FOR ExECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
t he remuneration policy of the c ompany aims to establish a remuneration structure for executive Directors and other senior managers in the Group which:
	 attracts and retains high calibre executives;
	 aligns management’s interests with those of shareholders, by incentivising management to enhance shareholder value; and
	 fosters a high performance culture, linking a substantial portion of remuneration to performance by providing management with the opportunity to 
earn competitive remuneration through variable based pay.
in formulating remuneration policy, the c ommittee has regard to the international scale and nature of the Group’s operations and takes into consideration 
the requirements of the code and guidelines issued by its leading shareholders and bodies such as the Association of British insurers (“ABi”) and the 
national Association of pension Funds. t he c ommittee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when determining 
Directors’ remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases.
t he c ommittee is cognisant of the need to ensure that the remuneration policy is firmly linked to the Group’ s strategy, including its risk management philosophy. 
the Board has set a strategy with the objective to grow earnings in both the short-term and longer-term with the intention of delivering above average 
shareholder returns in the medium to long-term. t his is set out on page 5. t his strategy is underpinned by the three-year plan which translates the strategy 
into operational targets. t he remuneration policy incentivises and rewards executives to deliver their contribution to the achievement of the Group’s strategy 
through the combination of short-term incentives targeted at business and Group performance and long-term incentives targeted at Group performance.
more than half of the executive Directors’ total remuneration is based on the variable, performance-related elements of the Annual incentive and the Long-
term incentive plan (“Ltip ”) where the targets focus on key business imperatives such as Headline earnings (represented by Headline profit attributable to 
owners of the parent, as shown on page 74), relative total shareholder Return (“ tsR”), defined as the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested 
dividends, and Headline earnings per share (“Headline eps ” , as defined on page 61). t hese targets are objective, auditable and transparent and as such are 
considered to be appropriate performance measures for management. 
to ensure that their interests are aligned with those of shareholders, executive Directors are required to build a significant stake in the company in 
accordance with the c ompany’s share retention guidelines. At the year-end, all executive Directors substantially exceeded this shareholding guideline. 
t he following illustrates the balance between fixed and variable remuneration for the executive Directors based on the remuneration policy for 2011:

the committee evaluates the efficacy of the Group’s executive remuneration policy each year and commissions more formal reviews as it considers 
appropriate. As part of its most recent review of the Group’s remuneration strategy for executive Directors and in order to reinforce the Group’s risk 
management controls, the committee has introduced clawback arrangements for the executive Directors, divisional ceOs and Group secretary. in the 
event that a misstatement is identified in the Group’s consolidated financial statements which requires the restatement of a prior year’s accounts in order 
to ensure compliance with the requirements of international Financial Reporting standards, then any variable executive remuneration resulting from the 
misstatement would be subject to clawback provisions at the discretion of the committee. t hese arrangements are to be applied in respect of the 2011 
Annual incentive, the 2011 Ltip awards, and their respective equivalents in future years. 
in addition, to align the Ltip even more closely with the Group’s strategy the c ommittee has decided, following consultation with the company’s major 
shareholders, to amend the eps performance condition for future Ltip awards, including the 2011 award. i nstead of a uK inflation adjusted percentage 
growth target the c ommittee will set an actual Headline eps performance target for each three-year performance period. For the 2011 award the c ompany 
reported Headline eps at the end of the period (year ending 31 December 2013) must be 82.0 pence for any payout to be achieved and 98.5 pence for the 
maximum payout to be made. t hese targets are equivalent to a 10%–17% annual eps compound growth range, or 33%–60% over the three-year period. 
t here is pro rata vesting on a straight-line basis where Headline eps is between 82.0 pence and 98.5 pence. t he c ommittee concluded that there was very 
little justification for continuing to utilise a uK-based inflation factor given the very small level of Group activity in the uK and that an absolute eps target 
expressed in pence would give a clearer “line of sight” to management.

DIALOGUE wITH SHAREHOLDERS
t he company is committed to open and transparent dialogue with its shareholders on remuneration as well as other matters. As a matter of course the 
committee consults with key institutional shareholders and various representative bodies about any proposed changes to the incentive arrangements 
of the company’s executive Directors. Following the 2010 AGm and as part of the ongoing commitment to maintain open dialogue, the chair of the 
committee met with major shareholders to obtain detailed feedback on the remuneration policy and to provide an opportunity to discuss any matters 
arising. t he c ommittee will carefully consider the views expressed when reviewing, setting and communicating future policy. 
KEY FEATURES OF THE ExECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REmUNERATION
ANNUAL EmOLUmENTS 
salary levels are reviewed annually and set to reflect individual contribution, experience and Group financial performance. t he committee takes account 
of the pay environment for employees within the Group. c onsideration is also given to levels paid in similar companies. Following the salary freeze applied 
in 2009, the executive Directors were awarded salary increases of 2% in 2010. With effect from 1 January 2011, messrs salmon and Wanecq were awarded 
increases of 2.5% in line with increases paid to other Group executives. As a result, messrs s almon’s and Wanecq’s current salaries are £540,105 and €632,528 
respectively. t he salary paid to mr Butterworth has historically been below the market median. in recognition of his personal performance and the strong 
Group financial results, the c ommittee considered it to be an appropriate time to increase his salary towards the median. Accordingly, mr Butterworth has 
been awarded an increase of 4.5% in respect of 2011 taking his annual salary to £334,160.  
Benefits in kind receivable by messrs Butterworth, s almon and Wanecq principally comprise company car allowances, life assurance and medical insurance. 
t hese benefits are similar to those provided to other Group executives in the uK.  
ANNUAL INCENTIVE 
in line with the Group’s other senior executives, the executive Directors are eligible to receive an Annual incentive calculated as a percentage of base salary 
and based on achievement against specified financial targets. each year the committee establishes the financial performance criteria for the forthcoming 
year. t hese criteria are set by reference to the Group’s financial budget and prior year actual financial results. t he target range is set to ensure that maximum 
bonuses are only paid for significantly exceeding market expectations. the committee considers that the setting and attainment of these targets is 
important in the context of achievement of the Group’s longer-term strategic goals.
For the financial year 2010, the executive Directors’ Annual incentives were based on Group Headline earnings performance, the calculation of which 
is shown in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. messrs Butterworth’s and salmon’s Annual incentives were assessed solely against this 
criterion, whilst half of mr Wanecq’s Annual incentive was assessed against this criterion and the remainder based upon the divisional trading profit of the 
c eramics division adjusted for performance against a key operating cash flow target. As stated in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, the maximum 
annual bonus potential for mr salmon was increased from 100% to 150% of salary in 2010. t he percentage of salary paid for target performance remained 
unchanged at 50% ensuring that increased bonus payments are only made for above target performance. Any payout over 100% of salary will be payable in 
deferred shares under the rules of c ookson’s Deferred share Bonus plan (further information about this plan is given on page 40). t hese shares would vest 
on the third anniversary of their award date, although they will lapse if mr salmon ceases employment with the c ompany before the end of the three-year 
period other than in certain circumstances permitted under the plan rules, such as retirement. t he maximum annual bonus potential remained at 100% of 
salary for messrs Butterworth and Wanecq in 2010 with 50% of salary payable at target.
in 2010, the Group’s performance exceeded the maximum Headline earnings target and the ceramics division’s performance exceeded the maximum 
trading profit target (as adjusted for cash flow performance) and so annual bonuses equivalent to 100% of base salary will be paid to messrs Butterworth 
and Wanecq for 2010, and equivalent to 150% of base salary will be paid to mr salmon. mr salmon will receive a payment equivalent to 100% of his base 
salary in cash and will receive a deferred share award equivalent to 50% of his base salary. t hese annual bonus payments are reported in the Directors’ 
remuneration table on page 42. 
the committee has determined that for 2011 messrs Butterworth’s and salmon’s Annual incentives will again be based on Group Headline earnings and 
mr Wanecq’s Annual incentive will be based 50% on Group Headline earnings and 50% on the ceramics division’s trading profit (adjusted for cash flow 
performance). t heir maximum bonus potential will remain unchanged at 150% of salary for mr s almon and 100% of salary for messrs Butterworth and Wanecq. 38

LONG-TERm INCENTIVE PLAN (“LTIP”) AND OTHER SHARE INCENTIVE PLANS 
t he Ltip rewards executives for delivering superior tsR, defined as the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, and (from 2007 
onwards) Headline eps growth over a set period of time, and as such is intended to align executive remuneration with shareholders’ interests. 
t he Ltip has two elements: firstly, executive Directors are eligible to receive a conditional annual allocation of shares worth up to 100% of base salary 
(“performance shares”); secondly, executive Directors can elect to invest all or part of their Annual i ncentive in ordinary shares of the c ompany (“investment 
shares”) in return for which they receive a conditional allocation of shares worth up to 2.25 times the pre-tax equivalent of the Annual i ncentive so invested 
(“matching share Award”). t he chief executive’s maximum investment in the matching share element of the Ltip is capped at an annual bonus equivalent 
to 100% of base salary.
in 2010, each executive Director received an allocation under the Ltip equal to 100% of salary, as shown on page 43. i n accordance with the rules of the 
Ltip, messrs Butterworth, salmon and Wanecq chose to use their Annual incentive award to purchase investment shares and received additional matching 
shares in respect of this investment. t hese matching shares may vest after three years, conditional upon the achievement of the performance targets 
described below.
During the year, the Remuneration committee reviewed the use of tsR and Headline eps as the basis for the Ltip performance conditions. it remained 
satisfied that they continue to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance for the executive Directors at this point. many investors regard 
tsR as an important indication of both earnings and capital growth relative to other Ftse 250 companies. t he committee has considered using a sector 
comparator group for measuring tsR performance, but given the lack of direct competitors deems it to be inappropriate. u se of tsR ensures that the value 
of awards vesting reflects improvement in the company’s performance over the relevant period. Headline eps is a key indicator of long-term financial 
performance and value creation. 
Following the most recent review, the criterion applicable to the Headline eps element of the performance condition has been changed. t he new condition 
is that the Group will have to achieve an actual eps performance target for the three-year performance period. For the 2011 award the c ompany reported 
eps at the end of the period (year ending 31 December 2013) must be 82.0 pence for any payout to be achieved and 98.5 pence for the maximum payout to 
be made. t he c ommittee will continue to review the measures as it sees fit to ensure that the Ltip rewards true value creation and sustainable performance 
going forward.
t he rules of the Ltip allow shares purchased by executives under a rights issue to be designated as investment shares and qualify for a matching share 
Award. t he value of the matching share Award relating to shares purchased under a rights issue is, as with any other matching share Award, increased as 
if the executive had invested a pre-tax amount in shares under the rights issue. in respect of the 2009 Ltip awards, the c ommittee specified that the total 
annual maximum value of investment shares (however sourced) that could qualify for a matching share Award was subject to an overall limit of 100% of 
base salary. subject to this limit, shares purchased by executives using any Annual incentive could continue to count as investment shares and qualify for 
a matching share Award in addition to any shares purchased in the rights issue which were designated as investment shares. in addition to the overall 
limit, the c ommittee decided in consultation with major shareholders that only 63% of shares taken up under the 2009 rights issue could be designated as 
investment shares under the Ltip in recognition of the significantly discounted price of the shares issued in the rights issue. Finally, the c ommittee further 
specified that the executive Directors be required to retain all of the cookson shares that they held at the time of the 2009 rights issue for a period of 36 
months after the rights issue in order for a matching share Award based on shares purchased in the rights issue to be able to vest. 
t he c ommittee has the discretion to award participants the dividends that would have been paid on the number of shares that vest in respect of dividend 
record dates occurring during the period between the award date and the date of vesting. 
performance shares and matching share Awards made in 2008, 2009 and 2010 vest after three years. t he proportion of shares vesting is based on the 
c ompany’s performance against specified performance conditions. Vesting of 50% of shares awarded is based upon the Group’s three-year tsR performance 
relative to that of the companies of its comparator group, the Ftse 250 excluding i nvestment t rusts, and 50% on Headline eps (the calculation of which is 
shown in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements) growth over a three-year period. t he two measures operate independently. 
the committee is proposing to grant future Ltip awards, including for 2011, to some participants as nil-cost options. these options would become 
exercisable, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance conditions, three years after their award, and would then remain exercisable until 
the fifth anniversary of their award. t his would allow each participant the flexibility to decide when to exercise their awards rather than the shares being 
subject to a one-off vesting date on the third anniversary of their award.

Vesting of 50% of performance shares and matching share Awards under the 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 Ltip awards is based on tsR performance in

Vesting of 50% of performance shares and matching share Awards under the 2008, 2009 and 2010 Ltip awards is based on Headline eps growth, as

matching share Awards will only vest if the i nvestment shares originally purchased have been retained. 
t he committee obtains independent external advice to assess whether the company has met the tsR performance condition at the end of the relevant 
performance period and to confirm that the companies which make up the index and the measurement of the company’s performance are both in 
accordance with the rules of the Ltip. measurement of the Group’s tsR takes place over a performance period commencing on the first day of c ookson’s 
financial year in which the award is granted. tsR is measured as the percentage increase in a return index for cookson and each comparator company 
between the beginning and end of the performance period. t he return index at the beginning of the performance period is the average of the return index 
on each weekday in the three-month period prior to the start of the performance period. t he same three-month averaging method is used to ascertain the 
return index at the end of the performance period. t he companies are then ranked, in descending order, according to their tsR. i f c ookson is ranked at or 
above the median of the comparator group then a proportion of the awards is eligible to vest. 
t he Group’s Headline eps is calculated on a consistent basis and the c ommittee has the discretion to adjust for exceptional items as it deems appropriate. 
Growth in Headline eps is the annualised percentage growth over the performance period. Headline eps for the base year — i.e. the calendar year prior to 
the award date — is compared with the final year — i.e. the calendar year three years after the base year. For the 2008, 2009 and 2010 Ltip awards this was 
expressed as compound annual growth, above the compound annual growth in Rpi. 
the performance period applicable to the awards made in 2008 ended on 31 December 2010. the company’s tsR performance during this three-
year performance period was assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the company’s performance was below median. 
the portion of the 2008 Ltip awards that was based on tsR will therefore lapse on the vesting date of 31 m arch 2011. However, the company did 
meet the eps performance condition; the company’s annual compound Headline eps growth was assessed for the three-year performance period 
as being more than 10% above Rpi. prior to the vesting of any award, the committee stipulates that, as an additional hurdle, it needs to be satisfied 
that vesting has been justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period. Having carefully considered 
the Group’s performance over the three-year period, and taking into account the significant improvement in the Group’s financial results during 
the past year, the committee concluded that the vesting of the Headline eps element of the 2008 Ltip awards is justified by the underlying financial 
performance of the Group. Accordingly, 100% of the portion of the 2008 Ltip awards that was based on Headline eps performance will vest on  
31 march 2011.  40

18548.04 24/03/2011 Proof 19
in 2009 the c ommittee adjusted the performance conditions applicable to the c ompany’s outstanding Ltip awards to take account of the c ompany’s 2009 
rights issue. t he adjustments made to the calculation of tsR, reflecting the actual behaviour of the majority of shareholders, and aligned with the executive 
Directors’ own investments, were based upon the assumption that all available rights under the c ompany’s rights issue, and any rights issues carried out by 
members of the comparator group during the performance period, were taken up in full by eligible shareholders. t he adjustments made to the calculation 
of the Headline eps performance conditions were based upon the assumption that the rights issue had taken place, on a pro forma basis, at the beginning 
of the base year, including an adjustment for notional interest on the rights issue funds received in the base year. 
in addition to the executive Directors, senior divisional and corporate executives are allocated performance shares under the Ltip and members of the 
Group’s executive c ommittee and senior corporate executives are also given the opportunity to participate in the matching share element. 
in 2007, the c ompany implemented a Deferred share Bonus plan (“DsBp”) in place of the L tip for certain senior managers. under this plan, executives receive an 
allocation of deferred shares to the value of a percentage of their annual bonus. t hese shares, which will be sourced from existing shares, vest after three years, 
although an executive’s allocation may lapse if he or she ceases employment in certain circumstances before the end of the three-year period. 
Following the company’s rights issue in 2009, the Directors approved adjustments to the number of shares granted under all outstanding options or 
awards and to any associated exercise price. Adjustments were made in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan and where required by plan rules, 
adjustments were made with the prior approval of HmRc and/or the c ompany’s Auditor. 
under the rules of the Ltip and executive share option schemes, the c ompany has the discretion to satisfy the majority of awards either by the transfer of 
existing shares or by the allotment of newly-issued shares. t he decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by the Board, which considers the most prudent 
and appropriate sourcing arrangement for the c ompany. under the executive share option schemes the c ompany granted share options, with an option 
exercise price fixed by reference to the market price prevailing at the time of grant, the exercise of which were subject to an eps performance condition. t he 
last executive share option grant was made in 2003 and the c ompany does not intend to make any further grants under the schemes. Any awards that vest 
under the DsBp are met from the transfer of existing shares. 
Further details of the awards and options outstanding under these share plans are given in note 39 to the consolidated financial statements and note 18 to 
the c ompany financial statements. 
SHARE USAGE
As at 31 December 2010, 234,619 shares were held in the c ompany’s employee share ownership trust (“esOp”). t he trustee of the esOp purchases shares in 
the open market or can subscribe for newly-issued shares as required, to meet liabilities for the provision of shares to satisfy options and awards that vest. 
c ookson share plans comply with the current ABi guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a 
ten year period in relation to the c ompany’s issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten year period on discretionary schemes. in the last 
ten years less than 1% of the c ompany’s current issued share capital has been allotted to settle obligations arising from the exercise or vesting of executive 
and all employee share incentives and thus the c ompany remains well within the limits. 
Details of the awards outstanding under the c ompany’s share plans as at 31 December 2010 and where granted as options, the associated exercise prices, 
are given in note 39.2 to the consolidated financial statements and note 15 to the c ompany financial statements.

SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES 
t he c ommittee encourages executive Directors to build and hold a shareholding in the c ompany equivalent in value to at least one times salary. t o this end, 
executive Directors will normally be expected to retain at least 50% (measured as the value after tax) of any performance or matching share Awards vesting 
under the Ltip, until this criterion has been met. 
DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS 
t he following paragraphs summarise the main terms and conditions of the contracts of the Directors: 
Executive Directors 
in line with the policy of the c ommittee, messrs Butterworth and salmon have uK service contracts which have 12 month unexpired terms and provide for 
12 months’ notice being given. mr salmon’s contract was dated 14 June 2004 and mr Butterworth’s 25 may 2005. each contract provides for compensation 
to be paid on early termination by the company based on one times salary, pension allowance and benefits payable half in a lump sum and the balance 
in six separate monthly instalments commencing six months after leaving, mitigated by any salary earned from any new paid occupation. mr Wanecq 
is contracted to Vesuvius Group nV/sA, under a Belgian services agreement dated 1 m arch 2006 for which his remuneration is in the form of fees. His 
appointment to the c ookson Group plc Board is subject to a separate appointment agreement for which no fee is payable. His termination arrangements 
are structured to effectively mirror messrs Butterworth’s and salmon’s arrangements including the notice period and mitigation obligations. 
none of the executive Directors’ contracts contain any change of control provisions and they all contain a duty to mitigate should the Director find an 
alternative paid occupation in any period during which the company must otherwise pay compensation on early termination. Other than as described 
for mr Wanecq, no Directors had any material interest in a contract of significance (other than service agreements) with the company or any subsidiary 
company during the year. 
Non-executive Directors 
in accordance with the c ode, each non-executive Director is appointed for an initial fixed term of three years subject to their election at the c ompany’s first 
Annual General meeting following their appointment and re-election at intervening Annual General meetings. t hereafter, subject to approval of the Board 
and their re-election by shareholders, they are appointed for a further three-year term.

t he chairman, m r Harris, was appointed as a non-executive Director on 1 April 2010 and succeeded mr Beeston as chairman at the conclusion of the 2010 
Annual General meeting. mr Harris was appointed for a fixed period which is due to expire at the conclusion of the Annual General meeting in 2016. During 
the first year of his appointment to the role of chairman he is entitled to 12 months’ notice from the c ompany; thereafter he is entitled to 6 months’ notice 
from the company. Any compensation for loss of office would be based upon his fee. mr Beeston was appointed on 1 April 2003 for a fixed period which 
was due to expire at the conclusion of the AGm in 2008. t his was extended in 2007 and was due to expire at the conclusion of the AGm in 2011. mr Beeston 
retired from the Board at the conclusion of the AGm in 2010. He waived his entitlement to any notice from the company. non-executive Directors are not 
entitled to receive compensation for loss of office at any time. 
All Directors are subject to retirement, and election or re-election, in accordance with the c ompany’s Articles of Association. 
t he Board sets the remuneration of the non-executive Directors after considering the role and responsibilities of each Director and the practice of other 
companies. t he non-executive Directors do not participate in Board discussions on their own remuneration. t he chairman’s remuneration is set by the 
c ommittee with reference to the fees of non-executive chairmen within two Ftse 250 comparator groups, the first focusing on sector comparators and the 
second on companies of similar size.  42

Ex TERNAL APPOINTmENTS 
executive Directors are permitted to hold positions as non-executive directors of other companies provided that these do not lead to conflicts of interest. 
t he Board sanctions each such request on a case-by-case basis. Fees received are retained by the executive Director concerned. in 2010, mr s almon received 
fees of £64,000 for his role as senior independent non-executive director of united u tilities Group plc. mr Butterworth received fees of £12,833 for his role 
as non-executive director of st ives plc.
PENSION ARRANGEmENTS 
messrs Butterworth and s almon are not entitled to participate in any of the Group’s pension arrangements. in accordance with their contracts they received

 t he interests and market prices shown have been adjusted for the rights issue which took effect in march 2009, and where applicable for the subsequent consolidation of 
the company’s ordinary shares which took effect on 15 may 2009, when every ten ordinary 10p shares held by shareholders at the close of business on 14 may 2009 were 
exchanged for one new £1 ordinary share.
2.
 in 2010 messrs Butterworth, salmon and Wanecq received potential maximum allocations of performance shares worth one times their respective base salaries. under the 
matching share award element of the Ltip they used their 2009 Annual i ncentive payments to purchase 13,631, 22,462 and 16,221 shares respectively, and received maximum 
allocations of matching share Awards based on these amounts which had a maximum potential value on the date of award equivalent to circa one times their respective base 
salaries for messrs Butterworth and salmon and circa two-thirds of base salary for mr Wanecq. t he allocations were made to messrs Butterworth, salmon and Wanecq on 7 
April 2010 and the allocations were calculated based upon the closing mid-market price of c ookson’s shares on the day before the awards were made. c ookson’s mid-market 
closing price on the 7 April 2010 was 586p.
3.
 t he mid-market closing price of c ookson’s shares ranged between 367.4p and 659.5p during 2010 and on 31 December 2010 was 658.5p.

 t he performance criteria which apply to the vesting of share allocations under the Ltip are summarised on pages 38 to 40.
5.
 t he performance period for the Ltip awards made in 2007 ended on 31 December 2009. t he company’s tsR performance during the three-year performance period was 
assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the c ompany’s performance was below median. in addition, the c ompany’s annual compound Headline 
eps growth over Rpi was assessed as being below 3% during this period. Accordingly, the 2007 Ltip awards lapsed on the third anniversary of their award.
6.
 t he performance period for the Ltip awards made in 2008 ended on 31 December 2010. t he company’s tsR performance during the three-year performance period was 
assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the c ompany’s performance was below median. t he c ompany’s annual compound Headline eps growth 
over Rpi was assessed as being above 10% during this period. t he Remuneration c ommittee has confirmed that it is satisfied that the vesting of awards under the 2008 Ltip is 
justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period. Accordingly, 100% of the half of the 2008 Ltip awards that was based on Headline 
eps performance will vest on the third anniversary of their award.

2.  ADOPTION OF NEw AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
2.1  REVISED AND AmENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS
t he following revised and amended standards and interpretations, which have all been endorsed by the eu, have been adopted by the Group in

total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
●   iFRs 1 (Revised), First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on 
or after 1 July 2009, simplifies the structure of iFRs 1 without making any technical changes.
●   Amendments to iFRs 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, which is effective for accounting periods

periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, clarifies how to apply the principles that determine whether a hedged risk or portion of cash 
flows is eligible for designation.
●   iFRic 12, Service Concession Arrangements, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 29 march 2009, clarifies existing 
requirements in relation to accounting for government sponsored infrastructure projects.

clarifies which currency exposures qualify for hedge accounting; which entity within a group can hold the hedging instrument; and how 
to determine the amounts to be reclassified from equity to profit or loss for both the hedging instrument and the hedged item when an 
investment in a foreign operation is disposed of.
●   iFRic 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010, 
clarifies how an entity should measure distributions of assets, other than cash, when it pays dividends to its owners.
●   iFRic 18, Transfers of Assets from Customers, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 november 2009, clarifies the 
accounting for arrangements where an item of property, plant and equipment provided by the customer is used to provide an ongoing service. 53

2.2  STANDARDS, AmENDmENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS THAT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE
the following revised and amended standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective and therefore have not been

or after 1 January 2011, removes the requirement for government-related entities to disclose details of transactions with the government 
and other government-related entities and clarifies and simplifies the definition of a related party.
●   Amendment to iAs 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, which has been endorsed by the eu and which is effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010, addresses the accounting for rights issues that are denominated in a currency other than 
the functional currency of the issuer.
●   Amendment to iFRic 14, IAS 19 — The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and Their Interaction, entitled

by the eu and which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011, provides relief for first-time adopters of iFRs 
from having to reconstruct transactions that occurred before their date of transition to iFRs and provides guidance for entities emerging 
from severe hyperinflation.
●   Amendments to iFRs 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which has not yet been endorsed by the eu and which is effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011, enhances the reporting of transfers of financial assets.
●   Amendments to iAs 12, Income Taxes, Deferred tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets, which has not yet been endorsed by the eu and which 
is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012, provides a practical approach for measuring deferred tax assets 
and liabilities when investment properties are measured at fair value. 54

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEmENTS
3.  SUmmARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.1  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
With the exception of certain items noted below, which are carried at fair value, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention, in accordance with the c ompanies Act 2006 and iFRs. 
3.2  BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEmENTS ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS
t he Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group.
3.3  DISCLOSURE OF ExCEPTIONAL ITEmS
iAs 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states key lines which 
should be disclosed. it also encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the reordering of items presented on the face of the income 
statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entity’s financial performance. in accordance with iAs 1, the c ompany has adopted 
a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its Group income statement the effect of any components of financial performance considered 
by the Directors to be exceptional, or for which separate disclosure would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance 
achieved and in making projections of future results.
Both materiality and the nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such presentation. such 
items may include, inter alia, amortisation charges relating to intangible assets, the financial effect of major restructuring and integration activity, 
profits or losses relating to non-current assets, gains or losses relating to employee benefits plans, finance costs, profits or losses arising on 
business disposals, and other items, including the taxation impact of the aforementioned items, which have a significant impact on the Group’s 
results either due to their size or nature.
3.4  BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
t he consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the c ompany and entities controlled by the c ompany 
(its “subsidiaries”). control exists when the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. in assessing whether control exists, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account. t he 
results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition 
or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed 
herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s interest therein. non-controlling 
interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination together with the non-controlling interests’ 
share of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income since the date of the combination. total comprehensive income is 
attributed to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
3.5  BUSINESS COmBINATIONS
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which the Group obtains 
control. the Group recognises goodwill at the acquisition date, measured as the excess of the aggregate of (i) the acquisition-date fair value of 
the consideration transferred; (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired; and (iii) in a business combination achieved in stages, the 
acquisition-date fair value of the Group’s existing equity interest in the acquiree; over the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Acquisition-related costs, with the exception of costs relating to the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed in the periods in which the 
costs are incurred. c ontingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. if the contingent consideration is classified 
as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in profit or loss. 55

3.  SUmmARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.6  REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to customers, 
after deducting sales allowances and value-added taxes. Revenue is recognised when the risk of loss transfers to the customer, depending on 
individual customer terms at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance, as appropriate. provision is made for returns 
where appropriate.
3.7  FOREIGN CURRENCIES 
t he individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
(a) Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency
t ransactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date:
(i)   Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. exchange differences arising on the 
settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement;
(ii)  non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated; and
(iii)  exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement 
except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, in which case any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
(b)  Translation from functional currency to presentational currency
When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency (pounds sterling), its results and financial 
position are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
(i)   Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date;
(ii)  income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average rates does not 
approximate the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used; and
(iii)  All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and 
are reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
(c)  Net investment in foreign operations
exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in the 
income statement in the separate financial statements of the reporting entity or the foreign operation as appropriate. in the consolidated Group 
financial statements such exchange differences are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve 
in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
3.8  EmPLOYEE BENEFITS
t he Group operates a number of pension plans, both of the defined contribution and defined benefit type.
(a)  Defined contribution pension plans
c ontributions to the Group’s defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefits expense when they fall due. prepaid contributions, 
to the extent that they result in either a cash refund or a reduction in future payments, are recognised as an asset. Outstanding contributions are 
recognised as a liability. 56

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEmENTS
3.  SUmmARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.8  EmPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
(b)  Defined benefit pension plans
t he net surplus or net liability recognised in the balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, less the fair value of the plan assets. t he defined 
benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by discounting the estimated future cash 
flows using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. 
Any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation is limited to the sum of unrecognised past service costs plus the present 
value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
pension expense for the Group’s defined benefit plans is recognised as follows:
(i)  Within trading profit:
  c urrent service cost — representing the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service 
in the current year; and
  past service cost — representing the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in prior 
periods that arises from changes made to the benefits under the plans in the current year. to the extent that the changes to benefits vest 
immediately, past service costs are recognised immediately, otherwise they are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
(ii)  Within ordinary finance costs:
  interest cost on the liabilities of the plans — calculated by reference to the plan liabilities and discount rate at the beginning of the year 
and allowing for changes during the year.
(iii) Within finance income:
  expected return on the assets of the plans — calculated by reference to the plan assets and long-term expected rate of return at the 
beginning of the year and allowing for changes during the year.
(iv) Within the Group statement of comprehensive income:
  Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans.
(v)  Gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the income statement in the same line as the item that gave 
rise to the settlement or curtailment or, if material, separately reported as a component of profit from operations.
(c)  Share-based payments
t he Group operates a number of different share-based payment arrangements for its employees of both the equity-settled and cash-settled type.
equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. t he fair value determined at the date of grant takes account 
of the effect of market-based vesting conditions, such as total shareholder Return (“tsR”), and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. t he cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the number of 
shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in Headline earnings per share, 
which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of grant. For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is 
measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model. For consistency, this method has also been used to value executive share options and 
stock appreciation rights granted to executives whose options are not subject to the additional market-based performance conditions. For all 
other grants, fair value is measured using the Black–scholes model.
For cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding 
increase in liabilities. t he fair value of the amount payable is initially measured at grant date using a form of stochastic option pricing model and 
spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. t he liability is remeasured at each balance 
sheet date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised in the income statement.
3.9  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPmENT COSTS
expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient 
resources to complete development. All other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in 
which it is incurred. c apitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.  57

3.10  FINANCE COSTS AND FINANCE INCOmE
Finance costs include: interest on loans, overdrafts, factoring arrangements and finance lease obligations; amortisation of the costs incurred in 
connection with the arrangement of borrowings; the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow 
hedges; interest on retirement benefit obligations; and the unwinding of discounts on long-term provisions. Borrowing costs that are directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its 
intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the income 
statement using the effective interest rate method.
Finance income includes: interest receivable from funds invested (including available-for-sale financial assets); the expected return from 
retirement benefit assets; and the unwinding of discounts on long-term receivables.
3.11  TAxATION
t ax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. c urrent and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that 
they relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the associated tax is also dealt with in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. t he Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or 
substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
t he carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis.
3.12 GOODwILL
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary or associate is initially recognised in accordance with the accounting policy in note 3.5 and is 
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. impairment testing is carried out annually, as described in notes 3.15, 5.2 and 
22. On disposal of a subsidiary or an associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 58

3.  SUmmARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.13 PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPmENT
Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. subsequent costs are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result 
in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is 
charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is 
available for use and is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over its 
estimated useful life as follows:
Asset category  Estimated useful life
Freehold property  between 10 and 50 years
Leasehold property  the term of the lease
plant and machinery — motor vehicles between 1 and 5 years
  — information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years
  — other between 5 and 15 years
t he depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at each financial year-
end. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over 
the term of the relevant lease. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount 
is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, as described in note 3.15. Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing 
sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
3.14  INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODwILL
intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from contractual or other 
legal rights, and their fair value can be measured reliably. t hey are amortised over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Asset category  Estimated useful life
c ustomer relationships 20 years
t rade names  20 years
intellectual property rights 10 years
Other  between 5 and 10 years
3.15 ImPAIRmENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (“c Gu”) exceeds its recoverable amount. 
t he recoverable amount of an asset or cGu is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs to sell and (ii) its value in use, which is the present value of the 
future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or c Gu, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cGu. impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
(a)  Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s c Gus expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
the Group’s cGus are disclosed in note 21 and represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored. cGus to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the c Gu may be impaired.
if the recoverable amount of the cGu is less than its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the c Gu and then to the other assets of the c Gu pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset 
in the c Gu. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 59

3.  SUmmARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.15 ImPAIRmENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
(b)  Other tangible and intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, 
the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the c Gu to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates 
used to measure the asset’s recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. Where an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, 
the carrying amount of the asset or c Gu is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cGu in prior 
years. A reversal of an impairment loss for tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
3.16  INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURES
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject 
to joint control. Joint control exists when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control.
the Group conducts its joint venture arrangements through jointly controlled entities and accounts for them using the equity method of 
accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for under iFRs 5. Where the Group transacts 
with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture.
3.17  INVENTORIES
inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the first in, first out method) and net realisable value.
c ost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the inventory 
to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal activity levels. net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. t he amount 
of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.
in addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group holds precious metals under consignment arrangements, further details of 
which are given in note 27.
3.18  NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
non-current assets (or a collection of assets and liabilities in a disposal group) are separately classified as held for sale in the balance sheet when 
their carrying value will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
immediately prior to being classified as held for sale the measurement of the assets (and all assets and liabilities in a disposal group) is brought 
up to date in accordance with applicable iFRs. t hen, on initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are recognised 
at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale are included in profit or 
loss, as are gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
Discontinued operations are those operations that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group, both operationally and for financial 
reporting purposes, that have either been disposed of or classified as held for sale and which represent a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations. 60

3.19  LEASES
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
(a)  Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments. t he corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the income statement.
(b)  Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Benefits 
received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
3.20  FINANCIAL INSTRUmENTS
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
(a)  Equity instruments
equity instruments issued by the c ompany are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(b)  Derivative financial instruments
t he Group uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to manage the effects of 
its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates on its borrowings and borrowing costs. in accordance with its treasury policy, 
the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. t he method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends 
on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged (note 4.2).
t he fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date. t he fair value of interest rate swaps is 
the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest 
rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
(c)  Non-derivative financial instruments
non-derivative financial instruments include investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, 
loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables. non-derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus directly 
attributable transaction costs.
c ash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or 
less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts that are 
repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for 
the purpose of the Group statement of cash flows. Loans and borrowings comprise secured and unsecured loans and obligations under finance 
leases (note 3.19).
t he Group’s investments in equity and debt securities are classified as available-for-sale investments. subsequent to initial recognition they are 
measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the investment revaluation reserve 
in equity. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in the investment revaluation reserve is transferred to profit or loss.
All other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment losses. 61

3.21  PROVISIONS
provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation. provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both 
the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the obligation. Where discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost (note 3.10).
3.22  USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL mEASURES
t he company uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting practice (“non-GAAp”) financial measures in addition to those reported in 
accordance with iFRs. Because iFRs measures reflect all items which affect reported performance, the Directors believe that certain non-GAAp 
measures, which reflect what they view as the underlying performance of the Group, are important and should be considered alongside the iFRs 
measures. t he following non-GAAp measures are referred to in this annual report.
(a)  Net sales value
net sales value is calculated as the total of revenue less the amount included therein related to any precious metal component. t he Directors 
believe that net sales value provides an important measure of the underlying sales performance of the Group’s precious metals division.
(b) Return on sales and return on net sales value
Return on sales is calculated as trading profit divided by revenue. Return on net sales value is calculated as trading profit divided by net sales value. 
t he Directors believe that return on sales provides an important measure of the underlying trading performance of the Group and the Group’s 
c eramics and electronics divisions and that return on net sales value provides an important measure of the underlying trading performance of 
the Group’s precious metals division.
(c) Underlying revenue growth
underlying revenue growth measures the organic growth in revenue from one year to the next after eliminating the effects of changes in exchange 
rates and commodity metals prices and the effects of business acquisitions, disposals and closures. t he Directors believe that underlying revenue 
growth gives an important measure of the organic revenue generation capacity of the Group.
(d)  Trading profit
t rading profit is defined as profit from operations before exceptional items. t he Directors believe that trading profit is an important measure of 
the underlying trading performance of the Group.
(e)  Headline profit before tax
Headline profit before tax is calculated as the net total of trading profit, plus the Group’s share of post-tax profit of joint ventures and total net 
finance costs associated with ordinary activities. the Directors believe that headline profit before tax provides an important measure of the 
underlying financial performance of the Group.
(f)  Headline earnings per share
Headline earnings per share is calculated as headline profit before tax and after income tax costs associated with ordinary activities and profit 
attributable to non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. t he Directors 
believe that headline earnings per share provides an important measure of the underlying earnings capacity of the Group.
(g)  Free cash flow
Free cash flow, defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, 
dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders, but before additional funding contributions to Group pension 
plans, is disclosed on the face of the Group statement of cash flows. t he Directors believe that free cash flow gives an important measure of the 
underlying cash generation capacity of the Group. 62

(h)  Average working capital to sales ratio
t he average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances to the annualised revenue for the 
year. Average working capital (comprising inventories, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables) is calculated as the average of 
the six previous month-end balances, and annualised revenue is derived from the revenue for the previous six months. t he Directors believe that 
the average working capital to sales ratio provides an important measure of the underlying effectiveness with which working capital balances 
are managed throughout the Group.
(i)  EBITDA
eBitDA is calculated as the total of trading profit before depreciation charges. t he Directors believe that eBitDA provides an important measure 
of the underlying financial performance of the Group.
(j)  Net interest
net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein considered by the Directors to be 
exceptional.
(k) Interest cover
interest cover is the ratio of eBitDA to net interest. t he Directors believe that interest cover provides an important measure of the underlying 
financial position of the Group.
(l)  Net debt
net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings and cash and short-term deposits. t he Directors 
believe that net debt is an important measure as it shows the Group’s aggregate net indebtedness to banks and other external financial institutions.
(m)  Net debt to EBITDA
net debt to eBitDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to eBitDA for that year. t he Directors believe that net debt to eBitDA provides an 
important measure of the underlying financial position of the Group.
(n)  Return on net assets
Return on net assets (“ROnA”) is calculated as trading profit plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by average net operating assets 
(being the average over the previous 12 months of property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables and 
payables). t he Directors believe that ROnA provides an important measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group’s divisions.
(o)  Return on investment
Return on investment (“ROi”) is calculated as trading profit after tax plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by invested capital 
(being shareholders’ funds plus net debt, employee benefits net surpluses and net liabilities and goodwill previously written off to, or amortised 
against, reserves). t he Directors believe that ROi provides an important measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group. 63

4.  FINANCIAL RISK mANAGEmENT
4.1  FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
(a)  Foreign exchange risk
t he Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from transactions and borrowings that are denominated in 
currencies other than pounds sterling. it uses various financial instruments to manage these exposures, as explained below.
●   Recognised assets and liabilities
  Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset 
or liability that are attributable to a particular risk and which could affect profit or loss. such forward foreign exchange contracts are 
accounted for as fair value hedges in accordance with the policy in note 4.2(a).
●   Forecast transactions
  Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that might arise from 
the fluctuation of exchange rates in relation to highly probable forecast transactions that are denominated in currencies other than its 
own functional currencies and which might affect profit or loss. such forward foreign exchange contracts are accounted for as cash flow 
hedges in accordance with the policy in note 4.2(b). 
●   net investment hedges
  Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency non-derivative financial instruments are used to hedge against the Group’s 
exposure to changes in the value of its investment in the net assets of its foreign operations that arise from fluctuations in exchange 
rates. such financial instruments are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with the policy in note 4.2(c).
(b)  Credit risk
credit risk is the risk that the Group may suffer financial loss as a result of a third party failing to carry out its obligations under a financial 
instrument. t he Group’s main exposure to credit risk is in relation to its trade receivables. As detailed in note 26, the Group is not exposed to any 
significant concentration of credit risk.
(c)  Liquidity risk
t he Group treasury function ensures that there are sufficient levels of committed facilities, cash and cash equivalents to enable the Group at 
all times to meet its financial commitments and operate within its financial covenants. Details of the Group’s committed facilities and covenant 
compliance can be found in the Financial Review on page 19.
(d)  Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
t he Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from its borrowings. An analysis of the currency and interest rate profiles of the Group’s borrowings 
is shown in note 37.
Borrowings at floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and borrowings at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest 
rate risk. t he Group’s policy is to borrow a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. From time to time the Group manages its cash flow and fair value 
interest rate risk by using interest rate swaps, which have the economic effect of changing the interest rate profile of the Group’s borrowings.  64

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEmENTS
4.  FINANCIAL RISK mANAGEmENT (CONTINUED)
4.2  HEDGING ACTIVITIES
t he Group designates certain financial instruments as either: (a) hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of recognised assets or 
liabilities that are attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss (fair value hedges); (b) hedges of the exposure to variability in 
cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk associated with a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss (cash flow 
hedges); or (c) hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. t he Group 
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the financial instruments that are used in hedging 
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
(a)  Fair value hedges
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised within trading profit in the income 
statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that are subject to the hedged risk.
(b)  Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast transaction, the 
effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the 
hedging reserve in equity. t he ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit, or within finance costs in the 
case of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. When the forecast transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit 
or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income 
statement in the same period. When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial 
liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of 
the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or designation of the hedge relationship is revoked, but the hedged 
forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in the hedging reserve and is recognised in 
accordance with the above policy when the transaction takes place. if the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative 
gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised immediately in the income statement.
(c)  Net investment hedges
t he portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge 
is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and is subsequently recognised in the income 
statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. t he ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately within 
trading profit in the income statement.
4.3  CAPITAL mANAGEmENT
t he Group considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt. it monitors its capital using a number of key performance 
indicators, including free cash flow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to eBitDA ratios, ROnA and ROi (note 3.22). t he Group’s 
objectives when managing its capital are:
●   to ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates within the 
financial covenants contained within its debt facilities;
●   to maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Group’s equity and net debt;
●   to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future returns to 
investors; and
●   to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
t he Group operated comfortably within the requirements of its debt covenants throughout the year and has substantial liquidity headroom 
within its committed debt facilities. Details of the Group’s covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found in the Financial 
Review on page 19. t he Group has established new three-year performance targets (page 5) that include maintaining a strong financial position 
with a year-end net debt to eBitDA ratio of not more than 1.5 times and dividend growth at least in line with earnings growth. 65

5.  CRITICAL JUDGEmENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTImATION UNCERTAINTY
5.1  PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPmENT
it is Group policy to depreciate its property, plant and equipment assets, except freehold land, on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives. t his policy applies an appropriate matching of the revenue earned with the capital costs of production and delivery of goods and 
services. A key element of this policy is the estimate of the useful life applied to each category of property, plant and equipment which, in turn, 
determines the annual depreciation charge. Variations in asset lives could significantly impact Group profit through an increase or decrease in 
the depreciation charge.
5.2  GOODwILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
t he Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill and other capitalised intangible assets have a value that will benefit 
the performance of the Group over future periods. t o assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of 
the carrying value of the Group’s capitalised goodwill and other intangible assets, using discounted cash flow forecasts to derive the value in use 
to the Group of the capitalised assets. in the assessment undertaken in 2010, further details of which are given in note 22, value in use was derived 
from discounted five-year cash flow projections, using a growth rate of 3% in the years beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates. 
t he projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Group’s businesses for 
this purpose. changes to the assumptions used in making these forecasts could significantly alter the Directors’ assessment of the carrying value 
of goodwill and other intangible assets.
5.3  CURRENT ASSET RESERVES
in the course of normal trading activities, judgement is used to establish the net realisable value of various elements of working capital, principally 
inventory and trade receivables. Reserves are established for obsolete or slow-moving inventories, bad or doubtful debts and product warranties.
Reserve requirements are based on the facts available at the time and are also determined by using profiles, based on past practice, applied to 
certain aged inventory and receivables categories. in estimating the collectability of trade receivables, judgement is required in assessing their 
likely realisation, including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related ageing of the past due balances. specific accounts are 
assessed in situations where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration in its financial condition, credit 
ratings or bankruptcy.
5.4  EmPLOYEE BENEFITS
t he Group’s financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-retirement benefits 
to current and former employees. it is the Directors’ responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of 
meeting such future obligations. t hese assumptions are set after consultation with the Group’s actuaries and include those used to determine 
regular service costs and the financing elements related to the plans’ assets and liabilities. Whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used 
are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect the Group’s profit and financial position.
5.5  LIABILITY RESERVES
cookson has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and 
environmental matters. several of the Group’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the 
ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with 
tax authorities. Reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other 
regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or 
other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty. t he Directors use their judgement 
and experience to make reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate amount relating to such matters.
5.6  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
t he Group’s financial statements present the results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations. Discontinued operations 
include those businesses that have been sold, or are classified as held for sale, and which represented a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations. t he Directors exercise their judgement to determine which of the Group’s businesses should have their results 
presented within discontinued operations. 66

5.  CRITICAL JUDGEmENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTImATION UNCERTAINTY (CONTINUED)
5.7  TAxATION
(a)  Current tax
t ax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group. in assessing the amount of the 
benefit to be recognised in the financial statements, the Directors exercise their judgement in considering the effect of negotiations, litigation 
and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement. Any interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for 
in the tax charge. 
t he Group operates internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions. As a consequence, the Group is routinely subject to tax 
audit and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude. provision is made for known issues based 
upon the Directors’ interpretation of country-specific tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome.
(b)  Deferred tax
t he Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number of the Group’s 
businesses. Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised. if these 
forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing differences might 
be recognised, then the value of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in a future period.
t he Group has losses and other timing differences for which no value has been recognised for deferred tax purposes in these financial statements. 
t his situation can arise in loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of these timing differences is not probable. it can also arise 
where the timing differences are of such a nature that their value is dependent on only certain types of profit being earned, such as capital profits. 
if trading or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield benefit to the 
Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.
6.  SEGmENT INFORmATION
t he segment information contained in this note makes reference to several non-GAAp financial measures, definitions for which can be found in 
note 3.22.
6.1 BUSINESS SEGmENTS
For reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main business segments: c eramics, electronics and precious metals. t he chief executive 
Officer of each of these business segments reports to the chief executive of the Group and it is the c ookson Board which makes the key operating 
decisions in respect of these segments. t he information used by the cookson Board to review performance and determine resource allocation 
between the business segments is presented with the Group’s activities segmented between the three business segments, c eramics, electronics 
and precious metals. t aking into account not only the basis on which the Group’s activities are reported to the c ookson Board, but also the nature 
of the products and services of the product lines within each of these segments, the production processes involved in each and the nature of 
their end-markets, the Directors believe that these three business segments are the appropriate way to analyse the Group’s results. t he principal 
activities of each of these segments are described in the Operating Review on pages 9 to 15.
segment revenue represents revenue from external customers (inter-segment revenue is not material) and segment result is equivalent to 
trading profit excluding corporate costs directly related to managing the parent company, which are reported separately in the table below. 
s egment net operating assets exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, net debt, net employee benefits liabilities, net tax liabilities and other 
net non-operating liabilities. segment result and segment net operating assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those 
items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 67

12.3  ExCEPTIONAL FINANCE COSTS
As a consequence of the issuance of $250m of us private placement Loan notes in December 2010, the Group was required to repay certain of its 
borrowings under its committed bank facilities. t he exceptional finance costs of £3.0m reported in 2010 arose in relation to this early repayment: 
£2.4m of these costs related to the close-out of interest rate swaps that had been used to hedge the interest payable in relation to the borrowings; 
and £0.6m related to the write-off of costs that had been capitalised in relation to the borrowings. the exceptional finance costs of £14.0m 
reported in 2009 arose in relation to the early repayment of certain of the Group’s borrowings and the conversion into sterling of the remainder of 
the Group’s foreign currency denominated borrowings: £12.8m of these costs related to the close-out of interest rate swaps that had been used 
to hedge the interest payable in relation to the borrowings; £0.5m related to the write-off of costs that had been capitalised in relation to the 
borrowings; and £0.7m related to early repayment costs. t he tax associated with these exceptional finance costs was £nil (2009: £nil).
13.  NET (LOSS)/PROFIT ON DISPOSAL OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
t he net loss on disposal of continuing operations of £0.6m (2009: £3.7m profit) related to a number of small disposals from the Group’s c eramics and 
electronics divisions, which generated £6.2m (2009: £6.2m) of net proceeds. t he tax charge associated with these disposals was £nil (2009: £0.9m). 73

t he Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices. changes in any of these areas could, adversely or 
positively, impact the Group’s tax charge in the future. c ontinuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary 
could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2010, as effective tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses. 
Other significant factors affecting the tax charge are described in notes 3.11 and 5.7.
tax charged in the Group statement of comprehensive income in the year amounted to £0.7m (2009: £21.8m credit), all of which related to net

For the purposes of calculating diluted basic and diluted headline eps, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to include 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares relating to the 
company’s share-based payment plans. potential ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares would 
decrease earnings per share, or increase loss per share, from continuing operations. 
in addition to the ordinary shares shown as being dilutive in the table above, the c ompany had 0.5m (2009: 0.8m) of outstanding options and share 
awards in relation to its share-based payment plans that could dilute eps in the future, but which are not included in the calculation of diluted and 
diluted headline eps above because they were antidilutive in the years presented. 75

21.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS
intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing 
carried out annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may 
be impaired. Other intangible assets are initially measured at cost, which is equal to the acquisition date fair value, and subsequently measured at 
cost less accumulated amortisation charges and accumulated impairment losses. Other intangible assets are subject to impairment testing when 
there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been incurred. 77

21.2  ANALYSIS OF GOODwILL BY CASH-GENERATING UNIT (“CGU”)
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s c Gus expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Directors consider that the Group has four c Gus: the c eramics division, the chemistry and Assembly 
materials product lines of the electronics division and the precious metals division. t hese cGus represent the lowest level within the Group at 
which goodwill is monitored. For the precious metals division c Gu, goodwill recognised in the balance sheet is £nil (2009: £nil).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEmENTS
22.  ImPAIRmENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
22.1  ImPAIRmENT POLICY
At each balance sheet date, the Directors review the carrying value of the Group’s tangible and other intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. if such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the 
Directors estimate the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (“c Gu”) to which the asset belongs.
t he Directors also carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of its c Gu s, to assess the need for any impairment of the carrying value 
of goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets associated with these c Gus.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or c Gu is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs to sell and (ii) its value 
in use. if the recoverable amount of a cGu is less than the carrying amount of that cGu, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the c Gu and then to the other assets of the c Gu pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of 
each asset in the c Gu.
 
t he value in use calculations of the Group’s cGus are based on detailed business plans covering a three year period from the balance sheet date, 
higher level assumptions covering a further two year period and perpetuity calculations beyond this five year projection period. t he cash flows in 
the calculations are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates.
22.2  KEY ASSUmPTIONS
t he key assumptions used in determining value in use are return on sales, growth rates and discount rates. Return on sales assumptions are based 
on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the 
balance sheet date.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions; external forecasts and historical trends for the Group’s key end-markets 
of steel production, foundry castings and electronics; and expected growth in output within the industries in which each major Group business 
unit operates. A perpetuity growth rate of 3% (2009: 3%) has been applied based on the long-term growth rates experienced in the Group’s end-
markets. t he Group’s projections are based on historical trends and external forecasts.
Discount rates are calculated for each c Gu, reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each cGu. t he pre-
tax discount rate used for the c eramics cGu was 14.5% (2009: 12.9%), for the chemistry c Gu 14.1% (2009: 13.0%) and for the Assembly materials 
c Gu 12.5% (2009: 11.4%).
22.3  GOODwILL ImPAIRmENT
in assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2010, the Directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable amount 
of the Group’s cGus as at 31 December 2010. t hose calculations resulted in recoverable amounts significantly higher than the carrying values of 
each of the Group’s c Gus.
23.  INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURES
t he principal joint venture of the Group, in which it has a 50% interest, is electroplating engineers of Japan Ltd. t he Group’s interests in its joint

tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences of £4.9m (2009: £1.9m) were recognised by subsidiaries reporting a loss in 2009 or 2010. 
On the basis of approved business plans of these subsidiaries and in view of the significant improvement in market conditions in 2010, the Directors 
consider it probable that the tax loss carry-forwards and temporary differences can be offset against future taxable profits.
t he total deferred tax asset not recognised as at 31 December 2010 was £483.0m (2009: £475.6m). t his consisted of £45.4m (2009: £51.2m) relating 
to capital losses that are available to offset future uK capital gains and may be carried forward without time limit, £232.6m (2009: £224.0m) relating 
to operating losses, £92.4m (2009: £85.8m) relating to unrelieved interest, £99.5m (2009: £101.5m) relating to other categories and £13.1m (2009: 
£13.1m) relating to uK Act tax credits, which may be carried forward indefinitely. i n accordance with the accounting policy in note 3.11, these 
items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets on the basis that their future economic benefit is not probable. in total, there was an increase 
of £7.4m (2009: £20.7m) in net unrecognised deferred tax assets during the year.
As at 31 December 2010, the Group had total operating losses carried forward with a tax value of £237.2m (2009: £228.0m). t his total includes 
£97.8m (2009: £84.5m) for losses which are available to offset future taxable us income, of which approximately £7.6m (2009: £7.3m) will expire 
in 2020 and the remainder will expire between 2022 and 2029. A further £108.4m (2009: £108.2m) of losses are available to offset future uK 
taxable income and may be carried forward without time limit. t he remaining losses with a value of £31.0m (2009: £35.3m) include £15.9m (2009: 
£20.9m) which may be carried forward indefinitely and £9.8m (2009: £9.4m) which will expire within the next 5 years if not used. t he balance has a 
maximum life of between 5 and 20 years. t he amounts arise in a number of countries and are not individually significant, reflecting the spread of 
the Group’s operations. As at 31 December 2010, the Group had unrelieved interest with a tax value of £92.4m (2009: £85.8m), which may be carried 
forward indefinitely, and us tax credits carried forward with a tax value of £10.1m (2009: £10.8m), comprising £2.7m (2009: £2.7m) of research and 
experimentation credits, which expire between 2018 and 2030, and £7.4m (2009: £8.1m) of foreign tax credits expiring between 2014 and 2018.

25.  DEFERRED TAx (CONTINUED)
Due to changes in uK tax law enacted in 2009 exempting dividends received from uK tax, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated 
with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is £nil (2009: £nil).
t he emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the uK corporation tax rate will reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of four years from 
2011.  t he first reduction in the rate from 28% to 27% was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010 and is effective from 1 April 2011. As this rate 
change was substantively enacted prior to the year end, the Group’s closing uK deferred tax liability has been provided using a tax rate of 27%. 
t he impact of using this lower tax rate was to increase the exceptional tax credit relating to the amortisation of intangible assets from £5.2m to 
£6.4m (note 14.1).

All of the Group’s operating companies have policies and procedures in place to assess the creditworthiness of the customers with whom they 
do business. Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made for the difference between its 
carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered. impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer 
basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances based upon historical loss experience. Historical experience 
has shown that the Group’s trade receivable provisions are maintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without 
being excessive.

impairment charges, write-offs and the reversal of unused amounts shown in the table above are charged or credited as appropriate within 
administration, selling and distribution costs in the Group income statement.
in determining the level of impairment provisions required, the Group’s operating companies initially review all significant trade receivable balances 
on an individual basis for evidence of impairment. evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, 
or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings. Of the total provision for impairment of trade receivables at 31 December 2010 of 
£31.3m (2009: £33.1m) shown in the table above, £25.9m (2009: £29.4m) related to balances that were impaired on an individual basis. t he ageing 
analysis of these individually impaired balances is shown in the table below. 81

Due to the large number of customers that the Group transacts its business with, none of which represent a significant proportion of the total 
outstanding trade receivables balance, the Group is not exposed to any significant concentration of credit risk. t here is no significant difference 
between the fair value of the Group’s trade and other receivable balances and the amount at which they are reported in the Group balance sheet.

the cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales in the income statement during the year was £1,263.7m  
(2009: £972.7m).
As at 31 December 2010, in addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group held £354.8m (2009: £304.5m) of precious metals 
either on consignment terms or on behalf of customers for processing.
cookson has entered into various precious metal consignment arrangements with precious metals consigning entities (the “consignors”). t he 
metal which the Group fabricates for its customers may be purchased by the Group from a consignor and sold concurrently to the customer, 
or may be consigned and sold directly from a consignor to the Group’s customers, with the Group charging customers only for the fabrication 
process. As the c onsignors retain title and associated risks and rewards of ownership under these arrangements, the value of the physical metal so 
held is not recognised in the Group balance sheet. c onsequently, the obligations in respect of the consigned metal are not recognised as a liability 
in the Group balance sheet. t he utilisation of consigned precious metals is established practice in the precious metals industry.
cookson provides a guarantee in respect of each consignment arrangement. Whilst the terms of each consignment arrangement differ in their 
specific terms, they share similar characteristics. metals are held on consignment by the relevant cookson company (the “consignee”) and the 
c onsignor retains title to the metal and has a right of physical return of the metal without penalty unless the consignee purchases such metal at 
a market price for such metals plus a premium. t he c onsignee pays a consignment fee on the value of the metals consigned to it which have not 
been returned or purchased. c onsignment fees for 2010 amounted to £8.9m (2009: £8.6m). 
consigned metals may be co-mingled with other metals. consignors are party to either committed or uncommitted arrangements. under 
committed arrangements the consignors provide a fixed term commitment to supply metal to the Group’s fabrication operations. under 
uncommitted arrangements the consignor is under no obligation to supply metal to the Group’s fabrication operations and has the right, with 
limited or, in some cases, no notice, to demand physical return of its consigned metal.  82

Derivative financial instruments are reported at their fair value at the balance sheet date and are accounted for in accordance with the accounting 
policies in note 4.2. in accordance with Group policy, no derivatives are held for speculative purposes. Of the £33.4m (2009: £19.6m) of derivative 
liabilities reported in the table above, £19.3m (2009: £11.9m) will mature within a year of the balance sheet date and £14.1m (2009: £7.7m) will 
mature within two years.
28.2  NET INVESTmENT HEDGES
t he Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to provide a hedge against the foreign exchange risk associated with investments in its foreign 
operations. Of the change in the fair value of these contracts in the year, £19.1m (which was associated with the change in spot prices) was determined 
to be an effective hedge and was recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within translation reserves (note 32) and £2.2m (which 
was associated with the change in forward prices) was credited to the income statement within finance income.
in addition to these derivative net investment hedges, the Group also designated certain non-derivative financial instruments (including foreign 
currency term loans under its syndicated bank facility; borrowings under its us private placement Loan notes (“uspp ”); and other short-term net 
foreign currency liabilities) as net investment hedges. t here was no ineffectiveness associated with the change in the fair value of these instruments 
and the effective change in fair value of £7.0m was recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within translation reserves (note 32). 
t he fair value of these non-derivative net investment hedging instruments as at 31 December 2010 amounted to £179.6m.
28.3  CASH FLOw HEDGES
During the year the Group entered into interest rate swap contracts (“swaps”) intended to provide a hedge against the cash flow risk associated with interest 
payable on its floating rate debt instruments. Of the change in the fair value of these swaps during the year, £4.4m was determined to be an effective hedge 
and was recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within hedging reserves and £0.1m was determined to be an ineffective hedge and was 
recognised in the income statement within ordinary finance costs. under the terms of these swaps the Group will make semi-annual payments of £0.5m 
between April 2011 and October 2012, when the contracts are due to mature. 
28.4  FAIR VALUE HEDGES
the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and forward commodity contracts in its operations to provide a hedge against the risk 
of changes in the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities that might otherwise arise as a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates and 
commodity prices. in relation to the fair value hedge assets, gains of £2.3m were recognised during the year within trading profit, matched by 
losses of £2.3m on the underlying hedged items; and in relation to the fair value hedge liabilities, losses of £2.2m were recognised during the year 
within trading profit, matched by gains of £2.2m on the underlying hedged items.
28.5  DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING PURPOSES
t hroughout the year the Group used forward foreign exchange contracts to provide an economic hedge against the change in fair value of its 
uspp arising from the fluctuation in exchange rates. A £9.8m gain (2009: £24.7m loss) arising on the change in the fair value of these contracts in 
the year was recognised within trading profit, offsetting the £9.8m loss in the year (2009: £24.7m gain) arising on the retranslation of the uspp. 83

32.1  HEDGING RESERVE
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast transaction (note 
28.3), the effective part of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in 
hedging reserves in equity. When the forecast transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss 
on the derivative financial instrument is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the Group income statement in the same period.
32.2  INVESTmENT REVALUATION RESERVE
Available-for-sale investments are carried in the Group balance sheet at fair value. changes in fair value from one balance sheet date to the next 
are recorded in the investment revaluation reserve, together with any related tax. When the investment is derecognised the cumulative amount 
relating to it in the investment revaluation reserve, together with any related tax, is recognised in the Group income statement.
32.3  TRANSLATION RESERVE
t he translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences attributable to the owners of the parent that arise from the translation of the 
financial statements of foreign operations and from the translation of financial instruments that hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign 
operations. in addition to foreign exchange differences attributable to the owners of the parent, the Group statement of comprehensive income 
includes foreign exchange differences attributable to non-controlling interests (note 35). 85

in addition to the maturity analysis of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities shown in the table above, note 28 includes details of the 
maturity profile of the Group’s derivative financial liabilities. t he Group manages the liquidity risk inherent in all these liabilities by maintaining 
sufficient committed bank facilities to ensure that it is able to meet both its operational cash flow requirements and any maturing financial 
liabilities. t hese committed facilities amounted to £573.2m at 31 December 2010, of which £350m was unutilised. t he level of these facilities is 
reviewed annually, as part of the Group’s three year planning process, to ensure that it continues to provide adequate operational headroom. 
Where the Group’s long-term cash flow forecasts indicate a need for additional finance, this is normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by 
means of either additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets.

37.1  CALCULATION OF FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed and 
willing parties. Wherever possible, fair value is calculated by reference to quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. Where no such 
quoted prices are available, other observable inputs are used and if there are no observable inputs then fair values are calculated by discounting 
projected cash flows at prevailing rates translated at year-end exchange rates.
37.2  FAIR VALUES RECOGNISED IN THE GROUP BALANCE SHEET

37.6  mARKET RISK — INTEREST RATE RELATED 
(a)  Cash flow risk
changes in market interest rates expose the Group to the risk of fluctuation in its future cash flows in relation to its financial assets and liabilities 
that attract interest at floating rates (note 37.4). Based upon the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 
2010 and the net floating rate cash position of £50.6m (2009: net floating rate debt position of £170.2m) at that date, a 1% increase in market 
interest rates would result in a decrease in both the Group’s annual net finance costs charged to the Group income statement and the Group’s 
net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows of £0.5m (2009: £1.7m increase). correspondingly, a 1% decrease in interest rates would 
result in an increase in both the Group’s annual net finance costs charged to the Group income statement and the Group’s net interest paid in the 
Group statement of cash flows of £0.5m (2009: £1.7m decrease). in January 2010, the c ompany entered into interest rate swaps aimed at fixing the 
interest rates on around two-thirds of the Group’s gross borrowings for a period of just over two years.
(b)  Fair value risk
changes in market interest rates expose the Group to the risk of fluctuation in the fair value of its financial assets and liabilities that attract interest 
at fixed rates (note 37.4). Based upon the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2010, a 1% increase 
in market interest rates would result in a decrease of £11.5m (2009: £3.2m) in the fair value of the Group’s net debt and a 1% decrease in market 
interest rates would result in an increase of £12.3m (2009: £3.3m) in the fair value of the Group’s net debt.

38.1  GROUP POST-RETIREmENT PLANS
t he Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined benefit and defined contribution type, and accounts for 
them in accordance with iAs 19.
(a)  Defined benefit pension plans
t he Group’s principal defined benefit pension plans are in the uK and the us. t he assets of these plans are held separately from the Group in trustee-
administered funds. t he trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans’ beneficiaries. t he Group also has defined benefit pension plans 
in other territories but, with the exception of those in Germany, these are not individually material in relation to the Group as a whole.
t he Group’s main defined benefit pension plan in the uK (“the uK plan”) is closed to new members and, having completed the required period 
of consultation with its employees, the closure of the uK plan and the uK defined contribution plan to future benefit accrual took effect from  
31 July 2010 and a new Group personal pension plan has been established in their place to provide defined contribution benefits for all eligible 
uK employees. A full actuarial valuation of the uK p lan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the uK plan trustee and 
the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2009. At that date, the market value of plan assets was £401.9m and this represented a 
funding level of 88% of the accrued plan benefits at the time (using the projected unit method of valuation) of £456.4m. c alculated on a “buy-out” 
basis (using an estimation of the cost of buying out the uK plan benefits with an insurance company), the liabilities at that date were £589.0m, 
representing a funding level of 68%. During 2009 it was agreed, in consultation with the uK plan t rustee, to reduce the level of “top-up” payments 
(made in addition to normal cash contributions) from £14.0m per annum such that, with effect from February 2009, no further additional payments 
would be made until August 2010. t he triennial funding valuation for the uK plan as at the end of 2009 was completed in July 2010, based upon 
which the company and trustee agreed a new schedule of contributions which commenced in August 2010, whereby the company will make 
“top-up” payments of £7.0m per annum until February 2016, targeted at eliminating the deficit in the uK plan by that date. t he level of “top-up” 
payments will be reviewed based on the uK plan’s next triennial valuation as of December 2012, which should be available in mid-2013. 
in July 2010, the uK government announced changes to the inflation index used for statutory pension increases (both for pensions in payment 
and pensions in deferment) to apply to private sector pension schemes. t he c ompany, the uK plan t rustee and their respective legal advisers are 
currently working to clarify how this impacts the uK plan and will communicate with any affected members in 2011.
the uK plan operates a hedging strategy, using a combination of swaps and bonds, to mitigate the impact of interest rate and inflation rate 
movements on the value of its projected liabilities for meeting future pension payments (the uK plan’s “economic liabilities”), the value of which is 
related more to interest rate and inflation rate swap yields than to corporate bond yields, upon which the discount rate used for iAs 19 valuation 
purposes is based. When the relationship between the relevant swap yields and corporate bond yields is stable, the uK plan’s hedging strategy 
should deliver a broadly stable “funding ratio” (the ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities) not just in relation to the uK plan’s economic liabilities, but 
also under an iAs 19 basis of valuation. As at 31 December 2010, the estimated funding position (incorporating the uK plan’s economic liabilities) 
showed a funding ratio of 92%, with the iAs 19 valuation reflecting a funding ratio of 101%. this represents a valuation difference of £41m, 
reflecting partly the use of differing discount rates, but also the use of stronger mortality assumptions for funding purposes. t he Group continues 
to fund the uK plan with reference to its economic funding position.
t he Group has a number of defined benefit plans in the us, providing retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit. i n addition, the 
Group’s us Retirement s ecurity plan has characteristics similar to defined contribution plans but with a minimum performance level guaranteed 
by the Group on the members’ accounts. t he cash balance rate assumption in the table in note 38.2(b) refers to the assumed minimum guaranteed 
return on members’ accounts. t he Retirement security plan and the Group’s other principal us defined benefit plans are closed to new members 
and also to future benefit accrual for existing members, with future pension benefit being provided, where appropriate, through a defined 
contribution arrangement. Actuarial valuations of the us defined benefit pension plans are carried out every year and the last full valuation was 
carried out as at 31 December 2009. At that date the market value of the plan assets was £93.4m, representing a funding level of 63% of accrued 
plan benefits at that date (using the projected unit method of valuation) of £147.5m. Funding levels for the Group’s us defined benefit pension 
plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by independent qualified actuaries and are governed by us government regulations. 
t he Group has a number of defined benefit pension arrangements in Germany which are unfunded, as is common practice in that country. 92

(b)  Defined contribution pension plans
t he Group’s principal defined contribution plans are in the uK and the us and the assets of the plans are held separately from the Group in trustee-
administered funds. t he total expense for these plans in the Group income statement amounted to £15.7m (2009: £12.7m) and represents the 
contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.
(c)  Other post-retirement defined benefit plans
the Group’s principal defined benefit plans for employees other than pensions are healthcare benefit arrangements in the us and uK. As is 
common for these types of plan, the costs of providing these benefits are not funded externally by the Group. in December 2009, the termination 
of certain us retiree medical benefit arrangements was announced, effective from 1 January 2011.
38.2  POST-RETIREmENT LIABILITY — VALUATION AND RISK mITIGATION 
t he assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, as 
detailed below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries. 
(a)  mortality assumptions
t he mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Group’s uK, us and German defined benefit pension liabilities are summarised in 
the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans. 
For the uK plan, the 2010 assumptions used have been derived from the self-Administered pension schemes (“sAps”) All table, with future 
longevity improvements in line with the “core” mortality improvement tables recently published by the c ontinuous mortality investigation (“cmi ”), 
with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum. t he latter cmi tables are expected to replace the use of the “cohort” improvement 
factors widely used since 2002. t his approach for the 2010 assumptions represents a strengthening of the mortality assumptions from those used 
in 2009, which were based on p A 92 tables projected forward with adjustments to reflect (i) a scaling factor of 112%, to take into account the lower 
level of life expectancy amongst the blue collar membership; (ii) the medium c ohort improvement factors; and (iii) a minimum level, or “underpin” , 
to the amount by which life expectancy is expected to improve at each age in the future, which has the effect of increasing the life expectancy at 
age 65 by some 0.5 years for someone currently aged 65 and by up to 2 years for someone currently aged 45.
For the Group’s us plans, as in 2009, the assumptions used have been based on the standard Rp2000cH mortality tables, projected 64 years for 
non-pensioners and 33 years for pensioners using projection scale AA. t he Group’s major plans in Germany have been valued using the Heubeck- 
Richttafeln 2005G mortality tables, as they were in 2009.

Discount rate
t he discount rate used to determine the liabilities of the uK plan for iAs 19 accounting purposes is required to be determined by reference to 
market yields on high quality corporate bonds. t he uK discount rate in the above table is based on the annualised yield on the iBoxx over 15 year 
AA-rated sterling corporate bond index; the us discount rate is based on the equivalent iBoxx index for us domestic corporations; and the German 
discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 10 year euro corporates AA index. 
Price inflation
t he assumptions for price inflation are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and 
index-linked bonds.
Expected asset return
t he expected asset return is the company’s expectation at the valuation date of long-term asset returns. t hese are based on the “risk-free” yield 
available by following a buy and hold investment strategy in government bonds. Returns for other bonds and equities are then estimated based 
on observed historic long-term strategic risk premia. t hese assumptions do not take account of the relative valuation of markets or of market 
momentum. t he Group’s major post-retirement investment portfolios are those related to its uK and us plans. Both portfolios are invested in 
equities, bonds and cash. in addition, the uK plan invests in infrastructure, absolute return strategies and derivative contracts for risk mitigation. 
An investment in real estate is planned for 2011.
During september 2010 the uK plan’s bond portfolio was restructured, liquidating the previous synthetic bond portfolio (cash and swaps) and 
replacing it predominantly with long duration portfolios of uK government bonds and uK corporate bonds. t here are also smaller portfolios of 
global high yield debt and emerging market debt and provision for a portfolio of index linked gilts once their value is considered acceptable. t he 
rationale for this change was to diversify the fund exposures and to reduce dependence on the swaps market.
t he majority of the Group’s total post-retirement assets are in bonds and equities and, for the purpose of the 2010 iAs 19 valuation, management 
makes assumptions as to the expected arithmetic long-term returns for these assets. Based on expectations as at December 2010 and the asset 
mix of the Group’s uK plan and of its us plans: the expected return for the respective bond portfolios is partway between treasury and corporate 
bond yields, specifically 4.5% for the uK plan and 5.4% for the us plans; and the expected return on the respective equity portfolios is expected to 
outperform long duration government bonds by a margin of 3.5% in the uK plan and 4.6% in the us plans. 94

38.2  POST-RETIREmENT LIABILITY — VALUATION AND RISK mITIGATION (CONTINUED)
(c)  UK pension plan risk mitigation strategy
t he c ompany and the uK plan t rustee consider the following to be the major investment risks which could affect the value of the uK plan’s assets 
compared to the value of its economic liabilities:
●   interest rate risk:  t he risk of government bond interest rates falling, leading to an increase in the value of plan liabilities.
●   inflation risk:  t he risk of inflation rising faster than expected, leading to an increase in the value of plan liabilities.
●   equity market risk:  t he risk of significant equity market falls, leading to a fall in the value of plan assets.
in order to mitigate these key risks, the t rustee has mandated the following financial derivative contracts which materially reduce the risk that the 
uK plan’s assets would fall materially relative to the value of its economic liabilities:
●   An interest rate swap overlay designed (together with the bond portfolios) to mitigate approximately 75% of the interest rate risk of the 
plan liabilities as measured on an ongoing basis. under these contracts the uK p lan receives a fixed rate of interest and pays out a variable 
rate of interest, based on the London inter Bank Offered Rate. t his is beneficial when long-term interest rates fall, significantly offsetting the 
corresponding increase in the value of the uK plan’s economic liabilities. in December 2010 an interest rate swaption collar was transacted, 
designed to mitigate the remaining 25% of interest rate risk in the case of extreme market movements during the next three years. 
●   inflation swaps designed, together with the bond portfolio, to mitigate approximately 70% of the effective inflation risk of the plan 
liabilities as measured on an ongoing basis. t he uK plan pays out a fixed rate of interest and receives payments indexed with actual 
inflation. t his is beneficial when inflation increases faster than expected and significantly offsets the adverse impact on the funding ratio.
in september 2010, the equity option contracts taken out to protect the uK plan from an initial fall in equity prices were approaching their expiry 
date and the cost of a new option strategy was considered too expensive. consequently, the equity option contracts were liquidated, but at the 
same time the value of the uK plan’s equity portfolio was reduced so that the overall effective exposure of the uK plan to equities was not materially 
changed. 
(d)  Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in key IAS 19 actuarial assumptions
t he following table analyses, for the Group’s main uK, us and German pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities resulting 
from changes to key actuarial assumptions used for iAs 19 valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant. 
it should be noted that the investment strategy adopted by the uK plan, details of which are given above, was designed to mitigate a significant 
majority of the interest rate and inflation risk related to the uK plan’s economic liabilities. t he stabilising impact of this strategy is not reflected in the 
following table. 
    Impact on plan liabilities
Assumption Change in assumption UK US  Germany
Discount rate increase/decrease by 0.1% Decrease/increase by 1.9% Decrease/increase by 1.3% Decrease/increase by 1.5%
price inflation increase/decrease by 0.1% increase/decrease by 1.4% n/a increase/decrease by 0.8%
mortality increase by one year increase by 4.0% increase by 3.2% increase by 2.1%
With regard to the Group’s post-retirement healthcare benefit plans, a 1% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions shown in the table 
in note 38.2(b) would increase the accumulated post-employment medical benefit obligation by £0.2m without changing the post-employment 
medical benefit costs and a 1% decrease in the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions would reduce the obligation by £0.1m without changing 
the post-employment medical benefit costs. 95

38.3  DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION
t he liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans for iAs 19 accounting purposes are measured by discounting 
the best estimate of the future cash flows to be paid out by the plans using the projected unit method, in which the calculation of plan liabilities 
makes allowance, where appropriate, for projected increases in benefit-related earnings.

(a)  UK Plan asset allocation
As at 31 December 2010, the uK plan’s assets, excluding risk-mitigation derivatives, were allocated 20% in equities; 61% in bonds and debt 
instruments; 7% in infrastructure investments; 5% in hedge funds; and 7% in cash. t he uK t rustee’s target allocation is currently 25% “liquid return” 
assets (mainly equities, but also global high yield and emerging market debt), 56% bonds, 6% infrastructure investments, 6% hedge funds, 2% 
cash and 5% in property investments. in addition, the uK plan holds a liability driven investment portfolio of financial derivative contracts which 
materially reduce the risk that the uK plan’s assets would fall materially relative to the value of its economic liabilities. 
(b)  US pension plan assets not recognised above
in addition to the assets reported above, £3.9m (2009: £3.9m) of assets were held as at 31 December 2010 to fund certain non-qualified us pension 
plan obligations (note 24). t hese assets are not included within pension plan assets as they are available to satisfy creditors in the event of the 
winding-up of the Group company in which they are held and are reported as investments in the Group balance sheet.
(c)  Defined benefit contributions in 2011
t he Group is expected to make aggregate contributions into its defined benefit pension plans of around £20m in 2011. t he Group is also expected 
to make aggregate contributions in respect of its other post-retirement benefit plans of around £2m in 2011.
t he triennial funding valuation for the uK plan as at the end of 2009 was completed in July 2010, based upon which the company and uK plan 
t rustee agreed a new schedule of contributions which commenced in August 2010 whereby the c ompany will make “top-up” payments of £7.0m 
per annum until February 2016, targeted at eliminating the deficit in the uK plan by that date. t he level of “top-up” payments will be reviewed 
based on the uK plan’s next triennial valuation as of December 2012, which should be available in mid-2013.
(d)  Actual return on plan assets
t he actual return on all Group pension plan assets was £63.5m (2009: £33.3m).  97

39.  SHARE-BASED PAYmENTS
39.1  SHARE-BASED PAYmENT PLANS
t he Group operates a number of different share-based payment plans; the main features of each plan are outlined below.
(a)  Long-term incentive plan (“L TIP”)
t he Ltip was introduced in 2004 to replace the Group’s executive share option schemes.
t he Ltip has two elements. Firstly, executives who are eligible receive a conditional annual award of shares worth up to a prescribed percentage 
of their base salary (“performance shares”). s econdly, executives who are eligible can elect to invest all or part of their annual incentive in ordinary 
shares of the company (“investment shares”) in return for which they receive a conditional award of ordinary shares worth up to 2.25 times the 
pre-tax equivalent of the annual incentive so invested (“matching shares”). in addition, for awards made after 7 march 2008, the Remuneration 
committee has the discretion to award participants the dividends that would have been paid on the number of shares that vest in respect of 
dividend record dates occurring during the period between the award date and the date of vesting.
performance shares and matching shares can vest after three years, with the proportion of shares vesting being based on the company’s 
performance against specified performance conditions. 
For outstanding and future awards, vesting of 50% of shares awarded will be based on the Group’s three-year total shareholder Return (“tsR”) 
performance relative to that of a comparator group, the Ftse 250 excluding i nvestment t rusts, and 50% on Headline earnings per share (“Headline 
eps”, the calculation of which is shown in note 16) growth over a three-year period. the two measures operate independently. Vesting of 
performance shares and matching shares under the outstanding and future Ltip awards will be based on tsR performance and Headline eps 
growth in accordance with the schedules disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 39.
An executive’s matching shares award will only vest if the investment shares originally purchased have been retained. t he fair value of awards 
granted under the Ltip are measured using a stochastic pricing model for those shares based on tsR performance, and using a Black–s choles 
pricing model for those shares based on Headline eps performance.
(b)  Executive option schemes (“ESOS”)
t he last executive share option grant was made in 2003. under these schemes, share options were granted at the market price prevailing at the time 
of grant. Options normally only became exercisable if the growth in Headline eps was at least equal to the increase in the Rpi plus 3% per annum for 
a consecutive three-year period.
t he fair value of awards granted under the esOs was measured using a stochastic pricing model.
(c)  UK and international Sharesave schemes (“SAYE schemes”)
t he last grant under the sAYe schemes was made in 2004. under the sAY e schemes, employees had the opportunity to purchase ordinary shares 
in the company at a discounted price of up to 20% by using their savings together with an additional tax-free bonus at the end of their saving 
period. t he schemes operated in conjunction with a three or five-year savings contract and options were granted at a discount of up to 20% of the 
market value of the shares at the date of grant. employees who entered into these contracts had to make monthly savings of between £5 and £250.
t he fair value of awards granted under the sAYe schemes was measured using a Black–scholes pricing model.
(d)  Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP”)
in 2007, the c ompany implemented a new DsBp in place of the Ltip for certain senior managers. under this plan, executives receive an allocation 
of deferred shares to the value of a percentage of their annual bonus. t hese shares vest after three years, although an executive’s allocation may 
lapse if their employment ceases in certain circumstances before the end of the three-year period. 
t he fair value of awards granted under the DsBp scheme is measured using a Black–s choles pricing model.
(e)  Stock Appreciation Rights (“SAR”)
Due to the disadvantageous tax regime in Belgium, Belgian participants in the esOs and sAY e schemes received sAR instead of share options. t hese 
sAR were awarded under exactly the same rights and conditions as the share options, except that individuals received, in cash, the difference between 
the subscription price and market price of c ompany shares on the date of exercise, rather than having the right to purchase shares. 100

t he provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors’ current best estimate of the costs to be incurred both in the fulfilment of

demolition and clean-up of closed sites. t he provision comprises amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from 
legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including claims relating to product liability. As the settlement of many of the 
obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to some 
uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are 
regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters. 
t he provision for restructuring and integration charges includes the costs of all of the Group’s initiatives to rationalise its operating activities. t he 
balance of £38.4m as at 31 December 2010 comprises £25.1m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect of leases terminating between 
three and eighteen years, and £13.3m in relation to future expenditure on restructuring initiatives, the majority of which commenced in 2009 and 
2010 and which is expected to be paid out over the next two years.
Other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or 
from third-party claims. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, 
the timing of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over 
the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters. 
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group balance sheet only when its 
realisation is virtually certain. As at 31 December 2010, £10.1m (2009: £10.1m) was recorded in receivables in respect of associated insurance 
reimbursements, of which £7.5m (2009: £7.5m) is non-current. t he amounts reported in the table above as charged to the Group income statement 
represent only that part of the total income statement charge reported as a movement on provisions. Other components of the charge, such as 
asset write-offs, are reported as a reduction in the carrying value of the relevant balance sheet item. 103

on these acquisitions amounted to £3.0m (note 21). in 2009, the Group acquired interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures for a total consideration 
of £8.2m, of which £5.9m was paid in cash and £2.3m was deferred, subject to future earn-out arrangements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEmENTS
44.  COmmITmENTS (CONTINUED)
t he Group’s property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts. in accordance with the accounting 
policy in note 3.19, where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is 
capitalised in the Group balance sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation. Where all the risks and 
rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classified as an operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability 
to the lessor is recognised in the Group balance sheet.
As disclosed in the table above, as at 31 December 2010 the Group was committed to making £108.2m (2009: £115.8m) of future payments in 
respect of assets held under non-cancellable operating leases. t he cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating 
leases, all of which was charged within trading profit, amounted to £25.6m (2009: £24.4m).
45.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEmENTS
in compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business do not get 
reported in the Group balance sheet. Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors include: inventory held under precious 
metal consignment arrangements (note 27); future lease payments in relation to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases 
(note 44); and trade receivable balances that have been subject to non-recourse factoring arrangements.
under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sells trade receivables balances to a third-party factoring company in exchange for 
a cash payment from the factoring company, net of fees. All the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject to these arrangements are 
transferred to the factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables are derecognised in the Group balance sheet. such arrangements 
are used from time to time by the Group to manage the recovery of cash from its trade receivables. As at 31 December 2010, the Group balance 
sheet included £39.4m (31 December 2009: £34.2m) of cash that would otherwise have been reported as trade receivables if these arrangements 
were not in place. Factoring fees incurred during the year ended 31 December 2010, which are written off to the Group income statement within 
ordinary finance costs, amounted to £1.5m (2009: £1.4m).
46.  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Guarantees given by the Group under property leases of operations disposed of amounted to £4.1m (2009: £3.9m). Details of guarantees given by 
the c ompany, on behalf of the Group, are given in note 19 to the c ompany financial statements.
the Group has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation 
and environmental matters. several of the Group’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the 
ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax 
authorities. While the outcome of litigation can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the Group’s insurance 
arrangements, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the 
Group’s financial position or results of operations.
Legal claims have been brought against certain Group companies by third parties alleging that persons have been harmed by exposure to hazardous 
materials used by those companies in the manufacture of industrial and consumer products, and further claims may be brought in the future. c ertain 
of the Group’s subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits, predominately in the us, relating to a small number of products containing asbestos manufactured 
prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by the Group. t hese suits usually also name many other product manufacturers. to date, the Group is not 
aware of there being any liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries. A number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled and the 
amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position or results of operations. 
47.  PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES
Details of the principal subsidiaries and joint ventures of c ookson Group plc and the countries in which they are incorporated are given in note 7 
to the c ompany financial statements.
48.  RELATED PARTIES
All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm’s length basis and in accordance with normal business terms. t ransactions between 
related parties that are Group subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note. During the year, Group subsidiaries 
made sales of products and services to Group joint venture companies of £1.7m (2009: £1.1m) and made purchases of goods and services from 
Group joint venture companies of £13.5m (2009: £12.3m). As at 31 December 2010, amounts owed by the Group’s joint ventures to Group 
subsidiaries was £nil (2009: £nil) and amounts owed to Group joint ventures by Group subsidiaries was £nil (2009: £nil). Details of related party 
information in relation to key management personnel are given in note 11.2. 105

1.  BASIS OF PREPARATION
1.1  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
t he company-only financial statements of cookson Group plc (“the company”), a company registered in the united Kingdom, are prepared in 
accordance with the c ompanies Act 2006 and under the historical cost convention and in accordance with uK GAAp.
A separate c ompany-only profit and loss account has not been presented, as permitted by section 408(3) of the c ompanies Act 2006.
1.2  BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEmENTS ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS
t he Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the c ompany have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the 
c ompany.
2.  SUmmARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
the following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently when dealing with all items which are material in relation to the 
c ompany-only financial statements. 
2.1  CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAxATION
Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year. Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing 
differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred taxation assets are only recognised 
if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be 
deducted. provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at 
the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
2.2  SHARE-BASED PAYmENTS
t he c ompany operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees. equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. t he fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as 
the total shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. t he cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that 
will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not 
included in the fair value determined at the date of grant. For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using 
a form of stochastic option pricing model. For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black–scholes model.
2.3  PENSION COSTS
t he c ompany participates in a uK-wide Group pension plan (the “uK p lan”) providing benefits based on final pensionable salary. t he assets of the 
uK plan are held separately from those of the company in an independently administered fund. t he company is unable to identify its share of 
the underlying assets and liabilities of the uK plan on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRs 17, Retirement Benefits, 
accounts for the uK plan as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Following a period of consultation with its employees, the closure of the 
uK plan to future accrual took effect from 31 July 2010, with a new Group personal pension plan established in its place to provide defined 
contribution benefits for all eligible uK employees. As a result of these changes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the 
contributions payable to the uK plan and the Group personal pension plan during the year.
the new Group personal pension plan established with effect from 31 July 2010 also replaced, for future accrual, the uK-wide Group defined 
contribution pension plan to which the c ompany participated up to that date. t he assets of both old and new plans are held separately from those 
of the company in independently administered funds. t he amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable 
to each plan for the part of the year during which each was in operation. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions 
actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.

2.  SUmmARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
2.4  POST-RETIREmENT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSION PLANS
t he company operates a post-retirement healthcare benefits plan. t he costs of providing the benefits under this plan are not funded and the 
amount recognised in the balance sheet is based upon an independent actuarial valuation, using the projected unit method.
2.5  FOREIGN CURRENCIES
transactions in currencies other than the company’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated 
into sterling at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
2.6  FINANCE COSTS
interest-bearing borrowings are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges and direct issue costs are accounted 
for on an accruals basis in the profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
2.7  FINANCIAL INSTRUmENTS
t he c ompany uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to manage the effects 
of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates on its borrowings. in accordance with its treasury policy, the c ompany does 
not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. t he method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on 
whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. 
t he fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date. t he fair value of interest rate swaps is 
the estimated amount that the c ompany would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest 
rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
2.8 INVESTmENT IN SUBSIDIARIES 
shares in subsidiaries are stated at cost, together with long-term loans that are stated at amortised cost, less any impairment in value.
2.9  PROVISIONS
provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the company will be required to 
settle that obligation. provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. 108

17.  EmPLOYEE BENEFITS
17.1  PENSION PLANS
t he company participates in a uK-wide Group defined benefit pension plan (the “uK p lan”). t he company is unable to identify its share of the 
underlying assets and liabilities of the uK plan and therefore accounts for its membership of the plan as it would for a defined contribution plan. 
c osts charged in the year in respect of its contributions payable to the uK plan were £4.3m (2009: £3.7m). Following a period of consultation with 
its employees, the closure of the uK plan to future accrual took effect from 31 July 2010, with a new Group personal pension plan established in its 
place to provide defined contribution benefits for all eligible uK employees. As a result of these changes, the amount charged to the profit and loss 
account represents the contributions payable to the uK plan and the Group personal pension plan during the year.
t he last full actuarial valuation of the uK plan, which was performed by an independent qualified actuary, was carried out as at 31 December 
2009. At that date, the market value of the plan assets was £401.9m, representing 88% of accrued plan benefits at the time (using the projected 
unit method of valuation) of £456.4m. calculated on a “buy-out” basis (using an estimation of the cost of buying out the uK plan benefits with 
an insurance company), the liabilities at that date were £589.0m, representing a funding level of 68%. t he 2009 full valuation has been updated, 
as appropriate, in order to estimate the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2010, at which date the market value of the plan assets was 
£443.2m (2009: £404.1m), representing 101% (2009: 95%) of estimated accrued plan benefits of £439.7m (2009: £426.4m). 
in July 2010, the uK government announced changes to the inflation index used for statutory pension increases (both for pensions in payment 
and pensions in deferment) to apply to private sector pension schemes. t he c ompany, the uK plan t rustee and their respective legal advisers are 
currently working to clarify how this impacts the uK plan and will communicate with any affected members in 2011.
the new Group personal pension plan established with effect from 31 July 2010 also replaced, for future accrual, the uK-wide Group defined 
contribution pension plan to which the c ompany participated up to that date. t he pension cost charge represents contributions payable by the 
c ompany to each plan for the part of the year for which each was in operation and amounted to £0.1m (2009: £0.1m). t here were no outstanding 
contributions payable to the plan as at 31 December 2010 (31 December 2009: £nil). 114

19.  CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Where the c ompany enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the c ompany 
considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. in this respect, the company treats the guarantee contract as a 
contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the c ompany will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. Guarantees 
provided by the c ompany as at 31 December 2010 in respect of the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to £40.8m (31 December 2009: 
£32.5m), which includes guarantees under property leases of operations disposed of amounting to £4.1m (31 December 2009: £3.9m).
in addition, on behalf of its subsidiaries the c ompany has given guarantees to precious metals consignors amounting to £354.8m (2009: £304.5m), 
representing all of the value of precious metals held by its subsidiaries on consignment terms as at 31 December 2010. Further details of these 
consignment arrangements are given in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
cookson has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and 
environmental matters. several of the company’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the 
ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with 
tax authorities. While the outcome of litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and 
the insurance arrangements of the company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the 
aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the c ompany’s financial condition or results of operations.
20.  RELATED PARTIES
All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm’s length basis and in accordance with normal business terms. t ransactions between 
related parties that are wholly owned Group subsidiaries are not disclosed in this note.
During the year, the c ompany received a dividend of £0.2m (2009: £0.1m) from Foseco india Limited, a company that is 75% owned by the Group. 
At the balance sheet date, the c ompany had an outstanding loan payable of £nil (2009: £1.2m) to Vesuvius c eska Republika, a.s., a company that 
is 60% owned by the Group. 
21.  OPERATING LEASE COmmITmENTS
t he company charged £0.4m (2009: £0.4m) to the profit and loss account in respect of operating lease arrangements, of which £0.1m (2009: 
£0.1m) related to the hire of plant and machinery. payments under operating lease arrangements in 2011 are expected to be £0.4m, principally 
under lease arrangements ending in more than five years.

BOILER ROOm SCAmS
in recent years, many companies have become aware that their 
shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. t hese are typically from overseas based 
‘brokers’ who target uK shareholders, offering to sell them what often 
turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in us or uK investments. t hese 
operations are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’ . 
shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers 
to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports. if you receive 
any unsolicited investment advice:
	 make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation
	 check that they are properly authorised by the FsA before getting 
involved by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/register/ 
	 Report the matter to the FsA by calling 0845 606 1234 (or +44 20 7066

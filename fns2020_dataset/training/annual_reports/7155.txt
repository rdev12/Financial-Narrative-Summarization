corporate Statement 4
Following the strategic 
review of underperforming 
areas of the business the 
Group closed its French 
operation in November 
2006. This was followed 
by the disposal of Sutton 
Publishing in January 2007 
for £3.0 million. The impact 
of the restructuring led to 
a one-off charge to the 
Income Statement of £2.9 
million but net cash ended 
the year at £6.5 million. 
The impact of a weakened 
US Dollar against Sterling 
adversely affected 
reportable Group revenue 
and pre-tax profits by £1.5 
million and £0.4 million 
respectively.
At the beginning of the 
financial year the Group 
acquired the trade and 
assets of Bookworks 
Pty, the most prominent 
distributor of automotive 
repair information in 
Australia for £0.7 million. 
This was followed in 
February 2008 by the 
acquisition of Vivid Holding 
BV, a leading European 
supplier of digital technical 
information to the motor 
trade for £6.2 million. The 
acquisition of Vivid gave the 
Group access to language 
translation, 
web development, DVD 
production and digital 
security expertise which 
would be strategically 
important in developing 
the Group’s multi-media 
platforms going forward.
The first signs of an 
economic downturn were 
felt in the US in August 
2007.
In February 2009 the 
Group sold its loss making 
UK print operation for 
£0.4 million. Following 
the sale, the Group’s 
printing operations were 
centralised in the US 
where a new binding 
line was purchased 
for £1.8 million. After 
acquisition costs in 2008 
of £6.9 million and capital 
expenditure in 2008/09 
of £4.4 million, the Group 
ended the year with net 
cash of £1.4 million. Vivid 
set up a new product

development subsidiary 
in Romania. A crisis in the 
World’s financial markets 
led to a deepening global 
economic downturn 
impacting all areas of  
the Group.
At the start of the 
financial year the UK 
business implements a 
new fully integrated IT 
system at a cost of £0.4 
million. Following the sale 
of the UK print business 
in 2009 all parts of the 
Haynes Group are profit 
making for the first time 
in 10 years. In the US, 
the introduction of a new 
digital press allows the 
Group to extend the life of 
titles by printing smaller 
quantities of titles 
on demand. Global market 
conditions 
remain very weak 
but like-for-like sales in 
the UK, Scandinavia and 
Australia are ahead of the 
prior year. In May 2010 the 
Group celebrates its 50th 
Anniversary.
On 1 June 2010 John 
Haynes steps down as 
Group Chairman after 50 
years but remains on the 
Board as Founder Director.  
J Haynes is appointed 
Group Chairman; Jeremy 
Yates-Round and Alex 
Kwarts are appointed to 
the Executive Board. The 
US business embarks on 
‘Project 50’, a programme 
to restore an old Ford 
Mustang convertible to 
show condition with live 
webcam and video footage 
available through the US 
website and You Tube. 
Extreme weather conditions 
in the third quarter impacts 
US revenue but sales 
bounce back in the fourth 
quarter. Work continues 
on a new Haynes digital 
platform.

In this my first full year as Group 
Chairman I am pleased to report that 
the last twelve months has been a busy 
period for the Haynes Group. Over 
the last couple of years the focus of 
management has been on the financial 
management of the business, ensuring 
the Group is well placed to meet the 
challenges associated 
with the global economic 
downturn. However, with a 
stable underlying business 
and a strong balance  
sheet, management can 
now once again re-focus 
their attention on to the 
operational aspects of our 
business.
During the year we 
have been working on 
the development of 
an electronic Haynes 
product utilising the 
technical automotive, 
IT and product 
design skills we 
have within the 
Group. In the US, 
we have also been 
working closely 
with our key 
retail customers 
to implement 
new marketing 
initiatives to help improve the 
in-store display of our products. While in 
the UK, recognising the increasing cost 
of final salary pension schemes, we have 
put in place a benefit restructuring plan 
for the employee pension scheme with 
the intention to help place the scheme on 
a more affordable basis going forward. 
Whilst these projects do not directly 
impact on the results of the reportable 
year they have, nevertheless, been 
important projects during the year.
results summary
Turning to the results, like-for-like Group 
revenue ended the year 1% ahead of the 
prior year at £33.76 million. The like-for-
like revenue reflects the change in terms 
with a significant US customer, which 
reduced US revenue by £1.02 million. 
This was matched by a corresponding 
reduction in advertising allowances.

The Board
I was delighted to announce the 
appointment of Alex Kwarts (Managing 
Director of Vivid Holding BV) to the 
Group Board. Alex is an IT professional 
with considerable experience in the 
development of IT and web based 
products. The Vivid team have an important 
role to play in the development of a multi-
media electronic platform for Haynes 
products. 
On 9 September 2010, Andrew Garner 
stood down as a Non-Executive Director 
from the Group Board after five years 
of service to pursue his other business 
interests. Andrew made a valuable 
contribution to the 
Group during his time 
on the Board and we 
wish him well for the 
future.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 9.5 pence per share (2010: 9.3 pence), 
which together with the interim dividend 
paid in April gives a total dividend for the 
year of 15.7 pence per share (2010:  
15.5 pence). Subject to the final approval 
by shareholders, the final dividend will be 
paid on 26 October 2011 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business 
on 7 October 2011. The shares will be 
declared ex-dividend on 5 October 2011. 
When considering the amount of dividend 
to distribute annually the Board takes into 
account the movement in Group earnings 
as well as the existing and future cash 
requirements of the Haynes businesses.
People
On behalf of the Group Board I would 
like to acknowledge the contribution of 
all our employees for their hard work and 
dedication in helping to drive the business 
forward during the year. With operations 
in eight countries and covering three 
continents Haynes is very much a global 
business and we are cognisant of the part 
played by our employees around the World 
in helping the Group achieve its targets. 
Future prospects
I am very encouraged by the Group’s long 
term growth prospects. The development of 
an electronic multi-media product presents 
the Group with an exciting opportunity, not 
only to work with our existing customer 
base but also to target new customers 
and open up new geographical markets 
in the coming years. At the same time 
our strong cash generation provides the 
Group with the financial strength to pursue 
complimentary acquisition opportunities 
which will augment our own internal growth 
plans and help to drive further growth in the 
business.

Business overview
This year once again, despite the very 
challenging economic background and 
the extreme weather conditions which 
gripped our core markets during the 
third quarter, we have delivered a small 
increase in Group-pre-tax profit and 
increased Group cash by 40% over the 
prior year. 
As part of our 50th Anniversary 
celebrations, the US business embarked 
on a very unique and exciting venture 
we called “Project 50”. This involved 
the restoration of a 1965 Ford Mustang 
convertible with a 289 V8 engine and 
C4 automatic transmission from “barn 
find” condition to “show car ready” in 
time for the AAPEX/SEMA show in Las 
Vegas in November 2011. The progress 
of the restoration project can be viewed 
through the live webcam on the US 
website, www.haynes.com or through 
the video logs on You Tube. The process 
of stripping down and rebuilding the 
Mustang and documenting the step 
by step approach taken encapsulates 
perfectly the strengths of our business 
model and is what makes Haynes titles 
so popular throughout the globe.
In June of this year, we announced the 
development of a prototype electronic 
version of the iconic Haynes manual. 
‘Haynes Manual Online’ (MOL) will 
include all the information in one of our 
printed manuals but through the benefits 
of an electronic platform also includes 
audio and video clips, colour pictures 
and diagrams, hyperlinks, definitions and 
word search capability. The development 
of Haynes MOL illustrates the benefits

that are now starting to flow to the 
Haynes Group following the acquisition 
of Vivid Holding BV three years ago 
and in particular, how the IT and web 
based skills that Vivid bring to the Group 
compliment the technical automotive and 
product design skills we already possess 
within the Haynes Group. 
We have also been working closely with 
our key retail customers to identify new 
marketing initiatives for our products. 
An example of this has been in the 
US, where we have been working with 
our largest customers to trial new face 
out displays in their stores and also in 
Australia where the return to face out 
displays are being very well received 
by our largest customers. The results 
to-date have been encouraging and the 
trials in the US are being extended. In 
the UK we have experienced a stronger 
demand from our retail customers with 
an on-line presence.  
operating results overview
Group revenue during the year has 
been impacted by the re-negotiation of 
terms with a major US customer, which 
reduced reportable revenue by  
£1.02 million to £32.74 million but 
was offset by a matching reduction 
in advertising expense. Excluding the 
impact of this change, like-for-like 
revenue ended the year 1% ahead of last 
year at £33.76 million (2010:  
£33.31 million). In the US, reportable 
revenue, in local currency, ended the  
year in line with the prior period.
During the year our gross margin was 
adversely affected by two main factors. 
Firstly, and most significantly, the 
reduction in US revenue following the 
change in terms with the major customer 
which reduced our gross margin by  
£1.02 million or 3.2 percentage points but 
did not impact pre-tax profits. Secondly, 
in 2009 the Group changed the way it 
accounted for Vivid’s external product 
development costs to write down such 
costs on a straight line basis over five 
years and bring in line with International 
Reporting Standards and Haynes Group 
policy. The impact of this change has 
been to increase the annual intangible 
amortisation charge by approximately 
£0.40 million year-on-year until 2013. 
In 2010/11 this has reduced our gross 
margin by £0.40 million or 1.3 percentage 
points although it is important to note 
that whilst this impacts on our reportable 
profits it does not affect Group cash 
flows. The impact of these two factors 
has led to a reduction in our gross margin 
of 0.7 percentage points to 63.5% (2010: 
64.2%). 
Group chief Executive’s review 10
Group overheads ended the year 5% 
down on last year at £13.33 million (2010: 
£14.04 million). With net finance costs, 
which almost entirely relate to pension 
assets and liabilities, of £0.51 million 
(2010: £0.52 million) pre-tax profits ended 
the year marginally ahead of last year at 
£7.18 million (2010: £7.17 million).
Segmental overview
North America and Australia
Like-for-like revenue in our North 
American and Australian operation in 
local currency ended the year up 5% at 
$30.65 million (2010: $29.12 million). The 
like-for-like revenue reflecting the change 
in terms with the US customer, which 
reduced revenue by $1.62 million but was 
matched by a corresponding reduction in 
advertising expense.
In the US, sales through the first half 
of the year tracked in line with the 
prior period but blizzard conditions in 
late December 2010 caused severe 
disruptions to large parts of the Midwest 
and East coast and were followed 
in February 2011 by similar blizzard 
conditions in the Southern Plains and 
upper Midwest of the Country, with 
both events adversely affecting the 
ordering patterns of our key customers. 
Nevertheless we ended the year with 
like-for-like reportable revenue ahead of 
last year. 
After taking into account the lower 
advertising expense following the change 
in terms with the major US customer, the 
net impact of the above left segmental 
operating profit in local currency 10% 
ahead of last year at $7.02 million (2010: 
$6.38 million). After translation to Sterling, 
applying an average Sterling to US Dollar 
exchange rate during the year of $1.59 
(2010: $1.58), segmental operating profit 
was also up 10% at £4.43 million (2010: 
£4.03 million).
united Kingdom and Europe
In the UK, despite a slow start to 
the year, overall sales of our Haynes 
titles ended the twelve month period 
in line with last year. We started our 
financial year with what we believed to be 
a strong general publishing programme 
and this has been borne out as revenues 
from our top 10 selling titles were up 20% 
on last year, with our ‘USS Enterprise 
manual’ and ‘Wallace & Gromit Cracking 
Contraptions manual’ being our top two 
selling titles during the year.
In the rest of Europe, revenue from Vivid 
in local currency ended the year 1% 
ahead of last year. Vivid operate in a 
competitive market place and we have 
been encouraged by new contract gains 
in Spain, Sweden, Italy and in Germany. 
Overall UK and European revenue ended 
the year 3% down on last year at  
£14.43 million (2010: £14.93 million).
Following the additional expenditure 
we incurred on our 50th anniversary 
promotional activity in 2010, we have 
seen advertising costs return to more

financial year with what we believed to be 
Following the additional expenditure  11
normal levels during the current 
year. Also during the year, the 
Group reviewed the allocation 
of overheads to the UK and 
European segments. As a 
result of this review,  
£0.51 million of overheads 
which had previously been 
allocated to the segment 
have this year been retained 
as a central overhead. Partially 
offsetting the above was the higher 
development cost amortisation in Vivid 
which increased segmental costs by 
£0.40 million. 
As a result of the above and despite the 
lower revenue, UK & European segmental 
operating profits rose by 10% to  
£2.40 million (2010: £2.19 million).
Taxation
The Haynes Group has trading 
subsidiaries in eight different countries 
and an effective rate for taxation which 
reflects the national rates applied to 
the profits generated locally in these 
territories. During the year under review 
the Group’s charge to taxation on 
continuing operations was £2.43 million 
(2010: £2.49 million) with an effective rate 
of 33.8% (2010: 34.7%).
Working capital and cash flows
The monitoring and control of the 
Group’s working capital balances 
remains a key priority for management. 
Inventory volumes have been reduced 
over the last few years in response to 
the economic downturn but in recent 
month’s management have been slowly 
increasing finished goods volumes and 
raw material levels, particularly in the US 
ahead of announced price increases.   
Nevertheless, it is relevant to note 
that finished goods volumes and raw 
materials stocks are still 16% lower and 
42% lower respectively, than four  
years ago. 
The net impact of the movements in 
inventory and trade receivables has 
meant that the Group cash inflow 
generated from continuing operations 
before  
tax was 
£8.38 million 
(2010:  
£10.23 million) 
which represented 
109% of Group 
operating profit 
(2010: 133%). With a lower requirement 
to replenish tangible fixed assets 
during the year leading to a reduction 
in capital expenditure of £0.58 million 
and our investment in intangible product 
development remaining in line with the 
previous year at £2.13 million (2010: 
£2.14 million) Group cash ended the year 
up 40% at £5.38 million (2010:  
£3.84 million).
Pensions
The Group has a number of different 
retirement programmes in the various 
countries in which it operates. The 
principal pension programmes are a 
contributory defined benefit scheme 
in the UK, a non-contributory defined 
benefit plan in the US and a defined 
contribution scheme in the Netherlands.
In recent years the Group has increased 
its contribution to the UK Scheme by 
1.1% with a further £0.4 million per 
year in contributions to help reduce the 
past service deficit. On 1 June 2010, 
the Group increased its contribution 
by a further 1% and in April 2011, the 
Company commenced a consultation 
exercise with its UK employees to 
restructure certain of the UK scheme 
as a central overhead. Partially 
offsetting the above was the higher 
normal levels during the current 
before

benefits and to increase the UK member 
contribution rate by 3%, the aim of 
which was to place the UK Scheme on 
a more affordable footing going forward. 
Whilst the consultation process was 
not completed until after the end of the 
financial year and therefore, does not 
impact the 2010/11 figures I am pleased 
to report that with the support of the 
active members the changes have been 
implemented in line with the Company’s 
proposals and will be reflected in the next 
triennial valuation for the period ended  
30 June 2011.
As at 31 May 2011 the aggregate deficit 
on the two defined benefit schemes as 
reported in accordance with IAS 19 was 
£10.43 million (2010: £14.02 million). 
The reduction in the aggregate deficit 
is due to a combination of factors but 
most noticeably, a higher return on the 
schemes assets both in the UK and the 
US, a move to the latest mortality tables 
in the UK and the move to calculate UK 
Statutory Revaluation Orders using CPI 
rather than RPI.
Group outlook
We enter the new financial year in a 
strong financial position. We have cash 
in the bank, we are free of gearing and 
the Group has realistic business plans for 
the coming year. However, the continuing 
turmoil in the global economy 
could have implications which 
affect these plans.
Following the recent development 
of a Haynes MOL prototype, we 
are currently in the process of 
demonstrating the prototype to 
our retail customers in the US with 
a plan to convert the top 50 selling 
US manuals to an electronic 
format in the current financial year. 
We also follow with interest the 
progression of e-books which 
is of greater relevance to our 
general interest titles. Although 
to-date it has been largely black 
& white fiction titles that have 
dominated the e-books market, 
the technology and the platforms 
for this to widen to colour 
illustrated titles is not too far away. We 
also strongly believe that for the DIY 
market in particular, a digital product will 
complement and work alongside, rather 
than replace, the printed product.
In Europe, Vivid is looking to build on its 
extensive database of European vehicles 
and its strong language skills to expand 
its business model into new geographical 
markets. The first phase of this new 
development programme covering the 
Brazilian market will commence in the 
coming year as will initial studies of the 
US market opportunities.
It is important for the Group to augment 
internal growth with complementary 
acquisitions as such opportunities 
present themselves. This is a strategy 
that has served the Group well in recent 
years and we will continue to evaluate 
relevant acquisition opportunities.

•  Share capital and related matters  Details of the Company’s share capital are shown in Note 
20 to the consolidated financial statements.  
 Both the ‘A’ Ordinary shares and the Ordinary shares carry equal voting rights of one vote  
 per share where a matter is decided other than on a show of hands. Both classes of share rank  
 ‘pari passu’ (including any distribution by way of dividend and on a return of capital), save that a  
 transfer of ‘A’ Ordinary shares will not be permitted by the directors other than to a member  
 of the holder’s immediate family or to family settlements. The holders of ‘A’ Ordinary shares may  
 convert such shares into Ordinary shares at the rate of one Ordinary share for each ‘A’ Ordinary  
 share, subject to the further provisions of the Articles of Association and the Companies Acts.
 The ‘A’ Ordinary shares represent 55% of the total issued capital, and the Ordinary shares 45%.
 Other than as expressed above, there are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor  
 on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions of the Articles  
 of Association and prevailing legislation.
 At the AGM on 13 October 2010:
 (i) A special resolution was passed to renew the directors’ authority to make purchases of its  
  own shares up to a maximum number of 1,500,000 shares. The authority which relates to  
  9% of the Company’s issued share capital remains unexercised and will expire at the  
  conclusion of the AGM in 2011, if not reviewed, and
 (ii) An ordinary resolution was passed giving the directors a general authority to allot further  
  shares of the Company, having an aggregate nominal value of £1,090,102. This represents  
  approximately one-third of the total ordinary share capital of the Company in issue at the  
  date the resolution was passed and is in line with institutional shareholder guidelines. This  
  authority will expire at the conclusion of the AGM in 2011, if not renewed, and
 (iii) A Special Resolution was passed to renew the Directors’ authority to issue equity securities  
  for cash otherwise than in proportion to existing holdings. This authority is limited to shares  
  having a maximum aggregate nominal value of £163,515 which represents just under 5% of  
  the total ordinary share capital of the Company in issue at the date the resolution was  
  passed. The figure of 5% is the amount recommended by the Pre-Emption Group as being  
  likely to be considered by the shareholders as “routine”. This authority will expire at the  
  conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2011 if not renewed. 
• appointment and replacement of directors  With regards to the appointment and replacement  
 of directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies Acts, the  
 Combined Code, and related legislation.
•	 Powers of directors  The powers of the directors are more specifically described in the Main  
 Board terms of reference, a copy of which can be found at http://www.haynes.co.uk/investor

•	 c hange of control  Excepting general commercial and trading agreements which may contain  
 provisions that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company, the  
 directors are not aware of any significant such agreements to which the Company is a party.  
 Furthermore the directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and its directors 
 or employees that provide for compensation upon the receipt by the Company of a takeover bid.

•  Financial instruments  The Group’s policies in relation to financial instruments and financial risk 
management are included in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
•  Foreign exchange  The Group’s main currency exposure is derived from trading transactions 
between Group operating units and with our global customer base. Approximately 47%  
(2010: 50%) of the Group’s revenue streams are generated in US Dollars, 27% (2010: 28%) in 
Sterling, 13% (2010: 13%) in Euro’s with the balance coming from a mix of currencies across our 
operating entities. Although the Group has an exposure to foreign currencies it is able to offset 
part of the currency risk as the printed product for the European markets is manufactured in the 
US and invoiced in local currency.
•  Donations  During the year Group donations to charitable organisations amounted to £13,614 
(2010: £9,796). There were no political donations in the year.
•  Environmental policy and social and community issues  The Board is committed to 
minimising the impact its operations have on the local environment. The Group operates a single 
printing facility, located in Nashville, Tennessee. It is Group policy to ensure that both national 
and local environmental laws and guidelines are adhered to in full. The Board ensures that key 
management are tasked with the responsibility to oversee the Group’s activities which impact 
the environment and to report back to the Board with any recommendations they may have 
regarding environmental policy. No social or community reviews have been undertaken in the 
current or preceding years.
•	 	 Directors’ and officers’ indemnity insurance  The Group purchases and maintains insurance 
for the directors and officers of the Parent Company including the trustees of the pension 
scheme when undertaking duties in accordance with Sc 233 of the Companies Act 2006.
•	 Disabled persons  The Group encourages the employment of disabled persons whenever 
practicable. The Group policy is to ensure that disabled employees and those who may become 
disabled benefit from training and career development in common with other employees.
•	 	 Employees, and health & safety  The Group involves employees by providing them with 
information which concerns them, consults with them and considers their views when making 
decisions which affect their interests and generally discloses matters affecting the Group’s 
performance through company briefings.
•	 	 Policy on payment of suppliers  The Group operates in various locations throughout the 
world. It is not Group policy to follow any specified code or standard on payment practice but 
the payment policies adopted reflect the terms negotiated with individual suppliers as well as the 
custom and practice of the locality. It is the Company’s intention to continue to apply the Group 
policy in the forthcoming year. At 31 May 2011 the amount of trade creditors as shown in the 
balance sheet represents 23 days of average purchases for the Company and 25 days for  
the Group.
•  Disclosure of information to auditors  Each of the directors confirms that they have taken all 
the steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information needed 
by the Company’s auditors for the purposes of their audit and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of the information. The directors are not aware of any relevant audit information of which 
the auditors are unaware. 
  A resolution to re-appoint BDO LLP as auditors of the Company and to authorise the directors 
to determine their remuneration will be put to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
 By order of the Board.

c orporate Governance
Introduction 
The principles of good corporate governance are designed to improve company performance 
by helping a board discharge its duties in the best interests of shareholders, whilst facilitating 
efficient and entrepreneurial management to deliver shareholder value over the longer term. 
Nevertheless, the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (‘the Code’) published in June 
2008 and appended to the Listing Rules and which applies to our reportable financial year is not 
intended to be a rigid set of rules. Rather it is a guide to the components of good governance 
which companies are expected to follow. The Code recognises that one set of provisions will 
not necessarily fit all companies. Accordingly, there are certain provisions within the Code which 
do not apply to companies below the FTSE 350. There may also be areas of the Code where 
smaller companies judge the provisions to be disproportionate or less relevant to their particular 
circumstances and where good governance can be achieved by other means. Where companies 
decide this is the case, the areas of strict non-compliance with the Code need to be explained in 
the Annual Report.
This section of the Annual Report explains how the Board and its Committees discharge their 
duties and how the Board applies the principles of the Code. Also included in the sections below 
are details of those areas where the Company’s governance differs from the strict provisions of 
the Code. The full text of the Code can be found on the FRC website at www.frc.org.uk.
In June 2010, the Financial Reporting Council issued an updated version of the Combined Code 
entitled ‘The UK Corporate Governance Code’ which applies to accounting periods beginning on 
or after 29 June 2010. Accordingly, this is the last year of reporting under the Code published in 
June 2008.
Statement of compliance 
The Board of Haynes Publishing Group P .L.C. recognises the importance of high standards of 
corporate governance. Accordingly, it has considered the principles and provisions of the Code 
and will continue to manage its affairs in line with the principles where it is in the interests of the 
business and of shareholders to do so. Other than where expressly stated, the Company has 
complied with the principles, supporting principles and provisions of the Code throughout the 
year under review.
Board of directors
During the year the Board reviewed its terms of reference which lay precise emphasis upon its 
responsibility for the overall management and strategic direction of the Group. The Board aims to 
encourage entrepreneurial endeavour within a framework of prudent planning and control. The Board 
appraises and approves major financing, investment and contractual decisions in excess of defined 
thresholds. All members of the Board are cognisant of their duty to act collectively and objectively in 
the best interests of the Company. Both the Audit Committee and the Remuneration & Nomination 
Committee are chaired by the senior independent non-executive director. The non-executive 
directors are intrinsically involved in scrutinising and monitoring the performance of management, and 
assessing the processes for the control of financial and other risks. The terms of reference for the 
Committees may be viewed on www.haynes.co.uk/investors.
•	 	 Following 	 the 	 appointment 	 of 	 J	 Y ates-Round	on 	 1 	 June 	 2010 	 the	 Boar d 	 comprised 	 five 	 executive	
and three non-executive directors, two of whom were considered to be independent by the 
Board. On 1 September 2010, the number of executive directors increased to six following the 
appointment of A Kwarts and on 9 September 2010, A Garner resigned as a non-executive 
director, leaving the Board with one independent non-executive director. Whilst the Board 
recognises the recommendation under A.3.2 of the Code for smaller companies to have two 
independent non-executive directors, the Board feels that at present, the composition of the Board 
is appropriate to enable the Board to discharge its duties in the best interests of the shareholders. 
The biographies of the directors are set out on pages 14 and 15 of this Annual Report.
•	 	 The 	 division	 of 	 r esponsibility 	 between 	the 	 Gr oup 	 Chairman	 and 	the 	Gr oup 	 Chief 	 Executive 	 is 	clear	
and understood and was committed to writing during the year and approved by the Board. The 
Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness along with 
the effectiveness of the individual directors while the Chief Executive is responsible for the day  
to day running of the business. 21
•	 	 The 	 non-executive 	 dir ectors 	 occasionally 	hold 	meetings 	 informally	 without	the 	 executive	 dir ectors 	
present. Likewise, the Chairman occasionally meets with the non-executive directors without the 
executive directors present.
•	 	 The 	 Boar d	 meets 	 at 	 r egular 	 intervals	of 	 appr oximately 	 two 	 months 	 to 	 determine	 and 	monitor 	
corporate strategy, to review the trading and financial performance of the Group and to consider 
matters specifically reserved for its approval. The following table details the number of board and 
committee meetings held during the year and the attendance record of the individual directors:

who is not dependent on the Group or its management for his or her primary source of 
income, and was not within the last five years a senior manager within the Group, and does 
not participate in the Group’s incentive bonus schemes or pension schemes.

other members of the Board and his significant interest in shares determine that he is not 
independent in line with the provisions of the Code. Notwithstanding these circumstances or 
relationships, the Board believes MEF Haynes to be independent in character and judgment.

Information, professional development and evaluation
All directors are provided with regular performance updates and full and timely access to 
information that enables them to make informed decisions on corporate and business issues. 
The Board receives monthly management accounts explaining performance against budget 
and the comparable year for each sector of the business, as well as risk management and 
business plans. The executive directors receive information on sales and margin for the 
individual businesses within the Group on a weekly basis, and for the major businesses such 
information can be accessed daily.
Directors are encouraged to regularly update and refresh their skills and knowledge on the 
basis that ‘all development is self development’. The Group Secretary is responsible through 
the Group Chairman for facilitating the training and induction of newly appointed directors, 
and ensuring that they are familiar with the Company’s operations and their own duties and 
responsibilities. He is also responsible for advising the Board through the Group Chairman on 
all governance and legal matters.
During the year, the Board has undertaken a formal appraisal of its own performance and 
processes and that of its committees, including a review of each committee’s composition and 
operating procedures.
Through a combination of personal discussions, general observation and ongoing monitoring 
of performance, the contribution of each individual director has been assessed by the 
Chairman against expected standards. The process of ongoing monitoring and review helps 
the Chairman to ensure that the contribution of the directors continues to be to the agreed 
standards relevant to the Group’s business and organisation. 
In turn, the Chairman’s own performance has been reviewed by the senior independent director 
following consultation with his fellow non-executive director and other members of the Board.
According to the Articles of Association all directors should seek re-election by shareholders 
at regular intervals of no more than three years. Directors are also subject to re-election by 
shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment. In accordance with the provisions of the 
combined code, non-executive directors who have served for more than nine years should offer 
themselves for re-election annually.
Directors remuneration, contracts and nomination
•  In accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code, a Remuneration & Nomination 
Committee with its own terms of reference has been established by the Board. The Board’s 
Report on Remuneration, which follows on pages 26 to 32, sets out details of the Group’s 
policy on remuneration, directors remuneration and the work of the Remuneration & 
Nomination Committee. This includes an explanation of those areas of non adherence to the 
provisions of the Combined Code.
•  The Remuneration & Nomination Committee is responsible for succession planning and 
recommending to the Board the appointment of new directors. The Board formally vets 
and scrutinises these proposals. The Committee’s composition is explained in the Board’s 
Report on Remuneration. Traditionally the Committee has been reliant upon its own energies 
and judgement in sourcing and evaluating candidates for vacancies on the Board. External 
search consultants and open advertising have not been preferred methods in the past due 
to the high costs associated with such channels. 
•  All executive directors have rolling service contracts with the Company terminable on 
less than two years notice, which in all cases may be served by either party. For recent 
appointments a notice term of one year or less has been implemented as a matter of course  
(see pages 30 and 31).
•  The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company but are usually 
appointed at the will of the Board for a fixed period of two years.
c orporate Governance (continued) 23
Dialogue with shareholders
•	 	 The	dir ectors 	consider	 that	clear	and	 timely	communication 	of	information 	to	Shar eholders 	
is an important part of their function. The Group Chairman’s and Group Chief Executive’s 
reviews on pages 6 to 12 provide a summary of the Group’s trading performance and future 
outlook. In addition to the publication, twice a year, of the Group’s financial results, there will 
often be briefings for Shareholders or their representatives, especially following the Group’s 
interim and final preliminary announcements.
•	 	 The	Gr oup 	Chairman	is	 in 	 a 	 good	position 	to	ensur e 	that	the	 views	of	 major 	 Shar eholders 	
are communicated to the Board as a whole. Additionally, once a quarter, the Chief Executive 
updates the Board with any significant discussions/feedback from Shareholders.
•	 	 The	Boar d	 views 	 the 	 Annual 	General	 Meeting 	 as	an 	 ideal 	 opportunity	to	 communicate	
with both institutional and private investors alike and confirms its compliance with all 
the provisions of the Combined Code relating to the constructive use of Annual General 
Meetings. This year’s Annual General Meeting will be held on 19 October 2011 and all 
executive and non-executive directors (including Committee chairmen) plan to be present 
and available to answer questions.
accountability, audit, and audit committee
It is the intention of the Board through this Annual Report, and other public reports and 
announcements, to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s 
position and prospects. The directors have set out their responsibility for preparing the 
accounts on page 33 of the financial statements.
•	 	 An	 Audit 	 Committee	with	appr oved 	written	 terms	of	 r efer ence 	 has	been	established 	by	the	
Board. Until the resignation of A Garner from the Main Board on 9 September 2010 and 
in line with C.3.1 of the Code, the Committee comprised two independent non-executive 
directors. Following A Garner’s resignation, the Committee comprises the Board’s sole 
independent non-executive director E Bell (Chairman of the Committee), who the Board 
considers to have had recent and relevant financial experience. During the year the 
Committee kept under review the effectiveness of the Company’s financial control policies 
and procedures for assessing and reporting financial risk.
•	 	 The	Audit	Committee	 is	r esponsible 	 for	making 	r ecommendations 	 to	the	 Boar d 	in	r elation 	to	
the appointment and remuneration of the external auditors. Consequently the Committee is 
responsible for monitoring the auditor’s performance, cost effectiveness, independence and 
objectivity, which it has done throughout the year.
•	 	 The	Committee	 is	authorised	to 	investigate 	 any 	 matter	within 	its	terms	 of	r efer ence 	and 	
where necessary to obtain external legal or other independent professional advice.
•	 	 The	Committee	 meets	 with 	 the	 Gr oup’ s 	exter nal 	auditors	at	 least	twice	a	year	to	discuss 	
the Group’s framework of controls, Group reporting and other relevant matters. At the 
conclusion of each annual audit, the Audit Committee receives and considers a report from 
the Group’s auditors setting out any material findings from their audit of the individual Group 
companies, and reports to the Board as necessary. The Group Finance Director is invited 
to attend all meetings of the Committee, albeit part of the meeting may be held without his 
presence, if deemed appropriate by the Committee.
•	 	 The	Committee	 keeps	under	r eview 	the 	“Whistle	blowing” 	arrangements	acr oss 	the	 Gr oup 	to	
ensure that procedures are in place for staff to report fraud and similar matters.
•	 	 In	certain	 cir cumstances 	 it	is	permitted	by	the	 Boar d 	for 	the	 auditors	to	supply	 non-audit 	
services (in the provision of tax advice, or on specific projects where they can add value). 
The Committee has approved and monitored the application of this policy in order to 
safeguard auditor objectivity and independence. 24
Haynes Publishing Group P.L.c .  Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Internal controls
By means of the systems and processes outlined below, the Board maintains a sound system 
of internal control to safeguard its assets and the investments of shareholders. The Board 
has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control. However, such a system 
is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. At least annually, the Board conducts a review of the effectiveness of these internal 
controls, as described below, and takes the necessary action to remedy any significant failings 
or weaknesses which may be identified by its review.
Financial
•	 	 A	 compr ehensive	 budgeting	 system	 is 	 in	 place 	 with	 annual	 budgets 	 r equiring	 appr oval	 by	 the	
directors. The results of the trading companies within the Group are reported monthly and 
compared to plan. The Group reports its financial results to shareholders on a six monthly 
basis and in between provides a quarterly update to shareholders and the market on trading 
performance.
•	 	 Authority 	limits 	exist 	acr oss 	the	Gr oup 	defining	 expenditur e	levels	 and	 the	Gr oup 	has	clearly	
prescribed guidelines for capital expenditure which includes detailed appraisal and review, 
levels of authority and due diligence requirements when businesses or assets are being 
acquired.
•	 	 A	 r eport 	on	 the 	 Gr oup’ s 	cash	flow 	and	 tr easury 	position 	is	r eceived 	by	the	 dir ectors 	 at	every	
Board meeting.
•	 	 In	addition	 (to	the	extent	 r equir ed	to	form	 a 	 statutory 	 audit 	 opinion)	the	Gr oup’ s 	financial	
systems are subject to annual review by the Group’s external auditors and reportable 
weaknesses, if any, identified during this annual review process are discussed with the Audit 
Committee.
o perational
•	 	 Ther e	is	 a 	 clearly 	 defined	organisational 	 structur e	which 	 allows	the 	Gr oup’ s	 objectives	to	be 	
planned, executed, controlled and monitored. The Group is committed to employing suitably 
qualified staff so that the appropriate level of authority can be delegated with regard to 
accountability and acceptable levels of risk.
•	 	 The	dir ectors	 and	senior	management	implement 	the	contr ol	 objectives	of	the 	Gr oup 	
through the adoption of defined checks and procedures. These include the review of 
financial and operational information, the setting up of appropriate authority levels, the 
segregation of incompatible duties and the defining of procedures for seeking and obtaining 
approval for major transactions and organisational changes.
•	 	 The	management 	information	systems	 pr ovide 	 the	dir ectors 	with	r elevant 	and 	timely 	r eports, 	
from which the directors can monitor the performance of the business. The executive 
directors have a significant involvement in the day to day management of the Group’s 
activities and accordingly are able to monitor and control procedures at an operational level.

c orporate Governance (continued) 25
r isk management
•	 	 The	Boar d 	 has	the	primary	 r esponsibility 	for 	identifying	the	major	business 	risks	facing	 the	
Group and developing appropriate policies to manage those risks. These policies are used 
both by the directors and by senior management to determine the key control procedures 
for each area of risk identified by the Board and the degree of information required to 
safeguard the business and the assets used within it.
•	 	 It	 is 	 accepted	that 	risk	 is 	 itself	pr evalent	 in 	 any 	commer cial 	enterprise	 and	that	it 	must	be 	 the	
objective of the Group’s management and staff to be prudent in the acceptance and control 
of risk incurring activity, rather than aiming to eliminate it entirely. Thus the reporting systems 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against damage or loss resulting 
from business activities.
•	 	 Thr ough	its 	day	 to 	 day 	 management	disciplines,	face 	to	 face 	 meetings,	r egular 	written	
reports and monitoring systems, the Group evaluates and mitigates unnecessary risks.
•	 	 In	addition,	 ther e 	 ar e 	 a	number	 of	ar eas 	 of	the	 Gr oup’ s 	business 	wher e 	 it	is	 necessary	 to	
take risks in order to strive for satisfactory profitability and returns to shareholders. The 
publication both of workshop manuals and books of special and general interest engenders 
commercial and publishing risk requiring close evaluation by editors and editorial committees 
with an in-depth knowledge of their subject and their markets.
•	 	 For	 the 	 financial 	 year	ended	 31	May	 2011, 	 the	Boar d 	 is	satisfied	that	ther e 	was 	in	place	 an 	
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating, and managing the significant risks faced by the 
Group as a whole. This process is formally structured by means of a written report which 
is reviewed annually by the Board. In addition, through discussion with the heads of the 
various operating units, an update is provided to the Board by the Group Finance Director 
at the half year. Risks identified by this process are regularly reviewed by the Board and 
addressed jointly by the Group Chief Executive and directors drawing upon the skills of 
senior management as necessary. The Board monitors this process and is satisfied that, 
given the size of the Group, and the nature of its operations, this process is sufficient to meet 
its needs without unduly hampering entrepreneurial activity, and that (in accordance with the 
recommendation of the Audit Committee) a separate internal audit function is not required.
Going concern
•	 	 After	making	 enquiries,	the	dir ectors 	have	a	r easonable 	 expectation	that	the	 Company	
and the Group have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. In forming this view, the directors have reviewed the Group’s budgets, cash 
flow forecasts and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months along with 
forecast capital expenditure for the next five years. The Board also considers the impact of 
the financial risks upon the business, details of which are included in Note 18 to the  
financial statements. 26

Board r eport on r emuneration
1 Best Practice
The Board Report on Remuneration (‘the Report’) aims to provide shareholders with information 
on the remuneration of the directors of Haynes Publishing Group P .L.C., and the criteria by 
which that remuneration has been determined during the year under review. The Report has 
been prepared in accordance with the requirements of The Companies Acts and the applicable 
UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules.
2 c onstitution of the r emuneration and n omination c ommittee 
Until the resignation of A Garner on 9 September 2010 and in line with A.4.1 and B.2.1  
of the Code, the Committee comprised two independent non-executive directors. Following  
A Garner’s resignation, the Committee comprises the Board’s sole independent non-executive 
director, E Bell (Chairman of the Committee), JHC Haynes (Executive Chairman) and MEF 
Haynes (non-executive director). Whilst JHC Haynes is not independent of management,  
as required by B.2.1 of the Combined Code, in considering the composition of the Committee, 
the Board gave full consideration to the other provisions of the Combined Code and in 
particular, B.2 which states that Remuneration Committees should consult with the Chairman 
and/or the Group Chief Executive about their proposals relating to the remuneration of the other 
executive directors. Having considered the Committee’s terms of reference, the constitution  
of the Group Board and the frequency of meetings, the Board felt it practical to include the 
Main Board Chairman as a member of the Committee. Any changes affecting his remuneration 
were discussed by the Committee without his participation.
3 Policy on directors’ remuneration 
The Committee is responsible for determining the emoluments of the executive directors of 
the Group. The Committee frames its decisions to ensure that the Group’s executive directors 
are appropriately rewarded for their contributions to the Group, whilst reflecting their scale of 
responsibility and performance. Through monitoring the market place and the occasional use of 
external advisers, the Committee seeks to offer remuneration packages which not only reflect 
current market conditions but are also commensurate with attracting, retaining and motivating 
directors of quality to ensure the continued growth and success of the Group. During the year 
under review, the Committee did not use the services of external advisers. In determining the 
emoluments of the executive directors, the Committee feels it is impractical to also monitor in 
detail the remuneration of senior management below board level as required by B.2.2 of the 
Code. Accordingly, the remuneration packages of senior management below Board level are 
reviewed by the executive director responsible for the respective business areas in which the 
senior managers are employed.
It is the Committee’s policy to ensure that there is a strong link between the level of 
executive directors’ remuneration and the performance both of the Group and its individual 
trading companies. Thus each executive director can augment their basic salary through 
a performance related bonus/incentive arrangement. The Committee has considered the 
appointment of permanent external consultants; however given the combined experience 
resting in the Committee members and bearing in mind the considerable costs of appointing 
permanent consultants, it is thought preferable that such an appointment should not be made.
4 Directors’ remuneration 
(i) Total emoluments
(a) The total emoluments of the directors of the Company were as follows:
  2011 2010
  £000 £000
Salaries and taxable benefits  1,021 813
Performance related bonuses  351 356
  1,372 1,169
Non-Executive Directors’ fees  65 71
T otal emoluments  1,437 1,240
Pension contributions  398 297 
  1,835 1,537 27
(b) The following categories comprise the principal elements of executive directors’ 
remuneration:
•	 	 Basic 	salaries	 and	fixed	benefits
•	 	 Annual	bonuses
•	 	 Pensions
 
Each of these elements is viewed with equal importance by the Committee, so as to ensure 
that the remuneration packages reflect not only the short term but also the longer term goals 
of the Company and of the Group. Consequently, although contrary to Schedule A, item 6 of 
the Combined Code provisions, the Committee believes that, as the performance bonus is an 
integral part of the executive directors’ remuneration package and as it is and has been for 
many years, part of their employment contracts, it is proper for this amount to form part of the 
directors’ pensionable salary. Pensionable salary is defined under the UK pension scheme rules 
as the amount declared to the Inland Revenue on an individual’s P60.
Each element of remuneration payable to the executive directors is discussed in more detail 
below and tabulated later in this Report.
Non-executive directors receive a fee for their services and are entitled to the reimbursement of 
incidental expenses. 
(ii) Basic salary and benefits
Basic salaries for all executive directors are reviewed annually by the Committee. When 
undertaking their annual review, the Committee is mindful of the annual pay review process for 
employees and employment conditions elsewhere within the Group as well as RPI and similar 
indices of inflation. Whilst these are important factors in determining the appropriate level of pay 
for the executive directors, they are not the only factors that it will consider when reaching  
its decision. 
The standard increase in executive directors’ base salaries during the financial year 
commencing 1 June 2010 was 3%. However, as from 1 June 2010 the UK Company increased 
its contribution to the UK defined benefit pension scheme by 1% and in line with the other UK 
employees the annual salary increase for JHC Haynes and J Yates-Round was 2%. In addition, 
each executive director is entitled to holiday in accordance with the Company’s policy for full 
time employees.
E Oakley, D Benhardus, J Yates-Round and A Kwarts are provided with a fully expensed car. 
JH Haynes is entitled to a fully expensed car in the US and to fuel expenses in the UK. JHC 
Haynes has opted to take an annual allowance in lieu of a company car and is entitled to 
receive fuel expenses.
All executive directors receive long term disability insurance and travel insurance, together with 
health cover for themselves and their immediate families. 28
Haynes Publishing Group P.L.c .  Annual Report & Accounts 2011
(iii) Annual bonus
An annual bonus is paid to each director based on the performance of the overall Group or of 
a substantial component of the Group. The bonuses payable in respect of the financial year 
ended 31 May 2011 were as follows:
JHC Haynes was entitled to a bonus of 0.5% on the first £4.5 million of overall Group net profit 
and 1.5% thereafter.
E Oakley was entitled to the following proportion of overall Group net profit: 1.5% on the first 
£4.5 million, 2.5% between £4.5 million and £7.5 million, and 3.5% over £7.5 million. This 
arrangement was last subject to review on 1 December 2007 and will be reviewed again during 
the current financial year.
Additionally, E Oakley is entitled to a one time discretionary bonus at an amount to be decided 
by the Chairman in consultation with the Committee in the event that the Group disposes 
of one of the Group’s businesses at a gain entirely attributable to the performance of that 
business.
D Benhardus was entitled to 0.5% of overall Group net profit.
J Yates-Round was entitled to a bonus of 1% of the net profit of the UK and European 
businesses.
A Kwarts was entitled to a bonus calculated on the net profits of the Vivid Group based on the 
following: 0.5% if the net profit exceeds the prior year by 15% or more but less than 25%, 1% 
if the net profit exceeds the prior year by 25% or more but less than 50% and 2.0% if the net 
profit exceeds the prior year by 50% or more.
JH Haynes was entitled to a bonus of 1% of the Group’s overall net profit.
For the purposes of the above the ‘net profit’ of the Group is before tax and excluding profits 
of a capital nature and before deductions of bonuses payable to other executive directors. The 
net profit of the UK and European businesses is calculated on the same basis, and before the 
deduction of Group costs. The net profit of the Vivid Group is calculated as the consolidated 
profit before tax of Vivid Holding BV before the deduction of Haynes Group costs.
(iv) Share option scheme
The Company has approval to operate an executive share option scheme. No such options are 
in existence at the present time.
(v) Pension policy
Each of the executive directors has been and continues to be contractually entitled to final 
salary or money purchase related pension benefits as described below.
(a) Defined benefit schemes
  The UK Scheme
  JHC Haynes and J Yates-Round are members of the UK scheme.
  The target pension for the directors is currently two-thirds of final pensionable salary at 
the age of 60 (from 12 July 2011 the pensionable retirement age has increased to 61). 
Final pensionable salary is defined as an average of the best three consecutive annual 
pensionable salaries in the final 10 years of service. The director contributes 5% of his 
pensionable pay, as defined under the Scheme rules (from 12 July 2011 this has increased 
to 8%). Death in service benefits provide for a return of the individual’s contributions made 
to the scheme, a cash sum equal to 4 times pensionable salary and a widow or dependants 
pension equal to 50% of the target pension receivable at normal retirement age. For death 
occurring during retirement a widow’s pension equal to 50% of pension entitlement is 
payable.
Board r eport on r emuneration
(continued) 29
  Pensions increase annually during retirement by the lower of 5% (from 12 July 2011 this has 
been reduced to 2.5%) or the percentage rise in the  Retail Price Index.
  With the approval of the Pension Scheme Trustees and the Employer, members may retire 
from the age of 55 on an actuarially reduced pension based on the shorter working life and 
after taking into account the cost of earlier payments.
 The US Plan
  E Oakley, D Benhardus and JH Haynes are members of the US Plan. The US Plan 
provides for a pension that vests in yearly increments reaching a maximum of 50% of 
final pensionable salary on attaining 7 or more years service with the Company. The final 
pensionable salary is calculated in a consistent manner to the UK scheme.
  The retirement age for the non-contributory US Plan is 65.
  Death in service benefits provide for a widow or dependants pension equal to the actuarial 
equivalent of the accrued benefit at the date of death. For death occurring during retirement 
a widow’s pension equal to 50% of pension entitlement is payable. In both cases election 
may be made to receive a cash lump sum, or by instalments, the amounted vested (actuarial 
accrued benefit).
  Pensions do not increase during retirement.
  There are no provisions for early retirement under the US Plan rules but the vested actuarial 
accrued benefit may be taken in instalments, as a lump sum or left in the Plan until age 70 
when, by law, they must be taken.
(b) Defined contribution (‘Money Purchase’) arrangements
  A Kwarts is a member of the Vivid Holding BV pension scheme which is governed by the 
employment laws in the Netherlands. Under the regulated scheme the employee contributes 
5.0% of gross salary (including holiday pay) and the employer contributes 2.2%.
  In the US, members whose benefits are capped by legislation participate in additional money 
purchase arrangements. A scheme has been set up based on the difference between the 
Company’s actual contributions to the defined benefit scheme and those contributions 
which would have been paid without the legislative cap. The pensionable cap in the US is 
$245,000 (£154,574). Under this arrangement the Company made contributions on behalf 
of E Oakley amounting to $267,014 (£168,463) and D Benhardus $55,896 (£35,266) during 
the year.
  Additionally, in the US there is an employer savings plan (401K pension plan) available to all 
employees. Under the plan the Company contributes 1.6% of salary as well as matching 
one third of employees’ deferrals up to a maximum of 6% of salary. During the year, the 
contributions for E Oakley amounted to $8,820 (£5,565) and for D Benhardus $8,153  
(£5,144). In the UK, there is an additional AVC facility for members of the UK Scheme. 30

6 Service contracts
The Committee is mindful of the unique characteristics of the Company; its vertical integration 
as both publisher and printer, its product range, its geographical spread, and its shareholder 
base. The Company’s competitive position must be of paramount concern. The service contracts 
for executive directors in the UK and Europe include a notice period of 12 months or less upon 
termination. 
Directors who are US based are employed ‘at will’ and there is no notice provision. However to 
ensure reasonable parity with the UK based directors a “notional” notice period applies to the 
calculation of their entitlements upon termination. If the Company terminates without notice or at 
short notice, the individual is entitled to the contractual entitlements and benefits which would have 
accrued within the notice period. With the Company’s consent these may be “rolled up” into a 
single payment at the point of termination.
In the event of termination for cause, the bonus element of remuneration is either not payable or 
payable only at the discretion of the Company.
Director Date of contract notice period
JHC Haynes 15 February 2002 12 months
E Oakley 30 May 2002 None (24 months notional)
D Benhardus 31 May 2002 None (12 months notional)
J Yates-Round 2 September 2010 12 months
A Kwarts 12 October 2010 3 months
JH Haynes (UK) 29 November 1979 12 months
JH Haynes (US) 29 November 1979 6 months
 
E Oakley’s original service contract was renegotiated upon his appointment as Group Chief 
Executive on 1 June 2002. The Committee is well aware of the advice provided in the Combined 
Code at B.1.6 concerning the length of the notice period, and in agreement with it, thus all but one 
of the directors have notice periods of 12 months or less. In the exceptional case, the Committee 
believes that it is not presently in the interests of the shareholders to negotiate an amendment.
Board report on remuneration
(continued) 31
 The directors’ service contracts are not of a fixed term, but will continue until  
 terminated by either party.
 
 Non-executive directors do not hold service contracts with the Company and are  
 appointed at the will of the board usually for a fixed period of two years. 
 
 Section 4(i)(a) and 4(v)(b) along with the following disclosures (up to and  
 including page 32) on directors’ remuneration have been audited as required by the  
 Companies Act 2006.

 The normal pensionable age for Main Board Directors of the UK Scheme increased to 61 from 12 July 2011.
The accrued benefit shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement age based on 
service to the end of the year.
From 1 October 2008, UK Government legislation requires the Trustees to take responsibility for 
setting the assumptions which underlies the calculation of voluntary transfers to be paid from the 
Plan, having first taken advice from the scheme actuary. Prior to this date the responsibility for 
setting the assumptions lay with the scheme actuary. Accordingly, the transfer values of the UK 
accrued pensions at the year-end have been calculated in accordance with this requirement.
Details of the Committee’s policy on pensions and the pension arrangements themselves are 
provided earlier in this Report.

Board r eport on r emuneration
(continued) 33
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that show and explain 
the Company’s transactions, disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company, and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The directors are required by the Companies Act 2006 to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the 
Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for the financial 
year.  The directors are required to prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance 
with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have chosen to prepare financial statements for the 
Company in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. Under company 
law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit  
or loss for the Group for that period.
In preparing the Group and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:
•	 select 	suitable	accounting	policies	 and	then	 apply	them	consistently; 
•	 make 	 judgements	and	 estimates	that	ar e 	 r easonable 	and	 prudent; 
•	 for 	the	 Gr oup 	 financial 	 statements,	state	whether 	they	 have	been	 pr epar ed 	in	accor dance 		
 with IFRS as adopted by the EU, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; 
•	 for	the	 Company 	 financial	statements,	 state	whether	applicable	UK	Accounting	Standar ds		
 have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and 
•	 pr epar e 	the	financial 	statements	on 	the	going 	concer n 	basis	 unless	it	 is	inappr opriate 	 to		
 presume that the Group and Company will continue in business.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
 
The directors are responsible for preparing a directors’ report and a directors’ remuneration report 
which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Website publication
The directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and financial statements are made 
available on a website.  Financial statements are published on the Group’s UK website in 
accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Group’s UK website is the responsibility of the directors. The directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
Directors’ responsibility statement pursuant to DTr 4
The directors confirm to the best of their knowledge:
•	 The	Gr oup	financial 	statements	have	 been	pr epar ed	in	accor dance	with	Inter national	 	
 Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs) and Article 4 of  
 the IAS Regulation and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position  
 and profit and loss of the Group.
 
•	 The 	annual	 r eport 	 includes	a	fair 	r eview 	 of	the	 development	and 	performance 	 of	the	 	
 business and the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company, together with a  
 description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

 1 Principal accounting policies
  Haynes Publishing Group P .L.C. (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.  
  The address of the registered office is given on page 13. The Consolidated Financial Statements of
 the Company for the year ended 31 May 2011 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries  
 (together referred to as the “Group”). The accounting policies contained below and the disclosures  
 in notes 2 to 25 all relate to the Group’s financial statements. The Company has  elected to prepare  
 its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP . The Parent  Company  
 Balance Sheet can be found on page 76 and the applicable accounting policies of  the Parent  
 Company are contained in notes 26 to 38. 
 
  Basis of preparation
  The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance  
  with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS’s) as adopted by the European Union and  
  the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.  
  
  The Group financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the  
  treatment of certain financial instruments and are presented in sterling, with all values rounded  
  to the nearest thousand pounds (£000) except as indicated otherwise.
  (a) n ew standards, amendments to standards or interpretations effective in 2010/11
  During the Group’s financial year beginning 1 June 2010 the following new standards, amendments  
  to standards or interpretations became effective for the first time.  
 
  IFRS 3 (revised): ‘Business Combinations’, requires that costs incurred during a business  
  combination which previously could be capitalised must now be expensed as incurred. 
 
  IAS 27 (revised): ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’, states that if an intangible

 Basis of consolidation
 The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and 
 entities controlled by the Company made up to the reporting date. Control is achieved where 
 the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity 
 so as to obtain benefits from its activities.  
 
 On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at 
 their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the fair value of consideration over the 
 fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of 
 the fair value of consideration below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
 (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the Consolidated Income Statement at the date of  
 acquisition. 
 
 The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the  
 Consolidated Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date  
 of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements  
 of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. 
 Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that  
 is not held by the Group and is presented within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet,  
 separately from the Company shareholders equity.
 All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

  Intangible assets and goodwill
  All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill arising  
  on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of consideration over the Group’s  
  interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly  
  controlled entity at the date of acquisition and is included in the balance sheet under the  
  heading of intangible assets.
 
 For acquisitions made prior to 1 June 2004, goodwill is recorded on the basis of its deemed  
 cost which represented its carrying value at 1 June 2004 under UK GAAP .
 
 The goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and reviewed for impairment at least annually.  
 On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of  
 goodwill is included in the determination of the profit and loss on disposal.  
 
 Where applicable adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies of an acquired  
 business into alignment with those of the Group. Any costs associated with reorganising or
 restructuring the business are charged directly to the Consolidated Income Statement. If at 
 the balance sheet date the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and   
 contingent liabilities can only be established provisionally these values are used. Any   
 adjustments to these values made within 12 months of the acquisition date are taken as  
 adjustments to goodwill.
 
 Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. An intangible  
 resource acquired in a business combination is only recognised as an intangible asset if it is 
 separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected  
 to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be measured reliably. An intangible  
 asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight line basis so as to charge its cost which, 
 in respect of an acquired intangible asset, represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the 
 Consolidated Income Statement over its expected useful life. An intangible asset with an 
 indefinite or indeterminate life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and 
 carried at costs less any recognised impairment losses.
 
 Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised  
 separately as an intangible asset. Amortisation is provided on a straight line basis so as to  
 charge the cost of the software to the Consolidated Income Statement over its expected useful life  
 within  the business. 
 
 The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows: 
 
 Trademarks, domain names, copyright, know-how   Indeterminate life
 Goodwill     Indefinite life
 Development costs    5 years

  r esearch and development costs
  All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. 
  
 Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is 
 incurred unless it relates to either the development of a new product or an enhancement to an  
 existing product where the commercial viability of the product can be proven, the costs can be  
 separately identified and measured reliably, the development is expected to bring future economic
 benefit to the Group and the Group has sufficient resources and intends to complete  the  
 development and to use or sell the asset. Any such capitalised development expenditure is
 amortised on a straight line basis so that it is expensed to the income statement over the expected  
 life of the product.
  
  r evenue recognition
  Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods or  
  services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes.   
   The following specific recognition criteria also apply:    
 Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are dispatched and the  significant  
 risks and rewards of ownership are passed to the customer and can be reliably measured.
 
 Revenue from the sale of services is recognised when the service has been supplied and the risks  
 and rewards associated with the supply have been passed to the customer. 
    
 Revenue from the sale of licenses under a fixed term and price contract is recognised on a 
 straight line basis over the period of the contract. Revenue from the sale of an individual 
 non-refundable license is recognised once the license has been delivered and the substantial 
 obligations of the vendor have been fulfilled.
   
  Foreign currencies
 Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the 
 transaction. Exchange differences arising from the movement in rates between the date of  
 transaction and the date of settlement are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement as  
 they arise. 
   
 Assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated to sterling at the  
 rate ruling on the balance sheet date. The results of that subsidiary are translated at an average  
 rate of exchange for the year.    
 
 Exchange gains or losses arising on the translation of the opening net assets of an overseas 
 subsidiary, together with exchange differences arising on the use of the average rate of exchange,  
 are taken to reserves.

  Impairment of non-current assets
  All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that  
  their carrying value might be impaired. In addition, intangible assets and goodwill with an indefinite  
  or indeterminable life are subject to at least an annual impairment test.
 
 An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an asset’s carrying value exceeds its  
 recoverable amount, which will represent the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and  
 its value in use. An asset’s value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows  
 expected to be derived from the asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable  
 amount of an individual asset, an impairment review is undertaken in relation to the cash  
 generating unit to which the asset belongs. The recoverable amount of  goodwill is determined by  
 reference to the discounted future cash flows of the cash generating unit to which it is allocated.
 Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed  
 if there has been a change in estimates used to assess the asset’s recoverable amount. The  
 carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the amount that would have been  
 determined had no loss been recognised in prior periods. Impairment losses recognised in relation  
 to goodwill are not reversed.    
 Impairment losses when recognised are passed through the Consolidated Income Statement.
  Property, plant and equipment
   Property, plant and equipment assets are held in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost (cost  
  comprising the acquisition cost of the assets along with any other attributable costs at the date  
  of acquisition).
 Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less any estimated  
 current residual values, by equal instalments over their estimated useful lives.  Residual values are
 based on commercial and industry experience and where appropriate using  the services of  
 professional surveyors.     
 
 While the estimated useful life on an asset is determined on acquisition, using best estimates, 
 both residual values and estimated useful lives are monitored on an annual basis. Where the  
 estimated current residual value is in excess of the net book value of the asset concerned, no  
 depreciation is charged during the period.    
 
 The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
 Freehold land                         Nil
 Freehold buildings   40 years
 Leasehold property   The period of the lease
 Plant and equipment   3 years to 20 years
 
 The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference 
 between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
 Consolidated Income Statement. 46

  Inventories 
 Stock and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost  
 comprises direct materials, other direct costs and labour together with an appropriate   
 proportion of overheads. 
 
 The cost of editorially originating a new title (i.e. the costs of writing, photographing and  
 editing  a title) are expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement to match against the  
 corresponding  revenue from such titles over a period not exceeding 5 years. Provision is made  
 against slow  moving and obsolete stock to ensure the value at which stock  is held in the balance  
 sheet is  reflective of anticipated future sales patterns. The period before a  provision is made varies  
 between product categories but for general publishing related titles does  not exceed 2 years  
 and for technical motoring titles does not exceed 5 years.
 
  Leases 
  Where a Group Company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks  
  and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a “finance lease”. The asset  
  is recorded in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over  
  its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Future instalments under  
  such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors. Rentals payable are apportioned  
  between the finance element, which is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement  
  and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments.
 All other leases are accounted for as “operating leases” and the rental costs are charged  
 to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease. 
 
  Taxation  
 The tax expense represents the aggregate of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax  
 currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit  
 as reported in the income statement as it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable  
 or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.  
 The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted  
 or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
 Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying  
 amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used  
 in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.  
 Deferred tax assets are generally recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will  
 be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount  
 of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that  
 it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset  
 to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period  
 when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the  
 Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly  
 to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
  
  Pension and other post retirement benefits  
 Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they  
 fall due. For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using  
 the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet  
 date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are  
 recognised outside the Consolidated Income Statement and presented in the Consolidated  
 Statement of Comprehensive Income. Past service costs are recognised immediately to the extent  
 that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise are amortised on a straight-line basis over  
 the average period until the benefits become vested. 47
 1 Principal accounting policies (continued)
  
  Pension and other post retirement benefits (continued) 
  The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value  
  of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced  
  by the fair value of scheme assets.
 Dividends payable
 The liability for final dividends is recorded when the dividends are approved by the Company’s  
 shareholders. For interim dividends, the liability is recorded when the dividends are paid.
 Financial instruments
 Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when  
 the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets which  
 include trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents are treated as loans and receivables  
 and carried at amortised cost.
 
  Trade and other receivables
  Trade receivables are recorded at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated  
  irrecoverable amounts. 
 
 A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence  
 that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms  
 of receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet  
 and the cost of irrecoverable trade receivables is recognised in the Consolidated Income  
 Statement immediately.
 Customer allowances, which are earned by customers on reaching targeted levels of sales  
 are netted against trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 Where an advance is paid to an author, ahead of a title’s publication, the advance is held as an  
 asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and is classified within other debtors. Once the title has 
 been published, royalties earned against the title will be offset against the author’s advance until the  
 advance asset has been cleared. Where it is deemed unlikely that future sales activity will clear the 
 outstanding royalty advance, a provision is made to write-down the asset to its expected 
 recoverable amount.
  Bank borrowings
  Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at fair value and carried at amortised cost.
  Trade payables
  Trade payables are not interest bearing and are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount.
 
 Provisions
 A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when a Group entity has a legal or  
 constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an  
 outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, a provision will  
 be made by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate which reflects current market  
 assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
 
 c ash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other  
 short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank  
 overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the Consolidated  
 Balance Sheet. For the purposes of the Group Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents  
 are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

   c ritical accounting estimates and judgements
  The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires the Group to make certain  
  estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the application of the policies and the amounts  
  reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates and judgements are evaluated based  
  on historical experiences and expected outcomes and are believed to be reasonable at the time  
  such estimates and judgements are made, although actual experience may vary from these  
  estimates.
  The estimates and assumptions which have the most significant bearing on the carrying value  
  of assets or liabilities are explained below:
 
  i)  Impairment of intangible assets 
 In line with IAS 36 the Group is required to test the carrying value of goodwill and intangible  
 assets with indefinite or indeterminate lives, at least annually, for impairment. As part of this  
 review process, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined using value in use  
 calculations, which requires estimates of future cash flows and as such is subject to estimates  
 and assumptions. Further details are contained in note 12 to the Consolidated Financial  
 Statements.
 
 ii) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
 
 Depreciation is provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements so as to write-down  
 the respective assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives and as such,  
 the selection of the estimated useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets requires  
 the use of estimates and judgements. Details of the estimated useful lives are as shown in the  
 policy note for depreciation.
 iii) Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
 Where there is an indication that the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment  
 may have been impaired through events or changes in circumstances during the year, a review  
 will be undertaken of the recoverable amount of that asset based on value in use calculations  
 which will involve estimates and assumptions to be made by management (refer to note 11  
 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
  
  iv) Pensions and other post retirement benefits 
   In determining the pension cost and the defined benefit obligation of the Group’s defined benefit  
  pension schemes a number of assumptions are used. These assumptions include  
  an appropriate discount rate, the levels of salary escalation and price inflation, the expected  
  return on the schemes’ investments and mortality rates. Further details are contained in note  
  19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  v)  Inventory provisions
 
 The Group reviews its finished goods inventory on a regular basis and, where appropriate, makes  
 provision for slow moving and obsolete stock based on estimates of future sales activity. The  
 estimates of future sales activity will be based on both historical experience and expected  
 outcomes based on knowledge of the markets in which the Group operates (refer to note 13  
 of the Consolidated Financial Statements).
   vi) Origination amortisation
 
 The cost of editorially originating a new title is expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement  
 to match against the corresponding revenue from such titles, over a period not exceeding  
 5 years. The assessment of future sales activity is based upon estimates from management  
 using both historical experience and expected outcomes based on knowledge of the markets  
 in which the Group operates. 49
 1  Principal accounting policies (continued) 
  c ritical accounting estimates and judgements (continued) 
 
 vii) Development costs
  The capitalisation and subsequent amortisation of development costs requires management  
  to make certain judgements regarding the future commercial viability of the development activity  
  and the businesses ability to devote the appropriate level of resources to complete  
  the development project and sell or use the asset.

 3   Segment information
 
 
 For management and internal reporting purposes, the Group is organised into two geographical  
 operating segments as follows:
 – UK and Europe
 – North America and Australia
 The UK and European business with headquarters in Sparkford, Somerset has subsidiaries  
 in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Romania and Sweden. Its core business is the publication  
 and supply of automotive repair and technical information to the professional automotive  
 and DIY aftermarkets.
 The North American and Australian business with headquarters near Los Angeles, California  
 publishes DIY repair manuals for cars and motorcycles under the Haynes and Chilton brands,  
 in both the English and Spanish languages. It also has a branch operation in Sydney, Australia  
 which publishes similar products under both the Haynes and Gregory’s brands.
 
 The above two operating segments are each organised and managed separately and are treated  
 as distinct operating and reportable segments in line with the provisions of IFRS 8. The  
 identification of the two operating segments is based on the reports reviewed by the chief  
 operating decision maker, which form the basis for operational decision making. 50

 In the segmental reporting freehold buildings are depreciated over 40 years - under IAS 16  
  the residual value of buildings reflect the expected value at the end of their useful life resulting  
  in an adjustment to depreciation.

 In the segmental reporting pension contributions are expensed and the assets and liabilities  
  of a defined benefit pension scheme are held separately from the Group - under IAS 19 the  
  Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income are  
  adjusted to reflect the annual current service cost and actuarial gains and losses arising on a defined 
  benefit pension scheme and the net surplus/(deficit) on the scheme is included in the Consolidated  
  Balance Sheet.
  
[5]
 In the segmental reporting goodwill is amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years - under IFRS 3 
  goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment but not amortised.

 The charge to taxation relates to the consolidated Group. Included within the taxation charge is  
  £390,000 (2010: £156,000) which relates to the UK & European operations and £1,765,000  
  (2010: £1,637,000) which relates to the North American & Australian operations. 51

  In April 2011 the rate of UK corporation tax changed from 28% to 26% giving an effective rate  
  of 27.7% for the financial year ended 31 May 2011. Included in the deferred tax charge above  
  is an amount of £36,000 arising from the change in the UK tax rate.
  
  Further reductions in the UK corporation tax rate have been announced which will reduce the rate  
  to 23% by 2014/15. However, these changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance  
  sheet date and therefore, have not been adopted in the calculation of the UK’s deferred tax assets  
  and liabilities.

 8 Taxation (continued)
 (b) r econciliation of effective tax rate
  
 The tax assessed for the period differs from the UK standard rate of corporation tax for the period  
 of 27.7% (2010: 28%). The differences are explained below:
2011 2010
£000 £000
Profit on ordinary activities before tax 7,177   7,168
Taxation calculated at the standard rate of corporation tax  
in the UK of 27.7% (2010: 28%) 1,988 2,007
affected by:
Variance in overseas tax rates 507   451
Income/expenses not chargeable/deductible for tax (46)   27
Adjustments relating to prior years (21)   1
Total tax charge for the year reported in the  
c onsolidated Income Statement 2,428 2,486
Effective tax rate 34% 35%
 The effective tax rate is higher than the standard rate of UK tax due to the impact of the mix  
 of profits from overseas operations where the tax rates are higher than in the UK. 
   
 There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with the 
 Company’s investments in its subsidiaries. However, in line with paragraph 40 of IAS 12, no liability  
 has been recognised in respect of these differences as the Company controls the dividend policies  
 of its subsidiaries and as such is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these 
 differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 The cumulative unremitted reserves of overseas subsidiaries as at 31 May 2011 was £25.9 million  
 (2010: £24.2 million). 
 9 Earnings per share
 The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based  on the following data:
 
2011 2010
£000 £000
Earnings:
Profit after tax - continuing operations* 4,742  4,677 
n umber of shares: 
Weighted average number of shares (note 20) 16,351,540 16,351,540
 * Figure has been adjusted to exclude a profit of £7,000 (2010: £5,000) attributable to  
 non-controlling interests.
 As at 31 May 2011 and 31 May 2010 there were no outstanding options on either of the Company’s 
 two classes of shares and there is no difference between the earnings used in the basic and diluted  
 earnings per share calculation. 57

 The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting,  
 to be held on 19 October 2011 and has not been included as a liability in these  financial statements.

 Impairment tests for cash-generating units (c Gu ’s) containing goodwill 
 
 The Group tests intangible assets and goodwill with indefinite or indeterminate useful lives for 
 impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that their carrying values might 
 be impaired. As at the balance sheet date an impairment test has been undertaken on the CGU’s  
 based on value in use calculations and using the latest available financial information. 
 The impairment reviews have been based on financial budgets which have been prepared by 
 management and approved by the Board. The key assumptions used in the reviews relate to 
 sales growth (which for Haynes North America Inc has been set at 2% and for Vivid Holding BV has 
 been set at 2% and includes the development of a new geographical market), sales pricing and  
 changes in direct costs which have been based on historical performance and predicted  
 future outcomes.

Financial Statements
Haynes Publishing Group P.L.c .  Annual Report & Accounts 2011
 The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows in both CGU’s was 15% (2010: 15%). Based  
 on the impairment reviews undertaken in relation to both the Haynes North American and Vivid  
 Holding BV CGU’s, the future cash flows are expected to exceed the carrying value of the goodwill  
 and intangible assets with indefinite or indeterminate lives and as  such there are no indications of 
 impairment at the balance sheet date (2010: £nil).
 
 The intangible assets in relation to trademarks and domain names and know how are assigned 
 indefinite useful lives and relate to Vivid Holding BV in the Netherlands and Bookworks Pty Ltd  
 in Australia.  Both Vivid and Bookworks have strong reputations in their respective market places.  
 Bookworks is the leading distributor of technical automotive publications in Australia  while Vivid  
 manages a unique multilingual database of repair and maintenance data on current European 
 and Asian cars, light commercial vehicles and trucks. The carrying value of  assets with an indefinite  
 life are tested annually for impairment. 
  
 In assessing the value in use of the CGU’s, management have considered the potential impact  
 of possible changes in the main assumptions used and believe that there are no such changes that  
 would cause the carrying value of the units to exceed their recoverable amount.
 
The carrying amounts of goodwill have been allocated as follows:

 was a net charge of £190,000 (2010: £345,000) to the Consolidated Income Statement in relation  
 to the inventory provisions. The movement in the inventory provisions are included within cost of  
 sales in the Consolidated Income Statement.
 Included within finished goods stock is £6.5 million (2010: £6.6 million) of editorial origination costs  
 in relation to the production of the core automotive and motorcycle repair manuals and general 
 interest titles which are amortised to  the Consolidated Income Statement over a period not

 The Group’s principal financial instruments during the year comprised bank overdrafts, lease  
 financing arrangements, cash and short-term deposits as well as other various items arising from  
 its operations such as trade receivables and trade payables. The main purpose of these  
 instruments is to finance the Group’s working capital requirements as well as funding its capital  
 expenditure programmes. From time to time the Group may enter into derivative transactions such  
 as interest rate swaps or forward exchange contracts, the main purpose of such transactions  
 is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and sources  
 of finance. There were no such transactions entered into during the current or preceding financial  
 years. 
 Foreign currency risk
  The Group has investments in subsidiary operations outside of the UK and also buys and sells  
  goods and services in currencies other than in the functional currencies of its subsidiary operations.  
  In light of the above, the Group’s non sterling revenues, profits, assets, liabilities and cash flows  
  can be affected by movements in exchange rates. The Group is able to take advantage of certain  
  natural hedge flows within the business operations which helps to minimise the impact of the  
  fluctuations in exchange but where appropriate will use forward rates to minimise the risk. There  
  were no forward exchange contracts entered into during the current or preceding financial years.  
  It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative trading in financial instruments.
 
 Sensitivity analysis 
  The most significant foreign currency risk to the Group is in relation to the US dollar. Management  
  estimate that if all other variables remained constant the impact on pre-tax profits of a 5 percent  
  increase in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have been to reduce profits  
  by £0.2 million with a decrease of 5% having an equal and opposite effect. This estimate has been  
  based on an assessment of translating the US dollar profits into sterling using the average rate  
  for the year of $1.59.
  c redit risk
  The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables, which are spread over  
  a range of countries and customers, a factor which helps to dilute the concentration of risk. The  
  risk associated with such trading is mitigated through credit control management procedures  
  including the use of credit worthiness checks, the application of credit limits and the sale of goods  
  subject to retention of title clauses. A provision is made against such balances where there  
  is an identifiable loss or event, which based on prior experience provides management with  
  a significant doubt over the recovery of the balance. Due to the long established relationships with  
  the majority of the Group’s customers there is not deemed to be a credit quality issue in relation  
  to the trade receivables balance. The amount of the total exposure is shown in note 14.   
     
 In addition to the above, the UK business has an exposure in relation to contractual advanced 
 royalty payments to authors. However, due to the large number of authors there is no significant 
 concentration of risk. The asset balance in relation to the author advances is held within other 
 debtors and prepayments (refer to note 14) and amounted to £0.2 million net of allowances for 
 doubtful recovery (2010: £0.2 million).       
 
 The credit risk on liquid funds is limited as the funds are held at banks with high credit ratings  
 assigned by international credit rating agencies.

  Liquidity risk      
 The principal aim of the Group’s liquidity management is to maintain a balance between
 continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans and asset
 leasing. As at 31 May 2011 the Group had a £1.0 million UK overdraft facility (2010: £1.0 million)  
 which is due for renewal in October 2011, a €0.4 million overdraft in Europe (2010: €0.4 million)  
 which has no fixed renewal date and a $11.0 million loan facility in the US (2010: $11.0 million)   
 which is due for renewal in October 2011.
 Interest rate risk
  From time to time the Group companies have overdraft and loan facilities which are subject to  
  variable rates of interest based on the respective bank’s base rate. As at 31 May 2011 there were  
  no bank loans outstanding (2010: £nil) and no bank overdrafts outstanding (2010: £nil). 
  Money market deposits are placed for periods varying between call and one month and attract
 variable rates of interest based upon the banks cost of funds for the relevant currencies.
 Sensitivity analysis 
  As the Group had no loans or overdrafts outstanding at the end of the year the Group does not  
  have a significant exposure to a change in the market rates of interest at the current time.  
  Fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
  There are no material differences between the carrying values and the fair values of the financial  
  assets and liabilities as recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Details of the amounts of  
  financial assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies can be found in notes 14, 15 and 16 to the  
  Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  c apital management 
  The primary aim of the Group’s capital management is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue  
  as a going concern, to support its businesses and maximise shareholder value. The Group  
  monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments as and when it is deemed necessary and  
  appropriate to do so using such methods as adjusting the dividend payment to shareholders or the  
  issuing of new shares.

 19 r etirement benefit obligation
 The Group operates a number of different retirement programmes in the countries within which  
 it operates. The principal pension programmes are a contributory defined benefit scheme in the 
 UK (the UK Scheme) and a non-contributory defined benefit plan in the US (the US Plan).  
    
 The assets of all schemes are held independently of the Group and its subsidiaries. The total
 pension costs for the Group as shown in the balance sheet at the year end and as charged 
 through the income statement in the year are analysed below:

 The overall expected return on assets assumption is derived as the weighted average of the  
 expected returns from each of the main asset classes. The individual return assumptions for   
 each class of asset are based on market conditions as at 31 May 2011 and represent a best 
 estimate of future returns for that class allowing for risk premiums where appropriate. 70

 The cumulative actuarial loss recognised in other comprehensive income since 31 May 2003 is 
 £4.2 million (2010: £7.5 million). The directors’ are unable to determine how much of the pension 
 plan deficits are attributable to actuarial gains and losses on an IFRS basis prior to 31 May 2003.
 In 2010, the Government announced proposals to link the indexation of pensions within private  
 pension schemes to the Consumer Prices Index (“CPI”) rather than the Retail Prices Index (“RPI”).  
 This proposal impacts pensions which increase each year in line with Statutory Revaluation Orders  
 (“SRO’s”) as the SRO’s are now calculated using the CPI. The impact of the above change on the  
 UK Scheme has been to reduce the Scheme liabilities by £0.7 million. The reduction has been  
 recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

 21   r elated party transactions (continued)
 During the year the directors had declarable interests in contracts with the Company and its 
 subsidiary undertakings as shown below. 
 (1) A lease dated 28 August 1979 between John H Haynes Developments Inc, (a company  
 registered in California and controlled by JH Haynes) and Haynes North America Inc. of the   
 premises situated at 859 and 861 Lawrence Drive, Newbury Park, California which was 
 amended on 1 May 2001, runs for a period of 5 years from that date, and is presently held over  
 pending renewal. The annual rent for the year ended 31 May 2011 was $207,214 (2010: $207,214)  
 or £130,734 (2010: £130,809) at the average exchange rate for the year. MEF Haynes is a Vice  
 President of John H Haynes Developments Inc.
 
 (2) A lease dated 20 December 1993 between the Haynes Family Trust (of which JH Haynes is 
 a trustee, and JHC Haynes and MEF Haynes are beneficiaries) and the Company of premises
 known as the “Sparkford Creamery” in Somerset for a term of 21 years at an annual rent, subject  
 to revision every 3 years and presently £64,544 (2010: £64,544).

At 31 May 2011 77
 26 Principal accounting policies
 
 Basis of accounting 
 The financial statements of the parent company, Haynes  Publishing Group P .L.C. have been 
 prepared under the historical cost convention except for the treatment of certain financial  
 instruments and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law. 
   
 The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 and has not 
 disclosed transactions with subsidiaries wholly owned by the Group.   
 Foreign currencies 
 Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the   
 transaction. Exchange differences arising from the movement in rates between the date of  
 transaction and the date of settlement are taken to the profit and loss account as they arise. 
 
 At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign  
 currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.  
   
 Depreciation 
 Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets less any estimated residual 
 values, by equal instalments over their estimated useful lives as follows: 
Freehold land Nil
Freehold buildings 40 years
Leasehold property The period of the lease
Plant and equipment 3 years to 10 years
 Taxation  
 Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
 reversed at the balance sheet date and that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to 
 pay less tax, with the exception that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
 the directors consider that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits from which 
 the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.  
  
 Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted tax basis at the tax rates that are expected to 
 apply in the periods in which the timing differences will reverse.   
 
 Leases  
 Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over 
 the life of the lease.   
  
 r etirement benefits 
 The Company participates in a multi-employer defined benefit pension scheme based on final
 pensionable pay where the assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the  
 Company. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of
 the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, in accordance with FRS 17
 ‘Retirement Benefits’, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. As a
 result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable
 to the scheme in respect of the accounting period. Details of the UK scheme are shown in  
 Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Ordinary shares will not be permitted by the directors other than to a member of the holder’s 
 immediate family or to family settlements. The holders of ‘A’ Ordinary shares may convert such shares  
 into Ordinary shares at the rate of one Ordinary share for each ‘A’ Ordinary, subject to the further 
 provisions of the Articles of Association and the Companies Acts.

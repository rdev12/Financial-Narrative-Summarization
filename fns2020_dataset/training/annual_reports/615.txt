LETTER
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
Last year, in my first report as Chairman, I introduced Alent 
plc as an independent company following our demerger 
from Cookson Group plc. I set out how Alent plc would 
further develop and execute our strategy to strengthen  
our position as a preferred supplier of highly engineered 
and customised specialty chemicals and materials across 
the electronics, industrial and automotive markets.
One year on, I can report that Alent’s performance in 2013 
has reinforced our confidence in our strategic direction.  
We set out in this report how we continue to develop and 
deliver on our strategy. Our focus on high unit growth 
end-markets, our differentiated value-add customer 
strategy, our strong market and technology positions  
allied to our innovation leadership and our financial 
strength, will both support organic growth and acquisitions,  
and will deliver long-term growth and sustainable margin 
improvement to our shareholders.
Results
In a challenging external environment, Alent delivered  
a solid set of results in 2013. Whilst adjusted operating profit 
declined 3.2% to £94.1m (2012: £97 .2m) and adjusted EPS 
declined 2.0% to 24.1p (2012: 24.6p) we believe we have 
outperformed in the majority of our end-markets both by 
holding or improving our market share positions and taking 
actions to improve our performance. Pricing discipline  
was maintained, cost control and restructuring for the 
future increased, and margins were largely maintained  
or improved. Cash generation from operations was 
exceptionally strong during the year, resulting in a  
much-strengthened balance sheet and a year-end  
net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.0x (2012: 1.3x).
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend for 2013  
of 5.71 pence with a total dividend per share for 2013 of 
8.60 pence. This is an increase of 4.2% on the prior year 
and in line with the Group’s progressive dividend policy  
of full year dividend growth expected to be at least in  
line with earnings growth, and targeting a dividend  
cover in the near term within a range of 3.0 to 2.8 times.  
The Directors’ intention is to maintain a capital structure 
that is both efficient and balanced between investment  
for growth and returns to shareholders.
PETER HILL, CBE 
CHAIRMAN
Health, Safety, Environment & Sustainability (HSES) 
The Group is committed to the continuous improvement  
in respect of health, safety, environment and sustainability, 
and our performance in this important area of our business 
continues to be of a high industry standard. Nevertheless, 
we remain extremely vigilant in monitoring and continuously 
improving our processes and activities that impact upon the 
safety of our people and the environment.
Governance and Board
Strong governance is integral to the long-term success  
of Alent and the Board is committed to ensuring that the 
business continues to be governed and managed with 
openness, honesty and transparency. Our Governance 
Report on pages 48 to 66 sets out the approach we take 
and highlights the key focus areas of the Board in 2013. 
During this, our first year, the Directors, both collectively and 
individually, visited and inspected a substantial proportion 
of Alent’s global operations, R&D centres and facilities, 
meeting management and staff. We have been uniformly 
impressed. We have also introduced and are progressing 
new governance and risk management processes.  
These actions will continue during 2014. 
Our people
It has been a year of tangible progress for the Group – 
strategically, operationally and financially. This could not 
have been achieved without the dedication, focus and 
commitment of all our people and, on behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank them for their considerable efforts and  
I look forward to another year of continued progress in 
delivering on our plans.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S  
STATEMENT
Overview
2013 was Alent’s first full year as an independent company. 
During the year, we have made considerable progress in 
developing our strategy and prioritising the goals and 
aspirations that will drive the future performance of our 
business. Throughout this report I will provide an overview  
of our performance in year one.
Our first year was not without its challenges. Our principal 
electronics end-market contracted during the course of 
2013. Consumer confidence remained subdued during the 
year, negatively impacting demand for electronic products. 
Industry forecasts for global electronic equipment revenue 
growth were modified downward throughout the year, with 
industry analysts now estimating a decline of 2.9% for full 
year 2013, down from the 4.5% growth forecast at the 
beginning of 2013. 
Personal computer unit volume was a key underperforming 
end-market. Other high unit volume electronic applications 
such as flat screen TVs experienced little, or negative unit 
growth during 2013. Whilst China continued to grow, there 
was weaker demand for new products and technologies 
which had a significant impact on electronics end-markets. 
Eurozone markets were weak although slightly improving in 
the second half of 2013. Automotive and industrial markets 
have been mixed, with Western European automotive 
contracting 2% during the year, whilst NAFTA and Asia 
Pacific have grown 4% and 6% respectively.
Against this challenging end-market backdrop, Alent 
delivered a solid financial performance during the year. 
Group NSV increased 0.8% (down 1.4% at constant currency 
rates) to £420.1m (2012: £416.7m), demonstrating our ability 
to outperform the majority of our end-markets. NSV in our 
Assembly Materials business increased 0.7% (down 0.9%  
at constant currency rates) with growth impacted by 
underlying weak end-markets, limited new product 
launches from a number of global OEMs and subdued 
consumer confidence. NSV in our Surface Chemistries 
business increased 0.9% (down 2.0% at constant currency 
rates) with solid growth in both our Performance Coatings 
and Printed Circuit Board segments through share capture 
offset by lower sales of copper damascene.

STRATEGIC
REPORT
CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION
In line with our strategy, we continued to focus on higher-
margin, enhanced technology products, and harvesting 
more mature products. The strong relationships we have 
with our customers give us a valuable insight into their 
needs and keeps us at the centre of their organisations.  
We have continued to resource and expand our OEM 
marketing and selling initiative and have largely held or 
improved our market share position in most product lines. 
Key to our strategy is our continued investment in the 
business for the long-term and as such, we maintained  
our R&D spend at 4% of NSV. 
Across all of our product segments, the pricing 
environment remained stable, despite weaker end-
markets. Cost control remains tight and disciplined.  
We have continued to restructure our business to further 
optimise our manufacturing footprint and reduce the 
operating cost base.
Group adjusted operating profit decreased 3.2% (down 
5.4% at constant currency rates) to £94.1m (2012: £97 .2m) 
and Group NSV margin decreased 0.9pts to 22.4% (2012: 
23.3%). Excluding the mix effect of the lower copper 
damascene sales, NSV margin was broadly maintained.
Operating cash generation during the year has been  
very strong, leading to reduced net debt and a 
strengthening of our balance sheet. Adjusted cash 
generated from operations was £102.8m (2012: £86.0m) 
and represented a cash conversion of 99.7% of EBITDA,  
an improvement of 22.8pts from our 2012 cash conversion 
of 76.9%. The improvement was largely driven by lower 
working capital due to a combination of lower raw material  
costs and improved working capital management.
We have continued to invest in the business with both  
R&D and capital expenditure. Our manufacturing footprint 
continues to be strengthened with our new Surface 
Chemistries facility in Shanghai now being commissioned 
and construction of the new facility in Chennai, India to  
be commissioned during 2014.
Our strategy
The key elements of our strategy are to:
• focus on high unit growth end-markets;
• leverage our differentiated value-add customer strategy;
• continue to develop higher-margin products; 
• improve mix and operational efficiencies;
• further invest in R&D to expand our market, technology 
and innovation leadership; and
• leverage our financial strength to support organic  
growth and acquisitions.
Throughout this report, we set out the progress we have 
made against our strategic objectives. Whilst the strategy 
has evolved as we progressed through the year, the key 
elements of the strategy as set out on page 12 of this report 
remain unchanged. 
Key strengths
Our key strengths as set out on pages 14 to 23 will enable 
us to deliver on our strategy. Our key strengths are our:
• position as a global market leader;
• competitive advantage through our OEM-focused 
strategy supported by our R&D capabilities and global 
manufacturing footprint;
• financial strength to support organic growth and bolt-on 
M&A; and
• outperformance of our long-term end-markets through 
the cycle.
We believe these strengths will enable us to deliver long-
term growth and sustainable margin improvement.
Our people
Overall, I am pleased with the excellent performance we’ve 
delivered in a challenging operating environment and I’d 
like to thank our people for their support and effort over the 
year. We have some 2,500 talented people in Alent who 
are committed to delivering on our strategy. Our people 
are our greatest asset and are critical to our future success 
and I look forward to another year of continued progress in 
delivering on our plans.
Outlook
We will continue to drive the future performance of our 
business with:
• our focus on high unit growth end-markets;
• our differentiated value-add customer strategy; 
• our ongoing R&D investment to expand our market, 
technology and innovation leadership;
• our focus on cost control and efficiency improvements; 
and
• our financial strength to support organic growth  
and acquisitions.
We anticipate the automotive end-market will continue to 
grow on a global basis but it is more difficult to predict how 
the overall electronics industry will develop. We expect to 
see the transition from traditional PCs to tablets continuing 
and smartphone unit growth beginning to slow. We 
anticipate overall consumer confidence to improve as 
global economies expand, leading to a modest increase 
in demand for consumer electronics. 
Whilst visibility remains limited, we expect to make progress 
over the course of the year, with our normal seasonal 
improvement in the second half, although foreign 
exchange translation will be a headwind at current rates.

 OU R  
STRATEGY
The key elements of our strategy are to:
Focus on high unit growth end-markets
Unit volumes are the underlying driver of NSV growth  
for Alent. Demand for our products is directly linked to 
demand for our customers’ end-products. We specifically 
focus our sales, marketing and product development 
efforts on those high-demand end-products which in  
turn drive high unit count applications and demand  
for our products.
The electronics market is forecast to experience growth  
in terms of value, and unit volumes over the medium to 
long-term. Our leading positions across a very broad  
range of the electronics value chain, including the 
personal computer, smartphone, tablet, automotive 
electronics, microelectronics, semiconductor and general 
electronics end-markets means that we have significant 
exposure to this underlying growth trend. 
Similarly, the global automotive market is expected  
to experience continued unit growth. This is enhanced  
by a growing trend in the automotive industry for  
increased electronic content in cars, and increased  
use of functional coatings for decorative, wear-resistant 
and anti-corrosion applications, which is benefiting  
both of our strategic businesses.
Leverage our differentiated value-add customer strategy
Alent has strong collaborative relationships with many 
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who specify 
which specialty materials, chemistries and technologies 
are used in their products. We leverage these relationships 
to increase OEM qualification of our products. Our long-
standing relationships provide a formidable barrier to  
entry for competition.
Alongside this important differentiator, we continue to  
focus on the value-add sales competencies across all  
our people so as to realise the full margin potential of  
the products and technologies we offer our customers. 
Equally important is the service element we provide 
through our technical process support and customer 
training academies. The knowledge and expertise of our 
technical service organisation is highly valued by OEMs 
and subcontractors, and this further strengthens our 
customer relationships.
Continue to develop higher-margin products 
We continue to migrate away from lower-margin 
commoditised products to focus on higher-margin, 
higher-value, innovative products. The constant evolution 
through product innovation means that we expect further 
gradual mix improvement across our portfolio. 
Improve mix and operational efficiencies
We continue to develop operational excellence 
programmes to increase productivity and reduce costs

OUR END-MARKETS
Alent is a global provider of highly engineered 
specialty chemicals and materials, servicing a 
broad customer base, with our products being 
used in the manufacture of a wide array of 
end-products. Our products are an integral part 
of products most of us use each and every day. 
Overall, our revenue by end-market is 
approximately 70% electronics, with industrial  
and automotive making up the balance. Our key 
sub-segments within these key end-markets are 
illustrated on pages 6 to 7 of this report. 
1. 
A GLOBAL 
MARKET LEADER
Alent is a global market leader 
operating in an industry with 
high barriers to entry, comprising 
two focused specialty chemicals 
and materials business units with #1 
and #2 global market share positions. 
Unit volumes are the underlying driver of revenue 
growth for Alent. Demand for our products is  
directly linked to demand for our customers’  
end-products. We specifically focus our sales, 
marketing and product development efforts on 
those high-demand end-products, which in turn 
drive high unit count applications and demand  
for our products.

Electronics Industry
The principal end-market for Alent is global 
electronics production, which accounts for 
approximately 70% of our revenue. 
We operate within the electronics materials 
segment of the electronics value chain, where  
we supply highly engineered specialty chemicals 
and intermediate materials to our customers.  
We supply electronic component manufacturers 
and OEMs, who, in turn, supply the electronic 
equipment manufacturers and suppliers. 
According to Prismark Partners, the electronics 
materials segment is estimated in 2013 to be a  
$133 billion market and the overall market for 
electronic products is estimated at $1,667 billion. 
Our products end up in electronic systems across  
a very broad range of applications, and are used 
in essentially everything with an on-off switch. 
In the electronics market, there is a strong trend 
towards increased interconnect density and 
portability in consumer electronics. Consumer 
demand is for faster, smaller and lighter products, 
which is leading to increasing miniaturisation and 
complexity and the use of multi-layer circuit boards. 
Alent is at the forefront of this trend and a leading 
player in the development and supply of specialty 
materials that enable the design and manufacture 
of today’s leading-edge electronic devices. 
According to Henderson Ventures, the electronics 
market is expected to grow 5.6% CAGR from 2013 to 
2015. It is the volume of electronic devices which is  
a key growth driver for our business. The electronics 
industry has historically been a “price down” 
industry, with reduced prices for each generation  
of product. This means that forecasts of market 
growth by value tend to understate the market 
growth by volume, and volume is the key driver  
of demand for our products.
Automotive Industry
As in the electronics end-market, volume is a key 
driver of demand for our products in the industrial/
automotive segment. Automotive is a particularly 
OEM-driven segment and our strong reputation 
and relationships with those OEMs position us well. 
According to IHS Global, vehicle volumes are 
expected to grow approximately 4% CAGR from 
2013 to 2017 . On top of this, there is a strong trend 
for increased electronic content in vehicles and 
increasing demand for functional and decorative 
coatings, which benefits both of our divisions. This 
dynamic will enable us to benefit from a twofold 
increase, both in the number of units as well as 
the increased product content. 
The need for improved corrosion-resistant and 
wear-resistant coatings, driven by the need to 
provide longer warranty protection to customers, 
is driving demand for our products. The improved 
quality of automobiles and requirement to reduce 
weight is also driving higher demand for 
increasingly sophisticated decorative finishes, 
which both enhance customer perception of  
the vehicle and enable lower weight materials 
(e.g. plastics) to be used in their production. 
MARKET-LEADING POSITIONS WITH GLOBAL 
MANUFACTURING PRESENCE
Alent has globally-recognised brands and a high 
number of market leading (#1 and 2) positions in 
our chosen end-market segments. 
We continue to strengthen our market leading 
positions. With global presence, close proximity  
to customers and leading technologies, we are 
constantly identifying new opportunities in high 
unit growth complementary end-markets.

LONG-STANDING AND COLLABORATIVE 
CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
We attribute our market leading position to close 
collaborative partnerships with industry-defining 
customers. These long-standing relationships 
extend from the design stage through to extensive 
post-sale technical support. Our products are 
generally process critical, designed with and 
customised for our customers, and hence there  
is an extensive qualification process which 
enhances customer relationships. The cost of our 
products represents a small proportion of material 
cost to the customer but our products provide 
significant value through improved yield, reliability 
and a lower total cost of ownership.
Alent has a strong reputation among OEMs who 
often specify what specialty materials, chemistries 
and technologies are used in their products.  
We will continue to leverage these relationships  
to increase OEM qualification of our products.  
Our long-standing collaborative relationships 
provide a formidable barrier to entry for competition.
TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
We continue to provide industry leading fast-cycle 
R&D activities to our customers to ensure that we 
remain ahead of emerging trends and deliver 
solutions to maintain our leadership position in  
terms of innovation and product development  
in our market niches. Our goal is to quickly solve 
customer problems, either through our network  
of experienced technical service engineers, or if 
required, a custom formulated product to meet the 
unique needs of a specific customer or application. 
GLOBAL FOOTPRINT
Our global presence gives Alent close proximity  
to our customers and high-growth end-markets.  
This allows us to deliver high-quality customer sales 
and post-sales service, “just in time” global low-cost 
manufacturing, efficient supply chains and fast-
cycle R&D. Our local presence and knowledge 
helps us to constantly evolve and extend our 
collaboration with our customers and strengthen 
our relationships. 18   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
Our competitive advantage is our 
OEM-focused strategy backed up 
by our R&D capabilities and our 
global manufacturing footprint.
Client relationships and OEM strategy
Approximately 70% of sales of our products end 
up in electronic systems across a very broad 
range of applications – essentially everything with 
an on-off switch. How these systems are actually 
built plays an important role in Alent’s strategy.
Many OEMs whose branded electronic systems 
are sold to consumers do not manufacture their 
own products but instead rely on subcontractors. 
Each OEM develops their own unique supply 
chain strategy. These individual OEM strategies 
span a very broad range.
At one end, there are OEMs that closely manage 
all aspects of their supply chain. They design their 
own circuit boards and control the selection  
of the printed circuit board fabricators who will 
build those circuit boards and will specify which 
materials from specific suppliers are to be used  
to fabricate those circuit boards.
The completed printed circuit boards are then 
sold to an assembly subcontractor for final 
assembly. Here again, the OEM specifies exactly 
which components will be used from which 
2. 
COMPETITIVE  
ADVANTAGE
suppliers, and which joining and other assembly 
materials will be used by the subcontractor to 
assemble the product.
In this extreme case of control by the OEM,  
they have oversight of all the materials and 
components used in the manufacture of their 
product. They can therefore guarantee the  
quality and reliability of the finished product,  
thus preserving and enhancing their brand  
image amongst global consumers.
At the other end of the spectrum are OEMs  
whose supply chain strategy is simply to procure 
everything at the lowest possible cost. These OEMs 
allow the assembly subcontractors to procure 
printed circuit boards from whomever they wish 
and are only concerned about cost. These OEMs 
do not specify who will build the circuit boards or 
which materials will be used. Once the circuit 
board is fabricated, the assembly subcontractor 
procures the various components and assembly 
materials strictly on the basis of cost with little 
regard for quality or reliability.
Alent focuses its sales, marketing and product 
development efforts on those OEMs who actively 
manage their supply chains. It is our belief that, 
over the long-term, these OEMs will build and 
maintain their market share and be able to retain 
and build upon their brand image with consumers.

Alent strives to partner with these OEMs and 
become an indispensable part of their own new 
product design infrastructure. Our mission is to 
understand the manufacturing and assembly 
challenges of new designs and to deliver new or 
modified materials, “just in time” to enable new 
OEM product launches that deliver no sacrifice  
in quality, reliability or overall cost of ownership.
This focus on the right OEMs over the past  
decade has been one of the foundations for  
the improvement in Alent’s business. These long-
standing relationships provide a formidable  
barrier to entry for competition.
Research and Development
A key takeaway from our OEM-focused strategy  
is the ability to listen to the customer and to 
translate this into an R&D project with very specific 
performance and time delivery milestones.  
We then deliver the product, or the solution to  
the problem, on time and supported by a data 
package detailing the productivity and reliability 
that this product will deliver in a high-volume 
manufacturing environment.
We work very hard in our R&D laboratories to 
demonstrate and prove the value that our products 
deliver. We do this by replicating our customer’s 
manufacturing processes in our laboratories.  
This ensures that we can generate meaningful  
and relevant data on productivity and reliability  
that is presented to the OEM. These comprehensive 
data packages show the OEM that our products 
lower their total cost of ownership whilst at the same 
time deliver improved reliability. 
Our global R&D spend falls into three categories:
Approximately 70% is allocated to customer- 
specific development. This involves incremental 
enhancements to existing products at the 
customer’s request. Customer-specific projects  
go through a four-stage development process  
of business justification, specification, execution 
and commercialisation.
A further 20% is allocated to new product 
development – the creation of new products or the 
provision of significant enhancements to existing 
products. These projects are managed by a “Stage 
Gate” process which approves, monitors and  
controls the project through its life cycle. At each 
“Stage Gate” , a decision is taken as to whether the 
project is viable to proceed to the next stage.
The remaining 10% is allocated to new technology 
or new market development. This involves 
brainstorming, idea generation and the exploration, 
selection and nurturing of emerging, breakthrough 
and disruptive technologies that will support our 
strategic initiatives and innovation pipeline over  
the next several years. 
With our global presence and leading 
technologies, we are regularly identifying new 
opportunities in high-growth complementary 
segments such as solar and LED. Although these 
markets are still at relatively early stages of their 
development, our Board believes they could 
provide significant additional sources of revenue  
in the future. The opportunity comes both from 
leveraging existing products and technologies in 
these new markets and through developing new 
product solutions, as well as potentially through  
bolt-on acquisitions.
Strategic proximity to customers
Alent must be able to manufacture a product 
wherever in the world the OEM chooses to have 
their product made, and Alent alone has the  
global footprint to accomplish this.
Not only does Alent deliver the product from  
a local manufacturing site, we also provide the 
assembly subcontractor or circuit board fabricator 
with our local technical service support.  
This ensures that in a high-volume production 
environment, the product performs as designed 
and delivers the productivity and cost of ownership 
designed into the product.
This OEM-focused strategy backed up by Alent’s 
fast-cycle R&D capabilities and global “copy exact” 
manufacturing footprint provide tangible value to 
the OEM. 
Alent’s motto has long been “our products must 
deliver measurably better performance or we 
cannot expect to command a premium price  
versus the competition” . As good as our sales  
people are, we cannot sell value to our customers  
if our products do not deliver value. Thus, it is critical 
that our products and services are viewed by 
customers as delivering a tangible performance 
improvement versus the competition. ALENT

BUSINESS UNIT  
REVIEW
Assembly 
Materials
We believe we have outperformed the majority of our 
end-markets in what was a challenging environment. 
Our principal end-markets have delivered negative unit 
volume growth during the course of 2013. Consumer 
confidence remained subdued during the year, 
negatively impacting demand for electronic products. 
Industry forecasts for global electronic equipment 
revenue growth were modified downward throughout 
the year, with industry analysts now estimating a 
decline of 2.9% for full year 2013, down from the 4.5% 
growth forecast at the beginning of 2013. 
Electronic content within vehicles continued its upward 
trend with growing global automotive production.  
Despite tablet computer and smartphone unit growth, 
other high unit volume electronic applications such as  
flat screen TVs experienced little, or negative, unit growth 
during 2013, with personal computer unit volume a key 
underperforming end-market. Whilst China continued to 
grow, there was weaker demand for new products and 
technologies which had a significant impact on electronics 
end-markets. Eurozone markets were weak although 
slightly improving in the second half of 2013. 
Against this challenging backdrop, NSV in our Assembly 
Materials division declined 0.9% on a constant currency 
basis versus the prior year. NSV improved in the second  
half of 2013 compared to H1 2013 by 7 .8% and was up 2.0% 
compared to H2 2012. However the H2 2013 acceleration 
was less than we had expected due to underlying weak 
electronic end-markets, limited new product launches  
from a number of global OEMs and generally subdued 
consumer confidence. 
Despite lower volumes, adjusted operating profit only 
decreased 2.7% on a constant currency basis. The NSV 
margin was slightly down at 27 .8%, reflecting a stable 
pricing environment. 
In our more mature Wave Solder Assembly segment,  
NSV declined 4.7% on a constant currency basis.  
We continued to experience a mix shift from wave solder  
to surface mount technology and as a consequence,  
year-on-year volume of bar solder declined 4%. Despite  
the volume decline, product margin contribution increased  
1% as a result of price discipline and continuing mix shift 
within the segment from lead to lead-free and lower silver  
content products.
In our higher-performance and higher-margin Surface 
Mount Assembly segment, NSV declined 3.7% on a 
constant currency basis due to lower product volumes.  
We did see a general pick-up in demand during H2 2013 
compared to H1 2013 as well as H2 2012, clawing back 
some of the weakness in H1 2013. Sales of tape-and-reel 
packaged preforms, which are manufactured shapes of 
solder used in smartphones and tablets, declined due  
to end-product design outs. In challenging markets for 
personal computers, our solder paste business performed 
well with volume down only 1% as we gained market share 
in this segment and product margin contribution was up 
8%. Wire volume was down 8% largely due to general 
market sluggishness in Asia, particularly Taiwan and China. 
Microelectronics includes a range of products that are sold 
into the semiconductor packaging, LED and photovoltaic 
end-markets, including electronic polymers, solder 
spheres, and die-attach materials. NSV was down 4.2%  
on a constant currency basis with improving demand in 
nano-silver and PV ribbon where commercial sales are 
gaining traction, being offset by lower volumes in spheres. 
The growth prospects over the medium term remain  
very strong.
The Other category includes our water treatment 
chemicals business, recycling and reclaim operations,  
and our consumer products. NSV increased 11.2% on  
a constant currency basis, due primarily to stronger 
demand for our water treatment products off the back  
of new product launches and efforts to globalise sales.  
The contribution from our recycling business decreased  
in the year, due to lower metal prices and tighter supplies 
of scrap feed stocks.
Cost control, pricing and improved mix combined to 
ensure that margin contribution increased across most 
product lines despite the lower volumes. STRATEGIC

Surface Chemistries NSV decreased 2.0% on a constant 
currency basis versus the prior year. NSV improved 
slightly in the second half of 2013 compared to H1 2013, 
but was slightly down compared to H2 2012. Solid full 
year growth from our Performance Coatings and 
Printed Circuit Board fabrication chemistry segments 
led to outperformance versus their underlying end-
markets. This was offset by weaker sales of copper 
damascene during the year.
Adjusted operating profit decreased 9.7% on a constant 
currency basis with NSV margin decreasing 1.7pts to 20.3%. 
Whilst we have increased NSV and margin contribution 
from our Performance Coatings and Printed Circuit Board 
fabrication chemistry businesses through market share 
gains and disciplined pricing, this was more than offset  
by the impact of lower sales of high-margin copper 
damascene additive. Excluding the mix effect of the lower 
copper damascene sales, NSV margin was maintained.
Automotive and industrial end-markets saw a modest 
pick-up in demand during H2 2013 compared to H1 2013. 
Increased demand for our Performance Coatings products 
in Asia and the Americas, was offset by weakness in 
European automotive production. For 2013, Western Europe 
experienced a 2% unit volume decline (source: LMC 
Automotive) in light vehicle production with the second  
half of 2013 growing 1% versus the second half of 2012. 
However, our outperformance in Europe and stronger 
demand in North American and Asian automotive markets 
resulted in our Performance Coatings segment NSV being 
up 1.1% versus the prior year on a constant currency basis. 
Surface  
Chemistries
In our Electronics segment, our Printed Circuit Board 
chemistry NSV was up 2.5% due to market share gains  
in surface finishes and increased market share in plated 
through-hole metallisation. 
Despite the global semiconductor market being flat  
in terms of silicon area (excluding solar), our copper 
damascene proprietary additive sales were down 18%.  
As previously reported, lower sales to a single customer 
who “back integrated” a chemistry suite from competition 
at the larger feature nodes impacted performance. We are 
well positioned and the strength of our business is reflected 
in our position at 28nm which remains solid, with process  
of record status at 22/20nm with a number of global 
customers. We have also made significant progress at  
the 14nm node with a handful of strategic customers.
The smaller product group, “Other” includes equipment 
sales, where we sell electroplating equipment to our 
customers and small amounts of non-proprietary resale 
products sourced from third parties and resold to 
customers. We continue to reduce NSV from this  
sub-segment due to minimal margin contribution.
We have continued to invest in the business with both R&D 
and capital expenditure. Our manufacturing footprint 
continues to be strengthened with our new Surface 
Chemistries facility in Shanghai now being commissioned.

Sustainability is a key part of our business  
model and we recognise its importance  
in delivering shareholder value.
BACKGROUND
Alent employs some 2,500 people, has a global 
base of manufacturing facilities and is serving 
customers in more than 100 countries worldwide. 
We operate in “just in time” supply chains  
with short lead times from order to delivery.  
We therefore have a relatively large number  
of small- and medium-sized facilities located close  
to our customers throughout the world’s major 
economic regions, rather than large, centralised 
factories supplying customers worldwide.  
Our manufacturing processes are not energy 
intensive (total energy costs are approximately  
1% of revenue) and do not produce large quantities 
of hazardous or other wastes and emissions. 
 www.alent.com/sustainability
POLICY 
We recognise that appropriate attention to the fulfilment  
of our corporate responsibilities can enhance our overall 
performance. In structuring our approach to the various 
aspects of corporate social responsibility, we take account 
of guidelines and statements issued by stakeholder 
representatives and other regulatory bodies from around 
the world. Social, environmental and ethical matters are 
reviewed by the Board, including the impact such matters 
may have on our management of risk.
Sustainability is a key part of our business model and we 
recognise its importance in delivering shareholder value. 
Our sustainability approach is embedded in our business 
through four key areas:
1.  OUR CODE OF CONDUCT:
requiring all of our businesses and our people to comply 
with the highest standards of legal and ethical behaviour;
2.  OUR PEOPLE: 
investing in and developing our most valued asset:  
our people;
3.  OUR PRODUCTS & SERVICES:
developing innovative products and services which 
promote sustainability in our customers’ production 
processes and products; and
4.  OUR HEALTH, SAFETY & ENVIRONMENT:
protecting the health and safety of our people, 
contractors, customers and the general public,  
and reducing energy consumption and waste  
in our operations.
1. OUR CODE OF CONDUCT
The Group has a Code of Conduct (the “Alent Code”), 
which is obligatory and sets out the standards expected  
of everyone, without exception, who works for Alent in any 
of its worldwide operations. The Alent Code emphasises our 
commitment to ethics and compliance with the law, and 
sets out required standards of legal and ethical behaviour. 
Everyone within the Group is accountable for upholding  
its requirements. 
The Alent Code sets out clear and simple principles 
covering: customers, products and services; employees; 
investors; society and local communities; health, safety  
and the environment; conflicts of interest; and competitors.

Long-term customer satisfaction is recognised as  
being essential to the attainment of Group goals, as  
is maintaining a reputation for integrity in all business  
and other dealings, both with customers and suppliers.  
The Alent Code defines how we must compete vigorously 
and honestly. 
We believe we can only achieve our goals through the 
efforts of our people. Job satisfaction requires working 
environments that motivate our people, together with 
opportunities for training and development to maximise 
personal potential. Wherever they work, our people have 
the right to be treated in good faith and with respect for 
the dignity of the individual. All of our companies must 
ensure that recruitment, training, promotion, career 
development, termination and similar employment-related 
issues are based on individual ability, achievement, 
experience and conduct without regard to race, colour, 
nationality, culture, ethnic origin, religion, gender, sexual 
orientation, age, disability or any other reason not related 
to job performance or prohibited by applicable law. 
We are committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance and transparent investor communication,  
as discussed in more detail in the “Governance” section  
of this report. 
We seek to be a good corporate citizen wherever we 
conduct business, to observe all national and local laws 
and take into account regional and local concerns, 
customs and traditions. 
The Alent Code requires all of its people, officers and 
Directors to have a duty of loyalty to the Group. Personal 
interests that do, may or might appear to conflict with 
Group interests must be avoided at all times.
Approach to anti-bribery and corruption training 
The Alent Code and its policies on anti-bribery and 
corruption require that employees and others working  
on behalf of the Company do not engage in any form  
of bribery or corruption. 
Our anti-bribery and corruption compliance programme 
has been implemented globally via an e-learning training 
module. New employees, as relevant, are required to 
complete the e-learning training as part of their  
induction process.
The Alent Code is reproduced in full on the Group’s website.

2. OUR PEOPLE 
We believe in the importance of investing in and 
developing our most valued asset: our people. We utilise  
a variety of programmes tailored to help our people 
enhance their performance, set and achieve objectives, 
and develop their leadership skills. In addition,  
we recognise and reward their high performance 
and achievements. 
Our programmes are based on our core values: 
• customer- and market-oriented innovation; 
• teamwork and collaboration; 
• enthusiasm and passion; 
• results- and people-orientation; and 
• flexibility, responsiveness, and agility.
There are several critical success factors that underpin our 
strategy while driving our people development initiatives:
• we must be a customer- and market-driven company that 
our customers rely on and prefer to do business with; 
• we must be a company that develops high-value, 
innovative products in a timely manner;
• we must create an organisation that has deep  
technical competence; 
• we expect differentiated performance of our people 
through rewards and recognition; and
• our goal is to recruit and retain high-performing people 
who create value for our organisation.
Employee development
To achieve success, we need to ensure that we work within 
a culture that supports these critical success factors.  
Our comprehensive development opportunities help 
introduce, reinforce and further strengthen each of our 
people’s special talents. Regardless of what stage in their 
career, each programme challenges participants to learn 
new and better ways to achieve their personal and 
professional goals. 
We believe our people are our competitive advantage  
and we have created comprehensive development 
opportunities to introduce, reinforce and further strengthen 
their special talents. These opportunities include:
• EDGE (Employee Development Generates Excellence) 
programmes; 
• Alent University (multi-language e-learning platform);
• Six Sigma; 
• Alent leadership programmes;
• Alent technical training; and
• education/training reimbursement.
In support of our commitment to our people and their 
development, in late 2013 we launched the “Alent 
University”, a multi-language online learning management 
system to enhance our various employee-development 
opportunities and further define our suite of blended 
learning programmes. 
In addition to our development opportunities, we  
are committed to providing competitive pay and a 
comprehensive benefits package to attract and retain  
the best employees. Our plans and initiatives include 
health and welfare plans; incentive plans; wellness 
opportunities; work/life benefits; and market benchmark 
compensation plans. 30   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

We believe that these initiatives are an important reason  
for our ability to consistently help create added value for 
our customers, allowing us to outperform many other 
competitors in our industry segments.
Human rights 
We recognise our responsibility to respect and support 
human rights. Therefore the working conditions of our 
people are in compliance with the internationally 
recognised standards and laws of the countries in which 
we operate. Furthermore we acknowledge and support 
the principles of the eight core conventions that the 
International Labour Organisation has identified as being 
fundamental to the rights of people in the workplace:
1. Freedom of Association and Protection of the  
Right to Organise Convention, 1948
2. Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining 
Convention, 1949 
3. Forced Labour Convention, 1930 
4. Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 
5. Minimum Age Convention, 1973 
6. Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 
7. Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 
8. Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) 
Convention, 1958
Diversity
We are committed to diversity and inclusion, not only in 
response to compliance requirements, but also because  
we believe it is the right thing to do. We embrace the 
cultures of countries where we do business by:
• linking diversity initiatives to the Group’s strategic  
business plans;
• identifying internal barriers to success;
• eliminating bias and discrimination from employment 
policies and practices;
• ensuring advancement opportunities are provided  
to all employees; and
• supporting the Group’s policies on diversity  
and harassment.
The Board strongly supports the spirit of the Davies Report 
“Women on Boards”. The importance of gender diversity is 
recognised in our commitment to recruit, develop and 
promote people on merit at all levels across the Group.
We are committed to gender-balanced leadership and 
want to ensure that we attract and retain the best people 
for our business. 17% of our senior managers and 32%  
of our supervisors are women; these figures have been 
steadily increasing. Additionally, 25% of our Board is female. 
Our senior management and Board support our diversity 
and inclusion strategy, and are focused on ways to 
improve the number of women at both the executive  
and management level in the future, to ensure that we 
generate innovative and creative thinking for our business. STRATEGIC

Charitable work 
We are committed to being a responsible corporate  
citizen through support for appropriate charitable projects, 
organisations and charities. With offices throughout the 
world, each location is encouraged to engage with the 
local community to develop its own local charitable 
programmes. The needs of the communities in which we 
operate are varied and diverse and although there are no 
global initiatives, there are numerous “grassroots” charitable 
efforts carried out within the regions. Examples include: 
• American Cancer Society – year-round donations are 
generated through various events, including participation 
in the annual “Relay for Life” event; 
• sponsorship of UK charity – Shooting Star Chase – a 
children’s hospice caring for babies, children and young 
people with life-limiting conditions, and their families;
• supporter of UK charity – National Energy Action (NEA), 
whose work improves and promotes energy efficiency  
and brings social, environmental, housing and 
employment benefits; and 
• donations have been made throughout the years  
in support of the relief effort for natural disasters such  
as tsunamis, earthquakes and hurricanes.
Furthermore, employees are encouraged to act as 
responsible and responsive citizens and to support projects, 
organisations and services that work towards the common 
good and improvement of their community and society.
Employee helpline
We have a 24-hour Employee Business Concern Helpline 
telephone and email facility. This is an independent  
and confidential service through which our people 
worldwide may register any concerns about any incorrect 
or irregular practices they perceive in our workplace  
or business environments.
3. OUR PRODUCTS & SERVICES
Green technologies
Our commitment to being a leading and preferred supplier 
of advanced, consumable specialty chemicals and 
engineered materials includes developing technologies 
that are socially responsible and eco-friendly. Our product 
technology focus is to develop environmentally-friendly 
products, many that are lead-free, halogen-free and 
hexavalent-free. Many of our products and processes help 
support our customers’ sustainability strategies. 
We collaborate with our customers, technology partners, 
and the world’s leading manufacturers to ensure that our 
green technologies create value by meeting current and 
future performance, productivity, design, profitability, safety, 
and regulatory requirements.
Conflict minerals
We have been very engaged with critical industry 
stakeholders in the Conflict Minerals issue and regulation 
over the past few years. In August 2012, the US Securities  
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) published the final  
rules of implementation of Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank 
Act regarding Conflict Minerals, requiring any USA publicly 
held company annually to disclose its use of conflict 
minerals that originated in Conflict Countries. As a UK  
listed company, we are not required to comply but we 
choose to do so as we strongly believe in this initiative. 
Conflict minerals are those minerals whose derivatives are 
tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold. We take very seriously our 
obligations in this process and have been very proactive in 
communicating our goals to our suppliers for transparency 
and have initiated our due diligence to certify our source 
tin’s status as “Conflict-Free”. 
We are also actively participating in the Conflict-Free  
Tin Initiative, launched in September 2012 by the Dutch 
government. Its aim is to establish a pilot programme to 
create demand for Conflict-Free Tin from a conflict region 
whose economy has collapsed due to a series of severe 
internal and cross-border conflicts. This initiative is designed 
to prevent an unintended boycott of minerals from the 
area due to the increased due diligence required when 
supplying Conflict Minerals from Conflict Countries.
ALTOONA SITE CERTIFIED AS CONFLICT-FREE SMELTER 
Alent’s facility in Altoona, USA, the largest single 
electronic solder recycling site in North America,  
has received certification as a conflict-free minerals 
smelter by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, 
Incorporated and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative 
Conflict-Free Smelter Audit Review Committee, as 
confirmed by a 3rd party compliance audit of its facility 
in November 2013. Alent is an early adopter of the 
Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative. 
As the leading global supplier of soldering materials, we 
acknowledge the importance of the Conflict Minerals 
legislation and its impact on the global electronics 
supply chain. This certification, as well as our participation 
in the Conflict-Free Tin Initiative, demonstrates our 
leadership and commitment to a conflict-free supply 
chain for the electronics assembly industry.
We take extremely seriously our obligations in this 
process and have been very proactive in communicating 
our goals to suppliers for transparency and documented 
certification of our source tin’s status as “Conflict Free” . 
We have documented and implemented a Conflict 
Minerals Policy based on the Organisation for 
Economic Co-Operation and Development Framework 
for Due Diligence.
Metals recycling
We move c5% of the world’s tin in any given year.  
We continue to invest and expand in our capabilities  
to take back metal waste streams and responsibly  
reclaim that waste into high-purity raw materials for reuse.  
Our metals recycling services operate the largest solder 
metals recycling facility in North America with major 
operations in Europe and significant operations in  
South America. 
Water treatment
Our water treatment business has long been committed to 
developing products and services that help our customers 
lower their environmental impact. Through initiatives such 
as the Home Energy Conservation Act, the UK Government 
has taken steps to address the key issue of global warming 
by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We have 
developed a portfolio of products that enable domestic 
users to minimise their carbon footprint by ensuring their 
systems operate at optimum efficiency. 
In 2013, we extended our range accredited with the 
Carbon Footprint logo from 5 to 23 products, which 
underpins our commitment to reducing carbon emissions 
and promoting sustainability. Each of our individual 
product’s carbon footprint is certified to PAS 2050;  
a specification for the assessment of the lifecycle 
greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, each carbon 
footprint product is assessed on a two-year basis and  
must prove a continuous programme of reduction in  
order to keep the label.  32   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

We are also a member and sponsor of the National  
Energy Action (NEA) charity whose partners assist the UK 
Government in delivering the ever-challenging targets to 
tackle fuel poverty in the UK. The definition of fuel poverty 
has been revised recently to encompass households where 
their income is below the poverty line (taking energy costs 
into account); and their energy costs are higher than 
typical for their household type. The correct use of our 
products is proven to maintain energy efficiency levels  
of boilers, reducing fuel wastage and thus lowering bills.
We have a vital part to play in ensuring the success  
of renewable water-borne central heating technology  
by developing the next generation of water treatment 
products. These protect the hardware of the new systems 
by offering full protection against corrosion, limescale and 
microbacterial contamination, as well as offering heat-
transfer properties.
Our products also comply with the principles of the Kyoto 
Protocol by being low in toxicity and manufactured to the 
ISO 14001 environmental quality standard. They are free  
from nitrates, phosphates and EDTA, making them highly 
biodegradable when discharged into the environment. 
As part of our R&D programme, we are pioneering the 
development of organic products and renewable 
technology heat transfer fluids to complement our  
water treatment range.
Operational excellence
Our efforts to achieve operational excellence in all of our 
facilities include a strong focus on maximising sustainable 
opportunities. Examples of just a few of our many Six  
Sigma projects undertaken throughout the Group are 
outlined below: 
REDUCTION OF PLASTIC PACKAGING
Objective 
Reduce shipping costs by 20%, whilst being 
conscientious stewards of the environment.
Six Sigma Project 
Our German operation in Langenfeld wanted to 
reduce the return costs of chemical packaging  
whilst reducing its environmental impact.
Results 
Using Six Sigma tools, a 20% reduction in plastic 
packaging was achieved, resulting in reduced 
transport and disposal costs whilst providing 
environmental benefits.
ACHIEVE BEST-IN-CLASS PRODUCT  
PERFORMANCE OF PV RIBBON
Objective 
Optimise our manufacturing process and obtain 
best-in-class performance of pv ribbon.
Six Sigma Project 
Use a combination of statistical process control tools, 
process capability analysis, and manufacturing 
experimentation techniques in order to achieve the 
desired product performance characteristics.
Results 
The Singapore site achieved a 15% improvement  
in a critical customer-required parameter resulting  
in best-in-class performance of our pv ribbon. 
4. OUR HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT 
(“HS&E”) 
We recognise our operations impact a wide community 
of stakeholders, including investors, customers, business 
associates, our people and local communities. As such, 
we have a wide range of initiatives to support health, 
safety and environmental activities. Those activities 
include advanced manufacturing facilities, designed to 
international standards, a high level of training for chemical 
operators, and segregation of raw materials and finished 
goods. All of our operations are designed with waste water 
treatment and pollution abatement equipment which 
meets or exceeds local compliance requirements.
Alent is committed to operating a sustainable, responsible 
organisation that protects the environment and the health 
and safety of those with whom we have relationships – our 
customers, our suppliers, our shareholders, our people, the 
environment and the communities in which we operate. 
Our commitment to protecting the environment is focused 
both on minimising the impact of our operations and on 
making a contribution towards a sustainable future 
through the design of our products. Compliance with 
applicable HS&E laws and regulations is a fundamental 
obligation for all our businesses. We therefore monitor energy 
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions as Group 
level KPIs. 
We are committed to maintaining a level of HS&E 
performance that is amongst the leaders in the specialty 
chemicals industry, and to demonstrating respect for  
the individual and the environment. We recognise that 
successful HS&E management involves integrating sound 
principles and practices into our daily activities so that 
business management and good performance levels are 
achieved by the collaborative effort of all of our people. 
The Board has overall responsibility for our HS&E policy  
and for monitoring its implementation. Executives and line 
managers at all levels are directly responsible through the 
normal management structure for HS&E matters in the 
operations under their control.  STRATEGIC

Particular emphasis is focused on the following areas:
• regulatory compliance: compliance with air, water  
and waste emissions, and industrial hygiene criteria; 
• health and safety performance: protecting the health 
and safety of our people, contractors, customers and  
the general public; and 
• environmental performance: reducing energy 
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
All of our manufacturing locations are certified to ISO 14001, 
the international standard for environmental management 
systems. In addition, 19 of our operations are certified to 
OHSAS 18001, the international occupational health  
and safety management system. Certification to these 
international standards is not appropriate for all facilities, 
particularly smaller ones and those with very limited 
environmental, health and safety impact. 
Regulatory actions against Alent companies have been  
at a low level for several years. This is indicative of the 
emphasis on continuous HS&E performance improvement 
across the industry in relation to statutory obligations. 
Like many manufacturers, some of our operations have 
potential environmental liabilities because of past 
operations at their current or former sites. Where remediation 
is required, we work with external specialists and with 
government authorities to ensure that remediation is 
conducted effectively and efficiently.
REACH 
In Europe, the second registration deadline under the 
Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of 
Chemical Substances – EC1907 /2006 regulations (“REACH”) 
took place in June 2013. This requires the registration of all 
substances produced or imported in quantities of between 
100 and 1,000 metric tonnes per year. We have provided 
our suppliers with the data required for them to meet this 
deadline. We have also begun preparing for the final stage 
of REACH which will require the registration of chemicals 
produced or imported in quantities of between 1 and 100 
metric tonnes per year and has a deadline of 2018.
ROHS
We continue to effectively address RoHS (Restriction  
of Hazardous Substances) and any customer-required 
restricted substance management through proactive 
contact with our suppliers and continued sampling  
of materials deemed to be “high risk”.
HEALTH AND SAFETY PERFORMANCE 
Our operations are impacted by the normal health  
and safety risks associated with manufacturing and  
other activities within the countries in which we operate. 
Our HS&E management programmes are designed to  
be forward-looking in the identification, management  
and mitigation of HS&E risks. 
We utilise audits, inspections and risk analyses to  
assess and continually improve our safety programmes.  
Both management systems and compliance audits are 
performed and results are shared across the organisation. 
We developed a new communications vehicle in 2012,  
to address common safety concerns identified through 
incident reports and internal audits. Safety Bulletins serve  
as a concise platform to convey critical safety information 
and programmes that can be deployed throughout the 
Group in a timely manner. Safety Bulletins released in 2013 
covered topics such as transferring and dispensing 
hazardous materials, incident reporting and investigation, 
and management of change.
Global Incident Rate 
We use a number of metrics to evaluate health and safety 
performance globally. All of our facilities report injuries in 
accordance with United States Department of Labor 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
record-keeping rules. Our incident rates are compared  
to NAICS 35 – the chemical manufacturing incident rates 
from the United States Department of Labor – Bureau of 
Labor Statistics.
Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) measures the number  
of recordable injuries/illnesses per 100 workers. In 2013, we 
achieved a TRIR of 0.68. Lost Work Incident Rate (LWIR) 
tracks the number of injuries/illnesses per 100 workers with 
one day or more away from work. Our 2013 LWIR was 0.50. 
Our strong performance in these areas continues, with 
both rates substantially below the benchmark for our 
industry of 2.40 for TRIR and 0.70 for LWIR.
ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 
Energy Consumption
Our manufacturing processes are not energy intensive  
and do not produce large quantities of air emissions.  
We operate a programme aimed at reducing energy use 
and its associated emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). 
We also leverage our extensive Six Sigma programme to 
identify and execute projects around the reduction of 
energy consumption at our facilities around the world. 34   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

CONTINUED
In 201 3, we consumed 287 , 1 1 8 million Btus (British Thermal 
Units ) MM Btu of energy . Of this 1 1 1 ,6 1 5MM Btu was 
electricity use (indirect energy). The remainder of our 
energy use consisted of natural gas and fuel oil ( direct 
energy). Note: In calculating energy consumption, we 
use the US national average to convert KWh to MM Btu. 
GHG Emissions
Our methodology for measuring GHG emissions follows 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocols of the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development and the World 
Resource Institute. We report direct and indirect GHG 
emissions in terms of CO
2 -equivalents (CO 2 -e). Direct 
GHG emissions are those that occur from stationary and 
mobile sources that we own or control. These emissions 
are also referred to as “Scope 1 ” emissions. Indirect 
emissions, or “Scope 2” emissions, are related to the  
use or purchase of electricity .
For 201 3, we have added an intensity /normalisation ratio 
to gauge performance and to be compliant with the UK 
GHG reporting requirements. Margin over Material 
(MOM) was used as this factor as it effectively removes 
fluctuations in material cost from the calculations and  
is the best gauge for our business.
We have collected data from all of our major 
manufacturing locations and major sites. We have 
excluded sales/business offices and warehouses as we 
believe these are insignificant. In 201 4, we will review all 
office and warehouse space to confirm their energy / GHG 
emissions are, as we expect, insignificant. In addition, we 
will perform an inventory / audit of all Freon usage within 
the business and include any releases in our 201 4 GHG 
emissions data. From a preliminary review, the type of 
Freon most used is R22 which is exempt from the current 
GHG reporting criteria.
In 201 3, we had a total of 26,004 metric tons of GHG 
emissions, made up of 10,571 metric tons of direct  
( scope 1 ) and 1 5,433 metric tons of indirect ( scope 2) 
GHG emissions. On an absolute basis, our total GHG 
emission saw a 2.72% increase from the 201 2 totals. 
As a better gauge of performance, this year we 
generated a GHG Intensity number based on MOM in 
which we saw a 6.25% increase from the 201 2 intensity 
number which we will be tracking from here forward. 
Prior to 2010, we had reduced our overall consumption  
of energy through the implementation of energy and 
GHG reduction projects. We do not have very energy 
intensive processes and expect similar emissions numbers  
going forward. STRATEGIC

 RISK MANA GEMENT  
AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
Our fully integrated system of risk management and 
internal controls provides visibility and accountability  
for risks throughout Alent. 
RISK ASSESSMENT APPROACH
Alent faces a wide range of risks across our global  
business. Efficient and effective management of our risks  
is at the centre of Alent plc and the way we operate.
The risk assessment approach is designed to identify, 
categorise and assess in terms of impact and likelihood  
of occurrence before, and after, control mitigation, the  
key risks facing the business. 
At the centre of the risk assessment is the framework for 
identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks 
faced by the business with Alent plc at the centre of the risk 
assessment. Surrounding the centre are controls utilised to 
protect the Group from existing and potential risks that 
could impact the business.
We have a Risk Management Policy which provides  
a consistent approach to risk management throughout  
the Group. Risks are identified and mitigated at every level 
within the Group. Where applicable, risks are aggregated 
and all Group risks and mitigation actions shared with the 
operating companies to ensure consistency of mitigation 
and localisation where possible.
 
Not all risks are within the control of the Group.  
However, our approach to risk management ensures  
we have controls in place to reduce the impact of such 
risks where possible, should they occur.
RISK MANAGEMENT ROLES 
Ultimately the Board is responsible for the Group’s risk 
management and internal control frameworks. The Board 
will regularly review insurance and other measures adopted 
to manage risks within the Group. The Audit Committee  
will regularly monitor, review and evaluate the effectiveness 
of the system and controls of the Group.
The Board delegates a level of risk to the Executive 
Management team through a series of Group policies  
and delegated authority matrices. 
During the course of 2013, the Group established an 
Executive Risk Committee to review, evaluate, mitigate  
and report on risks within the Group. These include business 
unit risks, Group risks, internal risks, external risks, financial 
risks and non-financial risks. The Committee meets regularly 
and provides the Board with updates on any major risks 
that could have a material impact on the Group, assessing 
the impact and likelihood of occurrence before, and after, 
control mitigation. 36   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

ECONOMIC RISK  
Global, economic and market related risks
The financial performance and financial 
position of the Group may be adversely 
affected by a significant weakening in 
demand in its core end-markets and general 
macro-economic conditions.
During an economic/financial downturn, there  
is an increased possibility that organisations 
with which the Group has either trading or 
funding relationships may not honour their 
obligations (counter-party risk).
• A review of intelligence related to our end-markets to ensure that any 
deterioration in those markets is identified early, communicated 
appropriately and acted upon. 
• The Board will regularly review Group strategy, which will determine  
the markets in which the Group operates. The current spread of the 
Group’s business, both geographically and by end-market served, 
provides some protection to the Group should conditions in particular 
markets deteriorate. 
• Cost-reduction initiatives and the cost base remains tightly controlled.
• Counterparties are chosen carefully so that those with poor credit 
ratings and reputations are avoided by the Group wherever possible. 
• Treasury policies and procedures detail the minimum rating criteria for 
banks where deposits can be made. Group subsidiaries are required to 
operate effective credit control procedures. 
• Surplus cash positions and bank balances held at subsidiary level are 
reviewed on a regular basis by the Group’s treasury department and 
actions taken where appropriate. 
• “Default lender” language was negotiated into the bank facility in the 
event that an existing bank lender cannot meet its lending obligations. 
• Group companies must hold adequate and specific reserves against 
possible bad debts. 
FINANCIAL
Financial Risk – Treasury
The Group’s financial position and trading  
results may be adversely affected by 
fluctuations in exchange rates, interest  
rates or the rate of inflation.
• The treasury policy is regularly updated and communicated to  
the divisions. 
• Transactional and balance sheet translation risks associated with 
currency exchange rate fluctuations through hedging and funding 
policies are actively managed. 
• There is a Group policy that foreign currency transaction exposures  
that are material at an individual operating unit level are hedged using 
appropriate instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts. 
For key operating currencies, the Group policy is to broadly match the 
currency profile of its borrowings with the currencies of its asset base. 
• Where appropriate, the Group manages its interest rate exposures using 
interest rate swaps or other instruments.
OPERATIONAL RISK
Technology and innovation
Alent may lose customers to competitors with  
new or alternative technologies if its businesses 
either do not adequately adapt to market 
developments or are unable to protect,  
maintain and enforce its intellectual property. 
• Significant investments in research and development are made to 
sustain competitive advantage and take appropriate action to ensure 
the cost base remains competitive. 
• The Group applies for patents over its products, technologies and 
processes in a number of jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, 
Europe and the USA. 
• New product and service offerings by competitors are regularly 
monitored and any perceived breach of Group registered patents, 
know how or designs is vigorously challenged. 
• The Group avoids holding key intellectual property in countries which 
do not afford an acceptable degree of legal protection to Alent. 
• Significant investment takes place in research and development 
facilities and will continue to ensure that the Group remains able to 
front-run emerging trends, and maintain its leadership position in terms 
of innovation and product development in its market niches. 
Throughout its global operations, the Group faces various risks,  
both internal and external, which could have a material impact  
on the Group’s long-term performance. 
The Group manages the risk inherent in its operations in order to mitigate exposure to all forms of risk, where practical,  
and to transfer risk to insurers, where cost-effective. The risks below are not the only risks the Group will face. Some risks are 
not yet known and some could change their level of materiality and impact on the Group in the future. All of these risks 
could materially affect the Group, its divisions, and results of future operations or financial condition.

RISK AND IMPACT ON STRATEGY KEY ACTIONS TREND*
Operational Risk – Personnel
The loss of key personnel or the failure to 
attract, develop or retain skilled or qualified 
employees could negatively impact  
the Group.
• The Group has created comprehensive development opportunities  
to introduce, reinforce and further strengthen employee talents. 
• The Group utilises a variety of programmes tailored to help  
its employees enhance their performance, set and achieve  
objectives, develop their leadership skills and recognise and  
reward their achievements. 
• A succession planning programme with an identified succession  
plan is in place for all senior members of staff.
• The Remuneration Committee approves fit-for-purpose employee 
compensation and incentive programmes. 
Operational Risk – Intellectual property
If the Group fails or is unable to protect, 
maintain and enforce its intellectual property,  
it may lose its exclusive right to use its 
technologies and processes.
• New product and service offerings by competitors are regularly 
monitored and any perceived breach of a Group patent is  
vigorously challenged. 
• The Group applies for patents over its major products, technologies 
and processes in a number of jurisdictions, including but not limited  
to Europe and the USA. 
• To the extent possible, the Group avoids holding key intellectual 
property in countries which do not afford an acceptable degree  
of legal protection to the Group.
Operational Risk – Raw material prices
The Group’s future prospects, financial position 
and results of operations could be adversely 
affected if it is unable to pass on to its customers 
fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials 
which it purchases. 
• The Group has processes in place to ensure that any increases or 
decreases in the cost of commodity metal prices are passed on to  
its customers. 
• Group systems are automatically uploaded with LME (London Metal 
Exchange) prices or equivalent on a daily basis. These prices are  
then agreed and passed on to the customer at the time of placing  
an order.
REGULATORY RISK
Environmental, health and safety
Changing regulatory environment and criteria, 
particularly in emerging markets and future 
expenditure on compliance with environmental 
and health and safety laws and regulations 
may materially adversely affect the Group’s 
future prospects, financial position and results  
of operations.
• Executives and line managers at all levels are directly responsible 
through the normal management structure for HS&E matters in the 
operations under their control.
• Group facilities are ISO compliant to quality, environmental and health  
and safety standards by a third party registrar. 
• The Group has in place an insurance programme covering all of its 
businesses which provides an acceptable level of coverage for the 
operational risks which they face.
Regulatory Risk – Failure to comply with  
laws, regulations and restrictions/ethics  
and governance
Should the Group’s businesses fail to comply 
with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements, this may result in a financial  
loss or restriction on their ability to operate. 
• As part of its planning process before entering a new market or territory, 
or expanding in an existing market or territory, the Group undertakes a 
rigorous assessment of the risks involved. 
• In addition, the spread of the Group’s major businesses, both 
geographically and by end-market served, provides some protection 
to the Group should any of its businesses be adversely impacted by 
legal, regulatory or other changes in an individual market or territory. 
• The Group has in place an insurance programme covering all of its 
businesses which provides an acceptable level of coverage for the 
operational risks they face. 38   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

OVERVIEW
I am pleased to be reporting on a solid set of results for 2013 despite subdued economic environments and end-markets 
that proved to be more challenging than expected. Global economies have shown lower than expected growth and 
consumer confidence remained subdued during the year. Despite these challenges, we have either held or grown 
market share in the majority of our end-markets, maintained price discipline and continued to exert tight cost control. 
Whilst adjusted operating profit was behind last year, cash generation was very strong resulting in a significant 
strengthening of the balance sheet leading to a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.0x versus 1.3x at the end of 2012.

REVIEW
 C ON T INUE D
NET FINANCE COSTS
Net finance costs in the year were £6.9m, a decrease of 
£1.6m or 18.8% on the adjusted proforma net finance cost 
for 2012. Interest on net borrowings of £5.7m (2012: £7 .6m) 
was lower than 2012 due to lower gross debt levels on the 
back of stronger cash generation and lower interest rates. 
The net interest cost associated with the net liabilities of the 
Group’s defined benefit pension and other post-retirement 
benefit plans was £1.1m (2012: £0.5m). 
ADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Adjusted profit before tax decreased 1.1% to £88.0m (2012: 
£89.0m) whilst on a constant currency basis, the decrease 
was 3.5%.
TAX CHARGE
The adjusted tax charge on ordinary activities was £20.9m 
(2012: £20.8m), on an adjusted profit before tax of £88.0m 
(2012: £89.0m). The effective tax rate (ETR) (before share of 
post-tax profit of joint ventures) was 24.0% (2012: 23.4%).  
The 2013 ETR is slightly higher than the prior year due 
primarily to higher withholding tax on the repatriation  
of dividends from overseas territories.
The tax credit on exceptional items was £4.8m (2012: 
charge £4.9m). Included within the 2013 tax credit is the 
recognition of a deferred tax asset of £6.1m (2012: £nil)  
in respect of a portion of the accumulated US tax losses. 
Prior to 2013 the accumulated tax losses in the US were  
not recognised as a deferred tax asset due to uncertainty 
in the future profitability from our US operations. As at  
31 December 2013 there were approximately US$240m  
of gross US tax losses available to Alent. Further details are 
provided in note 11 of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
As a result of an anticipated change in the geographic 
split of profit before tax and the continued repatriation of 
dividends from overseas territories, we expect the ETR for 
the full year 2014 to be between 25% and 26%. This assumes 
no change in the ETR from utilisation of our deferred tax 
asset associated with our US tax losses.
ADJUSTED PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
Adjusted profit for the year decreased by 1.6% to £67 .1m 
(2012: £68.2m).
ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Adjusted earnings per share decreased by 2.0% to  
24.1 pence per share (2012: 24.6 pence per share).  
The weighted average number of shares was 278.4m  
(2012: 277 .5m).
Group NSV increased 0.8% to £420.1m (2012: £416.7m), 
generally outperforming weak end-markets. NSV in our 
Assembly Materials business increased 0.7% to £209.5m 
(2012: £208.0m), with growth impacted by underlying weak 
end-markets, limited new product launches from a number 
of global OEMs and subdued consumer confidence. NSV in 
our Surface Chemistries business increased 0.9% to £210.6m 
(2012: £208.7m) with solid growth in both our Performance 
Coatings and electronic segments through share capture 
offset by lower sales of copper damascene.
Group adjusted operating profit decreased by £3.1m (3.2%) 
to £94.1m (2012: £97 .2m). On a constant currency basis the 
decrease was 5.4%. Group NSV margin decreased 0.9pts, 
both on a reported and constant currency basis to 22.4% 
(2012: 23.3%). 
Assembly Materials adjusted operating profit decreased 
0.9% (down 2.7% at constant currency rates) to £58.2m 
(2012: £58.7m) with the NSV margin decreasing 0.4pts to 
27 .8% (2012: 28.2%). Lower smartphone, personal computer 
and European automotive volumes impacted profit and 
NSV margin during the year. Despite weak end-market 
demand, pricing discipline was maintained and tight cost 
control continued.
Surface Chemistries adjusted operating profit decreased 
7 .2% (down 9.7% at constant currency rates) to £42.7m  
(2012: £46.0m) with the NSV margin decreasing 1.7pts to 
20.3% (2012: 22.0%). Whilst we increased NSV and margin 
contribution from our Performance Coatings and Printed 
Circuit Board chemistry business through market share 
gains and disciplined pricing, this was more than offset  
by the impact of lower sales of high margin copper 
damascene additive. Excluding the mix effect of the  
lower copper damascene sales, NSV margin was  
broadly maintained.
Corporate costs of £6.8m (2012: £7 .5m) are marginally  
down on the prior year largely due to lower incentive costs.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Total exceptional costs for the Group were £10.3m (2012: 
£15.8m), and were restructuring related charges, principally 
arising in connection with initiatives that included 
redundancy programmes, the downsizing or closure of 
facilities, the streamlining of manufacturing processes  
and the rationalisation of product lines. The net tax credit 
attributable to these restructuring charges was £1.9m (2012: 
£0.6m). We would expect an exceptional cost relating to 
restructuring of c£3m-£5m for full year 2014 as we continue 
to right size and streamline the business structures.
DEMERGER COSTS
There were no demerger costs in the year (2012: £10.7m).  STRATEGIC

Net assets at the end of 2013 were £312.4m, an increase of £36.4m on the 2012 level of £276.0m. The reason for the 
increase is principally strong cash generation and the resultant reduction in net debt.
Return on invested capital of 12.6% for 2013 is broadly similar to that of 2012.

Alent invests significant amounts in R&D and endeavours to 
sustain its competitive advantage. In 2013, total R&D spend 
was £16.0m, (2012: £16.5m) equivalent to 3.8% (2012: 4.0%), 
of NSV. Of this expenditure, £7 .9m (2012: £8.1m) or 3.8% 
(2012: 3.9%) of NSV was in the Assembly Materials business 
whilst £8.1m (2012: £8.4m) or 3.8% (2012: 4.0%) of NSV was  
in the Surface Chemistries business. All R&D costs have 
been expensed through the Group income statement. 
Going forward, we would expect R&D spend to broadly 
track NSV growth. 42   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

Cash generation during the year has been very strong, 
leading to reduced net debt and a strengthening of our 
balance sheet.
EBITDA for 2013 was £103.1m (2012: £111.9m).  
Working capital inflow in 2013 was £5.6m (2012: outflow 
£20.0m). Working capital as a percentage of sales was 
17 .5% (2012: 18.3%). The significant improvement was  
driven by a combination of lower raw material costs, 
working capital initiatives and a one-off benefit associated 
with the early receipt of a long-term equipment financing 
transaction. Going forward, assuming stable raw material 
costs, we would expect some working capital build in the 
first half of 2014 in advance of the traditional stronger 
demand in the second half of the year. We remain focused 
on reducing the working capital needs of the business 
although this is to some extent influenced by raw  
material costs.
Restructuring cash costs of £4.0m (2012: £3.8m)  
were incurred in the year in respect of restructuring 
initiatives leaving provisions made but unspent of  
£9.7m (2012: £3.8m). We would expect a restructuring  
cash outflow of c£8-10m in 2014.
Adjusted cash generated from operations was £102.8m 
(2012: £86.0m) and represented a cash conversion of  
99.7% of EBITDA, an improvement of 22.8pts from our 2012 
cash conversion of 76.9%.
Net interest paid of £4.1m (2012: £2.6m) was in respect  
of interest on borrowings, whilst income taxes paid 
amounted to £19.3m (2012: £22.1m). The tax cash flow in 
2013 benefited from a small number of one-off items, 
without which the tax cash would have been similar to 
2012. We would expect income taxes paid in 2014 to be 
similar to our effective tax rate of between 25% and 26%.
Capital expenditure in 2013 was £13.7m (2012: £16.4m 
excluding Woking). This represents 152% (2012: 184%) of 
depreciation. The main expenditure during 2013 was 
incurred on the new manufacturing plants in Shanghai, 
China and Chennai, India as well as continuing upgrade 
of our R&D equipment and facilities. Our Shanghai facility  
is currently being commissioned whilst Chennai will 
commence commissioning during the first half of 2014. 
Following the completion of the plant in Chennai, our 
manufacturing footprint will be largely complete. As such, 
we expect capital expenditure to be running at 1.0-1.5 
times depreciation in 2014 and beyond.
Adjusted free cash flow for the year was £73.2m  
(2012: £49.1m).
Demerger cash costs incurred in the year were £4.8m 
(2012: £5.7m) with no further cash costs anticipated.
NET DEBT
Net debt at 31 December 2013 was £96.5m (2012: £144.4m). 
Gross borrowings were £159.6m whilst cash on hand was 
£63.1m. At 31 December 2013, the Group’s gross borrowings 
were denominated in US Dollars (45%), Euros (19%) and 
pounds sterling (35%). 
£154.5m (2012: £227 .5m) of the Group’s gross borrowings 
comprise drawings under a £300m committed bank facility. 
Loans made under this facility bear interest at a floating rate 
per annum based on the London interbank offer rate (LIBOR) 
as applicable plus a margin ranging from 1.25% per annum 
to 2.25% per annum depending on the ratio of consolidated 
net borrowings to proforma EBITDA. The facility expires in 
September 201 7 .
Financial covenants applicable to the facility include 
adjusted EBITDA to net interest (minimum 4.0 times) and  
net debt to adjusted EBITDA (maximum 3.0 times). As at  
31 December 2013, Alent was operating well within these 
covenants as the ratio of EBITDA to net interest was 22.0  
times and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 1.0 times.

The Group operates defined contribution and defined 
benefits pensions plans, principally in the US and Germany. 
The Group’s largest defined benefit plan in the US is closed 
to new members and to further accruals for existing 
members. As at 31 December 2013, the net deficit in Alent’s 
post-retirement defined benefit plans was £18.8m (2012: 
£24.3m) with assets of £39.9m (2012: £41.1m) and liabilities 
of £58.7m (2012: £65.4m).
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending a 4.2% increase in the full  
year dividend, with a final dividend for 2013 of 5.71p  
per share making a total of 8.60p for the year (2012: 8.25p). 
This is equivalent to 2.8 times dividend cover from adjusted 
EPS. The final dividend, if approved at the Annual General 
Meeting on 19 May 2014, is to be paid on 19 June 2014 to 
shareholders on the register on 16 May 2014. Any shareholder 
wishing to participate in the Alent Dividend Reinvestment 
Plan (“DRIP”) needs to have submitted their election to do 
so by 29 May 2014. We maintain our progressive dividend 
policy with full year dividend growth expected to be at 
least in line with earnings growth, and targeting a dividend 
cover in the near term within a range of 3.0 to 2.8 times. 
In the normal course, the interim dividend will be equivalent 
to 35% of the full year dividend for the previous year.  
The Directors’ intention is to maintain a capital structure 
that is both efficient and balanced between investment  
for growth and returns to shareholders.
TREASURY MANAGEMENT
The Group maintains a centralised Treasury function which 
is responsible for setting treasury policy throughout the 
Alent Group, and for much of the Group’s treasury activity 
(particularly funding, risk management and cash 
management). Operating companies are responsible for 
those activities best controlled locally (eg payments and 
collections, local bank relationships and transactional 
foreign exchange management). The Group’s Treasury 
Policies and Procedures, which provide the framework for 
this activity, are approved by the Alent plc Board and 
reviewed on a regular basis.
FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
The majority of the Group’s funding requirements are  
met by means of its £300m committed bank facility, with 
limited use of local overdraft facilities where appropriate. 
Operating companies are required to remit surplus cash  
to Group Treasury, as soon as practical, through 
participation in the Group’s cash management systems  
or, where such participation is not possible, by payment  
of dividends or repayment of intercompany loans.
INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s interest rate risk arises principally on its core 
borrowings. This risk is managed, when appropriate, by the 
use of interest rate swaps. At 31 December 2013, 81% of the 
Group’s gross borrowings were hedged by means of interest 
rate swaps which had the effect of fixing the interest rate on 
these borrowings until March 2014.
TAXATION POLICY
Alent’s tax strategy is to manage tax risks and tax costs in a 
manner consistent with shareholders’ best long-term interest, 
taking into account both economic and reputational 
factors. The Group’s tax strategy aims to ensure compliance 
with all relevant statutory obligations and to mitigate the tax 
charge to a level that is consistent with the Group’s legal 
obligations in all relevant jurisdictions. The Group seeks to 
build constructive, open working relationships with tax 
authorities through transparency, and actively considers  
the implications of tax planning on the Group’s corporate 
reputation. Arm’s length principles are applied in the pricing 
of all intra-group transactions in accordance with OECD 
guidelines. The Group has strong controls and clear policies 
and procedures covering tax which the Group follows.  
We approach tax planning with the aim of paying the right 
amount of tax at the right time in each tax jurisdiction.
GOING CONCERN BASIS
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the  
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, they 
have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS and the material accounting policies are set out in 
the notes to the financial statements of this report. The Group 
has adopted new and revised IFRS as detailed in note 2.  44   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
 FIN A NCI A L
 REV IEW
 C ON T IN UE D
Applying accounting policies requires the use of certain 
judgments, assumptions and estimates. The following 
accounting policies have been identified as being the  
most significant and where there is most risk of material 
adjustment to the carrying value of the Group’s assets  
and liabilities within the financial statements:
• goodwill;
• employee benefits;
• liability reserves; and
• taxation.
See note 3 to the Group financial statements for  
more detail.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During 2013, the Group’s related party transactions were 
between the Company and its subsidiaries and have been 
eliminated on consolidation. Transactions between Alent 
plc and Vesuvius plc have been treated as related party 
up until the date of the demerger, 19 December 2012.  
The details of these transactions have been included  
in note 35 on page 133.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK
It is the Group’s policy to manage the currency risk on  
its net assets by matching the currency profile of its core 
borrowings with the currency profile of its earnings and net 
assets. At 31 December 2013, 35% of the Group’s gross 
borrowings were denominated in Pounds Sterling, 45%  
in US Dollars, and 19% in Euros.
The Group does not hedge the translation exposure  
on the income statements of its overseas subsidiaries. 
Foreign currency transaction exposures that are material  
at an individual operating unit level are hedged using 
forward foreign exchange contracts.
CURRENCY IMPACT ON TRADING
The Group reports its results in pounds sterling but conducts 
its business in multiple foreign currencies. The revenue mix 
in its major currencies in 2013 was as follows:
2013 2012
US Dollars 26% 25%
Chinese Renminbi 21% 20%
Euros 22% 19%
Taiwanese Dollars 9% 10%
Brazilian Reals 5% 5%
Based on the 2013 mix of non-pound sterling denominated 
revenue and adjusted operating profit, a 1% movement in 
US Dollars (relative to pounds sterling) changes revenue  
by £1.8m and adjusted operating profit by £0.2m.  
A 1% movement in Chinese Remminbi (relative to pounds 
sterling) changes revenue by £1.4m and adjusted operating 
profit by £0.4m. A 1% movement in Euros (relative to pounds 
sterling) changes revenue by £1.5m and adjusted operating 
profit by £0.2m.
The Group has a policy of broadly matching the currency 
of borrowings to the currency of its operating activities for 
its major trading currencies. At the end of 2013, 65% of  
the Group’s gross borrowings were denominated into  
non-sterling currencies, principally US Dollar and Euros.

REVENUE
Group revenue decreased by £29.2m to £684.7m (2012: 
£713.9m). On a constant currency basis the decline was 
5.8%. The revenue decrease is impacted by the “pass 
through” to customers of lower tin and silver prices, both 
major raw materials for Assembly Materials, and lower gold 
prices in the Surface Chemistries business. For the full year 
2013, the average prices of tin, gold and silver were, 
respectively, 6%, 15% and 23% lower than the same period in 
the prior year, such that approximately £15m of the Group’s 
revenue decrease was as a result of these lower metal 
prices. The balance of the revenue reduction was due to 
reduced demand for lower margin, more commoditised 
products (particularly bar solder and non-proprietary 
chemicals) and lower gold consumption partially offset  
by the continued market penetration of innovative, higher 
margin, products.
OPERATING PROFIT
Assembly Materials operating profit increased by £0.7m 
(1.2%) to £58.2m (2012: £57 .5m). The NSV margin increased 
0.2pts to 27 .8% (2012: 27 .6%). Surface Chemistries operating 
profit decreased by £2.5m (5.5%) to £42.7m (2012: £45.2m). 
The NSV margin declined 1.4pts to 20.3% (2012: 21.7%). 
NET FINANCE COSTS
Finance costs on a statutory basis amounted to £7 .4m 
(2012: £4.1m) including £1.1m (2012: £0.5m) for the net 
interest cost associated with the Group’s net defined 
benefit pension liabilities. Finance income amounted  
to £0.5m (2012: £0.5m).
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Profit before tax increased by £4.5m to £77 .7m  
(2012: £73.2m) primarily due to lower exceptional items.
TAX CHARGE
The tax charge on ordinary activities was £20.9m (2012: 
£23.3m) on profit before tax of £77 .7m (2012: £73.2m), an 
effective adjusted tax rate (before exceptionals and share 
of post-tax profit from joint-ventures) of 24.0% (2012: 23.4%).
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
Profit for the year was £61.6m (2012: £45.0m).
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share were 22.1p (2012: 16.2p). The weighted 
average number of shares was 278.4m (2012: 277 .5m).

GOVERNANCE
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
I am pleased to present the Company’s corporate 
governance report for 2013 on behalf of the Board. 
At the end of our first year, I can confirm that the new Board 
has proven itself to be working well together; the intense 
work undertaken has unified and strengthened the Board. 
We have met more than we would do normally which has 
enabled the Board to develop further its strategy for the 
Company. I feel the Board has the right depth and mix of 
skills and experience, knowledge and independence to 
address a number of tough challenges and to ensure that 
it acts in the best interests of shareholders as a whole.  
The Board is well placed to maximise the opportunities  
for Alent and its shareholders.
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards  
of corporate governance and ensuring values and 
behaviours are embedded and consistent across the 
business. As a new company we have sought to enshrine 
best practice and believe that good governance is  
integral to our strategy and decision making processes. 
Throughout this first year, either collectively or individually, 
all Board members have visited many of the Company’s 
operations and sites and engaged with our people and 
other stakeholders in order to gain an invaluable insight 
into the culture and values prevailing throughout  
the business.
As stewards of the Company, I believe it is the responsibility  
of the whole Board to ensure that the Company’s strategy 
is aligned with the interests of our investors and stakeholders. 
During the year the Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees, the Executive Directors and myself have 
extensively engaged with our major stakeholders to try  
and understand their views.
We believe that a robust governance framework based  
on integrity and transparency, which promotes challenge 
and accountability, is the cornerstone of our organisation. 
We have endeavoured to set out in this Report clear 
information for all stakeholders on how Alent sets out  
to achieve its goals.
I would like to encourage all shareholders to attend our 
AGM on 19 May 2014. It is an excellent opportunity to  
meet the Board and some senior executives.

WHAT IS OUR APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE?
This report, including the reports from the Nominations, Audit 
and Remuneration Committees, describes the Company’s 
corporate governance structure and explains how the 
Company has applied all the principles set out in sections  
A to E of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (the “UK Code”), The UK Code is 
intended to promote the interest of shareholders, increase 
director accountability and encourage greater stakeholder 
engagement and has been designed to provide investors 
with greater insight into the activities of companies, through 
the work of the Board and its Committees. As a company 
with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange,  
the Company is committed to ensuring that the highest 
standards of corporate governance are maintained and  
we intend to comply fully with the main and supporting 
principles of the UK Code.
The Company’s auditors, KPMG, are required to review 
whether or not the Corporate Governance Report reflects 
the Company’s compliance with the provisions of the UK 
Code specified for their review by the Listing Rules of the  
UK Listing Authority and to reflect if it does not reflect such 
compliance. No such report has been made. Copies of 
the UK Code are publicly available at www.frc.org.uk.
HOW HAVE WE RESPONDED TO RECENT  
GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENTS?
The Board has received regular updates from both myself, 
the Company Secretary and the Company’s advisers 
enabling it to consider all governance developments as 
well as receiving appropriate training and education on 
relevant issues.
LEADERSHIP 
The Role of the Board 
The Board is appointed by shareholders, who are the owners 
of the Company. The Board’s principal responsibility is to act 
in the best interests of the shareholders as a whole, within 
the legal framework of the Companies Act 2006. Ultimate 
responsibility for the management and long-term success  
of Alent rests with the Board of Directors. The Board focuses 
primarily upon strategic, policy and governance issues  
and is responsible for the Company’s long-term success.  
It approves the Company’s strategy, oversees the allocation 
of resources, approves the Company’s operating budgets 
which are normally proposed by the Chief Executive and 
monitors the performance of the Company against them. 
The Board is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the key risks faced by the Company, and for 
establishing the effectiveness of the Company’s systems  
of internal controls. It has a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it and delegates certain matters to Committees 
as set out in the Report. In addition, the Non-executive 
Directors constructively challenge the Executive Directors 
and review their performance. The Board reviews, at least 
annually, the performance of the Chairman.

HOW IS OUR BOARD ORGANISED?
The Roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive  
and Division of Responsibilities 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman  
and the Chief Executive has been agreed by the Board 
and is set out in writing. 
THE CHAIRMAN
The Chairman leads the Board, promoting a culture of 
openness, challenge and debate and ensuring its 
effectiveness and high standards of corporate governance 
to safeguard the interests of shareholders. The Chairman 
facilitates and encourages open communication and 
constructive working relationships between the Executive 
and Non-executive Directors and provides overall guidance 
to the Executive Directors and senior management. 
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Nominations 
Committee, is also responsible for Board succession 
planning and has ultimate responsibility for communication 
and dialogue with shareholders, together with ensuring 
that the Board acts in the best interest of shareholders 
taken as a whole. 
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary 
and Executive Directors, sets the agenda for Board 
meetings and ensures that all Board and Committee 
members receive accurate, timely and clear information 
prior to meetings. A clear structure for the operation of the 
Board and its Committees is in place. The Chairman meets 
routinely with the Chief Executive, the Finance Director  
and the Company Secretary to discuss relevant matters. 
The Board considers that the Chairman is able to, and 
does, devote sufficient time to his duties at Alent.
The biographical details of the Chairman and details  
of his relevant experience are set out on page 46. 
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for the 
day-to-day management of the business, the performance 
for which he is accountable and upon which he reports  
to the Board. He has the lead role in developing the 
Company’s strategic direction for consideration and 
approval by the Board, and for the implementation of the 
agreed strategy. The Chief Executive is responsible on  
a day-to-day basis for, and oversees, the Company’s 
performance in health, safety and environmental matters. 
The Chief Executive is supported by the Finance Director  
in the provision to the Board of high-quality financial 
information on the Company’s performance. 
The Role of Executive Directors 
The Executive Directors have specific executive 
responsibilities, of which the Chief Executive’s are set  
out above. The Chief Executive provides leadership to  
the management team, sets the culture, standards,  
ethics and values of the Company, and is responsible for 
management development and succession planning 
within the Company. The Finance Director has particular 
responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the 
Company’s financial reporting, for treasury, tax and risk 
management, and for internal financial controls. 
Executive Directors are not members of the Board 
Committees, although they may be invited to attend.  
Both Mr Corbett and Mr Egan attended all Audit 
Committee meetings during the year. Mr Corbett was also 
a regular attendee at the Remuneration Committee.
The biographical details of the Executive Directors and 
details of their relevant experience are set out on page 46.  STRATEGIC

The Role of Non-executive Directors 
The Non-executive Directors bring a wide range of skills 
and international experience to the Board. Their role is to 
understand the business and its markets, to help shape  
and develop strategy, and to challenge constructively  
and support the management. Additionally, their role is 
also to satisfy themselves with regard to the integrity of the 
Company’s financial information and to ensure that the 
Company’s financial controls and risk management 
systems are robust and defensible. Collectively they hold  
or have held senior positions in their chosen fields, 
including finance and mergers & acquistions, and 
contribute a wide range of international experience and 
objective perspective to the Board. They represent a strong, 
independent element on the Board. As Chairmen of the 
Board Committees, the independent Non-executive 
Directors also fulfil important leadership roles. As members 
of the Board Committees, the independent Non-executive 
Directors bring focus on governance and succession 
planning, internal controls, risk management and 
remuneration policies. 
The biographical details of the Non-executive Directors 
and details of their relevant experience are set out on 
pages 46 to 47 . 
The Senior Independent Director 
Mark Williamson is our Senior Independent Director.
The Board nominates one of the Non-executive Directors  
to act as Senior Independent Director and provide an 
alternative contact at Board level, other than the 
Chairman, to whom shareholder matters can be 
addressed. The Senior Independent Director, when 
necessary, supports the Chairman and the other Non-
executive Directors on Company related matters. He will 
act as a sounding board for the Chairman and, should it 
be required, can act as an intermediary for any concerns 
of other Non-executive Directors. There is a written job 
specification for the role which is reviewed annually  
by the Nominations Committee. The Senior Independent 
Director is responsible for undertaking the annual 
evaluation of the Chairman’s performance, leading the 
recruitment process for a new Chairman while ensuring  
an orderly succession process. 
The Company Secretary 
Simon O’Hara is the Company Secretary and has  
acted as Secretary to all Committees during the year.  
The Secretary supports the Chairman on corporate 
governance matters. Together with the Chairman, he is 
responsible to the Board in respect of compliance with 
Board procedures, ensuring a timely flow of information 
and for the setting of the annual programme of Board and 
Committee meetings and their agendas. Furthermore, he 
has responsibility, via the Chairman, for ensuring that the 
Board is kept up to date on legislative, regulatory and 
governance matters and developments and that all 
induction and professional development needs are met. 
The Company Secretary ensures that there is an 
appropriate level of communication between the Board 
and its Committees and between senior management 
and the Non-executive Directors. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services  
of the Company Secretary. 
Board meetings 
The Board convened formally on nine occasions during 
2013 and held a number of ad-hoc committee meetings, 
either face to face or telephonically, in which it considered 
non-routine business. In addition, the Chairman and the 
other Non-executive Directors met routinely on their own 
without the Executive Directors present, and, at least once 
during the year the Non-executive Directors met without 
the Chairman being present to discuss matters such as  
the Chairman’s performance. 
The Board used one of its meetings in 2013 specifically to 
consider and review the Company’s strategy and its 
implementation, and its future prospects and has used 
subsequent meetings to review additional areas of the 
Group’s strategy.  52   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
In addition to the three Board Committees there are a 
number of executive management committees which 
have been established to consider various issues involved 
in the day-to-day operational management of the 
Company, and matters for recommendation to the Board 
and its Committees.
Membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees  
is composed of the independent Non-executive Directors. 
The Board also delegates specific responsibilities to its 
Finance and Share Schemes Committees.

BOARD EFFECTIVENESS 
How do we get the best out of our Board?
The Board seeks to ensure that both it and its Committees 
have the appropriate range of skills, experience, 
knowledge and independence to enable them to 
discharge their respective duties and responsibilities 
effectively. Alent is privileged to have a Board of Directors 
with such international business backgrounds and a range 
of diverse skills, experience and nationalities. This diversity 
has been invaluable in developing the Company’s 
business strategy and enables such a global 
manufacturing business to be effectively governed. 
The Board considers its size to be appropriate for the 
requirements of the business. No one other than the 
respective Committee Chairmen and members of the 
Committees are entitled to be present at meetings of the 
Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees, but 
others may attend by invitation. 
The Board considers the majority of the Non-executive 
Directors to be independent of management and free 
from any business or other relationship which could affect 
the exercise of their independent judgment.
The Chairman satisfied the independence criteria on  
his appointment to the Board. Dr Emma FitzGerald,  
Noël Harwerth, Jan Oosterveld and Mark Williamson  
have been determined by the Board to be independent  
in character and judgment. Lars Förberg is not considered  
to be independent as he is managing partner of Cevian 
Capital which holds 21.94% of Alent’s issued ordinary  
share capital. 
Appointments to the Board and its Committees 
The Nominations Committee leads the process for Board 
appointments and makes recommendations to the Board. 
The Board through the Nominations Committee follows a 
formal, rigorous and transparent procedure based on 
objective criteria for the appointment of new Directors to the 
Board. The Committee considers any proposed recruitment 
in the context of the Company’s strategic priorities.  
Board appointments are made on merit. Non-executive 
appointees are required to demonstrate that they have 
sufficient time to devote to the role. The Nominations 
Committee is also responsible for reviewing the Board 
succession recognising the importance of recruiting 
Non-executive Directors with the necessary technical skills 
and knowledge relevant to the work of its Committees. 
Further information on the Nominations Committee is set  
out in the Nominations Committee Report on page 66.
Time commitment of the Chairman and  
Non-executive Directors 
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors each have  
a letter of appointment which sets out the terms and 
conditions of their directorship. An indication of the 
anticipated time commitment is provided in the recruitment 
role specification, and their letters of appointment provide 
details of the meetings that they are expected to attend, 
along with indicating the need to accommodate travelling 
time (particularly for overseas trips) and to set aside 
sufficient time to prepare for meetings and regularly to 
refresh and update their skills and knowledge. All Directors 
agree to commit sufficient time for the proper performance 
of their responsibilities and understand that this will vary 
from year to year depending on the Company’s activities. 
Directors are expected to attend all Board meetings and 
any additional meetings (including Committee meetings) 
as required. Directors’ other significant commitments are 
disclosed to the Board at the time of their appointment and 
they are required to notify the Board of any subsequent 
changes. The Company has reviewed the availability of the 
Non-executive Directors and considers that each of them is 
able to, and in practice does, devote the necessary 
amount of time to the Company’s business. 56   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
OUR INDUCTION PROGRAMME
Induction and training 
The Company Secretary is tasked with ensuring that a 
comprehensive induction programme is provided to all new 
Directors. This includes visits to manufacturing and other 
Company facilities, one to one meetings with key Company 
executives and wider management and introductions to  
the Company’s principal external advisers, as appropriate.  
For example, at its Board meetings in Providence RI and 
West Haven CT, the Non-executive Directors were given the 
opportunity to meet Alent’s wider US leadership group at 
both formal presentations and informal lunch and dinner 
events. Subsequently, after each site visit the Board or 
appropriate Committee has been briefed on the 
impressions gained by Directors attending the visit.
New Directors are advised of their legal and other duties 
and obligations as Directors of a listed company. 
Reference materials are provided, including information 
about the Board, its committees, Directors’ duties, 
procedures for dealing in the Company’s shares and other 
regulatory and governance matters. The Board’s learning  
is continued through Board and Committee briefings. 
The Chairman meets with Directors on an ongoing basis to 
review any training and development needs. In addition, 
the Directors are provided with details of seminars and 
training courses relevant to their role. They are encouraged 
to attend those they consider appropriate and are 
supported by the Company in so doing. Where a general 
training need is identified, in-house training will be provided 
to the entire Board. 
For example, before the start of the Board’s May meeting, 
the Company’s legal advisers led a bespoke training 
session addressing the duties and responsibilities of 
Directors of listed companies. Similarly, during the year, the 
Company’s external auditors presented a separate training 
session to advise Non-executive Directors of regulatory 
developments and statutory changes impacting their 
responsibilities and obligations.

Information 
The Board has in place processes to ensure that it is 
supplied in a timely manner with information of an 
appropriate quality to enable it to adequately discharge its 
duties. Papers are provided to the Directors in advance of 
the relevant Board or Committee meeting to enable them 
to make further enquiries about any matters prior to the 
meeting should they so wish. This also allows Directors  
who are unable to attend to submit views in advance  
of the meeting. 
The Company Secretary oversees the distribution of these 
papers and ensures that there is an appropriate level of 
communication between the Board and its Committees 
and between senior management and the Non-executive 
Directors. He also keeps the Board informed of relevant 
developments in corporate governance. The Chief 
Executive provides, as a matter of routine, a written update 
on important business issues between meetings and invites 
the views of the Directors on these. 
Support 
There is an agreed procedure in place to support Directors 
in the furtherance of their duties, to take independent legal 
advice if necessary, at the Company’s expense. 
EVALUATION OF BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
Performance evaluation 
The first annual Board review provided an opportunity to 
reflect on collective and individual effectiveness during  
the Board’s first year of working together. In accordance 
with the provisions of the Code, the Board of Alent plc 
undertook a formal and rigorous externally facilitated 
review of its own performance and effectiveness and 
assessed the performance of its Committees and 
individual Board members. The Chairman, assisted by  
the Company Secretary, led the evaluation process.  
The Senior Independent Director was responsible for the 
performance evaluation of the Chairman. 
As this was the Board’s first evaluation exercise, we took  
the view that the approach should take the form of a 
desk-based questionnaire, which could also be completed 
electronically. The Directors and the Company Secretary 
were asked their view on a range of subjects, including:
• the operation of the Board;
• Board administration
• strategy and performance;
• risk and governance; and
• individual Committee evaluation.
Within this framework the Board considered the balance  
of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the 
Company on the Board, its diversity, including gender,  
how the Board worked together as a unit and other factors 
relevant to its effectiveness.

How are we progressing?
It was clear from the Board review that good progress has 
been made against the actions the Board set itself last 
year. The Board successfully:
• engaged with institutional shareholders throughout  
the year;
• engaged with senior management and ensured via a 
number of site visits that the Board collectively understood 
the business and its markets and the environment in 
which it operates;
• ensured that the Company’s financial controls and risk 
management systems are robust and defensible; and
• reviewed the basis of executive remuneration, and 
produced a set of recommendations better to align  
the policy with Alent’s strategy (as set out on page 67  
of the Annual Report and Accounts).
Following the outcome of the Review, the Board has 
committed itself to a number of actions in 2014, including:
• continuing to challenge and effectively support the 
management team as we continue to evolve the strategy 
as set out on page 12;
• continuing to strive to make progress on planning the 
long-term framework for Board discussion, enabling more 
time for fuller debate on a range of strategic subjects;
• ensuring appropriate challenge and debate around  
risk and the approach to risk by reviewing the need for  
a Risk Committee;
• continuing to review the balance and the content of the 
Board papers and meeting agendas; and
• reviewing how we can continue to benefit from  
the extensive and diverse experience of our  
Non-executive Directors.
WHAT IS OUR APPROACH TO SHAREHOLDERS  
RE-APPOINTING DIRECTORS?
Re-election of Directors 
The Code recommends that all Directors of FTSE 350 
companies be subject to annual re-election by 
shareholders. All the Directors will therefore be offering 
themselves for re-election at this year’s AGM, with the 
biographical details of each of the Directors, including 
details of their other directorships and relevant skills and 
experience, set out on pages 46 to 47 . The Board believes 
that each of the Directors standing for re-election is 
effective and demonstrates commitment to their  
respective roles. Accordingly, the Board recommends that 
shareholders approve the resolutions to be proposed at 
the 2014 AGM relating to the re-election of the Directors. 
The current policy is for Non-executive Directors to serve  
on the Board for nine years, with review at the end of three 
and six years, subject to shareholder re-election, mutual 
agreement and annual performance evaluation. 
DO THE DIRECTORS HAVE DEEDS OF INDEMNITY?
Directors’ indemnities 
To the extent permitted by section 236 of the Companies 
Act 2006, the Directors have been granted Qualifying 
Third-Party Indemnity Provisions by the Company.  
The indemnities for Directors of Alent plc have been  
in force throughout the year. 
Directors’ conflicts of interest 
The Board has a formal system in place for Directors to 
review regularly their interests and to deal with situations 
where a Director reports any conflicts of interest. Any 
conflict situation reported to the Chairman and the 
Company Secretary is considered by the Board based on 
its particular facts. Any authorisations given to a Director 
who has a conflict situation are recorded in the Board 
minutes and in a register of Directors’ conflicts which is 
reviewed annually by the Board. The Board believes that 
the systems it has in place for reporting situational conflicts 
operates effectively.  58   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
ACCOUNTABILITY 
How does the Board formally satisfy itself that it has 
sound risk management and internal control systems?
The Audit Committee 
The membership of the Audit Committee is set out on page 
53. The Audit Committee Report, which summarises the 
terms of reference of the Audit Committee and describes 
its work in discharging its responsibilities, is set out on pages 
60 to 65. 
Financial and business reporting 
In its reporting to shareholders the Board recognises its 
responsibility to present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s position 
and prospects. The Strategic Report on pages 2 to 45 sets 
out explanations for the basis on which the Company 
generates or preserves value over the longer term and  
the strategy for delivering the objectives of the Company. 
Directors’ and Auditor’s Responsibility 
A statement of the Directors’ responsibility for preparing  
the Annual Report & Accounts is included on page 87 . 
A statement by the Auditor, KPMG LLP, setting out its 
reporting responsibilities, is included on page 88. 
Going concern 
The Directors consider that the Company has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future and accordingly, they have adopted  
a going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements of the Group and the Company. 
How does the Board identify Alent’s significant risks?
Risk management and assessment and internal  
control systems 
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment 
and maintenance of the Company’s system of risk 
management and internal control, and for reviewing  
its effectiveness. 
The Board’s process for identifying and evaluating Alent’s 
significant risks, its risk management and assessment system 
and its internal control system form part of the Audit 
Committee Report on pages 60 to 65. The Audit Committee 
assists the Board in reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Company’s system of internal control, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls, and risk 
management systems. 
The Company’s systems and controls are designed to 
provide the Directors with reasonable assurance that any 
problems are identified on a timely basis and are dealt  
with appropriately. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, the 
Directors confirm that they have reviewed the effectiveness 
of the Company’s system of internal control and that the 
necessary actions have been taken to remedy and control 
any control weaknesses identified during the year. 
Since the date of this review there have been no significant 
changes in internal controls or other matters which could 
significantly affect them. The key risks facing the Company 
are set out on pages 35 to 37 . 
During 2013, the Board further developed its procedures 
and embedded processes in respect of its Ethics, Health, 
Safety, Environmental and Sustainability activities.  
Current activities are described in the Corporate 
Responsibility Review, on pages 28 to 34. At Board level,  
the Chief Executive takes the lead on these matters. 
The Board reviews the role of insurance and other measures 
used in managing risks across the Company, receives 
regular reports on any major issues that have arisen during 
the year and makes an annual assessment of how the risks 
have changed over the period under review. 
The Board considers significant financing and investment 
decisions concerning the Company, including the giving 
of guarantees and indemnities, and monitors policy and 
control mechanisms for managing treasury risk. At the 
year-end, following the review by the Audit Committee of 
internal financial controls and of the processes covering 
other controls, the Board evaluates the results of the 
internal control and risk management procedures 
conducted by senior management. This includes a 
self-certification exercise by which senior financial and 
operational management throughout the Company certify 
the effectiveness of the system of internal controls within the 
businesses for which they are responsible, together with 
their compliance throughout the year with the Company’s 
policies and procedures. 
REMUNERATION
How do we decide what Directors are paid?
Executive compensation and risk 
All the independent Non-executive Directors serve on both 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees. They are 
therefore able to bring their experience and knowledge of 
the activities of each Committee to bear when considering 
the critical judgments of the other. This means that the 
Directors are in a position to consider carefully the impact 
of incentive arrangements on the Company’s risk profile 
and to ensure the Company’s remuneration policy and 
programme is structured so as to accord with the long-term 
objectives and risk appetite of the Company.

How does our Board engage with our shareholders  
and ensure that it is aware of shareholders views?
The Board believes that it is a priority to communicate  
with shareholders and uses various methods to reach as 
many shareholders as possible. There are programmes  
for the Chief Executive, Finance Director and the Head  
of Investor Relations to meet with the Company’s major 
institutional investors in the UK, the US and Continental 
Europe. The Board also seeks to ensure effective 
engagement with shareholders through the Company’s 
regular communications, the AGM, as well as through 
Capital Markets Days to provide the Company’s 
stakeholders with more detailed insight into the Company’s 
future strategy and investment proposition and other 
investor relations activities. 
In addition, the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
commenced, in the first quarter of 2014, meetings with key 
institutional shareholders and their representative bodies to 
discuss the proposals for the Company’s new remuneration 
policy, and further meetings will be held during the year.

The Company’s investor relations programme is managed 
by the Chief Executive and Finance Director, together with 
the Investor Relations Manager. The majority of meetings  
with investors are led by them, but the Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and other Directors are also available 
to meet with shareholders as appropriate. At these 
meetings, investors are offered the opportunity to meet with 
the Chairman or the Senior Independent Director, and 
indeed the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director 
held joint and separate meetings with several shareholders 
during the course of the year. 
The Company reports its financial results to shareholders 
twice a year, with the publication of its Annual and 
Half-Yearly Financial Reports and will issue two further 
trading updates each year with the publication of its 
Interim Management Statements. In conjunction with these 
announcements, presentations or teleconference calls  
will be held with institutional investors and stock market 
analysts. Recordings of these will be made available on  
the Company’s website www.alent.com along with copies 
of any presentation materials issued. 
Regular updates on shareholder issues and discussions  
are provided to the Board. Board members continue to 
receive copies of significant analysts’ notes issued on  
the Company. All Directors are expected to attend  
the Company’s AGM, providing shareholders with the 
opportunity to question them about issues relating to  
the Company, either during the meeting or informally. 
Annual General Meeting 
Communication with private shareholders is largely through 
the AGM, which is held at a central London location. 
Shareholders are given the opportunity to ask questions of 
the Board and the Chairman of each Board Committee 
during the AGM and to meet the Directors informally. 
Separate resolutions are proposed at the AGM on a poll for 
each item of business and shareholders are asked to vote 
“for”, “against” or “vote withheld” on each resolution. Votes 
are counted and an announcement confirming whether 
each resolution was passed at the AGM is made through 
the London Stock Exchange and can be viewed on the 
Alent website, together with a summary of the number of 
votes cast in respect of each resolution. The majority of 
shareholders have elected to access the Annual Report 
and other shareholder documents online via the Alent 
website rather than receiving a copy by post.

AUDIT COMMITTEE STATEMENT
Membership
The Committee comprises independent Non-executive 
Directors under my Chairmanship and meets at least four 
times during the year. The Board also considers that the 
Audit Committee members together possess the necessary 
commercial, financial and audit expertise to help them 
assess effectively the complex accounting, audit and risk 
issues they have to address. 
The Board considers that I have recent and relevant 
financial experience, as required by the Code.
Appointment on the Audit Committee is for a period of  
three years, extendable by no more than two additional 
three-year periods.
At my invitation, the non-independent Non-executive 
Director Lars Förberg, the Chairman of the Company, the 
Chief Executive, the Finance Director and the Company’s 
Auditor, KPMG LLP , regularly attend meetings. Other 
executives, including in particular the Group Financial 
Controller and the Head of Internal Audit, are invited to 
attend as and when appropriate. The Committee regularly 
meets separately with each of KPMG, the Finance Director 
and the Head of Internal Audit without others being present.
Key Objectives
The objectives of the Committee are:
• to provide effective governance over the appropriateness 
of the Group’s financial reporting including the adequacy 
of related disclosures, the performance of both the 
internal audit function and the external auditor, and the 
management of the Group’s systems of internal control, 
business risks and related compliance activities; and
• to monitor the integrity of financial reporting and  
to assist the Board in its review of the effectiveness  
of the Company’s internal controls and risk  
management systems.

Key Matters Considered by the Audit Committee  
in 2013
• review of the Company’s Half-Yearly and Annual  
Results Announcement/Annual Report and Accounts, 
respectively. In doing so, the Committee received  
reports from management on significant aspects of  
the Company’s financial statements, including matters 
requiring significant management judgment, asset 
impairment valuation, amounts reported at fair value, 
off-balance sheet items and contingent liabilities, and 
reports from the Auditor identifying any accounting or 
judgmental issues thereon requiring its attention;
• receipt of reports from the Head of Internal Audit 
covering, among other things, the work undertaken by 
the internal audit function and management responses 
to proposals made in the audit reports issued by the 
function during the year. The Committee also reviewed 
the results of an assessment which will be undertaken of 
the performance of the internal audit function and the 
Committee reviewed and approved the internal audit 
plan, submitted by the Head of Internal Audit; 
• reviewed periodically the Auditor’s control findings; 
• reviewed the results of an assessment undertaken of the 
performance of the Auditor, based upon feedback 
received from the Company’s corporate and divisional 
finance management; 
• reviewed and agreed the audit plan presented by  
the Auditor, which will detail the approach and scope  
of the work to be undertaken and the level of fees to  
be charged;
• reviewed the risk management process operated by 
management designed to identify the key risks facing 
each business and how those risks were being managed; 
• reviewed reports from management which address the 
appropriateness of the production of the Company 
financial statements on a going concern basis;
• reviewed the Company’s procedures for the 
identification, management and control of specific areas 
of risk which impact the Group and the Company; 
• as a matter of routine, the Audit Committee was 
presented with information on any significant litigation 
involving the Company; 
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal audit function; 
• monitoring and reviewing the Auditor’s independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness, taking into account 
professional and regulatory requirements; 
• making recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment and dismissal of the Auditor and approving 
the remuneration and terms of engagement of the 
Auditor; and 
• helping to strengthen the independent position of the 
Auditor by providing a direct channel of communication 
between it and the Non-executive Directors. 
Committee meetings
The Committee met five times during the year. The Audit 
Committee members comprise the independent Non-
executive Directors, other than the Board Chairman under 
my Chairmanship.
Main activities of the Committee during the year
The Committee assists the Board in carrying out its 
responsibilities in relation to financial reporting 
requirements, risk management and the assessment of 
internal controls. It also reviews the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal audit function and manages the 
Company’s relationship with the external Auditor.
As part of this process of working with the Board and  
to maximise effectiveness, meetings of the Committee 
generally take place just prior to a Company Board 
meeting. I report to the Board as part of a separate 
agenda item, on the activity of the Committee and matters 
of particular relevance to the Board in the conduct of their 
work. All members of the Board receive the agenda, papers 
and minutes of Audit Committee meetings.
Following the publication of the revised version of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, which applies to financial 
years commencing on or after 1 October 2012, the Board 
requested that the Committee advise them on whether we 
believe the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
The Audit Committee operates under formal terms of 
reference that are reviewed on a regular basis.  
These terms of reference, which are available on the 
Company’s website, www.alent.com, authorise the 
Committee to obtain outside legal or other independent 
professional advice at the cost of the Company and to 
secure the attendance at Audit Committee meetings of 
other parties with relevant experience and expertise  
should it be considered necessary. 
At its five meetings during the year, the Committee focused 
on financial reporting, risk management, external audit, 
governance and other matters, and internal audit and 
internal control systems. 62   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
Financial reporting
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial 
reporting is to review with both management and the 
external auditor the appropriateness of the half-year and 
annual financial statements concentrating on, amongst 
other matters:
• the quality and acceptability of accounting policies  
and practices;
• the clarity of the disclosures and compliance with 
financial reporting standards and relevant financial  
and governance reporting requirements;
• material areas in which significant judgments have  
been applied or there has been discussion with the 
external auditor;
• whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as  
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders  
to assess the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy; and
• any correspondence from regulators in relation to our 
financial reporting.
To aid our review, the Committee considers reports from the 
Group Finance Director, Group Financial Controller and also 
reports from the external auditor on the outcomes of its 
half-year review and annual audit. As a Committee we 
support KPMG LLP in displaying the necessary professional 
scepticism their role requires.
The primary areas of judgment considered by the 
Committee in relation to the 2013 accounts, and how  
these were addressed, were:
LITIGATION AND OTHER LIABILITY RESERVES
The Group has a small number of litigation and other liability 
provisions. The level of provisioning for liabilities for known 
and probable costs resulting from both legal and other 
regulatory requirements and the disclosure of contingent 
liabilities are issues where both management and legal 
judgments are important. The Committee addressed these 
issues by reviewing the background to the provisions, 
reviewing reports prepared and presented by the Group’s 
Vice President & General Counsel, discussing and 
challenging the key judgments with management in 
determining the value of provisions required, reviewing any 
regulatory laws or judgments, considering any legal advice 
that may have been received and taking into account the 
audit work performed by KPMG. The Committee enquired  
of management and the external Auditor as to the existence 
of other matters potentially requiring a provision to be made. 
After due consideration of these matters the Committee 
concluded that it is satisfied with the level of provisioning in 
the financial statements and the disclosures pertaining to 
contingent liabilities as shown in notes 30 and 33 in the 
Annual Report and Accounts.
TAXATION
The level of tax provisioning and the recognition of deferred 
tax assets in relation to unutilised tax losses, require 
assumptions and judgments from management.  
The Committee reviewed reports and received a 
presentation from the Group’s Director of Taxation highlighting 
the key tax risks that the Group faces, the tax strategy, the tax 
controls, the assumptions and judgments underpinning the 
level of tax provisioning and the recognition of deferred tax 
assets. The Committee also reviewed reports prepared by the 
external auditor on tax provisions, deferred tax and effective 
tax rates. In particular, the Committee reviewed and 
challenged management’s assumptions and judgments that 
sufficient future taxable income will be realised by the Group’s 
US operations, thereby supporting the recognition of a 
deferred tax asset in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts in 
relation to previously unrecognised tax losses in the US.  
The Committee is satisfied with both the level of tax provisions 
and the deferred tax assets recognised in the financial 
statements. The Committee is also satisfied with the 
presentation of the recognition of the US deferred tax asset  
as an exceptional tax item in the Group income statement  
as described in note 1 1 of the financial statements.
THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL AND PROPERTY,  
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Judgment is required to determine the extent to which 
goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance of 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGU”) over 
future periods. To assist in making this judgment, an 
assessment of the recoverable amount of each of the  
Group’s CGU’s is undertaken to support the carrying value  
of goodwill. The Committee reviewed the analyses prepared 
by management, including the assumptions underpinning 
the calculations and the sensitivity analysis on the available 
headroom. The Committee also considered the external 
auditor’s testing thereof, including the sensitivity of the 
outcome of impairment testing to the use of different discount 
rates. On the basis of the evidence reviewed, and given the 
recoverable amounts of each of the Group’s CGU’s being 
significantly higher than their carrying values, the Committee 
concluded that there was no impairment to goodwill.  
Details of the key assumptions and judgments used are set 
out in note 17 to the financial statements. In addition to 
goodwill, where specific indications of a potential impairment 
to the Group’s property, plant and equipment are present, 
calculations are prepared by management to support the 
carrying value of the asset in the Group balance sheet. 
During 2013, a small number of specific assets were reviewed 
with a potential indication of impairment. Again, after due 
challenge and debate the Committee concluded that no 
impairment of the Group’s property, plant and equipment 
was required.
DISCLOSURE OF EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
As detailed in note 2.6 of the financial statements, items of an 
exceptional nature are disclosed separately on the face of 
the Group’s income statement. Management consider both 
materiality and the nature and function of the item in 
deciding whether an item warrants such exceptional 
disclosure. The Committee review the disclosure of 
exceptional items in the financial statements on an individual 
basis to establish that all such items fall within the Group’s 
policy for reporting exceptional items as previously agreed by 
the Committee and approved by the Company’s auditor. In 
particular, the Committee considered the presentation of 
each exceptional item as detailed in notes 8 and 1 1 of the

financial statements. These included both restructuring  
and taxation exceptional items. After due challenge and 
debate, the Committee is satisfied that the presentation  
of exceptional items in the financial statements is in 
accordance with the Group’s exceptional items policy, 
provides a fair, balanced and understandable position and 
provides the information necessary for users to assess the 
Company’s performance on a consistent, continuing basis.
Risk management and assessment and internal  
control systems 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls, 
and risk management systems.
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment 
and maintenance of the Company’s system of risk 
management and internal control, and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. This system is designed to manage, rather 
than eliminate, the risks facing the Company and safeguard 
assets. No system of internal control can provide absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The 
Company’s system is designed to provide the Directors with 
reasonable assurance that any problems are identified on a 
timely basis and are dealt with appropriately. In accordance 
with the provisions of the UK Code, the Directors confirm that 
they have reviewed the effectiveness of the Company’s 
system of internal control and that the necessary actions 
have been taken to remedy and control any control 
weaknesses identified during the year. Since the date of this 
review there have been no significant changes in internal 
controls or other matters which could significantly affect 
them. The key risks facing the Company are set out on 
pages 36 to 37 . 
There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing any significant risks faced by Alent. Company 
management operates a risk management process 
designed to identify the key risks facing each business and 
reports to the Board on how those risks are being managed. 
As a basis for this report, each of the Company’s major 
business units produces a “risk map” which identifies their 
key risks and assesses the likelihood of those risks occurring, 
their impact if they do occur and the actions being taken to 
manage those risks to a desired level. The Board has 
enhanced its risk management structure and processes 
during 2013 as well as its procedures, and embedded 
processes in respect of its Ethics, Health, Safety, 
Environmental and Sustainability activities. Current activities 
are described in the Corporate Responsibility Review, on 
pages 28 to 34. At Board level, the Chief Executive currently 
takes the lead on these matters. 
The Board reviews the role of insurance and other measures 
used in managing risks across the Company and receives 
regular reports on any major issues that have arisen during 
the year and makes an annual assessment of how the risks 
have changed over the period under review. 
The key features of the Company’s system of internal  
controls include: 
Strategy and financial reporting 
The Company operates a comprehensive strategic 
planning and forecasting process, with an annual budget 
approved by the Board. Monthly operating financial 
information is reported against this budget and key  
trends and variances analysed. Action is then taken  
as appropriate. 
Company accounting policies and procedures are 
formulated and disseminated to all Company operations, 
covering the application of accounting standards and the 
maintenance of accounting records and key financial 
control procedures. 
Operational controls 
Each operating company, including the Divisional  
and Corporate offices, maintains internal controls and 
procedures appropriate to its structure and business 
environment, whilst complying with Company  
policies on items such as the authorisation of capital  
expenditure, treasury transactions and the management 
of intellectual property. 
In addition, the Company’s financial reporting process, 
including the preparation of the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements, incorporates the dissemination and 
use of common accounting policies and procedures and 
financial reporting software.
The Board considers significant financing and investment 
decisions concerning the Company, including the giving 
of guarantees and indemnities, and monitors policy and 
control mechanisms for managing treasury risk. 
Reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls 
The internal control system is monitored and supported by 
the Company’s internal audit function. This function assists 
management and the Board in the effective discharge of 
their responsibility for internal control by conducting reviews 
of Alent’s businesses and reporting objectively both on  
the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal 
control in place and as to whether those businesses are  
in compliance with applicable Company policies and 
procedures. The Audit Committee receives reports from  
the Head of Internal Audit on a regular basis and reports  
to the Board on the results of its review.  64   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
As part of the Board’s process for reviewing the effectiveness of 
the system of internal control, it delegates the following matters 
to the Audit Committee to be carried out during the year: 
• review of external and internal audit work plans; 
• consideration of reports from management, internal audit 
and external audit on the system of internal control and 
any significant control weaknesses; and 
• discussions with management on the actions taken on 
problem areas identified by Board members, in internal 
audit reports or in external audit management letters. 
At the year-end, following the review by the Audit Committee 
of internal financial controls and of the processes covering 
other controls, the Board evaluates the results of the internal 
control and risk management procedures conducted by 
senior management. This includes a self-certification 
exercise by which senior financial and operational 
management throughout the Company certifies the 
effectiveness of the system of internal controls within the 
businesses for which they are responsible, together with their 
compliance throughout the year with the Company’s 
policies and procedures. 
Internal audit 
The Company’s internal audit function operates on a 
global basis. The Head of Internal Audit is responsible for 
developing the function, within the framework of common 
Company policies and standards, and for carrying out 
assignments in accordance with an annual audit plan 
approved by the Audit Committee. In 2013, 24 internal audit 
assignments were undertaken covering approximately  
30%, of the applicable businesses as required by the Audit 
Charter. The Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the 
Audit Committee Chairman with functional responsibility to 
the Finance Director. The Audit Committee receives reports 
from the Head of Internal Audit and reports to the Board on 
the results of its review.
External Audit
APPOINTMENT OF AUDITOR 
The Audit Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of the Auditor. 
In undertaking this duty, the Committee takes into 
consideration a number of factors concerning the Auditor 
and the Company’s current activity, including: 
• the quality both of reports provided by the Auditor to the 
Audit Committee and the Board, and of advice given; 
• the level of understanding demonstrated of the 
Company’s businesses; 
• the independence of the Auditor, in light of the provision 
of non-audit services; 
• the objectivity of the Auditor’s views on the controls 
throughout the Company; 
• its ability to coordinate a global audit, working  
to tight deadlines; 
• the cost-competitiveness of the Auditor in relation to the 
audit costs of comparable UK companies; 
• the tenure of the incumbent Auditor; and 
• the periodic rotation of the senior audit management 
assigned to the audit of the Company. 
In addition, the Audit Committee considers external reviews 
of the performance and quality of the Auditor, including: 
• the Annual Report issued by the Audit Inspection Unit of the 
Financial Reporting Council on the work of the Auditor; 
• the Auditor’s own annual Transparency Report; and
• evaluations of the effectiveness of the external  
audit process.
KPMG LLP has been the Company’s Auditor since the 
demerger from Cookson plc on the 19 December 2012.  
The Company is following the finalisation of draft EU 
legislation and implementation of the decisions of the UK 
Competition Commission in relation to auditor tenure in 
order to ensure our compliance with these requirements as 
they become clear, as well as the current Code requirement 
to put the external audit contract out to tender at least every 
ten years. The Audit Committee is recommending the 
Auditor for reappointment at the AGM in 2014. 
The terms on which the Auditor is engaged do not include 
any contractual obligations which would prevent the 
Directors appointing a different audit firm should this be 
considered appropriate. 
INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY OF AUDITOR 
The Audit Committee is cognisant of the need to ensure  
that the independence and objectivity of the Auditor is 
continually maintained. It has put in place safeguards to 
ensure that the independence of the external Auditor is  
not compromised. These safeguards include: 
• seeking ongoing confirmation that the Auditor is 
independent of the Company in its own professional 
judgment; and 
• considering all the relationships between the Auditor and 
the Company, including those relating to the provision of 
non-audit services and whether these impair, or appear 
to impair, the Auditor’s judgment or independence.

NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The Audit Committee monitors the other services being 
provided to the Company by the Auditor. The Company 
has a policy governing the Company-wide conduct of 
non-audit work by the Auditor to ensure that this does not 
impair its independence or objectivity. The Auditor is 
prohibited from performing services where it: 
• may be required to audit its own work; 
• would participate in activities that would normally be 
undertaken by management; 
• is remunerated through a “success fee” structure; or 
• acts in an advocacy role for the Company. 
The policy sets out the categories of work that the Auditor is 
prohibited from undertaking. Other than these, the Company 
does not impose an automatic prohibition on the Auditor 
undertaking non-audit work. The Auditor is eligible for 
selection to provide non-audit services that are not, or are  
not perceived to be, in conflict with Auditor independence, 
provided it has the skill, competence and integrity to carry  
out the work in the best interests of the Company. 
Recruitment to the Company of any new employee who 
had been employed by the Auditor in the past five years 
requires the approval of the Audit Committee. 
Proposals for any non-audit related fees which the 
Company is intending to pay to the Auditor are presented to 
the Audit Committee. Any individual assignment where the 
fee is likely to be in excess of £30,000 must be pre-approved 
by the Audit Committee. Where appropriate, services are 
tendered prior to awarding work to the Auditor. Details of the 
amounts paid to the Auditor during the year for audit and 
other services are set out in note 7 on page 103. 
Committee evaluation
The Committee conducts a formal review of its effectiveness 
annually and concluded that its performance was effective. 
Details of the Board and Committee evaluation process can 
be found on page 56.
Employee helpline 
This is an independent and confidential service through 
which employees worldwide may register any concerns 
about any incorrect or irregular practices they perceive in 
Alent’s workplaces. The helpline is operated 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week, by an organisation that specialises in 
the provision of such services. It can be contacted by 
phone, email or via a designated website. Translation 
facilities are available for those for whom English is not their 
first or preferred language. 
Approach to anti-bribery and corruption training 
The Alent Code and its policies on anti-bribery and 
corruption require that employees and others working on 
behalf of the Company do not engage in any form of 
bribery or corruption. 
Our anti-bribery and corruption compliance programme 
has been implemented globally via an e-learning training 
module. New employees, as relevant, are required  
to complete the e-learning training as part of their  
induction process. 
The compliance programme includes undertaking risk 
assessments and engaging with others working on behalf 
of the Company to ensure that their standards comply with 
the Company’s policies. 
The Alent Code is reproduced in full on the Group’s website

Jan Oosterveld 
Mark Williamson 
The Remuneration Committee members are the 
Independent Non-executive Directors excluding the Board 
Chairman. The Committee’s principal roles are to set the 
appropriate remuneration for the Chairman, the Executive 
Directors and the Company Secretary, and to monitor the 
levels and structure of remuneration below Board level. 
Further details of the Remuneration Committee and its 
activities are provided in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 67 to 84. The Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee reports the outcome of Committee meetings  
to the Board. 
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT 
Members 
Peter Hill (Committee Chairman) and the  
Non-executive Directors. 
The Nominations Committee advises the Board on 
appointments to, and retirements and resignations from,  
the Board, and reviews the Company’s succession plans. 
The members of the Nominations Committee are the 
Chairman, and the Non-executive Directors. The Committee 
meets as and when required and is chaired by the 
Chairman or a Non-executive Director. The Chairman  
would not act as Chairman of the Nominations Committee 
where it was dealing with the appointment of his successor. 
Formal meetings will be held to consider standing items of 
business; there is also expected to be a significant level of 
ad-hoc discussion between members of the Nominations 
Committee, particularly when a recruitment exercise  
is taking place. 
When considering the appointment of new Directors, the 
Nominations Committee draws up a specification, taking 
into consideration the diversity of the Board, the balance  
of skills, knowledge and experience, the independence  
of Board members and the ongoing requirements of the 
Company. The Nominations Committee’s foremost priority 
will be to ensure that the Company has the best possible 
leadership. Its prime responsibility is to ensure the strength 
of the Board. Board appointments will be made on merit 
against objective criteria, selecting the best candidate  
for the post. 
The Nominations Committee utilises, where appropriate, 
the services of executive search firms to identify 
appropriate candidates and will only use those firms that 
have adopted the Voluntary Code of Conduct addressing 
gender diversity and best practice in search assignments. 
Wherever possible, the Nominations Committee will 
arrange for all Directors to meet with the preferred 
candidate. The Nominations Committee makes 
recommendations for each appointment to the full Board. 
Care is taken to ensure that all proposed appointees have 
sufficient time available to devote to the role and do not 
have any conflicts of interest. 
The Nominations Committee reviews the Company’s 
succession plans for members of the Board. The Board as  
a whole also considers this subject. Both of Alent’s divisions 
submit detailed succession plans in respect of senior 
divisional executives to the Board for review each year.  
The Board also considers succession planning for senior 
corporate executives. 
The Nominations Committee also considers diversity 
generally across the Company. It is the Company’s aim to 
maintain an appropriate level of diversity on the Board to 
reflect the diverse nature of the Company’s operations, 
and to increase the level of diversity in executive 
management below Board level. 
The Board fully supports the recommendations of the 
Davies Report entitled “Women on Boards”. 
The Board actively seeks to meet with key executives 
throughout the Company so as to gain a greater 
understanding of the breadth and depth of management 
talent. This enables members of the Committee to adopt  
a more informed approach to succession planning. 
The Chairman of the Nominations Committee reports  
the outcome of Nominations Committee meetings to  
the Board.

REMUNERATION 
REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s 
report on Directors’ remuneration for 2013. In this Annual 
Statement, which precedes our Policy Report and Annual 
Report on Remuneration, I have set out the context for the 
remuneration decisions, and the outcome of our review of 
remuneration which was completed in 2013. 
Remuneration decisions
The key decisions on Executive Director Remuneration 
proposed in 2013 related to salary increases for 2014 and 
payments of variable remuneration. With regard to the 
former, the Committee decided to increase salaries for the 
Executive Directors by 2.5% which was in line with the 2.5% 
increase to base salary for the general workforce. As for 
variable remuneration, no payments are to be made to 
Executive Directors based on performance in 2013. This is 
largely a result of overall trading for 2013 being slightly below 
our expectations due to the softer than anticipated demand 
in consumer electronics end-markets which resulted in Alent 
failing to hit its budgeted profit targets.
The Committee also approved awards to be made to the 
Executive Directors under the Alent Share Plan. These awards 
will vest in 2016 subject to the satisfaction of EPS growth 
targets and a relative TSR performance condition.
Alent’s incentive arrangements were established prior to  
the demerger of Alent from Cookson Group plc and were 
not designed specifically for Alent. As a result, in the 2012 
Alent report on remuneration, the Committee highlighted  
its intent to review executive remuneration including  
annual and long-term incentive compensation to ensure 
that remuneration is appropriately aligned with Alent 
shareholders, market practice and Alent strategy. This review 
is now complete, and the key findings under the “Proposed 
Changes for 2014” section of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report (DRR) relating to the annual bonus plan are noted  
as follows.
Summary of 2013 annual bonus arrangements
The 2013 annual bonus outcome is determined by 
performance against an annual EPS target. This outcome is 
then modified up or down by up to 10% based on working 
capital performance. There is no deferral of bonus 
payments into shares. The bonus outcomes for the 
achievement of Threshold, Target and Maximum 
performance targets for 2013 are set out below:
Performance 
target for 2013
Bonus outcome
1
CEO
(% of salary)
FD
(% of salary)
Threshold 0% 0%
Target 62.5% 50%
Maximum 125% 100%
1.  Note that bonus payouts between different performance levels 
are determined on a linear basis
The review identified that the 2013 and prior annual bonus 
performance ranges between threshold and maximum 
had been too narrow which resulted in “all or nothing” 
bonus outcomes and a perception that the bonus  
failed to reward years of particularly strong performance.  
With regard to performance measures, the review 
highlighted the opportunity to increase both the 
motivational effect of the annual bonus and the alignment 
of the plan with corporate strategy by including other 
performance measures which could drive the delivery  
of Alent strategy.
Proposed changes for 2014
The Committee is proposing the following changes for 2014 
in order to incentivise and reward strong performance, 
align the annual incentive closer to Alent strategy, and 
increase shareholder alignment. 
Change 1: Introduce a “superior” performance target 
and increase bonus maximum
Increasing the top end of the performance range with  
the introduction of superior performance targets and 
increasing the maximum bonus opportunity will make the 
annual bonus outcomes less “all or nothing” whilst ensuring 
that the additional bonus opportunity is only payable for 
the achievement of challenging targets. For both the Chief 
Executive and Finance Director it is proposed to increase 
the maximum bonus opportunity to 150% and 125% of base 
salary respectively.
Change 2: Introduce deferral into Alent shares, to be 
held for three years, of half of any bonus above target 
opportunity (see table below for detail)
Introducing bonus deferral will increase the alignment of 
executive and shareholder interests, increase the retention 
value and period of the annual bonus, and ensure that the 
payment of any extra bonus opportunity is only for the 
delivery of sustained long-term performance. Awards of 
Alent shares will be made under the existing Share Plan.
Change 3: Modest increase to target bonus (see table 
below for detail)
Modest increases to target bonus opportunities will help 
address the below market positioning of target bonus and 
also help address the reduction in cash compensation 
resulting from the introduction of deferral. 
Change 4: Introduction of additional performance 
measures to the annual bonus
To help drive Alent strategy, it is proposed to incorporate 
additional performance measures in the annual bonus.  
It is intended that the relative weightings of these measures 
could be changed from year to year to reflect changes in 
Alent strategy. The proposed measures and weightings for 
2014 are set out below and reflect the continued focus on 
EPS and return on NSV margin:
• Adjusted EPS targets (50% of opportunity)
• Return on NSV Margin (30%)
• Personal/Strategic Objectives (20%) 68   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
A summary of the combined effect of these changes on 
the bonus payable for different levels of performance is set  
out below:

Above Superior 125% 150% 100% 125%
1. Note that bonus payouts between different performance levels 
are determined on a linear basis.
Conclusion
We propose to introduce these changes for the 2014 
financial year. The other elements of Executive Director 
Remuneration, including the Alent Share Plan, are 
expected to remain broadly unchanged from current 
practice. We believe our proposals are balanced and fair, 
will help to incentivise the delivery of Alent strategy and 
support success for Alent and its shareholders.
Futhermore, the Company is committed to open and 
transparent dialogue with its shareholders on remuneration 
as well as other governance matters. As a matter of course 
the Remuneration Committee will continue to consult with 
key institutional shareholders and various representative 
bodies about the pay and incentive arrangements of the 
Company’s Executive Directors. We look forward to a 
continuing dialogue on both the Alent business, and what 
we need to do in respect of overall remuneration practices 
for our Executive Directors and the Company as a whole.
I hope you have found this Annual Statement helpful, and 
will be able to support the Remuneration Policy Report  
and Annual Report on Remuneration at this year’s Annual 
General Meeting.
Yours sincerely,
NOËL HARWERTH

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The following Remuneration Policy Report summarises the Remuneration Committee’s policy for the remuneration of 
Executive Directors which will operate from 1 January 2014 and, if approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting, will become formally effective at the 2014 AGM.
Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy Table
All the elements of Executive Directors’ remuneration (both fixed and variable) which comprises of base salary, annual 
bonus, deferred awards, long-term share incentives and retirement benefits (pension) are outlined in the following table:
Element of 
Remuneration Link to Strategy Operation Opportunity Performance Metrics
Base salary Helps to recruit and  
retain. Reflects the 
individual’s experience, 
role and contribution 
within the Company.
Paid in cash.
Normally reviewed  
by the Remuneration 
Committee annually  
and any increases  
effective from 1 January. 
No prescribed maximum 
annual increase.
However, merit increases 
align to group increases 
and those for the  
wider workforce  
except in exceptional 
circumstances.
n/a
Benefits Helps to recruit  
and retain.
Executive Directors  
are eligible to receive 
certain benefits in kind.
These principally  
comprise company  
car allowances, life 
assurance and  
medical insurance.
Provision of relocation 
assistance upon 
appointment if/when 
applicable.
n/a
Annual Incentive Incentivises Executive 
Directors to achieve 
specific, pre-defined 
annual targets.
Half of any bonus  
above target is deferred  
in shares for three years. 
The remainder is paid  
in cash.
Subject to clawback.
150% of base salary  
(70% at Target) for the  
Chief Executive.
125% of base salary  
(55% at Target) for the 
Finance Director.
At least 70% of the award  
is based on financial 
measures such as EPS.
The remainder is based  
on personal / strategic 
measures of performance.
For each individual bonus 
element, achievement of 
the threshold performance 
target delivers no payment 
for that element.
Alent Share Plan Flexible “umbrella plan” 
designed to align 
Executive Directors’ 
interests with those of 
shareholders and  
aid retention of Executive 
Directors over a three-year 
performance period.
Awards are generally 
made annually.
Awards can be made  
as performance shares, 
market-priced options,  
or a combination of both.
Awards vest at least three 
years after their award 
date subject to the 
achievement of specified 
performance conditions.
For performance shares, 
the Remuneration 
Committee has the 
discretion to award 
participants cash or 
additional shares equal  
in value to the dividends 
accrued on any shares 
that vest.
Subject to clawback.
Maximum face value of  
an award is: 
–  200% of base salary for 
performance shares; or
–  300% of base salary for 
market-priced options.
If a combination of 
performance shares  
and market-price options  
is awarded then the 
commercial value of the 
mixed grant cannot be 
higher than the 
commercial value  
that could have been 
awarded under a  
single grant.
Vesting of awards is  
based on: 
(i)  the Company’s TSR 
performance versus a 
peer group selected by 
the Committee.
(ii)  internal financial 
measures as selected  
by the Committee, such 
as EPS.
At least 50% of any award 
will always be based on 
internal financial measures.
Prior to any vesting the 
Remuneration Committee 
has also stipulated that,  
as an additional hurdle, it 
needs to be satisfied that 
vesting has been justified  
by the underlying financial 
performance of the 
Company over the 
performance period.
Retirement Benefits Helps to recruit and retain 
key employees.
Ensures income 
in retirement.
Retirement benefits are 
provided by way of an 
allowance which can be 
delivered in cash or as a 
payment to a defined 
contribution arrangement.

Shareholding guideline
The Remuneration Committee encourages Executive Directors to build and hold a shareholding in the Company 
equivalent in value to at least one times gross base salary. For new Executive Directors, the target is to achieve this  
within a four-year period.
Difference between remuneration policy for executive directors and other employees
The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration across Alent when setting remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors and the same principles apply to all employees when determining salary increases. In addition, the Annual 
Incentive and Alent Share Plan are operated for employees who are not Executive Directors. The key difference in  
policy is that variable remuneration represents a greater proportion of Executive Directors’ total package than it  
does for other employees.
Choice of performance measures and target setting
For the Annual Incentive and Alent Share Plan, our policy is to choose performance measures which help drive and 
reward the achievement of Alent strategy, and also provide alignment between employees and shareholders. Further 
detail on performance measures and targets is disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Non-executive Directors Remuneration Policy Table
The following table outlines the remuneration policy for Non-executive Directors of Alent:
Element of 
Remuneration Link to Strategy Operation Opportunity Performance Metrics
Base Fees Reflects the individual’s

The Board sets the 
remuneration of the

of each Director and  
the practice of other 
companies. The Non-
executive Directors do  
not participate in Board 
discussions on their  
own remuneration.

n/a
Clawback Arrangements
Variable remuneration paid to Executive Directors is subject to clawback arrangements in the event that a misstatement 
is identified in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. When a misstatement is identified by the Remuneration 
Committee which requires the restatement of a prior year’s accounts in order to ensure compliance with the requirements 
of International Financial Reporting Standards or any applicable law, then such portion as the Remuneration Committee 
deems appropriate of any variable remuneration paid to Executive Directors (including from both the Annual Incentive 
and the Alent Share Plan and on an after-tax basis) resulting from a measure of financial performance affected by the 
misstatement will be subject to clawback provisions.
External Appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold positions as Non-executive Directors of other companies provided that these 
do not lead to conflicts of interest. The Board sanctions each such request on a case-by-case basis. Fees received are 
retained by the Executive Director concerned. 
Policy on Service Contracts and Letters of Appointment
Our policy is to offer service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of between six to 12 months.  
Service contracts do not contain any change of control provisions. In the event of termination upon notice by either  
the Company or an Executive Director, the Company has the option of making a payment in lieu of any notice due,  
a significant part of which is subject to offset against subsequent income earned by the Executive Director.
For the Chairman, appointment is terminable on six months’ notice. All other Non-executive Directors’ appointments are 
terminable on three months’ notice on either side. All Non-executive Directors are subject to retirement, and election or 
re-election, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and now stand for re-election annually. STRATEGIC

Exit Payment Policy
This Exit Payment Policy sets out the framework on how 
termination payments will be calculated for each element 
of Directors’ remuneration together with the policy on the 
setting of notice periods.
An Executive Director’s appointment is terminable by the 
Company on not less than 12 months’ written notice, and by 
the Executive on not less than six months’ written notice. In the 
case of termination, the Company can choose to make a 
payment in lieu of notice for part or all of the notice period. 
Any such payment in lieu will be no greater than base salary, 
pension contributions and the value of benefits to which the 
Director would have been entitled for the duration of the 
remaining notice period, net of statutory deductions in each 
case. Half of this payment will be made in a lump sum, the 
remainder in six equal monthly installments. If the Director  
finds a role paying equivalent or better base salary or fees,  
no further installments shall be payable, and the value of  
any lesser new base salary or fees shall be deducted from 
any further instalments.
Executives have no contractual right to an annual bonus 
award. However, if the Committee determines that an 
annual bonus should be payable after an executive has 
served notice, then annual bonus payments will be 
pro-rated for time served during the year and paid after 
the completion of the termination year’s performance 
period as aligned to plan guidelines.
Under the rules of the Alent Share Plan, awards will lapse  
in full unless specified “good leaver” circumstances apply.  
These circumstances include:
• retirement;
• ill health;
• injury or disability;
• redundancy;
• death;
• employment with a company which ceases to be  
a Group member or relating to a business or part  
of a business which is transferred to a person who  
is not a group member; and
• any other reason as the Committee decides.
Where the Committee exercises its discretion to treat an 
Executive Director as a good leaver it will take into account the 
individual’s performance and the reasons for their departure.
Good leavers’ awards of performance shares or market-
priced options made under the Alent Share Plan normally 
vest at the usual time unless the Committee determines 
that they should vest earlier. However, they are always 
subject to the achievement of any performance criteria. 
Good leavers’ awards of deferred shares relating to the 
Annual Incentive will vest on the date of termination since 
there are no performance conditions needed to be met.  
In addition, awards normally will be pro-rated to reflect the 
time employed from the award date unless, under normal 
circumstances, the Committee determines otherwise. 
In addition, no contractual arrangements have been 
made prior to the coming into effect of the regulations  
that could impact on the quantum of Directors’  
termination payments. 
The Non-executive Directors are not entitled to receive 
compensation for loss of office at any time. The Chairman 
is entitled to six month’s notice.
Policy on Recruitment Remuneration
The Company will follow the principle that the 
remuneration package for a new Director would be set in 
accordance with the terms of the approved remuneration 
policy in force at the time of appointment. This means that 
the maximum level of variable remuneration (such as 
bonus and long-term incentive awards) would be in line 
with the maximums set out in the policy table in force at  
the time of appointment. Currently these maximums are:
• Annual Incentive: 150% of base salary.
•  Alent Share Plan: 200% of base salary for performance 
shares; or 300% of base salary for market-priced options.
However, the Committee may offer additional cash  
and/or share-based elements to “buy out” remuneration 
lost when leaving a former employer. These elements of 
remuneration, including awards made under Listing Rule 
9.4.2 R, will only be offered when the Committee considers 
them to be in the best interests of the Company and, 
therefore, shareholders. Any such “buy out” payments 
would be based solely on remuneration lost when leaving 
the former employer and would reflect (as far as 
practicable) the delivery mechanism (i.e. cash, shares, 
options), time horizons and performance requirements 
attaching to that remuneration. Shareholders will be 
informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. 
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay 
element awarded in respect of the prior role may be 
allowed to pay out according to its terms on grant, 
adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. 
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that 
they are put to shareholders for approval at the first AGM 
following their appointment.
Other aspects of our recruitment policy include:
• Where it is appropriate to offer a below-median salary  
to a new Executive Director, a series of increases to the 
desired salary positioning may be given over the 
proceeding few years subject to individual performance 
and experience in role.
• Different performance measures may be set initially for 
the annual bonus, taking into account the responsibilities 
of the individual, and the point in the financial year that 
they joined.
• A new Director may receive fees for professional advice 
as appropriate.
• A new Director may receive relocation assistance as stated 
in the Executive Directors Remuneration Policy Table. 72   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

Assumptions made for each scenario are as follows:
• Minimum: latest known salary, benefits and pension as 
shown in the single figure table.
• Target: Minimum remuneration plus target annual bonus 
plus 25% vesting of awards under the Alent Share Plan. 
Assumes Alent Share Plan awards equal to 200% of salary 
for both the Chief Executive and Finance Director.
• Maximum: minimum remuneration plus maximum annual 
bonus plus 100% vesting of awards under the Alent Share 
Plan. Assumes Alent Share Plan awards equal to 200% of 
salary for both the Chief Executive and Finance Director.
Consideration of Group Employee Conditions
Although there is no formal consultation with employees in 
the company in drawing up Directors’ remuneration policy, 
the policy is aligned to the overall compensation guideline 
of driving high performance which is applicable to all Alent 
employees. There are no specified comparison metrics 
taken into account when determining Directors’ 
remuneration policy. 
Consideration of Shareholder Views
Alent is committed to open and transparent dialogue  
with its shareholders on remuneration as well as other 
governance matters. All views expressed by Alent’s 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting or during  
the reported financial year are taken into account by  
the Committee when making decisions relating to the 
Directors’ remuneration policy. In relation to any changes 
to the Directors’ remuneration policy, the Committee will 
typically consult with shareholders before such changes 
are submitted for shareholder approval so that shareholder 
views can be taken into account.
In normal circumstances, we expect to submit the 
Directors’ remuneration policy once every three years. 
However, Alent will include the policy section on an annual 
basis to provide consistency and make cross-referencing 
easier for the reader.  STRATEGIC

Key areas of discretion
Key areas of discretion in the application of our 
remuneration policy include, but are not limited to:
• The choice of financial performance measures in variable 
remuneration and the choice of performance targets for 
those measures;
• The choice of whether to pay an annual bonus to an 
Executive Director who is serving their notice period;
• Discretion in exceptional circumstances to amend 
previously set incentive targets or to adjust the proposed 
payout to ensure a fair and appropriate outcome;
• Certain decisions relating to the Alent Share Plan as set 
out in the plan rules regarding change of control and 
leaver provisions.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This section of the Directors’ remuneration report explains 
how the Directors’ remuneration policy as set out in the 
Remuneration Policy Report will be implemented in 2014, 
and how it has been implemented in 2013. 
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy in 2014
Remuneration in 2014 will be broadly the same  
as in 2013, but with some changes to the Annual  
Incentive arrangements.
Base Salary
The Committee has reviewed base salaries in line with 
policy and has decided that base salaries for the Executive 
Directors will be increased by 2.5% in line with the workforce 
general increase of 2.5%. This means that effective  
1 January 2014, the base salaries for Steve Corbett and 
David Egan will be £464,333 (converted from USD to GBP at 
a fixed exchange rate of 1.6556) and £317,750 respectively. 
NED fees
In 2013 the base Non-executive Director fee was £45,000 
and £165,000 for the Chairman. Additional fees to 
Committee Chairmen were £15,000, and additional  
fees for the Senior Independent Director were £5,000.  
The Committee reviewed the fee structure during the year 
and determined that the fees will remain at the same level.
Annual Incentive
The Annual Incentive (AI) performance measures will  
be changed in 2014 better to align the annual bonus 
opportunity with Alent’s strategy. Accordingly, while there 
will be continued focus on EPS targets for 2014 there will be 
an additional measure for the achievement of NSV margin. 
As a result, the performance measures along with the 
respective percentages that form the basis of an 
individual’s total AI target opportunity for 2014 will be:
• Adjusted EPS Targets (50% of total opportunity);
• Return on NSV Margin (30%) – Calculated as adjusted 
operating profit divided by net sales value;
• Personal Objectives (20%).
As set out in the Annual Statement and Policy Report,  
the maximum opportunity for the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director will be 150% and 125% of base salary, 
respectively. In addition, half of any bonus paid above 
target will be deferred in shares for three years to increase 
alignment between the long-term interests of executives 
and shareholders. 
Alent Share Plan awards 
The Committee intends to make grants of 200% of salary to 
each of the Executive Directors in 2014. The performance 
condition relating to these awards will be disclosed in next 
year’s annual report on remuneration.  74   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

ANNUAL INCENTIVE
In 2013 Annual Incentive payments for the Chief Executive and Finance Director were based on adjusted EPS and a 
Working Capital adjustor. As the adjusted EPS target was not achieved, no bonus was payable for performance over 
2013. Full disclosure of the bonus calculation is provided below:

The maximum bonus opportunities for the Chief Executive and Finance Director in 2013 were 125% of salary and 100% of 
salary respectively. As a result, the bonus outcome of 0% of maximum (as shown in the table above) resulted in a 
payment of 0% of salary for both the Chief Executive and Finance Director.
ALENT SHARE PLAN VESTING
Awards shown in the 2013 single figure represent the grants made to Executive Directors in 2011 under the Cookson 
Group plc (Cookson) LTIP for which the performance period ended on 31 December 2013. These awards were rolled 
over to become awards over Alent shares of equivalent value after the demerger and were due to vest in April 2014. 
The performance condition for these awards is measured over a three-year period, but by reference to Cookson 
performance up to the Demerger Effective Time and by reference to Alent performance thereafter to the end of the 
period. The awards continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the existing Cookson LTIP, save that the 
relevant company (and relevant remuneration committee) is Alent instead of Cookson.  76   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
Vesting of 50% of these awards is based on adjusted EPS growth, whilst the remaining 50% is based on TSR growth relative to a 
comparator group. As shown in the tables below, both of the targets were not achieved at the end of the performance period:

same vesting conditions based on the performance of Cookson up to the 18 December 2012.
The information in the above table is audited by the Company’s Auditor. Further detail on the performance conditions is 
set out below.
PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS RELATING TO AWARDS MADE UNDER THE ALENT SHARE PLAN
In the case of Alent Share Plan grants for which the performance period ends on 31 December 2014, these represent the 
grants made to Executive Directors in 2012 under the Cookson LTIP. These awards over Cookson shares were rolled over 
to become awards over Alent shares of equivalent value. Performance will still be measured over a three-year period, 
but by reference to Cookson performance up to the Demerger Effective Time and by reference to Alent performance 
thereafter to the end of the period. The awards continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the existing 
Cookson LTIP, save that the relevant company (and relevant remuneration committee) is Alent instead of Cookson.
The vesting of the awards, when originally granted, was based on Cookson’s performance against specified 
performance conditions measured over a three-year period. Vesting of 50% of shares awarded was based upon 
Cookson’s three-year TSR performance relative to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 250, excluding 
Investment Trusts, and 50% on EPS growth over the three-year period. The two measures operated independently.
The new Alent targets for measuring performance for the 2011 and 2012 Cookson LTIP awards, following the Demerger, 
have been determined as follows:
• As regards the EPS target, the Cookson headline EPS threshold and maximum vesting targets for the final year of the 
relevant three-year performance period have been split between Alent and Vesuvius by reference to their respective 
trading profit contributions to Cookson’s total 2012 trading profit such that the new Alent and Vesuvius targets 
aggregate to the currently disclosed Cookson targets. The respective Alent adjusted EPS values as reported for the final 
year of the three-year performance period will then be compared with these new threshold and maximum targets to 
determine the vesting outcome. STRATEGIC
REPORT
CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL

WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   79
• As regards the TSR target, Cookson’s TSR growth from the start of the relevant three-year performance period up to the 
time of the Demerger will be determined and added to the TSR growth of Alent from the Demerger date to the end  
of the three-year performance period. This aggregate TSR growth will then be ranked against the TSR of the relevant 
comparator group and the resulting vesting outcome will be calculated against the TSR performance schedule in  
the Cookson LTIP.

the Company on not less than 12 months’ written notice, and by Mr Egan on not less than six months’ written notice.  
Mr Egan is subject to certain non-compete and non-solicitation covenants for a period of 12 months following the 
termination of his employment. The agreement is governed by English law.
Neither of the Executive Directors’ contracts contains any change of control provisions. Both contracts give the 
Company the option, in the event of termination upon notice by either party, to make a payment in lieu of any notice 
due, a significant part of which is subject to offset against subsequent income earned by the relevant Executive Director.
No Director had any material interest in a contract of significance (other than service agreements) with the Company  
or any subsidiary company during the year.

Shareholding guidelines
As set out in the Policy Report, The Remuneration Committee encourages Executive Directors to build and hold a 
shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to at least one times gross base salary. For new Executive Directors, 
the target is to achieve this within a four-year period.
As at 31 December 2013, Steve Corbett held 132,392 shares in Alent and David Egan held 10,082 shares in Alent. Using 
the Company’s closing share price at 31 December 2013 of 355p, this represents 104% of base salary (gross, pre-tax) for 
Steve Corbett, and 12% of base salary (gross, pre-tax) for David Egan.

During 2013 NBS was paid a total of £80,915 for its services to the Committee as listed above, and CC was paid a total of 
£65,418 for its services to the Committee. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that advice received from its advisers 
is objective.

• salary review, annual and long-term incentive proposals for the Executive Directors and senior management;
• reviewing achievement against the performance targets, and approving payouts, in respect of the  
Annual Incentive;
• setting performance targets and approving the structure of the Annual Incentive arrangements;
• considering the Company’s performance against the performance conditions applicable to the Cookson awards 
rolled over into awards over Alent shares, and authorising the vesting of these awards where relevant;
• setting the performance conditions and authorising the grant of awards under the Alent Share Plan;
• receiving feedback on the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s meetings with key institutional shareholders 
regarding the Company’s remuneration policy and practice, and, in the light of this, advice received from the external 
advisers regarding trends in remuneration practice and governance, discussing the Company’s approach to 
executive remuneration and reviewing whether any changes should be made;
• reviewing the Remuneration Committee’s Terms of Reference, and recommending any amendments to  
the Board for approval;

Share Usage
Under the rules of the Plan the Company has the discretion to satisfy awards either by the transfer of existing shares or by 
the allotment of newly issued shares. The decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by the Board, which considers the 
most prudent and appropriate sourcing arrangement for the Company.
The Alent Share Plan complies with the current ABI guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all 
plans should not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the Company’s issued share capital, with a further 
limitation of 5% in any ten-year period on discretionary schemes.

policies contained in notes 25 of the consolidated financial 
statements, are each incorporated by reference into, and

by the Auditor about its reporting responsibilities can be 
found on pages 87 and 88 respectively. The Directors fulfil 
the responsibilities set out in their statement within the 
context of an overall control environment of central strategic 
direction and decentralised operating responsibility.
The following additional disclosures are made in 
compliance with the Companies Act 2006, the Disclosure

Governance Code 2010.
ACTIVITIES
Alent plc is a holding company. A list of its principal

2014 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The AGM of the Company will be held at 11.00 am on

London EC2M 2PP. 
The notice of the 2014 AGM is contained in the circular  
to shareholders accompanying this Annual Report, 
together with an explanation of resolutions to be 
considered at the meeting. 
GOING CONCERN 
The Directors have assessed the future funding requirements 
of the Group and the Company and compared it to the 
level of long-term debt and committed back facilities for the 
12 months from the date that the financial statements were 
approved. The assessment included a sensitivity analysis on 
the key factors which could affect future cash flow and 
funding requirements. Having undertaken this work the 
Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate 
resources to fund its operations for the foreseeable future 
and so determine that it is appropriate to prepare the 
accounts on a going concern basis.
DIVIDEND 
The Board is recommending a final dividend in respect of 
2013 of 5.71 pence per ordinary share which, if approved, 
will be paid on 19 June 2014 to shareholders on the register

PENSIONS
In each country in which the Group operates, the pension 
arrangements in place are considered to be consistent 
with good employment practice in that particular area. 
Independent advisers are used to ensure that the plans are 
operated in accordance with local legislation and the 
rules of each plan. Group policy prohibits direct investment 
of pension fund assets in the Company’s shares. Outside 
the UK and the US, the majority of pension plans in the 
Group are of a defined contribution nature. Current active 
employees in the UK are offered membership of a defined 
contribution plan, which is operated on a contract basis, 
with oversight by a governance committee.
All US retirement plan assets are held in trust for the 
exclusive benefit of plan participants and their 
beneficiaries. An independent financial institution acts as 
the Trustee. The trust assets are protected by law and by 
Federal Government Regulation and are subject to annual 
audit by an independent accountant, the Internal Revenue 
Service and the Department of Labor. Further details of 
pension arrangements are given in note 26.
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF DIRECTORS
The Directors shall not be fewer than five nor more than  
15 in number. The Company may, by ordinary resolution, 
from time to time vary the minimum number and/or 
maximum number of Directors. The Board may appoint  
any person to be a Director (so long as the total number  
of Directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in the 
Articles). Any such Director shall only hold office until the 
next AGM and shall then be eligible for election.
ESSENTIAL CONTRACTS AND CHANGE  
OF CONTROL DISCLOSURE
A small number of senior management employees within 
the Group are entitled to receive payments of up to 12 
months’ salary in the event that employment is terminated 
in certain circumstances within 12 months of a change  
of control of Alent. The Remuneration Committee has 
approved these arrangements as being in line with Alent’s 
wider Remuneration Policy, and no Director of Alent is 
entitled to any such payment.
The terms of the Group’s committed bank facility contain 
provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise 
termination or other rights in the event of a change of 
control on takeover of the Company. A number of other 
arrangements to which the Company and its subsidiaries 
are party, such as other debt arrangements and share 
incentive plans, may alter or terminate on a change of 
control in the event of a takeover. In the context of the 
Group as a whole, these other arrangements are not 
considered to be significant.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’
 RESP O NSI B I L ITY
The Directors of Alent plc are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Group and parent company  
(“the Company”) financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Company financial statements for each financial year.  
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards and applicable law (“UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice”). 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they  
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group  
and the Company and of their profit or loss for that period.  
In preparing each of the Group and the Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently; 
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; 
• for the Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Company financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Report that 
comply with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
DIRECTORS’ APPROACH 
The Board’s objective is to present a balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s position and 
prospects, particularly in the Annual Report, half-year report 
(formerly the interim report) and other published documents 
and reports to regulators. The Board has established an Audit 
Committee to assist with this obligation.
STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL 
REPORT AND FINANCIAL REPORT
As required by the Code, the Directors confirm that they 
consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performances, business model and strategy. When arriving  
at this position the Board was assisted by a number fo 
proccesses including the following:
• the Annual Report is drafted by appropriate  
senior management;
•  an extensive verification process is undertaken to ensure 
factual accuracy;
• comprehensive reviews of drafts of the Report are 
undertaken by members of the Executive and other  
senior management;
• an advanced draft is considered and reviewed by the 
Company’s legal advisers and brokers; and
•  the final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee prior  
to consideration by the Board.
STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES
Each of the Directors, as at the date of the Annual Report, 
whose names and functions are indicated below confirms  
that to the best of their knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
• the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 45 contained in the 
Annual Report for the year 2013 includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included  
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that  
they face.

 REPORT TO THE MEMBERS  
 OF ALENT PLC ONLY
OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM OUR AUDIT 
1. OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
IS UNMODIFIED 
We have audited the financial statements of Alent plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the 
Group income statement, the Group statement of 
comprehensive income, the Group statement of cash 
flows, the Group and parent company balance sheets,  
the Group statement of changes in equity and related 
notes. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit for the 
year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have  
been properly prepared in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF  
MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT 
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial 
statements the risks of material misstatement that had  
the greatest effect on our audit were as follows: 
RECOGNITION OF US DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (£6.1M) 
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee statement), page 97 
(accounting policies) and page 106 (financial disclosures) 
• The Risk: The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset 
in respect of unutilised operating losses arising in the US. 
In addition the Group has further very significant US 
losses for which no deferred tax assets have been 
recognised in these financial statements. The amount  
of deferred tax assets (if any) that it is appropriate to 
recognise in respect of losses is based on judgment in 
respect of the timing and quantum of forecast future 
profits and the ability of the Group’s US components to 
offset any of its accumulated losses against these 
expected profits. The risk is that the amount of the 
deferred tax asset is over or understated. 
• Our Response: In this area, our audit procedures 
included, among others, using our own tax specialists to 
assist us in assessing and challenging the assumptions 
and judgments made by the Directors. In assessing the 
appropriateness of the level of deferred tax asset 
balance recognised in the Group balance sheet we 
compared the assumptions used in respect of future 
taxable income forecasts in the relevant components in 
the US to the Group’s long term forecasts for consistency 
and we critically assessed the assumptions and 
judgments made by the Directors by considering the 
historical accuracy of forecasts and, based on our 
knowledge of the client and the industry in which it 
operates, the sensitivities of the profit forecasts and  
our assessment of the risk of management bias.  
We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures (see Note 11) setting out the basis of the 
deferred tax balance and the level of estimation 
involved, as well as the appropriateness of disclosing

VALUATION OF LITIGATION AND OTHER LIABILITIES (£16.1M)
Refer to page 62 (Audit Committee statement), page 97 
(accounting policies) and page 130 (financial disclosures) 
• The Risk: In providing for estimated known or probable 
costs resulting from both legal and other regulatory 
requirements, the Directors of the Group use their 
judgment and experience and, where appropriate, 
receive external advice. The completeness and valuation 
of the provision for legal and environmental claims are 
inherently judgmental due to the degree of uncertainty 
involved. The risk is that the amount provided in respect 
of legal or environmental claims is over or understated 
which could have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial position and results for the year and that the 
disclosures relating to such provisions and contingent 
liabilities do not properly explain the risks and 
assumptions relating to these. 
• Our Response: In this area our audit procedures 
included, among others, assessing whether all current 
cases had been appropriately considered by the 
Directors through inspecting, at the reporting 
component level, the claims reporting received from 
reporting components. In addition we met in-house  
legal counsel and management responsible for material 
claims to discuss the nature of ongoing claims (legal 
and other) and analysed external evidence such as 
correspondence from regulators and/ or reports from the 
Group’s external advisers/lawyers to challenge the basis 
of provisions recorded. In addition we obtained formal 
confirmation from the Group’s external counsel for a 
significant litigation. We also assessed the adequacy  
of the Group’s disclosures (see Note 3 and Note 30) in 
respect of the description of the claims provided and the 
level of estimation involved in arriving at the provision, as 
well as the contingent liabilities disclosure for unprovided 
claims in Note 33. 
3. OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN 
OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
The materiality for the financial statements as a whole was 
set at £4 million. This has been determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation which  
we consider to be one of the principal considerations  
for members of the Company in assessing financial 
performance of the group. Materiality represents 5% of  WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   89

INFORMATION
Group profit before taxation and 5% of Group profit before 
taxation adjusted for exceptional items as disclosed on the 
face of the income statement.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all 
corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified 
through our audit with a value in excess of £0.3 million, in 
addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold 
that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed by 
component auditors at the key reporting components in 
the following countries: China, Germany, Hong Kong,  
India, Netherlands and Taiwan and by the Group audit 
team for the United Kingdom. In addition, specified audit 
procedures were performed by component auditors in 
Brazil and the United States of America. These group 
procedures covered 71% of total Group revenue; 75% of the 
total profits and losses before taxation that made up Group 
profit before taxation; and 95% of total Group assets.
The remaining 29% of revenue, 25% of the total profits  
and losses before taxation and 5% of total group assets  
is represented by 220 reporting components around  
the world. None of these 220 reporting components 
represented more than 3.8% of revenue, profit before tax  
or total group assets. Local statutory audits are performed 
over 21 of these components, but generally these are 
completed after the date of this report.
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes  
at the key reporting components of the Group were all 
performed to materiality levels set by, or agreed with,  
the Group audit team. These materiality levels were set 
individually for each component and ranged from  
£0.2 million to £3 million. 
Detailed instructions were sent to all the auditors in these 
locations. These instructions covered the significant areas 
that should be addressed by these component auditors 
(which included the relevant risks of material misstatement 
detailed above) and set out the information required to be 
reported back to the Group audit team. The Group audit 
team visited the United States and attended the German 
audit close meeting via telephone. Telephone meetings 
were also held with the auditors at these locations and all 
of the countries in all locations in scope for Group reporting 
purposes that were not physically visited. 
4. OUR OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE 
COMPANIES ACT 2006 IS UNMODIFIED 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance  
with the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with  
the financial statements. 
5. WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT IN RESPECT  
OF MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO  
REPORT BY EXCEPTION 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to 
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit, we have identified other information in the Annual 
Report that contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between  
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider that the Annual 
Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Statement does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the  
Audit Committee.
• Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept  
by the parent company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
• Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 85,  
in relation to going concern; and 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages 49 relating to the Company’s compliance 
with the nine provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the  
above responsibilities. 
SCOPE OF REPORT AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 87, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
A description of the scope of an audit of accounts is 
provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made 
solely to the Company’s members as a body and subject 
to important explanations and disclaimers regarding  
our responsibilities, published on our website at  
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2013a, which are 
incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should 
be read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this 
report, the work we have undertaken and the basis  
of our opinions.

NOTES TO THE  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2013
1. GENERAL INFORMATION 
Alent plc (“the Company”) is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock 
Exchange. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary and joint venture 
companies (“the Group”) are set out on pages 4 to 9 and its registered address is Forsyth Road, Sheerwater,  
Woking GU21 5RZ. 
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION 
2.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING 
The consolidated financial statements of Alent plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”). 
2.2 GROUP REORGANISATION AND DEMERGER IN 2012
There was no Group reorganisation and demerger activity in 2013.
In 2012 the Performance Materials division was demerged from Vesuvius plc with effect from 19 December 2012 and the 
entities making up the Performance Materials division were transferred to a new parent company, Alent plc. Application 
was made to the UK Listing Authority and to the London Stock Exchange for the issued share capital of Alent plc to be 
admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange.
Although Alent plc acquired the entire share capital of Alent Investments Limited, it did not have the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of the Performance Materials division. For that reason, the acquisition was accounted 
for in accordance with the principles of reverse acquisition accounting as set out in IFRS 3, Business Combinations.  
For the purposes of these consolidated financial statements, this had the effect of the legal acquirer, Alent plc, being 
treated as having been acquired by its legal subsidiary, Alent Investments Limited. The impact of adopting this reverse 
acquisition accounting basis is set out in each applicable note to these consolidated financial statements, which have 
been prepared as if the continuing operations of the Group were in existence for the whole of the period from 1 January 
2012 to 31 December 2012. 
2.3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities 
controlled by the Company (its “subsidiaries”). Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing whether control exists, potential 
voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective 
date of disposal, as appropriate. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies 
into line with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis.  
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
2.4 GOING CONCERN 
As discussed in more detail in the Directors’ Report on page 85, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, they 
have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
2.5 FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY 
The financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, 
and rounded to one decimal place. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 25.1.  96   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
NOTES TO THE  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED) 
2.6 DISCLOSURE OF EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS 
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, 
but states key lines which should be disclosed, encourages disclosure of additional line items where such presentation 
will assist in understanding financial performance and requires separate disclosure of material items of income or 
expense. Accordingly, the Company discloses exceptional items separately on the face of its Group income statement, 
together with a full explanation of the nature and function of such items in the notes to the financial statements. 
Both materiality and the nature and function of the item are considered in deciding whether an item warrants treatment 
as an exceptional item. Such items may include, inter alia: the financial effect of major restructuring activity; profits or 
losses relating to current and non-current assets; gains or losses relating to employee benefit plans; profits or losses 
arising on business disposals; recognition and utilisation of deferred tax assets; and other items, including the taxation 
impact of the aforementioned items, which have a significant impact on the Group’s results either due to their size  
or nature.
2.7 NEW AND REVISED IFRS 
Effective from 1 January 2013, the Group has adopted the following amended and revised standards.
Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements As a result of the amendments to IAS 1, the Group 
statement of comprehensive income has been modified to present separately items that may subsequently be 
reclassified to profit or loss from those that will never be reclassified. Comparative information has been restated 
accordingly. The adoption of this amendment has no impact on the previously reported comprehensive income or 
financial position of the Group.
IAS 19, Employee Benefits (revised 2011) IAS 19 revised has changed the way in which the Group calculates interest 
income on its pension plan assets and the way in which this interest is presented within the Group income statement. 
Under IAS 19 revised, interest income is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit 
obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the plan assets at the beginning of the annual period, taking into 
account any changes in the assets during the period as a result of employer contributions and benefit payments. 
Previously, the Group determined interest income on its pension plan assets based on their long-term rate of expected 
return. The net finance cost on the net defined benefit liability was previously presented gross within finance income and 
finance costs in the Group income statement. The amount is now presented as a single net finance cost on the net 
defined benefit liability within finance costs. Prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly. This change in 
policy has no impact on the previously reported total comprehensive income or financial position of the Group. 
During the year a number of other new and amended IFRS became effective and were adopted by the Group, none of 
which had a material impact on the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings 
per share. A number of other new and amended IFRS were issued during the year, which do not become effective until 
after 1 January 2014, none of which is likely to have a material impact on the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, 
total comprehensive income or earnings per share. 
3. CRITICAL JUDGMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY 
Determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future 
events. The major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are noted below. 
3.1 GOODWILL 
The Directors use their judgment to determine the extent to which goodwill has a value that will benefit the  
performance of the Group over future periods. To assist in making this judgment, the Directors undertake an  
assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of the Group’s capitalised goodwill. In the assessment undertaken  
as at 31 December 2013, further details of which are given in note 17, value in use was derived from discounted five-year 
cash flow projections, using a growth rate of 3.0% in the years beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates. 
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the 
Group’s businesses for this purpose. Changes to the assumptions used in making these forecasts could significantly alter 
the Directors’ assessment of the carrying value of goodwill. WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   97

3. CRITICAL JUDGMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY 
(CONTINUED)
3.2 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
The Group’s financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other 
post-retirement benefits to current and former employees. It is the Directors’ responsibility to set the assumptions used in 
determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations. The assumptions are set after consultation 
with the Group’s actuary, and whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the 
assumptions used would affect the Group’s profit and financial position. 
3.3 LIABILITY RESERVES 
Alent has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those 
covering taxation and environmental matters. Several of the Group’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, 
certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are 
aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities. Reserves are made for the 
expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory 
requirements, or from third-party claims. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject 
to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty. 
The Directors use their judgment and experience to make reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate 
amount relating to such matters. 
3.4 TAXATION 
(a) Current tax 
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group.  
In assessing the amount of the benefit to be recognised in the financial statements, the Directors exercise their judgment 
in considering the effect of negotiations, litigation and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the 
potential settlement. Any interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge. The Group operates 
internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions. As a consequence, the Group is routinely subject to 
tax audits and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude. Provisions 
are made for known issues based upon the Directors’ interpretation of country-specific tax law and their assessment of 
the likely outcome. 
(b) Deferred tax 
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a 
number of the Group’s businesses. Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values 
at which these assets are recognised. If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax 
rates or to the period over which the losses or timing differences might be recognised, then the value of deferred tax 
assets will need to be revised in a future period. 
The Group also has losses and other timing differences for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in these 
financial statements, relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of the timing difference 
is not probable or to where the timing difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain types of profit 
being earned, such as capital profits. If operating or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these companies, 
these losses and other timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge. 
4. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
The Company uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”) financial measures in 
addition to those reported in accordance with IFRS. The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures, listed below, 
are important when assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group and its businesses. 
4.1 NET SALES VALUE (“NSV”)
NSV is revenue less commodity metals that pass through to customers. As the changes in the value of these commodity 
metals are passed through to customers, NSV is a more appropriate measure of the underlying activity of the business.
4.2 RETURN ON SALES AND NSV MARGIN 
Return on sales is calculated as adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. NSV margin is calculated as adjusted 
operating profit divided by NSV. 98   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

4. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED) 
4.3 ADJUSTED RESULTS
Adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted profit for the year and adjusted earnings per share are,  
as appropriate, each stated before: exceptional items; amortisation of acquired intangible assets; deferred tax on 
acquired intangible assets and goodwill; acquisition costs; the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial 
instruments; profits or losses arising on business disposals; and demerger costs, and include the effect of proforma 
adjustments (note 4.13).
4.4 ADJUSTED CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS 
Adjusted cash generated from operations is cash generated from operations as reported in the Group statement of 
cash flows after adding back £nil (2012: £16.0m) for Woking restructuring (note 8) and £4.8m (2012: £5.7m) for demerger 
cash costs (note 9). 
4.5 FREE CASH FLOW 
Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of 
property, plant and equipment and dividends from joint ventures but before additional funding contributions to Group 
pension plans. 
4.6 AVERAGE WORKING CAPITAL TO SALES RATIO 
The average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances to the 
annualised revenue for the year. Average working capital (comprising inventories, trade and other receivables, and 
trade and other payables) is calculated as the average of the six previous month-end balances, and annualised 
revenue is derived from the revenue for the previous six months. 
4.7 EBITDA 
EBITDA is calculated as the total of operating profit before share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, exceptional items  
and depreciation charges. 
4.8 NET INTEREST 
Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein 
considered by the Directors to be exceptional. 
4.9 INTEREST COVER 
Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest. 
4.10 NET DEBT 
Net debt comprises the net total of: short-term deposits; cash at bank and in hand; bank overdrafts; and current  
and non-current interest-bearing borrowings net of capitalised borrowing costs.
4.11 NET DEBT TO EBITDA 
Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year.
4.12 RETURN ON INVESTMENT 
Return on investment (“ROI”) is calculated as adjusted operating profit after tax plus share of post-tax profit of joint 
ventures, divided by invested capital (being total equity plus net debt, net employee benefit liabilities and goodwill 
previously written off to, or amortised against, reserves). 
4.13 PROFORMA ADJUSTMENTS 
In order to provide clearer financial information and performance metrics of Alent, proforma financial adjustments  
have been made to present the results for 2012 as if Alent had been a standalone Group for the whole of that period.
Proforma central costs of £7 .5m represent estimated annual costs associated with becoming a separate stand-alone 
Group. Accordingly these costs have been presented on a proforma basis in the segmental analysis for 2012. 
Proforma finance costs adjustments have been made to reflect Alent’s post-demerger banking arrangements  
and debt levels, increasing the statutory net finance costs for 2012 by £4.9m, to £8.5m on a proforma basis.
Proforma tax adjustments have been made to reflect Alent’s post-demerger structure and performance. As a result the 
proforma tax charge on ordinary activities for 2012 was £20.8m on adjusted profit before tax of £89.0m, an effective tax 
rate (before share of post-tax profit from joint ventures) of 23.4%.  WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   99

5. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
The segment information contained in this note makes reference to several non-GAAP financial measures, definitions  
for which can be found in note 4. 
5.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
(a) Revenue recognition 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered 
to customers after deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group. 
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either 
on a stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary materials with equipment, revenue is 
recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement. 
Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred to the customer, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and recovery of the 
related consideration is probable. In practice this usually occurs when the goods have been delivered to, and 
accepted by, the customer. A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates.
Construction contracts Where the outcome of a contractual arrangement, such as an equipment construction 
contract, can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised as performance occurs by reference to the 
stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. When it is probable that total contract costs will 
exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
(b) Research and development costs 
Research Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which  
it is incurred. 
Development Development expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or 
process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and 
has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognised in the income 
statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
In determining whether development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset or recognised in the income 
statement as an expense, management considers whether the strict intangible asset recognition criteria set out in IAS 38, 
Intangible Assets, have been met at the time the expenditure is incurred. In making this determination, management 
recognise that a significant portion of the development expenditure undertaken by the Group is focused on incremental 
improvements to existing products, as opposed to new or substantially improved products, and that for most of the 
Group’s product developments commercial feasibility is not probable until acceptance by potential end customers, so 
future economic benefits from the developments are not often probable at the time the expenditure is incurred. 
5.2 BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
For reporting purposes, the Group is organised into two main business segments, namely Assembly Materials and 
Surface Chemistries. It is the Alent Board that makes the key operating decisions in respect of these segments. The 
information used by the Board to review performance and determine resource allocation is presented with the Group’s 
activities analysed between these two business segments. Taking into account the basis on which the Group’s activities 
are reported to the Alent Board and the nature of the products and services within each of these business segments, 
the Directors believe that these two business segments are the appropriate way to analyse the Group’s results.  
The principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Business Unit Review on pages 26 to 27 . 
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers (inter-segment revenue is not material) and segment 
result is operating profit before share of joint ventures and exceptional items and before corporate costs directly related 
to managing the parent company, which are reported separately in the tables below. Segment result includes items 
directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
During 2013, the comparative financial information reviewed by the Alent Board included the effect of proforma 
adjustments. Accordingly, the comparative financial information shown in the table below has been restated to reflect 
such proforma adjustments. 100   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

Restructuring charges
Restructuring charges for the year amounted to £10.3m (2012: £3.5m) and arose in connection with initiatives to 
streamline the Group’s manufacturing footprint and improve the Group’s cost base. These initiatives included 
redundancy programmes, the downsizing or closure of facilities, the streamlining of manufacturing processes and the 
rationalisation of product lines. The net tax credit attributable to these restructuring charges was £1.9m (2012: £0.6m).
Restructuring cash costs of £4.0m (2012: £19.8m) were incurred in the year, of which £nil (2012: £16.0m) related to the 
purchase of a property in Woking, UK which was previously occupied on a leasehold basis and over which an onerous 
lease reserve had been established in 2009. The remaining cash costs in the year were incurred in respect of the 
restructuring initiatives commenced both in 2013 and in prior years, leaving provisions made but unspent of £9.7m  
(2012: £3.8m).
Loss on construction contract
The one-off loss on a construction contract of £6.6m in 2012 related to a contract for the installation of a chemical 
treatment line and represented the additional costs to complete the project incurred by Alent after the third party 
sub-contracted to carry out the work went into liquidation. The tax credit attributable to this loss was £1.9m. WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   105

11. INCOME TAX 
11.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss 
except to the extent that they relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity,  
in which case the associated tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or directly to equity. 
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable nor deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates  
and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences  
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against 
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting 
profit. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or 
the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance 
sheet date.  WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   107

11.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY (CONTINUED)
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.

Tax credited in the Group statement of comprehensive income in the year amounted to £nil (2012: £0.2m all of which 
related to net actuarial gains and losses on employee benefits plans).
The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices. Changes in any of these 
areas could, adversely or positively, impact the Group’s tax charge in the future. Continuing losses, or insufficiency of 
taxable profit to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, 
relative to 2013, as effective tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses. Other significant factors  
affecting the tax charge are described in notes 3.4 and 11.1. 108   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

In accordance with the accounting policy in note 11.1, these items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets on 
the basis that their future economic benefit is not probable. In total, there was a decrease of £10.6m (2012: £13.5m 
increase) in net unrecognised deferred tax assets during the year. 
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had total operating losses carried forward with a tax value of £76.7m (2012: £78.8m)

From 1 April 2013, the UK corporation tax rate reduced to 23%. On 2 July 2013, the UK Government passed the 2013 
Finance Bill, which will reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014, with a further rate reduction to 
20% from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, the Group’s closing UK deferred tax liability has been provided using a tax rate of 
between 21% and 20%, depending on the expected timing of the realiastion or settlement of the liability.

Prior to the demerger from Vesuvius plc on 19 December 2012, Alent was part of Cookson Group plc. Accordingly, Alent’s 
weighted average share capital for 2012 has been calculated by reference to movements in the number of issued 
ordinary shares of Cookson Group plc for the period from 1 January 2012 to 19 December 2012 and by reference to 
movements in the number of issued ordinary shares of Alent plc with effect from 19 December 2012.
For the purposes of calculating diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to include the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary 
shares relating to the Company’s share-based payment plans. Potential ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive 
when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share, or increase loss per share, from  
continuing operations.
Other than the ordinary shares shown as being dilutive in the table above, the Company had no other outstanding 
options or share awards in relation to its share-based payment plans that could dilute EPS in the future, but which are 
not included in the calculation of diluted EPS above because they were anti-dilutive in the years presented.

14. RECONCILIATION OF MOVEMENT IN NET DEBT (CONTINUED)
Net debt is a measure of the Group’s net indebtedness to banks and other external financial institutions and comprises 
the net total of: short-term deposits; cash at bank and in hand; bank overdrafts; and current and non-current interest-
bearing borrowings net of capitalised borrowing costs. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the 
purpose of the Group statement of cash flows. There is no significant difference between the fair value of the Group’s  
net debt and the amount at which it is reported in the Group balance sheet.
15. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
15.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other items of property, plant and equipment are 
carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs are capitalised only when it 
is probable that they will result in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured 
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Group income statement in the period in 
which it is incurred. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset 
is available for use and is therefore not charged on construction in progress. Depreciation is charged to the Group 
income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over its estimated 
useful life as follows: 
Asset category Estimated useful life 
Freehold property between 10 and 50 years 
Leasehold property the term of the lease 
Plant and equipment – motor vehicles between 1 and 5 years 
    – information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years 
    – other between 5 and 15 years 
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at 
least at each financial year-end. As described in note 17 .1, an asset’s carrying amount is immediately written down to its 
recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses arising on 
disposals are determined by comparing the sales proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the Group 
income statement. 112   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

16. INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Intangible assets comprise goodwill that has been acquired through business combinations. 
16.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the 
aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling 
interest acquired over the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Goodwill is 
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or 
more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated 
may be impaired. On disposal of a business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the 
profit or loss on disposal. WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   113

16.3 ANALYSIS OF GOODWILL BY CASH-GENERATING UNIT (“CGU”) 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. For the purposes of impairment testing, the Directors consider that the Group has two 
CGUs: the Assembly Materials and Surface Chemistries businesses. These CGUs represent the lowest level within the 
Group at which goodwill is monitored.

17. IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
17 .1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
At each balance sheet date, the Directors review the carrying value of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it 
is not feasible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Directors estimate the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination and the Directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of its CGUs, to 
assess the need for any impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets 
associated with these CGUs. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of (i) its fair value less 
costs to sell and (ii) its value in use. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than the carrying amount of that CGU, the 
resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then 
to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an 
asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the asset’s 
recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. The value in use calculations of the Group’s CGUs are 
based on detailed business plans covering a three year period from the balance sheet date, higher level assumptions 
covering a further two year period and perpetuity calculations beyond this five year projection period. The cash flows in 
the calculations are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates.  114   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM
NOTES TO THE  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

17. IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
17 .2 KEY ASSUMPTIONS 
The key assumptions used in determining value in use are NSV margin, growth rates and discount rates. NSV margin 
assumptions are based on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring 
and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date. 
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions; external forecasts and historical trends for the 
Group’s key end-markets of electronics and automotive; and expected growth in output within the industries in which 
each CGU operates. A perpetuity growth rate of 3.0% (2012: 2.5%) has been applied based upon external forecasts of 
the long-term growth rates experienced in the Group’s end-market locations.
Discount rates are calculated for each CGU, reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to each CGU. The pre-tax discount rate used for the Assembly Materials CGU was 14.1% (2012: 13.8%) and for the 
Surface Chemistries CGU 12.5% (2012: 14.0%). 
17 .3 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT 
In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2013, the Directors made use of detailed calculations 
of the recoverable amount of the Group’s CGUs as at 31 December 2013. Those calculations resulted in recoverable 
amounts significantly higher than the carrying values of each of the Group’s CGUs and consequently no impairment 
charges were recognised.
18. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 
18.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using 
the effective interest method, less impairment losses.

All of the Group’s operating companies have policies and procedures in place to assess the creditworthiness of the 
customers with whom they do business. Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be 
impaired, provision is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash 
that will be recovered. Evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, or 
entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings. Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual 
customer basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon 
historical loss experience. Historical experience has shown that the Group’s trade receivable provisions are maintained 
at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without being excessive. WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   115

Due to the large number of customers that the Group transacts its business with, none of which represents a significant 
proportion of the total outstanding trade receivables balance, the Group is not exposed to any significant concentration 
of credit risk. There is no significant difference between the fair value of the Group’s trade and other receivable balances 
and the amount at which they are reported in the Group balance sheet.
19. INVENTORIES 
19.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) and net realisable value. Cost comprises 
expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in 
bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads 
based on normal activity levels. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. The amount of any write-down of inventories 
to net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.

As at 31 December 2013, in addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group held £10.1m (2012: 
£13.8m) of precious metals on consignment terms. As the precious metals consignors retain title and associated risks 
and rewards of ownership under these arrangements, the value of the physical metal so held is not recognised in the 
balance sheet. Consequently, the obligations in respect of the consigned metal are not recognised as a liability in the 
Group balance sheet. 116   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
20.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and 
forward commodity contracts to manage the effects of its exposure to foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk. 
The way in which derivatives are used to manage the Group’s financial risk is detailed in note 25. 
Derivatives are measured at fair value. The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts and forward commodity 
contracts is calculated using market prices at the balance sheet date. 
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is 
designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. 
Strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at 
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The change in fair value of a derivative 
that is not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes is recognised within operating profit in 
the Group income statement. Wherever possible, the Group avoids the administrative burden of hedge accounting, 
and does not designate a derivative as a hedge when, in the absence of hedge accounting, the change in fair value 
of the hedged item is itself recognised within operating profit in the Group income statement in the same period as the 
change in fair value of the derivative. No derivatives are held for speculative purposes.
Cash flow hedges 
The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recognised in other 
comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is 
recognised immediately within operating profit. When the transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects 
profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the 
income statement in the same period. 
Fair value hedges 
The change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge is recognised within operating profit in 
the income statement. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in its fair value that is 
attributable to the hedged risk and this adjustment is recognised within operating profit in the income statement.

Other capital reserve 
On 19 December 2012, Alent plc issued 278,448,752 ordinary shares of £1.50 each to the public shareholders of Vesuvius 
plc in return for the receipt of the entire share capital of Alent Investments Limited. Alent plc applied merger relief under 
section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 to this transaction and, accordingly, the excess of the total market value of Alent 
Investments Limited, being £862.4m, over the nominal value of the shares issued of £417 .7m has been recorded in the 
other capital reserve. 
Other reserve 
The other reserve arose as a result of applying reverse acquisition accounting following the demerger of the Alent Group 
from Cookson Group plc, and represents the difference between the capital reserves of the legal acquirer of the Alent 
Group, Alent plc, and those of the legal acquiree, Alent Investments Limited. 
Capital redemption reserve 
On 9 December 2013, Alent plc redeemed the 50,000 redeemable non-voting preference shares with a nominal value 
of £1.00 per share. Further details can be found in note 7 of the Notes to the Company Financial Statements. 
Translation reserve 
The translation reserve in the table above comprises all foreign exchange differences attributable to the owners of the 
parent. These exchange differences arise from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and from 
the translation of financial instruments that hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations. 118   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

25.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
(a) Non-derivative financial instruments 
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition they are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. 
(b) Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the  
currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated 
financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the 
presentational currency of the Group. 
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency 
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded  
at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date: 
(i) Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange 
differences arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group income  
statement; and 
(ii) Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Translation from functional currency to presentational currency 
When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency (pounds sterling),  
its results and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows: 
(i) Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date; 
(ii) Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such 
average rates does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of a specific transaction, in which case the 
transaction rate is used; and 
(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation 
reserve in equity and are reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed. 
Net investment in foreign operations 
Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign 
operation are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity  
and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. 120   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

25.2 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS 
The Group’s treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is principally responsible 
for managing the financial risks faced by the Group. The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the 
most significant of which are market risk and liquidity risk. 
(a) Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash flows of the Group’s financial instruments may fluctuate 
because of changes in market prices. The Group is principally exposed to market risk through fluctuations in exchange 
rates (“currency risk”) and interest rates (“interest rate risk”). 
Currency risk 
The Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and financial assets (being cash and short-term deposits) that 
are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling. The Group’s general policy is proportionally to match the 
currency profile of its core borrowings with the currency profile of its earnings and net assets achieved, where necessary, 
by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts (“FX swaps”). The currency profile of the Group’s borrowings and 
financial assets is shown in the table below.

25.2 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED) 
The floating rate financial liabilities shown in the tables above bear interest at various rates. The financial assets attract 
floating rate interest at various rates. 
Based upon the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% 
increase in market interest rates would decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement 
and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by £0.3m (2012: increase £1.4m) and a 1% reduction in 
market interest rates would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net 
interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by £0.3m (2012: decrease £1.4m). Similarly, a 1% increase or decrease 
in market interest rates would result in no change (2012: no change) in the fair value of the Group’s net debt. 
(b) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have difficulties in meeting its financial obligations. The Group manages  
this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents  
to ensure that it can meet its operational cash flow requirements and any maturing financial liabilities, while at all times 
operating within its financial covenants. The level of operational headroom provided by the Group’s committed 
borrowing facilities is reviewed at least annually as part of the Group’s three year planning process. Where this process 
indicates a need for additional finance, this will normally be addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by means of either 
additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets. 
As at 31 December 2013, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of £300m (2012: £300m), of which £145.5m  
(2012: £72.5m) were undrawn. These undrawn facilities are due to expire in September 2017 .

25.3 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
The Group monitors its capital using a number of key performance indicators, including free cash flow, average working 
capital to sales ratios, net debt to EBITDA ratios and ROI (note 4). The Group’s objectives when managing its capital are: 
• to ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group 
operates within the financial covenants contained within its debt facilities; 
• to maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Group’s equity and  
net debt; 
• to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable 
future returns; and 
• to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events. 
The Group operated comfortably within the requirements of its debt covenants and has substantial liquidity headroom 
within its committed debt facilities. Details of the Group’s covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be 
found in the Financial Review on page 42. 
26. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
26.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
(a) Defined benefit plans 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of its defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating  
the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount 
using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related 
pension liability, and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. These calculations are performed by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit 
obligations and the return on the plan assets, are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income. The  
net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability is determined by applying the discount rate used to measure  
the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit liability at the beginning of the 
year and taking into account changes in the net defined benefit liability during the year as a result of contributions  
and benefit payments. Net interest expense is recognised in the Group income statement. Gains and losses arising  
on settlements and curtailments are also recognised in the Group income statement.
(b) Defined contribution plans 
The Group makes payments to defined contribution pension plans and has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense in the Group income 
statement when they fall due. 
26.2 GROUP POST-RETIREMENT PLANS 
The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined benefit and defined  
contribution type.
(a) Defined benefit plans 
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension plans are in the US. The assets of these plans are held separately from the 
Group in trustee-administered funds. The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans’ beneficiaries. The 
Group also has defined benefit pension plans in other territories, but these are not individually material in relation to the 
Group as a whole.  WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   125

26.2 GROUP POST-RETIREMENT PLANS (CONTINUED)
The Group’s US defined benefit plans are closed to new members and to future benefit accrual for existing members. 
The main US plan, the Retirement Security Plan, has characteristics similar to defined contribution plans, but with a 
minimum performance level guaranteed by the Group on the members’ accounts. The cash balance rate assumption 
in the table in note 26.3(a) refers to this minimum return. The Group’s US defined benefit plans provide retirement benefits 
based on final salary or a fixed benefit. Actuarial valuations of the US plan are carried out annually by independent 
actuaries and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2012. At that date, the market value of the plan 
assets was £39.1m, representing a funding level of 76% of funded accrued plan benefits of £51.7m. 
Funding levels for the Group’s US defined benefit plan are determined by management after taking into account the 
results of the annual valuations of the plans, minimum funding levels prescribed by US government regulations and 
advice received from the Group’s independent investment advisers. In 2014, the Group is expected to make aggregate 
contributions into its defined benefit plans of around £2.5m.
(b) Defined contribution pension plans 
The total expense recognised for the Group’s defined contribution pension plans and recognised in the Group income 
statement for the year amounted to £5.8m (2012: £5.6m).
26.3 DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION
(a) Actuarial assumptions 
Actuarial assumptions are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries.  
The principal assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans 
relate to the Group’s US plans and these are summarised in the tables below. 
Life expectancy of US pension plan members 
2013
years 
2012

Age to which future pensioners are expected to live  – Men 87.2 86.6 
        – Women 89.2 89.1 
The mortality assumptions summarised in the table above are based on fully generational mortality tables that explicitly 
allow for differences in mortality levels and future trends in mortality, for people born in different years. 
The other principal actuarial assumptions for the Group’s US defined benefit pension plans are shown below.

Discount rate 4.50 3.65 
Cash balance rate 5.25 5.25
The discount rates in the table above, which are used to determine the liabilities of the US plans, are determined by 
reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds, using the Citigroup pension discount curve. The cash 
balance rate is the minimum performance level guaranteed by the Group to members of its main defined benefit  
plan in the US. 126   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

The allocation of assets in the Group’s US plan is based upon a liability-focused investment strategy, designed to  
reduce the funding volatility of the plan as the funding level improves, and substantially to remove the investment risk  
of the plan once full funding on an accounting valuation basis is achieved. This is accomplished by dividing the 
portfolio into “return-seeking” and “liability-matching” portfolios. The return-seeking assets are designed to generate 
returns in excess of the change in the value of the plan’s projected liabilities and the liability-matching portfolio, 
comprised of high quality fixed income investments, is designed to match the change in value of the plan’s liabilities 
regardless of market conditions. The mix at 31 December 2013 between return-seeking and liability-matching assets  
was approximately 40%/60%. Other assets in the table above are principally comprised of cash.

28. TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 
28.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using  
the effective interest method.

There is no significant difference between the fair value of the Group’s trade and other payables balances and the

29. LEASES 
29.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are 
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Benefits received and receivable  
as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 130   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

29.2 OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS

Later than five years 2.7 2.7 
Total operating lease commitments 21.1 22.1 
The Group’s property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts. Where 
the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is 
capitalised in the Group balance sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease 
obligation. Where all the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classified as an 
operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group balance 
sheet. The net book value of the Group’s property, plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 
31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 was not material. 
The cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged 
within operating profit, amounted to £6.4m (2012: £7 .2m).
30. PROVISIONS 
30.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current market assessment of the time 
value of money and the specific risks associated with the obligation. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

Of the total provision balance as at 31 December 2013 of £23.5m (2012: £20.1m), £11.7m (2012: £12.3m) is recognised  
in the Group balance sheet within non-current liabilities and £11.8m (2012: £7 .8m) within current liabilities. 
The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors’ best estimate of the costs to be incurred in the 
fulfilment of obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure 
and the demolition and clean-up of closed sites. The provision as at 31 December 2013 principally comprised amounts 
payable in respect of environmental remediation and monitoring works, demolition and site clean-up costs, and 
associated regulatory liabilities. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to 
legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the 
majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years. 
Provisions for restructuring and other charges include the costs of all of the Group’s initiatives to rationalise its operating 
activities. The balance of £10.0m as at 31 December 2013 includes £2.8m in relation to onerous lease provisions in 
respect of leases terminating between five and thirteen years, and £6.9m in relation to future expenditure on 
restructuring initiatives which is expected to be paid out over the next two years.  WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   131

31. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES NET OF CASH ACQUIRED 
No acquisitions were made during the year. The £1.0m disclosed in the Group statement of cash flows in respect of  
the acquisition of subsidiaries net of cash acquired, comprised deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions in  
prior years.
In 2012 the Group acquired interests in subsidiaries for a total consideration of £3.2m, of which £0.4m was paid in cash on 
completion and £2.8m (of which £0.8m was subsequently paid in 2012) was contingent upon future performance. The fair 
value of net assets acquired, which did not include any cash, was £0.4m. Goodwill arising on these acquisitions amounted 
to £2.8m (note 16). The £1.4m disclosed in the Group statement of cash flows for 2012 in respect of the acquisition of 
subsidiaries net of cash acquired, comprised £0.4m paid in cash on completion, £0.8m of deferred consideration paid  
in respect of acquisitions in 2012 and £0.2m of deferred consideration paid in respect of earlier acquisitions. 
32. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course 
of business are not reported in the Group balance sheet. Of such arrangements, those considered material by the 
Directors are inventory held under precious metal consignment arrangements (note 19) and future lease payments in 
relation to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases (note 29).
33. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
The Group has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those 
covering taxation and environmental matters. Legal claims have been brought against certain Group companies by 
third parties alleging that persons have been harmed by exposure to hazardous materials used by those companies in 
the manufacture of industrial and consumer products, and further claims may be brought in the future. Several of the 
Group’s subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course  
of the operations of the company involved, and the Directors are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be,  
the subject of dispute with tax authorities. Reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or 
probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims. As the settlement of 
many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount 
of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty. 
Certain subsidiary companies of Alent plc and Vesuvius plc are defendants in two actions, brought by MacDermid 
(incorporated in the United States), which are pending in the Connecticut Superior Court and arising out of corporate 
activity involving the parties in the autumn of 2006. The first action was commenced in 2009 and the second action  
was commenced in August 2012. MacDermid claims damages of approximately $62m, plus punitive or exemplary 
damages, costs and interest which are currently unquantifiable. Both Alent and Vesuvius believe these claims have  
no merit and are vigorously defending these actions. Each of Alent and Vesuvius anticipate filing motions for summary 
judgment in 2014 and, if any claims remain pending decisions on those motions, a trial in the first action is anticipated in 
2015. Any liability relating to the MacDermid claim arising following the demerger of Cookson Group will be split equally 
between Alent plc and Vesuvius plc.  132   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION 
1.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING 
Alent plc (“the Company”) was incorporated on 31 August 2012 and is registered in England and Wales. 
At a General Meeting on 26 November 2012, the shareholders of Cookson Group plc approved the demerger of the 
Performance Materials division. On 19 December 2012 (the demerger date), the businesses making up this division were 
transferred to an unrelated company, Alent plc, in exchange for the entire share capital of that company. As a result of 
the demerger, Alent plc became the ultimate parent company of the Alent subsidiaries. Trading of shares in Alent plc on 
the London Stock Exchange commenced on 19 December 2012. 
The financial statements of Alent plc (“the Company”), are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with UK GAAP. The Company has not presented a separate 
profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006. 
1.2 GOING CONCERN 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements of the Group and the Company for the year ended 31 December 2013.

A final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2012 of £15.3m (2011: £nil), equivalent to 5.5 pence per ordinary share, 
was paid in June 2013 and an interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2013 of £8.0m (2012: £nil), equivalent to 
2.89 pence per ordinary share was paid in October 2013, resulting in a total cash cost of dividends paid in 2013 of 
£23.3m (2012: £nil).
A proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2013 of £15.9m, equivalent to 5.71 pence per ordinary share, 
is subject to approval by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a

7. ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL 
7 .1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
7 .2 ANALYSIS OF ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL 
On incorporation, the Company’s share capital consisted of one ordinary share with a par value of £1  
(“the subscriber share”).
On 18 September 2012, the Company issued 50,000 redeemable non-voting preference shares of £1 each. The 
preference shares were allotted for cash and remained unpaid by virtue of the holder giving an undertaking to pay  
up each share pursuant to sections 583(2) and 583(3) of the Companies Act 2006. On 9 december 2013 the company 
redeemed the 50,000 redeemable non-voting preference shares for total consideration of £50,000, with such 
consideration being satisfied by the cancellation of the undertaking to pay.
On 19 December 2012, the Company issued 278,448,752 ordinary shares of £1.50 each to the public shareholders of 
Vesuvius plc in return for the receipt of the entire share capital of Alent Investments Limited. The Company applied 
merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 and, accordingly, the excess of the total market value of 
Alent Investments Limited, being £862.4m, over the nominal value of the shares issued of £417 .7m, was recorded in an 
other capital reserve. On the same date, the subscriber share was converted into and redesignated as a deferred share 
of £1. The company repurchased and cancelled the deferred share on 9 December 2013. WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   137

7 .2 ANALYSIS OF ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL (CONTINUED)
On 19 December 2012, the capital of Alent plc was reduced by: 
a) cancelling and extinguishing paid-up capital on each of the Alent plc shares in issue immediately prior to the 
confirmation by the Court of the Alent plc capital reduction to the extent that the amount paid up on each such 
Alent plc share shall be 10 pence; and 
b) reducing the nominal value of each of the Alent plc shares to 10 pence each.
8. RESERVES 
8.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
(a) Taxation 
Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively 
enacted, by the balance sheet date. 
Current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year. Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in 
respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception 
that deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future 
profits from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Provision is made for the tax that 
would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet 
date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.

10. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
10.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
The Company principally operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date 
takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting 
for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares 
that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline 
earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of grant. For grants with market-
based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model. For all other 
grants, fair value is measured using the Black–Scholes model. 
10.2 PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT RECOGNITION 
The Company operates a number of different share-based payment arrangements, the main features of which are 
detailed on pages 75 to 79 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.  WWW.ALENT.COM  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013  ALENT   139

11. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies 
within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this 
respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable 
that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. Guarantees provided by the Company  
as at 31 December 2013 in respect of the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to £161.8m (2012: £228.7m) 
which includes £154.5m (2012: £227 .5m) of drawings under the syndicated debt facility. 
Alent has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those 
covering taxation and environmental matters. Several of the Company’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, 
certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are 
aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities. While the outcome of 
litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the 
insurance arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will,  
either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or  
results of operations. 
12. RELATED PARTIES 
All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm’s length basis and in accordance with normal business 
terms. Transactions between related parties that are wholly owned Group subsidiaries are not disclosed in this note.  140   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

TECHNICAL TERMS
BGA A BGA (Ball Grid Array) is a type of surface mount technology used for packaging 
integrated circuits. 
Copper damascene Chemicals used to create nanoscale copper connections within semiconductor wafers. 
Die attach products The “die” refers to the silicon die in active integrated circuit packages. The attachment 
is most commonly a thermal path to help draw the heat out of the package and is 
typically either a purely metal or a conductive polymeric bond. This application is 
critical to the integrated circuit’s reliability and ultimate performance. 
Electroplating A plating process that uses electrical current to coat a conductive object with a thin 
layer of another material in order to bestow a desired property (e.g. corrosion-
resistance and wear-resistance, aesthetic qualities, etc.) to a surface that otherwise 
lacks that property.
Flux A chemical-based material designed to help reduce oxides and clean metal surfaces 
in order to enable effective “wetting” of metal surfaces to the molten solder alloy during 
the creation of a solder joint when attaching an electronic component to a printed 
circuit board. 
Immersion silver A printed circuit board final finish that provides tarnish resistance, low contact 
resistance and ease of cleaning. Specially designed to meet printed circuit board 
lead-free assembly and OEM requirements. 
Integrated circuit or IC An electronic circuit manufactured by lithograph, or the patterned diffusion of trace 
elements into the surface of a thin substrate of semiconductor material. Additional 
materials are deposited and patterned to form interconnections between 
semiconductor devices. 
LED A light-emitting diode. 
Printed circuit board A printed circuit board, a type of circuit board which has conducting tracks 
superimposed or “printed” on one or both sides. May refer to a board either before  
or after the assembly process. Also referred to as a printed wiring board (“PWB”) in  
the USA. 
Printed circuit  
board assembly 
Printed circuit board assembly involves attaching components such as semiconductors 
and capacitors on to a fabricated board and making the required physical and 
electrical connections. This has to be done with precise accuracy if the finished printed 
circuit board is to function effectively. 
Semiconductor wafers A semiconductor wafer is a thin slice of semiconducting material, upon which 
microcircuits are constructed by chemical deposition of various materials. 
Solder An alloy of tin and other metals with a comparatively low melting point used to join less 
fusible metals. 
Surface mount technology Both a technology design and the electronic components that are used in the process 
of soldering components to the surface of a printed circuit board. 
Through-hole assembly The use of either older technology parts or parts requiring significant mechanical 
strength, where the component has wire leads that physically pass through holes in  
a printed circuit board. 
Wafer bumping products Metal alloys for wafer bump plating, including gold, copper, lead-free alloys and low 
alpha lead-based alloy. STRATEGIC

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN 
Shareholders are able to take their dividend as cash, or in 
shares through the DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan) 
operated by the Company’s Registrar, Equiniti. Further 
details are available at http:/ /www.shareview.co.uk/
products/Pages/DividendReInvestmentPlan.aspx or directly 
from Equiniti. 
The Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) allows shareholders 
to use their cash dividends to buy more shares in the 
Company. Rather than receiving a dividend cheque 
through the post or having their bank account credited 
with the dividend payment, shareholders can choose to 
use their cash dividend to buy additional shares. 
Whole shares are purchased with any residual money 
being carried forward and added to the next dividend. 
However, if the amount of the dividend, less any dealing 
costs incurred in completing the purchase, is insufficient to 
buy a single share, no charge is made and the dividend is 
carried forward. 
E-COMMUNICATIONS 
Using the Group’s website as the main method of 
distribution for many statutory documents is part of our 
commitment to reducing our environmental impact. 
Shareholders can choose to receive communications, 
including the Annual Report & Accounts, and Notice of 
Meetings, in electronic form rather than by post. 
This has a number of advantages, including: 
• savings on environmental resources; 
• significant cost savings for the Company on the delivery 
of documents; and
• speedier delivery of shareholder communications. 
Shareholders can register through the online service 
provided by our Registrar, Equiniti, at www.shareview.co.uk. 
The registration process requires the input of a shareholder 
reference number (SRN), which can be found on the  
share certificate. 
To ensure that shareholder communications are received 
in electronic form, “email” should be selected as the 
mailing preference. 
Once registered, shareholders will be sent an email 
notifying them each time a shareholder communication 
has been published on the Company website, and 
providing them with a link to the page on the website 
where it may be found. 144   ALENT  ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2013 WWW.ALENT.COM

WARNING TO SHAREHOLDERS 
Alent plc is legally obliged to make its share register 
available to the general public. Consequently  
some shareholders may receive unsolicited mail,  
including correspondence from unauthorised  
investment companies. 
Companies have become increasingly aware that their 
shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls 
concerning their shareholding. These calls are typically 
from overseas-based brokers who target UK shareholders 
offering to sell what often turn out to be worthless or 
high-risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be very 
persistent and extremely persuasive. Shareholders are 
advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to 
buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice: 
• ensure that you obtain the correct name of the person 
and organisation; 
• check that they are properly authorised by the  
FCA before becoming involved. You can check at  
www.fca.org.uk; and
• report the matter to the FCA by calling 0845 606 1234  
or visiting www.fca.org.uk.  FINANCIAL ADVISER

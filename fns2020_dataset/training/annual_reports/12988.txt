RapidCloud International Plc  l  Annual Report 2014 2
I am particularly pleased with the Company’s performance in its
second year trading as a publicly listed entity. Both the financial
results are strong and the continued investment in the staff,
technology and products provides confidence for the coming
year.
Financial Review
During the year, the total number of customers increased 11%
to 42,000 whilst increasing our average revenue per customer.
In terms of financial performance, the results for the financial
year showed continued growth with revenues increasing 57%
to RM 17.82 million (2013: RM 11.34 million). Gross profit was
also up 14% to RM 9.67 million (2013: RM 8.46 million) with
gross margins decreasing to 54% (2013: 75%). Profit for the
financial period after tax and basic earnings attributable to
ordinary shareholders increased by 45% to RM 3.67 million
(approximately £0.66 million) (2013: RM 2.53 million).
Successful fund raising and Acquisition
We were delighted that new and existing shareholders
supported us in raising new funds of RM 3.24 million post our
admission to AIM. 
We completed the acquisition of Exxelnet during the year for a
total consideration of RM 4.59 million of which, half was paid
as an initial consideration in cash and the remainder being
contingent on future profits and to be settled by the issue of
new ordinary shares in RapidCloud. We acquired the business
with a solid customer base and remain confident that the
combined Group will benefit greatly from cross-selling and
up-selling opportunities.
The acquisition provided us with a profitable business in
Singapore, which is the world's fourth largest financial centre
and has recently become the preferred location for many
multi-national companies to position their global headquarters.
The acquisition also delivered a highly skilled workforce, which
we knew would integrate well with the existing business and
offer us increased scale and reach to deliver further growth.
Awarded Emerging Business Excellence Award
The Company was delighted to receive a Business Excellence
Award at the annual Sin Chew Business Excellence Awards
(“SCBEA”) 2014, sponsored exclusively by CIMB Bank. 
Launched in 2013, the SCBEA aims to set the benchmark for
corporate excellence in Malaysia. Every year, SCBEA honours
businesses for their efforts in exemplifying strategic
management approaches.
The award serves as one of the highest accolades for the
enterprises which have achieved utmost excellence in all key
business management disciplines which form the strategic parts
of organisational growth and sustainability.
This award is testament to RapidCloud’s ongoing progress and
development.
Investment in business
During the period, we continued to invest in personnel, product
and corporate development. The acquisition delivered
incremental skillsets and we continued to develop products and
successfully launched a suite of new products. These products
have already gained traction in their target markets and
provide significant confidence for the future.

Statement
RapidCloud International Plc  l  Annual Report 2014 4
2014 was a year of significant development for RapidCloud
across all metrics including financial performance, operational
progress and strategic acquisitions.
Personnel and Product Development 
During the year we significantly increased our investment in the
Company’s sales and technical capabilities increasing total staff
numbers to 160 from 58 last year.
Through continued R&D investment and the acquisition of
Exxelnet, RapidCloud now offers complete end-to-end solutions
to enterprises including infrastructure hosting, back-end
software applications, front-end design and internet marketing
product suites.
Whilst we offer a complete end-to-end solution, staying ahead
of our competition is key, and as such R&D and in-house product
development is core to our ongoing success.
Our investment in developing new enterprise level products is
leading directly to higher value work, and we are ‘moving up
the value chain’.
Products Launched in 2014 and post period
Within 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, we launched the
following products: 
RapidDocs is a cloud-based, multi-user Document Management
System to manage the workflow, creation, retrieval, archival
and searching of massive amount of digital documents or
images in real-time across multi-devices from anywhere,
anytime.
RapidDMS is a cloud-based Dealership Management & Reward
System to assist manufacturers or distributors in managing its
dealers’ network by providing modules and real-time business
intelligence information across multi-devices.
RapidSEO is a Search Engine Optimisation solution that
optimises web content and page structure to improve lead
conversion rate and the overall performance of a website.
RapidSEO will help channel prospective buyers by obtaining top
ranking on major search engines.
RapidSEM can structure, control and determine the relevancy
of online advertisement campaigns to maximise its full
potential, resulting in better lead conversions. With RapidSEM
reporting tools, clients can monitor the effectiveness of the
marketing campaign and refine it for greater results.
We are already gaining traction with these new products, which
importantly move us up the value chain and into important new
market segments such as the public sector.
Our improved
performance,
across all business
units, is validation of our
skill sets, our ability to
deliver innovative products
and services while
maintaining high customer
service levels. Importantly
so, our wins in 2014 is a
testament to our ability to
scale our cloud solutions
to handle big data
requirements for both
private and public sector.

New Contract Wins 
We announced several new contract wins throughout the year,
which demonstrated the early success of both our new sales
teams and enhanced product suite.
The most notable and material contract announced within the
year was with the national legislature of a country in Southeast
Asia. This contract is to assist in the development of a
cloud-based management system which can rapidly process vast
amounts of legislation data while providing members of the
legislature easy access to required information such as
documents, video, profiles and events through a single secure
interface. This win is a significant validation of skill sets and high
customer service levels, servicing both the private and public
sectors. We see it as a testament to our ability to scale our cloud
solutions to handle big data requirements. 
Outlook 
2014 saw progressive expansion in customer numbers, our
geographic footprint and our service offering.
With the acquisition of Exxelnet we gained not only a foothold
in the key territory of Singapore, but also an expert team of
software engineers and digital marketing specialists which are
now fully integrated into the enlarged group and whose
capabilities broadened our offering to customers.
With a broadened offering comes the opportunity to secure
higher value work, and with our enhanced sales team operating
in all our five regions we are continue to see a strengthening
pipeline develop.
This along with catering to our existing valued customer base,
has led to an increase in total client numbers and an increased
rate of retention at 75%.
Our business continues to be profitable and cash generative, as
we continue with deepening our footprint and expansion
strategy. The Board expects continued strategic expansion and
a strong performance in the current year and beyond.

Directors (continued)
236655 Rapid Cloud pp01-pp07  03/06/2015  11:57  Page 7 RapidCloud International Plc  l  Annual Report 2014 8
The directors of RapidCloud International Plc (‘RCI’ or the ‘Company’) present their report together with the audited consolidated
financial statements of RCI and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Principal activities and business review
The Group’s principal activity during the year was the provision of Software Solutions to businesses through Southeast Asia. A full
review of the Group’s business operations is set out in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Statement.
The Company was incorporated in Jersey on 15 March 2013 as a private company (RapidCloud Limited). On 3 July 2013 the Company
re-registered as a public company and changed its name to RapidCloud International Plc. On 14 August 2013, the Company was
admitted to AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
During the year the Group increased both its client base and product offering which has contributed to the increase in revenue
up to RM17.82 million (2013: RM11.3 million) and profit after tax of RM3.67 million (2013: RM2.53 million).
Outlook
The directors are extremely pleased with progress over the past year which has brought a significant increase in revenues and
profitability. Management is focused on delivering on its planned geographical expansion by incorporating an operation in
Indonesia during the year and acquiring a company in Singapore whilst continuously exploring ways of expanding its client base
and offering new innovative software solutions.
Results and dividends 
During the year the Group made a profit after taxation of RM3.67 million (2013: RM2.53 million).
Dividends totalling RM0.58 million were paid during the year.
Risks relating to the Group and its business
Competition
There is significant competition in the software industry with low barriers to entry, new entrants and larger competitors with
significant financial resources. There is a risk that competitors have or will develop products that are competitive to the Group in
terms of functionality, quality or price.
Technological evolution
Changing customer needs, introduction of new products and continual technologies evolution may impact the Group’s business
products. To mitigate this risk the Group continually invest in the Research and Development of new customer centric products.
Economic, legislative and political risks
The Group may be affected by the adverse developments in political, economic and regulatory environment in which the Group
operates. Uncertainties in the political and economic environment include: expropriation; nationalisation; inflation and deflation;
changes in interest rates and taxation regime and currency exchange control. Any deterioration in the economic climate could
result in the delay or cancellation of customers’ technology investment projects and in a more prolonged economic downturn, it
may lead to the overall decline in the sales of the Group that restrict the growth and profitability of the Group. Whilst the Group
strives to continue to take effective measures to protect it against such risks with prudential financial management and efficient
operating procedures, there is no assurance that adverse political, economic and regulatory environments will not adversely affect
the Group.
Foreign currency risk
The Group may experience fluctuations in exchange rate that may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s profitability or
pricing competitiveness for its products and services. There can be no guarantee that the Group would be able to compensate or
hedge against such adverse effects and negative exchange rate effects could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business
and financial performance.

Protection of intellectual property
The Group have protected its proprietary rights on its software for major technology platforms where the core products are built.
These protected platforms are SME WebCombo, E-Commerce Combo and TotalWEB! Lite. The Group is also reliant on the internal
processes and systems to protect such rights. Whilst the Directors believe that the Group’s efforts to protect its proprietary rights
in its proprietary systems, processes and software are adequate, there is a risk that they may not suffice to prevent misappropriation
of its intellectual property and it may not be able to detect unauthorised use of or take appropriate steps to enforce, its intellectual
property rights.

To the members of RapidCloud International plc For the year ended 31 December 2014
We have audited the Group financial statements of RapidCloud International plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 which
comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes. The financial
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law
1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 10, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APB’s website at
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year
then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to
you if, in our opinion:
• proper accounting records have not been kept, or proper returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• we have not received any information or explanation that was necessary for our audit.

 1. Accounting policies
RapidCloud International Plc (‘RCI’ or the ‘Company’) is a company registered and incorporated in Jersey on 15 March 2013. The
address of the registered office is 13-14 Esplanade, St. Helier, Jersey, JE1 1BD.
The consolidated financial statements of RapidCloud International Plc and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) are presented in
Ringgit Malaysia (‘RM’), which is the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. The functional currency for
each individual entity is the local currency of each individual entity. The primary economic environment for the Group is Malaysia.
All amounts are prepared to the nearest thousand (RM’000) except where otherwise indicated.
2. Adoption of new and revised IFRS standards
There were no IFRS standards or IFRIC interpretations adopted for the first time in these financial statements that had a material
impact on the Group. The following standards have been adopted for the first time in this financial year.
IFRS 10 – Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 11 – Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 – Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
Amendment to IAS 36 – Recoverable amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
The Group has not applied in advance the following accounting standards and interpretations, including the consequential
amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective. The transfer to these new or revised standards and interpretation is
not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Amendments to IAS 1 – Disclosure Initiative 
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS38 – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation 
3. Significant accounting policies
3.1 Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as
adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’)
3.2 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that are
measured at the fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.
3.3 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by the Company
and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:
• has power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses
control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in
the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the
date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Purchase method
Under the purchase method, the results of the subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are included from the date of acquisition or up
to the date of disposal. At the date of acquisition, the fair values of the subsidiaries’ net assets are determined and these values
are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. The cost of acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at
the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for
control of the acquire, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.

236655 Rapid Cloud pp22-pp44  03/06/2015  11:59  Page 22 RapidCloud International Plc  l  Annual Report 2014 23
3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
3.3 Basis of consolidation (continued)
Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions are eliminated; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless
costs cannot be recovered. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to ensure consistency
of accounting policies with those of the Group.
3.4 Goodwill
Goodwill represent the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the Group’s share of the fair values of the
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiaries at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for impairment
annually. The impairment value of goodwill is recognised immediately in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill
is not reversed in a subsequent period. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair values of the identifiable net assets
of the subsidiaries exceeds the cost of the business combinations, the excess is recognised as income immediately in profit or loss.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows
from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash-generating units. Subject to operating
segment ceiling test, for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated
are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored
for internal reporting purposes. The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is
allocated to a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value-in-use and its fair value less costs of disposal.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable
amount. Impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss, unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which such impairment
loss is recognised directly against any revaluation surplus for the asset to the extent that the impairment loss does not exceed the
amount in the revaluation surplus for that same asset. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating
units) and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units)
on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods
are assessed at the end of each reporting period for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment
loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount since the last impairment
loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been
recognised for asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount,
in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
3.5 Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entities operate (the functional currency). The consolidated financial information is presented in Malaysia
Ringgits (‘RM’), which is RCI’s functional and presentational currency.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at
year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income.

3.5 Foreign currency translation (continued)
Foreign operations
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to RM at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period.
Revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. All exchange
differences arising from translation are taken directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the
translation reserve. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income
relating to that particular foreign operation is reclassified from equity to profit or loss.
3.6 Financial instruments
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a
contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the time-frame established by the market concerned, and are
initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified at fair value through profit or
loss, which are initially measured at fair value.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market
are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate method, except for short-term
receivables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of assets
For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, a provision for impairment of receivables is established when
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the
receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets’ carrying amount and the recoverable amount.
Provisions for impairment of receivables are included in the statement of comprehensive income.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual
agreement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with interest
expense recognised on an effective basis.
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised costs of a financial liability and of allocating interest
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments
through the expected life of the financial liability or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial
recognition.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
3.7 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is provided
to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of each asset on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives, as
follows:
Fixtures and equipment 5 years
Office equipment 5 – 10 years
Computer equipment 3 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Renovation 10 years
Signboard 10 years
Sun Microsystems 5 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each statement of financial position date to determine
whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets are tested for impairment to estimate
the assets’ recoverable amounts. Any impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within the
statement of comprehensive income.
3.8 Software development expenditure
Software research costs are charged as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Software development costs are
charged as an expense in the period incurred unless RCI believes:
• an asset is create that can be identified (a new software product);
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
• the development cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
The capitalised software development costs of the Group are amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of
the assets which is currently assessed to be 5 years.
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use
and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those
from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in those expense categories
consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
3.9 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost and comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, deposits
held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts
that are repayable on demand are included within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement of financial position. For the
purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts if they form an integral part of the
Group’s cash management.
3.10 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating
leases. Payments under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the statement of
comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
3.11 Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be
reliably measured. Revenue is recognised when the services are supplied and is measured at the fair value of consideration received
or receivable net of sales tax, returns, rebates or discounts and after eliminating sales with the Group. The Group recognises
revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and specific delivery criteria have been met.
Deferred revenue is recognised to the extent that services have been invoiced but have not yet been delivered and accordingly
are recognised as a liability within accruals and deferred income in the statement of financial position.
3.12 Financial income and expenses
Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances and deposits. Interest income is recognised when the right to
receive payments is established.
Financial expenses comprise interest payable on bank loans, hire purchase liabilities’ charges and other financial costs and charges.
Interest payable is recognised on an accrual basis.
3.13 Employee benefits
Short term employee benefits
Wages, salaries, paid annual leave, paid sick leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are recognised as an expense in the period
in which the associated services are rendered by employees.
Post-employment benefits
The Group pays monthly contributions to defined contribution plans. The legal or constructive obligation of the Group is limited
to the amount that they agree to contribute to the plan. The contributions to the plan are charged to the statement of
comprehensive income in the period to which they relate.
3.14 Current and deferred income tax
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of
financial position date. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. 
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the statement of
financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income
tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
4. Significant accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgement, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and
expenses. Judgements and estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates may
differ from the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the future financial years are as follows:
Depreciation, useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment
The Directors estimate the useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment in order to calculate the depreciation
charges. Changes in these estimates could result in changes being required to the annual depreciation charges in the statement
of comprehensive income and the carrying values of the property, plant and equipment in the statement of financial position.
Amortisation, useful lives and residual values of software development assets
The Directors estimate the useful lives and residual values of software development assets in order to calculate the amortisation
charges. Changes in these estimates could result in changes being required to the annual amortisation charges in the statement
of comprehensive income and the carrying values of the software development assets in the statements of financial position.

4. Significant accounting judgements and estimates (continued)
Deferred tax liability
The Group estimates future profitability in arriving at the fair value of the deferred tax assets and liabilities. If the final tax outcome
is different to the estimated deferred tax amount, the resulting changes will be reflected in the statement of comprehensive
income, unless the tax relates to an item charged to equity in which case the changes in tax estimates will also be reflected in
equity.
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following significant judgements, apart
from those involving estimations, which may have a significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements:
• impairment of assets (including receivables, goodwill, software development expenditure and property, plant and
equipment);
• timing of recognition of revenue on project contracts.
5. Revenue
Revenue represents the invoiced value of goods sold and services rendered, net of discounts and returns. Revenue is derived from
the Group’s principal activity of the provision of computer products and services using cloud computing technology along with
the development of software to support the services.
6. Operating segments
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur
expenses. IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires disclosure of the operating segments that are reported to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker (‘CODM’). The CODM at the end of the financial year under review has been identified as the Board of Directors
who have responsibility for planning and controlling the activities of the Group. The Group’s reportable segment has been
identified as the provision of Cloud Computing services. Across the Group there is considered to be a commonality in the nature
of services, the type of customer, the methods used to provide services and the regulatory environment.
All operations of the Group are carried out in Southeast Asia. All revenues therefore arise within Southeast Asia. No single external
customer amounts to 10 per cent or more of the Group’s revenue.
As the Group only has one reportable segment, no further segmental information is disclosed.

Software development assets comprise capitalised development work on software products. These costs are internally generated
wages and salaries costs arising from the Group’s software developers and are recognised only if all the following conditions
are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified;
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefit; and
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Once development has been completed the software development intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over
their useful lives, which is assessed annually and is currently considered to be 5 years.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual
impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups
of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written
down to its recoverable amount.
There have been no impairments in the periods under review.

There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer fund to the Group in the form of cash dividends
or repayment of loans and advances.
(b) Acquisition of subsidiaries
(i) Emerge Systems (Thailand) Ltd and Sharksurf Philippines Incorporated
Although the Group owns less than half of the ownership interest in Emerge Systems (Thailand) Ltd (‘EST’) and Sharksurf Philippines
Incorporated (‘SPI’) and less than half of their voting powers, the Directors have determined that the Group controls these two
entities. On 1 January 2014, the Group obtained control of EST and SPI by virtue of written undertakings with other shareholders
of EST and SPI and the Group now has full and absolute control of the management and business operations of EST and SPI. EST
and SPI have therefore been included in these 2014 financial statements as subsidiaries. In the 2013 financial statements they were
treated as associated companies (note 15).

RCSG was acquired at a cash consideration of RM2,520,000 payable to the sellers and with deferred consideration (contingent on
future profitability over 36 months following the acquisition date) to be settled by up to 650,000 new shares of RCI, which are
estimated at RM2,074,000.
The goodwill recognised above comprises expected synergies, revenue growth and future product and market developments.
These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill because they do not meet the criteria for separately identifiable
intangible assets.
The acquired RCSG subsidiary contributed RM3,679,000 in revenue and operating profits of RM828,000 from the date of acquisition
to 31 December 2014. If the acquisition of RCSG had been completed on the first day of the financial year, the RCSG revenue would
have contributed RM6,057,000 to Group revenues and RCSG operating profit would have been RM171,000.

16. Intangible assets and goodwill (continued)
Impairment testing of goodwill
RCI tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The
recoverable amounts of the CGU’s are determined from value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions for the value-in-use
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to forecast profitability. These assumptions
have been revised in the year to take account of the current economic environment. Management estimates discount rates using
pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each CGU. Future
cash flows are derived from the most recent financial budget approved by management for the next five years, beyond that period
cash flows are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3%. The rate used to discount forecast future cash flows is 10% which represents
the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
In 2014 no impairment charge has been made against goodwill for any CGU (2013: RMnil) as the impairment tests resulted in
headroom for each CGU. RCI has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGU’s carrying value and sensitizing
the discount rate and reducing the long term growth rate to 0% does not create an impairment charge in any CGU.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk that may arise from exposure to a single debtor. Exposure to credit and
currency risks related to trade and other receivables is disclosed in note 24. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of
trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values. All of the Group’s trade receivables have been reviewed for indicators
of impairment. 
Certain trade receivables were found to be impaired and a provision of RM601,000 (2013: RM424,000) has been included at the
year end, the movement of those provisions are as follows:

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The Group’s financial risk management policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available for the development
of the Group’s business whilst managing its risks. The Group does not engage in speculative transactions or hedging transactions.
The Group’s principal financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents. The main purpose of these financial instruments
is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial instruments such as receivables and payables that arise directly
from its operations.
The Directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management and they recognise
that financial risk management is an area in which they may need to develop specific policies should the Group become exposed
to further financial risks as the business develops.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, market price risk, foreign currency risk
and interest rate risk. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of these risks. The Board reviews and
agrees policies for managing each of these risks as and when they arise. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout
the financial information.
Credit Risk
Credit risk arises mainly from the inability of customers to make payments when due. The Group has adopted a policy of only
dealing with counterparties that the Directors consider to be credit worthy. Receivables are monitored on an on-going basis via
Group’s management reporting procedures and action will be taken for long outstanding debts deemed irrecoverable.
The carrying amounts of the financial assets recorded on the statement of financial position at the end of the reporting period
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. Cash at banks are placed with financial
institutions that the Directors consider to be credit worthy.
The Group’s credit risk exposure relates to the Group’s debts and is discussed in greater detail in note 17.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. As part of its overall
prudent liquidity risk management, the Group actively manages its cash flows and ensures that sufficient funding is in place to
meet the obligations as and when they fall due.

Market Price Risk
Market price risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the Group’s income. The objective of market price risk
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Fair values
Generally, the carrying amounts of all financial assets and liabilities of the Group as disclosed in the notes to the financial
information are approximate to their faire values.
Capital Risk Management

Group at a Glance
888 has made several strategic changes to address 
evolving challenges in the e-gaming industry. The Group has 
transformed its business from being a consumer focused 
casino and poker operator into two separate lines of 
business: “B2C” and “B2B”, each of which has a separate 
mangement structure.
888 now offers consumers worldwide all four core B2C 
product offerings: Casino, Poker, Bingo and Sportsbetting as
well as Live Dealer and Backgammon. We are experiencing 
rapid growth especially in our B2C’s “Emerging Offering” 
which includes Bingo, Sportsbook, Live Dealer Casino and 
Backgammon.
888 is also developing its B2B business line and is becoming 
a leading provider of technology, operations and know-how 
to business partners, using its existing capabilities. 888 is 
uniquely positioned to work with carefully selected strategic 
partners who are either aiming to monetise their existing 
database, brand loyalty and media assets or looking to 
enhance their existing online gaming operations.  
888 has already secured a number of high profile agreements
which highlight both the potential of this strategic direction 
and 888’s unique position as a leading operator offering a full 
service model in the B2B field. These include partnerships in 
2007 with Riley’s, Tower Torneos and LuckyAce. 2008 has
seen an acceleration in B2B development with several more
deals in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, including 
the groundbreaking partnership with the UK Football Pools 
(Sportech Plc) highlighting the potential for 888 in this area. 
The development and growth of the B2B business is an 
integral part of 888’s growth strategy for 2009 and beyond.

Expanding our Offering
888ladies, launched in February 2008 in the UK, is a 
gender-targeted bingo offering that has become in a 
relatively short period of time one of the most popular online
bingo rooms in the UK. 
The brand has been successfully launched, and continues 
to prosper, as a bingo site that is not just all about bingo, 
but as much about being an 888lady. Successful online and 
offline marketing activity has enabled 888ladies to convey
this core message most effectively into an emerging and 
competitive market place. We aim to provide our customers 
with not just a leisure activity but a way to access a different,
indulgent lifestyle that simply cannot be accessed through 
any other bingo, or indeed gaming, site.
888ladies has six bingo rooms, two of which are open 
24 hours a day, seven days a week, all offering an ever 
increasing customer base an ever growing number of bingo 
games. 
Customers can play 75/90 ball bingo and buy tickets for 
big cash games, including the monthly guaranteed £8,888 
jackpot game. Over 2,500 customers play at 888ladies 
every day while there are over 30,000 funded players on the 
site. A figure which continues to grow, day on day, month
by month.
The site has very quickly become established as a firm 
favourite among the bingo playing community and 888ladies 
has already received many plaudits from within the industry.
Indeed, 888ladies took the prestigious eGaming Review 
Bingo Operator of the Year Award in 2008 only a few 
months after its launch.
888ladies aims to provide its customers with a warm and 
loving environment, actively developing a community by 
creating a lively and buzzing chat room as well as a daily
updated blog. It continues to enjoy significant growth and 
looks set to remain a leader in this sector for years to come.

Chairman’s Statement
“2008 has been a year of 
significant change, both to 
our business model and to the 
macro-economic environment in 
which we compete.”
On behalf of the Board of 888 Holdings plc, I am pleased to 
present the financial results for the year ended 31 December
2008. This has been a year of significant change, both to our 
business model and to the macroeconomic environment in 
which we compete.
B2C
We grew our core B2C offering impressively in 2008, and
now offer all four key online gaming segments: Casino, 
Poker, Sportsbetting and Bingo. Our leading Casino 
business was again one of the main drivers for the Group’s
revenue growth and our online brand, 888Casino, had a very
successful year. It is now available in 19 different languages 
and underpinned 888 being awarded the prestigious 
eGaming Awards 2008 Casino Operator of the Year Award. 
Our Poker operation recorded a small decline in Total 
Revenue but expanded geographically with a new localised 
offering launched in 11 new languages in 2008, bringing it to
a total of 20 languages.
We have continued the successful consolidation of our
business away from a US market dominated Casino and 
Poker model to a more internationally diverse gaming 
entertainment business with a significantly expanded 
product offering. This now includes our market leading Bingo
offering, sports betting, ‘Live Dealer’ and backgammon and
importantly an integration infrastructure which opens up our 
platform to games from other vendors.
B2B
As part of a strategic move to expand our business model, 
we have continued the development of our B2B offering 
to become a leading provider of technology, operations 
and knowledge to business partners, using our existing 
capabilities. We believe there is a huge opportunity in this 
area especially as the operator environment is fragmented
and existing lottery operators are optimistic that online 
offerings will become a major future growth opportunity.
This development has required many technological and 
cultural changes in our organisation but we are now reaping 
the rewards and we have first mover advantage as a B2C 
operator ‘moving into’ B2B with a complete package of the 
services we can offer to our B2B customers.
Employees
I would like to thank all 888 employees, management and 
customers for making 2008 another record year, despite 
what developed into an extremely difficult economic 
environment in the latter part of the year.
Responsible Gaming
Responsible gaming is a fundamental pillar to our business. 
Our aim is to ensure our services are used responsibly.
During the year we have expanded our activities in this 
important area as more fully described in the Enhanced 
Business Review.
Financial Results
2008 was another year of strong growth for 888. Total 
Operating Income (“TOI”) increased 21% to US$263 million 
(2007: US$217 million) underpinned by 208% growth in our 
Emerging Offering to US$45 million (2007: US$14 million) 
and a 15% rise in TOI from Casino to US$139 million (2007: 
US$120 million). EBITDA* increased 23% to US$56 million 
(2007: US$46 million).
* Before share benefit charges of US$8.4 million (2007: 
US$7.8 million) and exchange rate losses of US$2.6 million 
(2007: gains of US$1.1 million).

Dividend
Given our strong financial results, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of 2.9 cents per share
in addition to our interim dividend of 2.5 cents per 
share paid in October 2008.
Outlook
2008 has been a transformational year for 888 and 
we have made tremendous progress in uniquely 
challenging economic circumstances. We have 
become a world class B2B end-to-end gaming 
solution provider whilst maintaining and growing 
our position as one of the leading operators in the 
e-gaming world serving consumers globally under our 
own B2C brands. Our pipeline for 2009 is promising 
and your Board expects to continue our progress 
across all business parts for the foreseeable future.

Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s Review
“We believe that the combined B2C
and B2B model is an essential key 
to successfully growing the business 
in 2009, and we therefore intend to 
continue focusing on both these lines of 
business.”
Introduction
The first half of 2008 was again a very successful trading 
period for 888 delivering record half year results and a 
seventh consecutive period of semi-annual growth. Trading 
during the traditionally weaker summer months of July and 
August remained solid with TOI in August growing above 
July’s level. However, like most business sectors, we were
not immune to the unprecedented ferocity with which the 
global economy slowed. Growth in September began to slow
and that coupled with the extraordinarily volatile exchange 
rate movements — especially the sharp decline in the value 
of European currencies versus the US dollar — has impacted 
the business.
Despite the difficult circumstances, our underlying business 
remained solid throughout the year, and we have delivered
21% revenue growth year on year. We are confident in 
our business model and strategy and find our successful 
combination of a world class B2C organisation and an 
innovative B2B provider in the sector a strong model 
that enables us to deal better with the current challenges 
the industry faces. As proof, our firm foundation of B2C 
earnings, which was significantly expanded and diversified 
in 2008, was complemented by a rapid growth in our B2B 
business in the year.
TOI increased 21% to US$263 million (2007: US$217 million) 
underpinned by 208% growth in our Emerging Offering to 
US$45 million (2007: US$14 million) with EBITDA* increase 
of 23% to US$56 million (2007: US$46 million).
* Before share benefit charges of US$8.4 million (2007: 
US$7.8 million) and exchange rate losses of US$2.6 million 
(2007: gains of US$1.1 million).
Delivering on our Strategy
2008 marked another milestone in the delivery of our 
strategic goals in the completion of the transformation of our 
product offering and the significant evolution of our strategic
partnership programme into a significant B2B business.
In the first half of the year we made strategic investments 
in both our offering and our brand. The constant drive 
to acquire and retain customers through an enhanced 
and innovative offering saw 888 transformed into a 
comprehensive provider of the four key online gaming 
segments: Casino, Poker, Sportsbetting and Bingo as well as 
additional niche products such as Backgammon.
In March we launched www.888sport.com (“888sport”), 
a pan-European sports betting offering, developed with 
Blue Square, the interactive gaming and betting division 
of Rank Group Plc. The service was initially launched 
in five markets and we have also recently launched in 
one additional market and plan to further expand our 
geographic reach in 2009. Our sports product delivered solid 
performance in its first year.

Our Bingo offering has been significantly expanded and 
enhanced during the year. 888ladies, our new sub-brand 
targeted predominantly at a female audience, was officially 
launched in February and backed by a high profile TV 
campaign featuring well-known celebrity comedian Vic 
Reeves. The launch was a huge success with customers and 
the industry alike as was recognised when we were named 
Bingo Operator of the Year at the eGaming Awards. 
At the end of the year we announced the further expansion 
in the B2B side of our Bingo business, achieved by signing 
agreements to launch three new Bingo networks in addition 
to the seven we already operate. One of these in Spain will 
be, for the first time, a localised offering tailored specifically 
for local tastes and customers. In addition to operating our 
own brands we also host, on a full managed service basis, a 
number of skins and during the year agreements were signed
to add another six new partners to the network. Bingo 
remains the fastest growing segment in the online gaming
industry and we feel we are very well positioned in this 
market. The result of these activities was significant growth in 
the bingo business in 2008.
As well as launching our own new products, in 2008 we 
have evolved our strategy toward the creation of a games-
ecosystem powered by our industry-leading integration 
infrastructure. This enables us to introduce a diversified 
offering to existing and new players rapidly and with a low
cost of development and integration. By opening up our 
platform for integration with games from other vendors we 
are offering our customers an accelerated rate of new games
launches while offering third party game providers the best 
platform on which to debut or grow the exposure of their 
titles. Over a dozen games integration contracts have been 
signed giving us access to more than 1,000 new games 
— of which 22 are already launched in various parts of our 
business. 
This dual approach, which gives us the ability to introduce 
games easily and quickly into local markets, will remain 
a core element of our strategy as we strive to increase 
customer loyalty and lifetime value and continue to attract 
new players.
2008 was a transformational year in terms of our B2B 
business, which grew rapidly throughout the year. The real 
step change for our B2B operations came in June with 
the ground-breaking partnership we signed with Sportech 
PLC, one of the UK’s leading gaming businesses. Under 
the partnership 888 provides Sportech with a turnkey online 
gaming operation which includes our market leading gaming 
and back-end software, customer support and payments 
processing as well as — for the first time — the marketing
of all their products online. We believe the combination of 
Sportech’s brands in global pools sports betting coupled 
with our software, operations, Internet marketing and online 
gaming capabilities will yield significant mutual benefits. 
Following this deal we are well positioned as one of the 
leading B2B providers to the industry, and given our recently 
announced deals and ongoing activity with some of the 
leading online gaming operators, B2B will continue to be our 
main growth engine in the coming years. 
I am pleased that we continue to be awarded industry 
accolades for our innovation and our offering. In 2008 we 
retained, for the third successive year, eGaming Awards
Casino operator of the Year endorsing our global reach 
and market-leading position in this category and were also 
awarded the aforementioned Bingo operator of the Year. We
also picked up Leisure Report’s “Best Betting and Gaming 
Award” for a second year running and “Operator of the Year”
beating strong competition from across the general leisure
sector.
Our approach and success in B2C marketing is one of 
888’s key differentiators; where 888 innovates, many follow.
Marketing was a key component to the success of our 
product launches for both 888sport and 888ladies. Strategic
sport sponsorships and associations such as Sevilla FC, 
World Snooker Championship and the Shane Warne
captaincy of the 888 poker team give the brand valuable 
high profile visibility. These initiatives, coupled with our ability 
to localise our marketing efforts across multiple channels, 
continue to support successfully our geographic expansion 
and generation of significant numbers of new players.

Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s Review
continued
We continue to recognise the importance of customer loyalty,
as building strong relationships leads to people playing more
games, more often, for more time. As product offerings are
increasingly tailored to individual markets and segments, 
the CRM teams continued to run localised promotions 
throughout the year. Alongside front of house promotions, 
ongoing improvement in our support systems and services 
also helped to ensure that customers kept coming back 
to 888. 
During 2008 we also opened up further communication 
channels through which we are able to contact customers. 
The magazine ‘Eight’ remains popular amongst customers, 
and direct mail has now been augmented with SMS 
messaging. This, coupled with targeted segmentation of 
the customer base, now means players receive information 
of particular interest to them immediately. The delivery of 
promotions and tournament reminders in this way also helps
to drive traffic online.
People
Our ability to recruit and retain high calibre employees is 
fundamental to our success and we continue to add talented 
people to our world-class team. It is not just that our people 
have a direct influence on the way our customers feel when 
they are playing our games — the integrity and expertise 
of our people is central to our strategy, execution and 
innovation. I would like to personally thank each and every 
employee for their support and hard work in the past year.
Regulation
The regulatory landscape within which we operate remains 
unstable in some regions. Whilst the European Court of 
Justice’s ruling in the Placanica case restated the importance 
of EU regulations to our industry, there have been some 
mixed messages from the EU Parliament. Generally, however,
we view EU developments positively and we have seen a 
continued trend throughout the year of additional European 
jurisdictions embarking on a path to license and regulate 
online gaming, a route which we clearly welcome. 
As stated in our announcement dated 5 June 2007, we 
have initiated preliminary discussions with the United States 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York 
relating to our activity in the US prior to the signing of the
UIGEA. It is too early to assess any particular outcome of 
these discussions.
Responsible Gaming
We take our responsibilities as an international gaming
operator extremely seriously. We continue to lead the market 
in our support of the prevention of under-age and problem 
gaming and promotion of responsible gaming. 2008 was no 
exception and was marked by the introduction of a unique 
product called the Observer. Observer was developed with
Dr Mark Griffiths, a Chartered Psychologist and Professor 
of Gambling Studies at the Nottingham Trent University.
A complex set of parameters including financial and 
behavioural data are used to flag up customers who might 
be at risk from becoming a problem gambler. This data is 
analysed and investigated and action taken in partnership 
with the customer to prevent or resolve a potential problem 
situation.
Last year we launched a specialist website 
www.888responsible.com dedicated exclusively to 
responsible gaming. It is a comprehensive site covering
all aspects of responsible gaming practices, dealing with 
problem gambling and preventing under-age gambling.
In 2008 we also ran a specific campaign aimed at raising 
potential under-age gamers and parents’ awareness of 
under-age gambling issues.
Our 2009 Focus
We believe that the combined B2C/B2B model is an
essential key to growing the business successfully in 2009, 
and therefore intend to continue focusing on both these lines 
of business. 
We have taken the decision to operate B2B as a separate
business unit as our strategy for our B2B business is to 
become a leading provider of technology, operations and 
knowledge to new entrants to the market using our existing 
capabilities. The B2B business will be relaunched under 
a separate brand with its own sales force and we have 
appointed a separate Managing Director to the business. 
We have a very strong pipeline with more than 50 deals
at various stages. We will expand organically but will also 
look to grow our footprint through the acquisition of B2B 
technology enablers to accelerate our growth. We have 
already announced a deal this year, signed in January,
focusing on Continental Europe and expect to announce 
more deals during the year.
Alongside the fast developing B2B business we will continue 
to focus on our B2C offerings with the introduction of a no 
download ‘games tab’, Live dealer in Europe and Bingo 
into a number of additional European markets including 
Spain. These developments, alongside further geographic 
expansion are expected to drive the growth of our B2C 
business even in these turbulent times. 
16254888COM FRONT.indd   10 16254888COM FRONT.indd   10 08/04/2009   17:46 08/04/2009   17:46 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 11
16254 08/04/2009 Proof 8
Third party games integration continues and 2009 will see a 
major step as the platform will become a full multi-currency 
offering, allowing customers to play localised games that
appeal to them, in their local language, in their local currency.
This is expected to have a positive impact on both our B2C 
and B2B businesses. 
Outlook
Our plans for 2009 will be to both grow our player base and 
maximise customers’ Life Time Value — for both us and our 
B2B partners — by offering new and innovative products. 
Our B2B business, which saw the first full year of operation 
in 2008, is already showing further growth in 2009.
Our sustained performance in B2C will be achieved by 
a continued focus on customer needs and the growing 
attractiveness of our offering. Specifically, opening up our 
platform to integration with games created by other vendors, 
will continue delivering customers with ongoing innovation 
in 2009. 
The combination of our leading B2C business and our fast-
growing B2B business gives us a very good base for growth
in 2009 and beyond.
The broader economic climate remains challenging as does 
the weakness of the European currencies, affecting our US$ 
reported revenues. However, whilst remaining cautious in
our outlook, we are confident our customers will continue to 
enjoy our services and that the overall strength and resilience 
of the business will ensure we weather this turbulent period 
well. Just as we managed to grow market share after the 
industry was hit by the closure of the US market, we are
confident we will outperform the market in these challenging 
times and continue to grow our business.

General
The Group achieved strong financial results in 2008 with 
TOI increasing by 21% to $263 million (2006: $217 million), 
EBITDA

 increasing 6% to $49 million (2007: $46 million) 
and basic Earnings Per Share

 increasing 8% to 13.4¢ 
(2007: 12.4¢). The Group continued to be highly cash 
generative with Net cash generated from operating activities 
increasing 22% to $56 million (2007: $46 million) and its financial 
position remains strong as ever with cash and equivalents at 
year end at $98 million with no debt (2007: US$104 million). 
Turnover growth was particularly strong in Emerging 
Offerings, mainly Bingo, generating $45 million in 2008 
(2007: $14 million).
Excellent growth was achieved during the first nine months of 
2008. In August, the Group reported record half year results 
and a seventh consecutive period of semi-annual growth with 
revenue from core operations boosted by the successful launch 
of 888ladies and 888sport. Growth continued until September 
when performance was impacted by the global economic 
crisis and extreme volatility in exchange rates. Our underlying 
business was not immune to these unprecedented conditions 
although our core business remained solid.

Geographical segmentation 
As the table below illustrates, in 2008 888’s turnover grew in all reported geographic markets led by 28% in Europe (excluding 
UK), followed by 23% in the Americas (excluding USA), 15% in the UK and 13% in the Rest of The World.

Rounded.
As a result of the strong revenue growth during the year 
in Europe (excluding the UK), this region now represents 
44% of 888’s TOI (2007: 42%) followed by the UK at 41%, 
Americas (excluding USA) at 8% and the Rest of the 
World at 7%. 
Expenses
During 2008 the Group continued its investment in 
infrastructure as required to enable its B2B capabilities while 
continuing the development of its B2C offerings.
Operating expenses, which include mainly salaries, 
chargebacks, returned e-cheques and payment service 
providers’ commissions, totalled $84.6 million (2007: $64.9 
million) representing 32% of TOI (2007: 30%). Salaries and 
benefits, representing the largest component of operating 
expenses, increased by 30% to $40.3 million (2007: $31.0 
million) reflecting the investment in infrastructure required to 
complete the build-up of our B2B line of business. 
Chargebacks increased during the year to $4.8 million in 
2008 (2007: $2.8 million). However, when combined with 
expenses related to commisions paid to payment service 
providers, $15.3 million (2007: $13.4 million), the total ($20.1 
million (2007: $16.2 million)) represents a stable ratio to TOI 
7.6% (2007: 7.5%). This shift between these cost items is a 
result of the Group’s efficient implementation of processing 
optimisation aimed at increased processing volume and an 
increased approval rate while keeping overall costs stable. 
Finally, given that 2007 comparative figures represent less than 
seven months of Bingo activity, the comparable ratio reflects 
enhanced efficiency. 
Research and development expenses increased in 2008 by 
17% to $27.4 million (2007: $23.5 million). This was primarily 
a result of necessary investment in the Group’s technological 
infrastructure and upgrading B2B capabilities to become a 
service provider to business partners and due to adverse 
currency movements during the first three quarters of the year. 
16254888COM FRONT.indd   13 16254888COM FRONT.indd   13 08/04/2009   17:47 08/04/2009   17:47 888 Holdings plc www.888holdingsplc.com 14

Enhanced Business Review continued
Marketing expenses during the year were $80.2 million 
(2007: $70.9 million), representing a 31% ratio to TOI (2007: 
33%), and well within our target. 
Attracting valuable new customers at the right cost is a key 
driver of 888’s business profitability. In 2008, the Group 
continued to focus on attracting and retaining customers 
from selected segments aiming to maximise customer life 
time value and maximum return on marketing cost. During 
the year, 888’s marketing team recruited more than 246,000 
new Casino and Poker first time depositors (“FTDs”) from 
more than 1.1 million new real money registrations with an 
average cost per acquisition (“CPA”) in 2008 of $232 
(2007: $225).
Administrative expenses
1
 increased by 22% to $22.0 
million (2007: $17.9 million). The increase in Administrative 
expenses during the year is attributable mainly to a $2.6 
million foreign exchange loss (2007: gain of $1.1 million) 
and a $2.2 million adverse currency effect within the salary 
component in this line item. 
Share benefit charges
As part of 888’s commitment to invest in human capital, 
eligible management and employees receive equity awards 
under the 888 All Employee Share Plan (“Share Plan”). In 
2008, the Group continued to award shares and options to 
employees under the Share Plan. The non-cash charge for 
2008 was $8.4 million (2007: $7.8 million), comprising a 
$2.2 million charge relating to grants in the current year 
(2007: $1.8 million) and $6.2 million relating to grants made 
in the past.
Finance Income
With the Group continuing to generate and retain cash 
surpluses throughout the year, net interest income was $3.0 
million (2007: $5.0 million), reflecting the sharp decrease in 
interest rates compared to previous years.
EBITDA
As a result of strong revenue growth, a stable marketing 
to turnover ratio, maintaining cost control and better 
management of resources, we increased EBITDA
1
 by 23% 
to $56 million (2007: $46 million). EBITDA
1
 margin increased 
slightly to 21.2% (2007: 21.0%).
Taxation
The tax charge for 2008 was $3.1 million (2007: $3.2 million) 
reflecting the Group’s efficient tax position.

  Before share benefit charges of US$8.4 million (2007:

Profit and Earnings per share

 increased during the year 6% to $48.6 
million (2007: $45.8 million) and Basic Earnings per share

increased 8% to 13.4¢ in 2008 (2007: 12.4¢).
 
Dividend 
The Group’s stated policy is that it intends generally making 
an annual dividend payment representing 50% of profits after 
tax and the policy would also reflect long-term earnings and 
cash flow potential of the Group. On 27 October 2008, the 
Company paid an interim dividend of 2.5 cents per share 
totalling $8.6 million (2007 interim dividend totalling $6.1 
million). Given the strong financial performance in 2008, the 
Board recommends a final dividend of 2.9 cents per share. 
Cash flow
The Group’s strong profitability during the year was matched 
by strong cash generation with net cash generated from 
operating activities reaching $56.4 million (2007: $46.2 
million), representing 101% ratio to EBITDA
2
. 
During 2008, the Group made cash payments of $36.7 
million (2007: $20.0 million) in investment activities — 
principally the final payment in respect of the 2007 bingo 
acquisition and the ongoing acquisition of technology 
equipment. In addition, the Group returned $25.6 million 
(2007: $36.2 million) in dividends to its shareholders 
consistent with its dividend policy.
Balance Sheet 
The Group’s balance sheet remains strong. The Group has 
no debt, and retains ample liquid resources. The Group’s 
cash position as at 31 December 2008 was $98.4 million 
(31 December 2007: $104.3 million). This strong position 
allows the Group to benefit from suitable acquisition 
opportunities in the consolidating market.
Balances owed to customers increased to $33.3 million (2007: 
$26.4 million) representing natural growth in the business. 
The Group maintains 100% cash reserves to cover immediate 
withdrawal of all customer deposits at will at any time.

Marketing
2008 was a very busy and highly successful year for 888’s 
industry leading marketing activities.
We believe that marketing is a key component in the success 
of both of our newly launched products, 888sport and 
888ladies. This was recognised by the industry magazine, 
eGaming Review, which presented 888ladies with its 
prestigious Bingo Operator of the Year Award.
888 was also named the magazine’s Casino of the Year for 
the third successive year and picked up the “Land Links 
Partnership of the Year” award, given to the operator which 
forged ahead with bridging the gap between offline and 
online in the most innovative way during 2008.
Winning three eGaming Awards, in addition to being 
nominated in an industry-leading nine different categories, 
yet again confirmed 888’s position as an industry leader.
In addition to the eGaming Awards, 888 also won Leisure 
Report’s “Best Betting & Gaming Award” for 2008 for the 
second successive year as well as its “Operator of the Year” 
Award, a category in which 888 beat strong opposition from 
not only the gaming sector but the leisure industry as a whole.
Another example of 888’s innovation, its in-house customer 
magazine “Eight” was awarded the influential “Most Effective 
Membership” title at the 2008 Association of Publishing 
Agencies (APA) Effectiveness Awards. The award was given 
by the APA in the UK and is one of the most coveted prizes 
for an in-house publication.
The magazine was mailed to all of the Group’s casino and 
poker customers in the UK and contains lifestyle features and 
gaming content, seeking to further cement the relationship 
between 888 and its players.
888 Strategic Review
888 has addressed the evolving challenges of the 
competitive landscape in the e-gaming industry by 
transforming its business into two separate lines of business: 
“B2C” and “B2B”.
888’s growth strategy is to maintain its position as one of the 
leading operators in the industry, serving consumers worldwide 
under its various B2C brands (B2C), but also to become a 
leading provider of technology, operations and know-how to 
business partners, using its existing capabilities (B2B).
Within its B2C division, 888 continues to promote its 
consumer targeted offering under its own brands including 
Casino, Poker, Sportsbetting, Bingo, Backgammon and 
Live Dealer. 
 
B2C
From being a provider of Casino, Poker and Bingo in 
2007, 888 is now a comprehensive provider of all gaming 
segments, including the four cornerstones of online gaming 
(Casino, Poker, Sportsbetting and Bingo) and additional 
secondary products (Backgammon and Live Dealer Casino). 
This expansion and diversification of our offering can be seen 
in the rapid growth in our “Emerging Offerings” segment 
(including Bingo, Sportsbook, Live Dealer Casino and 
Backgammon and B2B income) from US$14 million in 2007 
to US$45 million in 2008. 
Our offerings have become more geographically diverse and 
have been complemented by product expansion in existing 
territories. We have invested in two completely new regions 
— South-East Asia and South America. We introduced 
localised products appealing directly to Asian consumers 
where consumers’ tastes are quite different to our traditional 
markets in the UK and Continental Europe. South America 
showed healthy growth and is a region where poker is a 
popular pastime. For the first time, 888 has also expanded 
into Eastern Europe and has the infrastructure in place for a 
more aggressive 2009. Our offerings have been translated 
into new languages: Russian, Polish, Romanian, Latvian, 
Estonian, Lithuanian, Hungarian and Bulgarian. We have 
also established local relationships and partnerships with 
business development and marketing firms to allow us to 
maximize our potential in these jurisdictions.
This market-leading offering and expansion strategy will 
continue to be the foundation of our business.

Enhanced Business Review continued
Branding 
888’s brand awareness continues to be one of its key 
strengths within the sector. The ‘Enjoy the Game’ tagline 
remains one of the most well-known phrases in the gaming 
industry and this has been heightened by use across Europe 
within the sportsbook product and through extended media 
coverage over the last year via its sports sponsorships, 
partnerships and associations. 
Sports sponsorships, partnerships and 
associations
888 has a long history of ground breaking, innovative sports 
sponsorships across various fields and geographies including 
football, snooker, speedway motorcycle racing and darts to 
name a few. The 888.com World Snooker Championship, 
the highlight of the snooker year and one of the major events 
in the British sporting calendar, took place in April 2008, at 
the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. 
The event was televised for nearly three weeks by the BBC, 
resulting in over 140 hours of primetime 888sport branding 
on every player’s waistcoat and on all advertising boards in 
the Crucible arena.
In addition, 888 became the official partner of the world’s 
number one ranked player and current World Champion, 
Ronnie O’Sullivan. This partnership enabled us to maximise 
our investment in the 2008 888.com World Snooker 
Championship creating increased media coverage and 
generating a significant number of first time depositors (FTDs) 
within the recently launched 888sport as well as increasing 
turnover figures. 
888 also sponsored former world snooker champion John 
Higgins who over the last twelve months played in a number 
of online Poker tournaments and attended a number of 
media interviews.
888 also offered those at the venue an opportunity to 
join 888sport at the event itself and to place wagers on 
the snooker over the three week period which proved a 
succesful initiative.  
Cricketer Shane Warne, one of the world’s most recognisable 
sporting stars, was also employed by 888 in the last twelve 
months as an ambassador. He captained the 888 poker 
team in both Australia and the United Kingdom. 
Shane competed in the World Series, the European World 
Series, the Aussie Millions and the 888.com Open, always 
wearing 888.com branded clothing generating notable media 
coverage wherever he went, including a significant number 
of national and International television, radio and press 
interviews.  
Our shirt sponsorship with one of Spain’s biggest football 
clubs, Sevilla FC, has also seen 888 achieve a significant 
amount of global media exposure, as Seville competed in 
tournaments against high profile European football teams. 
888’s partnership with Sevilla is another in a line of sports 
sponsorships the Group has engaged in to promote the 
brand, and to generate FTDs.
In Germany, sponsorship of former star football player 
Thomas Brodric has seen him endorse and compete in 
a number of poker tournaments, whilst in Australia 888 
has sponsored the world famous former boxer and trainer 
Jeff Fenech in a number of high profile international poker 
tournaments during 2008.
Recognising the success of these partnerships, 888 was 
awarded the eGaming Awards 2008 “Land-links Partnership 
of the Year” with the judges noting “888’s link-ups were 
innovative and well-timed, with impressive results”.
The Future
We are set to see even more exposure through our various 
sponsorships and associations throughout 2009. 
With the Ashes set to captivate the hearts and minds of two 
nations, our continued association with Shane Warne during 
this period will ensure that 888 receives more than its fair 
share of branding. 
We plan to grow even bigger, do even better, and conquer 
even more horizons.
We will still be 888. We will still urge customers to ‘enjoy the 
game’, but we will do it in a bigger and better way than 
ever before.
Customer relationship management
The Group continues to recognise the importance of 
customer loyalty, as building strong relationships leads to 
people playing more games, more often, for more time. The 
Customer Relationship Management (‘CRM’) team aims to 
ensure that 888 customers feel valued and continue to enjoy 
the game.
The CRM team is split into two departments, one focusing 
on the Group’s broader market customer base and the other 
on VIP customers.
16254888COM FRONT.indd   16 16254888COM FRONT.indd   16 08/04/2009   17:47 08/04/2009   17:47 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 17
16254 08/04/2009 Proof 8
In order to reinforce loyalty, and ultimately increase customer 
spend, a number of initiatives were undertaken in 2008. Key 
to CRM is giving people the right messages at the most 
opportune times — successfully segmenting customers 
in order to provide them with opportunities that appeal to 
them directly. The Group’s commitment to localisation helps 
strengthen relationships with customers and provides an 
opportunity for the CRM team. As our product offerings 
become increasingly tailored to individual markets, the CRM 
team developed and implemented many promotions across 
geographic areas during the year. 
Alongside the eye-catching front of house promotions, 
improvements in back room support also help to ensure 
that customers keep coming back to 888. Improvements 
in analytical processing in 2008 have helped to identify 
customers struggling with technical issues; for example, 
customers having difficulties depositing money are identified 
and contacted personally within ten minutes.
2008 has also seen the opening of further communication 
channels through which the Group is able to contact 
customers. The magazine ‘Eight’ remains popular amongst 
customers, and direct mail has now been  augmented with 
SMS messaging — further personalising the customer 
relationship. SMS, coupled with targeted segmentation of 
the customer base helps players now receive information 
of immediate interest to them, immediately. Promotions and 
tournament reminders being delivered in this way also help to 
drive traffic online.
The Group’s market-leading VIP department builds real 
one-on-one relationships with VIPs so that 888 remains their 
online gaming operator of choice. VIP Account Managers 
Representatives are available in ten languages to provide the 
highest level of personal support.
Our VIP program was expanded in 2008 to offer this 
personal service across the Group’s gaming portfolio. The 
launch of 888ladies was followed by the introduction of Gold 
Ladies, and VIP services were introduced for Pacific Poker 
and 888sport customers. VIP services are set to roll out 
across further areas of the 888 portfolio throughout 2009.
Alongside hands-on account management, relationships with 
VIPs are strengthened through exclusive promotions and 
offline events. In 2008, over 80 promotions were run for VIPs, 
with various prizes as well as large bonuses. As a means to 
further personalising interaction between VIPs and 888, 40 
different offline events were held in nine different countries, all 
personally hosted by an 888 VIP Account Manager.
Search and Web Optimisation Technologies 
(“SWOT”)
888’s SWOT team utilise proprietary techniques developed 
over almost a decade designed to optimise customer 
recruitment. SWOT is much more than traditional simple 
search engine optimisation. Successful use of SWOT helped 
to exploit the opportunity provided by the launch of 888ladies 
and 888sport to increase the acquisition of players through 
these new channels, especially in the United Kingdom. 
Increasing search engine visibility also helped drive player 
acquisition success in other markets worldwide, notably 
Canada and the Scandinavian countries. 
The Group will continue to focus on SWOT in order to 
maximise the impact of the product offering, and new 
launches in 2009 will bring further customer acquisition 
opportunities.

Enhanced Business Review continued
Our Offering
888’s core product offerings (casino, poker, bingo and, 
sport) together with its secondary offerings, (Live Dealer and 
Backgammon) are available to end customers under 888’s 
various B2C brands and also through carefully selected 
strategic B2B partners where 888 acts a service provider 
including Sportech — UK, Rileys — UK, Tower Torneos — 
Latin America, Lucky Ace — Europe and Poker Dome — 
Australia.
Casino
888’s primary online Casino brand, Casino on Net, had a 
successful year in 2008 — building on its strengths and 
continuing to innovate in order to retain its position as the 
leading online Casino in the world. Continued improvements 
to the customer experience coupled with the addition of 
popular new games helped driving revenue levels, with TOI 
from Casino increasing 15% in 2008 to US$139 million.
During 2008 the Group focused on the integration of many 
new games, whilst maintaining its core propositions of trust 
and simplicity alongside first-class customer service. 
888’s strategy is to create a 360 degree gaming ecosystem, 
offering best in class casino and soft games, ‘blockbusters’ 
being built in house and a wide choice of games introduced 
through integration ensuring that the site stays fresh and 
888 remains a one stop shop for all casino and gaming 
requirements. Through providing customers with a large 
variety of choice and entertainment, in the localised formats 
that appeal most to them, 888 continues to expand its target 
audience.
As 888’s gaming arena becomes broader through the 
continued internal development of sophisticated games and 
the integration of external content, the Group has sought to 
seek partners that can keep adding novelty to the offering. 
Throughout 2008, 888 carefully selected ‘best-of-breed’ 
partners to provide these innovative and attractive additional 
games. A total of 22 new games have been integrated to 
date onto the 888 platform and the Group continues to work 
to add further exciting games to complement its current 
offering. 
In addition to increasing the range and quality of games 
on offer through the integration of new games, the Group 
continues to improve its offering and provide customers 
with up-to-date and relevant offerings to match their gaming 
needs. The Live Dealer Casino has continued to be popular, 
and additional Video Slot games were developed in-house 
throughout the course of the year. Often these games would 
be themed around a major worldwide event such as the 
Olympic Games and European Football Championships, 
helping to drive customers regularly back to the site in the 
knowledge that there will be new and innovative content. 
A revamp of the Casino lobby helped to keep a cutting edge 
look and feel of the site and changes to the ‘no download’ 
offering helped to make it easier for new users to begin 
playing as 888 customers. Additional games were added to 
the ‘no download’ offering, in five different languages and 
further improvements are planned for 2009.
In order to expand the worldwide appeal of the offering, 
as well as the games being targeted for specific regions 
and demographics so are the languages and currencies in 
which they can be played. Casino on Net is now available in 
14 different languages, and 2009 will see the Group take a 
major step as the platform will become a fully multi-currency 
offering, allowing customers to play localised games that 
appeal to them in their local language and currency.

888 enjoyed a steady level of revenues and active customer 
Casino participation in 2008, until a disappointing Q4. 
Due to the prolonged and deepening economic downturn, 
unprecedented challenging trading conditions were 
experienced following the end of the summer holiday season. 
Active customers played slightly less and the strengthening 
US$ exacerbated the impact on reported US$ denominated 
revenues. 
Poker
The Group has continued to further the global reach of its 
Poker operations and as a result the market share of its 
poker network, among networks that do not accept US 
players, has increased during 2008. 2008 saw an expansion 
in Pacific Poker’s offering with the launching of localised 
websites in 11 new languages: Russian, Polish, Czech, 
Bulgarian, Hungarian, Romanian, Lithuanian, Latvian, 
Estonian, Greek and Japanese. The Group offers a global 
Poker room in which customers can find the game of their 
choice, at the time of their choice, in the language of their 
choice.
888 has continued to take steps to enrich the user 
experience. Features were introduced across the year to 
maintain customers’ engagement, including the addition 
of advanced community tools and localized content, while 
ongoing promotions and regular big-money events provided 
incentives for players to continue to play regularly. 
The regular Pacific Poker events were bolstered in 2008 
through the introduction of the World Poker Crown. The 
WPC had a guaranteed minimum prize pool of US$3 million 
making it the largest single event of its kind offered to the 
non-US market. Traffic was driven to the site as qualifiers 
were played out exclusively through Pacific Poker, with 
daily and weekly online tournaments being run, customised 
to match 888’s geographic customer base profiles. The 
qualifiers ended with an online final in April deciding the eight 
participants to go forward to the 888 branded offline final 
held in Peralada, Spain.
Improvements to the Poker platform allowed the Group 
to make significant advancements in monetising players, 
with the unification of the popular ‘Demo’ mode into the 
real money environment which helped customers transfer 
seamlessly from demo to real money play. System updates 
also allow 888’s customer relationship managers to monitor 
individual customers’ playing habits and tailor marketing 
activities accordingly, providing players with the opportunities 
that will most appeal to them.
As 888 changes into a one stop shop for all online gaming 
entertainment needs, cross-selling opportunities are further 
exploited. The launch of 888’s sportsbetting platform, 
888sport, was followed quickly by the introduction of Sport in 
Poker, providing customers with the opportunity to play across 
different 888 products using a single login and a unified wallet. 
The Group will continue to ensure that customers have the 
best possible gaming experience, and there will be a number 
of customer facing improvements carried out during 2009. 
The Pacific Poker site will be given a new look and feel, 
with additional products and poker side bets enhancing the 
customer experience of the Poker room.

continues its global reach and market leading position in this

Enhanced Business Review continued
Levels of poker active players and revenue held up well until 
the last quarter, 888 enjoyed steady levels of active customer 
Poker participation and revenue in 2008 until a disappointing 
Q4. Due to the prolonged and deepening economic 
downturn, unprecedented challenging trading conditions 
were experienced following the end of the summer holiday 
season. Active customers played slightly less and volatile 
adverse foreign exchange movements exacerbated the effect 
on US$ denominated revenues. 
Combined Casino and Poker KPIs
As more customers continue to migrate onto the Group’s 
unified offering, the distinction between Casino and Poker 
revenue becomes more and more difficult. As a result, the 
Group reports it’s KPIs for the combined Casino and Poker 
activity in the table above.
Bingo
Following the acquisition of the Bingo business in 2007 
which enabled 888 to enter the bingo arena as a major white 
label network operator, February 2008 saw a milestone in 
the evolution of 888’s bingo offering — the launch of the 
new 888 Bingo network, 888ladies. The site was positioned 
to appeal to a whole new market for the Group and has 
been a huge success. A high profile television advertising 
campaign starring Vic Reeves, aligned with positive customer 
experiences, helped to quickly establish the network with 
over 2,500 daily active players and over 30,000 real money 
players.
There are 10 bingo rooms, four of which are open 24 hours 
a day, seven days a week, which offer a number of bingo 
variants. Customers can play 75/90 ball bingo and buy 
tickets for big cash games, including an £8,888 jackpot once 
a month. 
888ladies is not simply an online bingo room, and the 
Group has worked to crystallise its position as a leading 
entertainment and content destination for women, enhancing 
customer satisfaction and retention levels, through providing 
a dynamic, surprising and inclusive online experience.
Regular promotions give customers a reason to return, and 
blogs and chat rooms help to personalise relationships. 
Editorial capabilities have also been developed both in regards 
to topic variety and content and an increased number of new 
editorials offered to customers on a daily basis.
 
The Group has continued to strengthen the community feel 
of the site, a feeling engendered through a combination 
of friendly, welcoming moderators who follow customers 
throughout their stay within 888’s bingo rooms, and a 
website that includes a variety of interaction opportunities, 
chat tools and venues.
888’s community platform allows customer retention 
teams to chat, interact with customers and observe their 
behaviour, and when combined with the latest technology 
developments, including RSS feeds and WEB 2.0 widgets, 
888 is able to offer customers what they want and truly 
personalise their experience. 888ladies links what people 
read, consume and win, ranging from personalised online 
horoscopes, bonuses and invitations to play on birthdays 
and lucky days, to games themed after the brands 888’s 
customers care the most about, such as their favourite TV 
show or celebrity. The Group was proud to be awarded

Bingo Operator of the Year at the eGaming Awards 2008 
recognising the success of the offering.
In 2009 the Group will look to expand the bingo platform 
globally. We aim to establish a presence in Continental 
European countries by the end of the year. We will also be 
launching new networks and skins in additional languages 
and with localised multi-currency support. Enhanced 
customer features will also ensure that the 888 bingo offering 
remains best of breed.
Sportsbetting
The launch of a sports betting platform in March was a 
significant milestone for the Group. Following the introduction 
of 888sport, the Group became a comprehensive provider 
of all gaming segments. The international launch reinforced 
888’s strategy of creating a large community of people 
consuming entertainment content online. Sportsbetting is 
also customer acquisition and retention tool and enables 888 
to cross-sell from its existing products.
888sport is an international sports betting offering, with 
editorial content and sports and betting selections, as well 
as live in-running betting and coverage of a large number of 
sports including: UK and Irish horseracing, UK, European 
and international football, Greyhound racing, Golf, Cricket, 
Rugby, Tennis, Novelty events such as Big Brother, and many 
more.
888sport is offered in seven markets with fully tailored and 
localised language-specific offerings in all areas allowing 
customers to bet on events of relevance to them in the 
currency of their choice. Over the course of the year 
888sport was rolled out in a further four countries.
The offering was developed in conjunction with Blue Square, 
one of the most popular and well-established sportsbooks in 
the UK. As a result of the partnership 888 is able to rely on 
Blue Square’s experience in trading and risk management to 
reduce the risks associated with this business, allowing the 
Group to concentrate on fulfilling its strategy of cross-selling 
its sports betting services to its existing customer base whilst 
leveraging its robust multi-channel marketing engines to 
acquire new sportsbook customers globally.
The offering was combined with a high profile advertising 
campaign targeting new customers around specific events 
ranging from Euro 2008 and the Olympics to major horse 
races such as the Cheltenham Festival and the Grand 
National, with localised campaigns and promotions 
coinciding with the start of local football leagues. Existing 
sport related sponsorships such as Seville football club and 
the 888 World Snooker Championship also helped to build 
the awareness of the 888sport brand. 
16254888COM FRONT.indd   21 16254888COM FRONT.indd   21 08/04/2009   17:47 08/04/2009   17:47 888 Holdings plc www.888holdingsplc.com 22
16254 08/04/2009 Proof 8
Enhanced Business Review continued
The Group sees further opportunities in sportsbetting. 
The launch of an improved ‘in play’ application taking in 
a wider variety of live events, the addition of new content 
and statistics and the introduction of soft games will help to 
further improve the player experience. 2009 will also see the 
expansion of the sport offering through further expansion of 
888sport into key territories and white label agreements.
E-Payments
Improvements to the E-Payments offering played a significant 
role in underpinning some of 888’s key strategic initiatives in 
2008, helping to personalise the customer experience and 
localise the offering.
The focus on attractive front of house options is matched by 
888’s state-of-the-art payments processing system, which 
offers both cutting-edge back office functionality and an 
advanced cashier interface. The cashier user interface was 
significantly upgraded this year to include the implementation 
of Live Person interactive chat, which is proactively initiated 
by the support team. This gives customers the opportunity 
to get live help from an 888 agent, assisting in improving 888 
customers’ playing and depositing experience whilst at the 
same time increasing cash conversions.
 
When customers sign up with 888 they can deposit using a 
range of payment options tailored to suit their local market 
based on their physical location, from which they can 
choose their preferred payment method. As a truly global 
provider of gaming entertainment, it is important that 888 
offers customers the games relevant to them, in their local 
language, with the choice of their preferred payment method. 
This was illustrated by the roll-out of 888sport, which is now 
offered in seven markets, each in the local language, and all 
in the local currency. A multi-currency bonus feature was also 
added across the service offering.
Constant improvements in payment processing have seen 
a total of 11 new languages added to the client interface, 
improving penetration in untapped and emerging gaming 
markets. 888 will continue to add variety of localised 
payment methods offered worldwide for the benefit of 
customers.
2009 will see further improvements to 888’s payment 
systems, starting in the first quarter with the now completed 
integration of PayPal, the world’s best known eWallet, into 
the 888 cashier for countries where PayPal may be sued 
for gaming payments. The Group will also implement a 
new multi-functional cashout client with additional cashout 
methods, significantly increasing customers’ ability to 
receive their winnings easily and efficiently while greatly 
reducing the number of chargebacks and the risk of 
fraudulent transactions. This will improve the user experience 
as well as further streamline and enhance the cashout 
process for customers. 
B2B
888 has always been at the forefront of developments in the 
Internet gaming industry. A pioneer and leader in the B2C 
industry, 888 made the strategic decision in 2007 to lead 
the way in becoming the largest B2C operator to move into 
the B2B arena. Capitalising on its experiences as a B2C 
operator for well over a decade, 888 is uniquely positioned to 
work with carefully selected strategic partners who are either 
aiming to monetise their existing database, brand loyalty 
and media assets or looking to enhance their existing online 
gaming operations. 
888 has already secured a number of high profile agreements 
which highlight both the potential of this strategic direction 
and 888’s unique position as a leading operator offering a full 
service model in the B2B field. 
16254888COM FRONT.indd   22 16254888COM FRONT.indd   22 08/04/2009   17:47 08/04/2009   17:47 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 23
16254 08/04/2009 Proof 8
This B2B business move began in 2007 with agreements 
with Riley’s, Tower Torneos and Lucky Ace. 2008 has seen 
an acceleration in B2B development with several more 
deals in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, including 
the groundbreaking partnership with the UK Football Pools 
(Sportech Plc) highlighting the potential for 888 in this area. 
The development and growth of the B2B business is an 
integral part of the 888’s growth strategy for 2009 and 
beyond.
It was the signing in June 2008 of a strategic partnership 
with Sportech that saw a step-change in 888’s B2B 
activities, as 888 started providing a full managed service 
including all technology, operations and marketing of 
Sportech’s leading Littlewoods brand. 
888 provides Littlewoods with a full turnkey solution 
including its market-leading gaming and back-end software, 
customer support and payments processing services. 888 
also provides advanced marketing services to Littlewoods 
marketing, brand and customer base, helping to extend the 
reach of Littlewoods’ business. This agreement represented 
the full evolution of 888’s B2B offering — Total Gaming 
Services — and is a milestone agreement.
Internal restructuring
As part of a restructuring of the 888 team to facilitate the 
growth in 888’s B2B model, 888 has appointed a dedicated 
B2B Managing Director and recruited a specialist B2B sales 
and marketing team, the ideal platform for delivering new 
deals in 2009.
As the B2B business expands, it has become of increasing 
commercial importance to have a clear division from 888’s 
B2C business. Accordingly, 888 is in the process of selecting 
and developing a new brand under which to market its 
B2B business, Whilst promoting the strengths of 888’s core 
knowledge and experience as an operator, this move clearly 
differentiates the B2B business as a separate and distinct 
part of the 888 Group. 
A marketing strategy is currently being devised to roll out this 
new B2B brand and will be designed to enhance visibility 
amongst the media and target markets of 888’s growing 
B2B business. Activities will include advertising and PR in 
core trade and business magazines, key speaker positions 
and trade stands at leading conferences and exhibitions and 
sponsorship of industry events. 
‘Total Gaming Services’ is the strapline that will underpin the 
unique positioning in the market for 888’s B2B business. This 
reflects the opportunity for clients to not only benefit from 
888’s decade of experience in technology and operations 
but also utilise the advanced marketing services, through 
the provision of offline/online marketing, management of 
affiliates, SEO, CRM and business analytics. 
In addition to developing the B2B team, 888 has also 
restructured the rest of its Group in order to create 
independent departments in such areas as Research & 
Development and Customer Care, focusing separately on 
both the B2B and B2C businesses. This move enabled 888 
to scale the service to the growing requirements of its B2B 
clients and helped the B2B business in meeting existing 
project delivery timescales, increasing the speed to market 
for new clients and maximising profitability of the business. 
This restructuring augmented the independent B2B business 
that was structured as a separate business unit with several 
departments in it, focused entirely on B2B partners: Sales 
& Business Development, Programs & Integrations, Client 
executive unit, Client marketing & Operations, B2B Marketing 
and PR and B2B Finance.

Enhanced Business Review continued
New partners
888 sees three main sources of new B2B partners: (i) 
existing online gaming operators searching for additions to 
their existing suite of gaming products or to replace entirely 
their current software suppliers, (ii) media companies and 
land-based casinos looking to monetise their brands; and 
(iii) lottery companies seeking experienced online gaming 
partners, with a heritage of successful business delivery and 
strong responsible gaming systems and capabilities, that can 
facilitate a smooth transition from leadership in land-based 
gaming to significant market-share holding and combat the 
threat of competition. 
New entrants to the online gaming market require a 
technology platform to work with, expertise in setting up 
operations and, above all, knowledge of how to leverage 
their assets and target the gaming consumer. 888’s 
experience through operating its own B2C businesses 
makes it well positioned to partner with these new entrants 
to mutual advantage.
Bingo
The successful acquisition of Globalcom in May 2007 gave 
the Group a perfect springboard to enter into the B2B bingo 
arena, providing software, customer support and payment 
processing to some of the premium Bingo partners in 
the UK.
Utilising these acquired foundations, 888 is also a leading 
player in bingo B2B, providing solutions to business partners 
operating their own networks and other third party sites. 888 
powers some of the most prominent players in the bingo 
market such as Foxy Bingo, Mirror Bingo, Think Bingo, 
Cheeky Bingo, Bingo Scotland and Wink Bingo. 888 now 
has a white label network of more than 45 online bingo sites 
or “skins” including bingoballroom.com, poshbingo.com, 
bingofabulous.com and twofatladies.co.uk. 
888 plans to utilise its B2B platform to tap into new growth 
markets. A perfect example of the implementation of this 
strategy was the launch of a localised Spanish Bingo offering 
in 2008. 
Poker
888’s B2B business offers a total gaming service solution 
for white label Poker operators with a wide range of 
tournaments, multi-language capabilities and the most 
popular games. New developments will include upgrading 
the existing poker client to create a new and improved player 
experience, designed to get players to the right tables faster 
and playing more. Significant white label agreements have 
been launched with Poker Dome (Australia), Littlewoods 
(UK) and Lucky Ace (Europe), all of whom have benefited 
from 888’s CRM expertise in reducing churn rate, activating 
dormant accounts and delivering increased returns. The 
rapid development of new skins will further bolster activity 
enabling the network to grow and provide greater liquidity as 
new partners are integrated in 2009. 
   
16254888COM FRONT.indd   24 16254888COM FRONT.indd   24 08/04/2009   17:47 08/04/2009   17:47 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 25
16254 08/04/2009 Proof 8
The B2B team is currently working on a strong transaction 
pipeline for 2009 with a number of deals at various stages, 
across a variety of game offerings. 2009 will mark a significant 
step forward in the development of the B2B business making 
an increased contribution to the profitability of the Group. The 
Group believes that the B2B business will provide a significant 
portion of total revenues and profits by the financial year 2010.
Technological Infrastructure
888’s technological strength has been its ability to develop 
and manage all aspects of its operations in-house, including 
software development. This enabled 888 to produce a 
distinctive product and brand feel for its B2C offering, and 
to exercise flexibility in relation to its online products and 
services, implement efficiency in customer support and 
maximise the security of its system architecture.
888’s information technology platform, hosted in Gibraltar, 
consists of over 700 production and over 900 development 
servers and uses a fully integrated proprietary software 
infrastructure developed in-house. 888’s information 
technology infrastructure handles over two million visitors 
a day to its various websites with over 30,000 customers 
playing concurrently at peak times. Substantial investment 
has been, and continues to be, made in 888’s choice of 
technology, its architecture design, planning systems and 
implementation. The system architecture has been designed 
and built with security, resilience and scalability as a priority, 
which has underpinned the Group’s growth in recent 
years. 888 has invested millions of US dollars to enhance 
its technology platform using best-of-breed approach, 
implementing solutions from the leading vendors (Cisco, HP , 
EMC, CA, VMware etc.) 888 is also a recipient of the TRUSTe 
Web Privacy Seal of approval for all its websites and online 
gaming activities. TRUSTe runs the world’s largest privacy 
seal program, with more than 2,400 websites certified and 
reflects 888’s commitments to client privacy.
In 2007, 888 opened up its technological platform in order 
to become a B2B provider and enable easy integration 
with games from other providers. This focused on a single 
point of integration to 888’s platform, involved a number 
of infrastructure challenges and required technological 
advancements in 888’s back-office capabilities. 
In order to facilitate the addition of third-party games and to 
complement 888’s own core games with carefully selected 
‘best-of-breed’ partners, an Integration Platform was 
developed and expanded during 2008. 
The Integration Platform allows the integration of new third 
party games by multiple vendors, especially new entrants to 
the markets who require a technology platform for games 
and back office facilities. This industry-leading integration 
infrastructure enables third party game providers to swiftly 
connect into 888’s gaming environment, wallet, cashier and 
customer support systems. The almost turnkey addition 
of these games, often with content to appeal to localised 
audiences, has enabled 888 to introduce rapidly a diversified 
and localised offering to existing and new players worldwide.
In total, 22 new games were integrated onto the 888 
platform across 2008, and the Group has now access 
to over 1,000 new games from over 10 suppliers to 
complement its wider offering.
In 2008 we also introduced a new financial transactions 
system enabling optimization as well as localization and 
customization of financial transaction processing based on 
customer preferences, risk and cost considerations.
We continue to invest in software development which takes 
place in our state-of-the-art Research, Development and 
Marketing centre in a suburb of Tel Aviv supported by our 
recently added lower cost development location in Eastern 
Europe. This investment has enabled 888 to add innovative 
slot machines to the existing home-grown offering of casino, 
poker and backgammon games. 2008 also saw multiple new 
releases of Poker, Casino and Bingo, as well as a complete 
new offering — Sports Betting, significantly enhancing 888’s 
offering.
Customer Support and Service
888 remains committed to its goal of being the market leader 
in the global online gaming industry, including in respect of 
customer satisfaction.
Our customer service operation is staffed by dedicated 
teams of highly trained in-house customer support 
representatives providing the highest levels of service and 
support for each of the Group’s brands and White Labels. 
In 2008 we continued to invest in our support infrastructure 
and notably expanded our language portfolio. We offer first-
class customer support via email and telephone, 24 hours 
a day, 7 days a week, to customers around the world in 14 
different languages. Our Live Chat service is now offered 
in four languages. In 2008 we also launched 888sport 
supported in four languages and expanded Pacific Poker’s 
Offering to 11 new languages. 
The Group has invested in industry-leading technology 
provided by “RightNow Technologies” to help support its 
online customer experience initiatives. This investment 
allowed 888 to reduce its operational expenditure, effectively 
manage its resources and gain valuable insight into its 
customers’ needs and preferences.
Excellent customer service continues to be a central tenet of 
the Company’s offering. The ongoing dialogue with clients is 
maintained by Customer Relationship Management teams 
in two dedicated contact centres, located in Gibraltar and 
Antigua.

Enhanced Business Review continued
The main Gibraltar contact centre focuses on providing 
support for our principal markets in Europe, Asia/Pacific and 
Latin America, while the Antiguan contact centre focused 
on supporting our English-speaking markets in Europe, 
Asia Pacific and Canada. 
Expert teams initiate outbound interaction with new and 
existing customers who may experience issues depositing 
into their respective 888 accounts. Our outbound teams 
proactively contact selected populations with the aim to 
update customers about special offers, new products and to 
reactivate customers that have become inactive.
During 2008, we introduced a new proactive chat application 
(provided by “LivePerson”) with much success. We also 
expanded those activities for more brands, White Labels and 
languages. 888 also expanded available contact channels 
by offering the first ever Promotion sent via SMS (targeting 
Casino and Bingo players).
The contact centres continue to play a vital role in the 
successful launch of 888’s strategic partnerships such as 
LuckyAce, Poker Dome and Littlewoods.
The Support teams aim to close the majority of issues 
during the first contact as demonstrated in the customer 
performance figures attained in 2008:
Casino in English 
l 97.6% of all phone calls are answered within, 25 seconds
l 99.0% of all emails are replied to within 24 hours
l 96.5% of all chats are answered within, 30 seconds
Poker in English
l 97.7% of all calls are answered within, 25 seconds
l 98.5% of all emails are replied to within 24 hours
l 95.2% of all chats are answered within, 35 seconds
Bingo in English
l 94.8% of all calls are answered within, 25 seconds
l 90.5% of all emails are replied to within 24 hours
l A total of 80,046 chats were answered within the 
customary highest service level (SLA) 
Customer Satisfaction
We continuously monitor customer satisfaction by requesting 
and analysing real-time feedback. In 2008, we again 
conducted a comprehensive survey to benchmark 888’s 
service level within our primary markets. 
Respondents accredited their highest rating to the level of 
professionalism of our representatives and when compared 
to previous studies, the results show a considerable increase 
in satisfaction, most notably for our important German 
market. 
l Casino players rated the level of professionalism of our 
representatives at 4.20 (out of 5)
l Poker players rated the level of professionalism of our 
representatives at 4.10 (out of 5)
l German players rated their overall satisfaction with 888’s 
customer support at 3.91 in 2007 and in 2008 rated their 
overall satisfaction at an impressive 4.17 (out of 5)
l Casino players rated their overall satisfaction with the 
service received at 3.94 (out of 5)
l Poker players rated their overall satisfaction with the 
service received at 3.74 (out of 5)
l Response time ratings were 4.10 and 4.00 for Casino 
and Poker respectively (out of 5)
888’s unparalleled customer service and our leadership in 
the e-gaming industry have been repeatedly recognised and 
we were honoured to be named ‘Best Betting & Gaming 
Company 2008’ at the Leisure Report Awards. 
A vital component in maintaining and exceeding customer 
expectations is our ability to access each client’s full and 
complete history in real time, thus optimising customer 
interactions on all levels. Customer contacts are strictly 
monitored to ensure quality and parity.

888’s proprietary back-office application is probably the 
most advanced application of its kind in the industry and 
functions as the backbone of our entire business operation. 
Data from various divisions is integrated and streamlined 
into a single point of reference and gives representatives 
from every department — Customer Support, VIP , Risk 
Management, Business Production and Finance — the tool 
to provide superior assistance to customers, regardless of 
the department a query is directed to.
Responsible Gaming
The Group believes that its primary responsibility is to provide 
the best online gaming entertainment to its customers. 
However, the Group acknowledges the potential danger 
that its games may pose for a small minority of people and 
it strives to reach excellence in its responsible gaming policy 
and ethical conduct.
888 is devoted to promoting a responsible gaming culture 
within the organisation. The aim is to raise awareness 
through education and to continuously provide staff with 
tools and training necessary to ensure a responsible gaming 
environment.
We continuously monitor our policies and generate new 
innovative ways to foster caring and ethical gaming, 
and above all to make certain our customers are safe. 
Responsible gaming is a key feature of our business strategy, 
reflecting the seriousness we attach to the issue and the 
value we attribute to “caring” within the organisation. 
Training
The Group has developed a global training programme 
whereby employees receive training on overall awareness of 
the Group’s commitment and policies on responsible gaming 
and more specific and detailed knowledge depending on 
their specific business role.
During the year we developed a further in-depth second 
level specialized training day in association with Gamcare 
for those employees whose role may possibly lead them to 
encounter problem gamers and those that handle difficult 
cases. One of the first of its kind in the industry, it covered 
topics such as: the cycle of problem gambling, psychology 
and temperament of problem gamblers, and dealing with 
reactions. We intend to repeat this specialized training 
in 2009.
Protecting Customers
The Group carries a Gamcare certification. Gamcare is the 
leading authority on the provision of counselling, advice and 
practical help in addressing the social impact of gambling in 
the UK. The certification recognises gaming businesses that 
have successfully implemented robust policies and practices 
of social responsibility and player protection.
As a responsible, regulated gaming organisation, we also 
comply with all guidelines published by our regulator in 
Gibraltar and eCOGRA, a non-profit, independent, regulatory 
body based in the UK. eCOGRA ensures that approved 
online casinos are properly and transparently monitored to 
provide player protection.
Protecting Minors 
Under-age gambling on our sites is prohibited and the Group 
takes the matter of under-age gaming extremely seriously.
Our offerings are not designed to attract minors. In 
compliance with our licensing obligations, we proactively 
discourage persons under the age of 18 who attempt to play 
on any of our sites. We use sophisticated verification systems 
to identify and track minors who log in to our software, and 
we make every effort to prevent them from playing. 
We have trained staff to be highly sensitive to the possibility 
of under-age gambling. Whenever an account is suspected 
of belonging to an under-age customer, it is suspended until 
a full investigation has been carried out.  
The Group’s dedicated responsible gaming website 
888responsible.com launched a new campaign in 2008 
aimed at raising potential under-age gaming and parents’ 
awareness to the issue of under-age gambling. It includes an 
educational movie that tells the story of a mother who takes 
control of her under-age gambling son, an extreme situation 
which 888, as a Company that cares for its clients, will do 
everything in its power to help prevent.
The Group also adheres to the stringent rules concerning 
under-age gambling established by the Interactive Gaming 
Council (IGC), of which 888 is a member.

Enhanced Business Review continued
Preventative Measures
888 works closely with its customers in all aspects of the 
gambling experience. If however that experience become a 
problem for the customer we work with them towards the 
best and most comfortable solution for them. 
We have several established measures in place to help 
prevent gambling becoming a problem for players. These 
include setting personal limits, opportunities for self-
exclusion during which time the customer will not receive 
any promotional material and a “Gambling Therapy” button 
providing customers with information and support to anyone 
affected by problem gaming.
In addition, during 2008 we implemented a totally unique 
proprietary project called the “Observer”, the aim of which 
is to develop a bespoke set of algorithms to identify 
patterns that are likely to indicate early problem gamblers. 
We developed this data mining system in consultation with 
Dr Mark Griffiths, a Chartered Psychologist and Professor 
of Gambling Studies at the Nottingham Trent University. 
A complex set of parameters including financial and 
behavioural data are used to flag up any customers who 
might be at risk from becoming a problem gambler. This 
data is analysed and investigated and then action taken 
in partnership with the customer to prevent or resolve a 
potential problem situation occurring.
Raising Awareness and Education
Our specialist website www.888responsible.com is 
dedicated exclusively to responsible gaming. It is a 
comprehensive site covering all aspects of responsible 
gaming practices, dealing with problem gambling and 
preventing under-age gambling. In 2008 we ran a specific 
campaign aimed at raising potential under-age gaming and 
parents’ awareness of the issue of under-age gambling.
A direct link is accessible to the site from all of 888’s sites. 
We continue to support the work of the RIGT (Responsibility 
In Gambling Trust) through contributions to their educational 
programmes, the aim of which is to help young people better 
understand the dangers of problem gaming and to help them 
develop the personal and social skills that are also relevant to 
a wide range of choices and not just to gambling.

Regulation and General 
Regulatory Developments
The regulatory framework of online gaming in different 
countries around the world is as dynamic and rapidly 
evolving as ever. While some jurisdictions have moved to 
curtail the activities of online gaming sites, many others are 
currently contemplating liberalization and regulation of the 
industry, and some have already taken this route. The Board 
notes that there are significant risks, unique to the online 
gaming industry, including from activity with customers in 
the USA prior to the Group’s withdrawal from the market 
in October 2006, when US customers of 888 generated 
55% of its total Revenue. The Board remains committed 
to monitoring closely and addressing regulatory changes 
as they occur, and to fostering, so far as possible, the 
trend towards liberalisation and regulation of online gaming 
throughout the world.
Gibraltar
888 is licensed and regulated in Gibraltar. 
European Union (EU)
The European Commission is challenging the online 
gambling and betting regulatory regimes of various European 
States, as the Commission holds that as regards EU licensed 
companies, these regimes might infringe the enshrined 
freedom to provide services, the freedom of establishment 
and the concept of mutual recognition. This effort is reflected 
in, inter alia, the infringement proceedings initiated against 
several EU States — Italy, Denmark, Finland, Germany, 
Hungary, the Netherlands, Sweden, France, Austria and 
Greece. Should these Member States fail to supply adequate 
reasoning of their gambling legislation, the Commission may 
refer the issue with each Member State to the European 
Court of Justice. While these proceedings may, in the end, 
cause the European States to liberalise their gambling 
markets, it should be noted that it could be a very long 
time before resolutions or judgments are reached (if at all). 
However, the pressure exerted by the EU Commission has 
resulted in several EU Member States contemplating and, in 
some cases advancing, a liberalised gaming sector. These 
Member States include France, Spain, Sweden, Greece 
and Denmark. Indeed, the French Budget Minister recently 
presented a liberalisation scheme, which will see (according 
to the Minister) French licensed online gambling activities 
in 2010. 
Other EU Member States such as Ireland, Cyprus, Belgium, 
Estonia and the Czech Republic are also considering revising 
their gaming laws so as to possibly regulate online gaming. 
In addition to these infringement proceedings, the EU 
Commission is involved in other instances in which the 
online gambling and betting regulatory regimes appear to 
contravene rights and freedoms of online gambling and 
betting operators (e.g. issuing detailed opinions against the 
enactment of prohibitive legislation, and intervening in the 
World Trade Organisation (WTO) process described below).
In March 2009, the EU Parliament approved a report calling 
to, inter alia, respect the States’ rights to protect consumers, 
fight crime and preserve the structures used to finance 
sport and social activities, This report is, to a large part, 
inconsistent with the views held by the EU Commission and 
lacks any formal operational impact. 
In Italy, 888 holds a sports betting licence, which allows 
it to offer sports betting services (supervised by the State 
Monopoly Authority). Following regulations issued by the 
Italian authorities in 2007, the licence will allow 888 to 
offer skill games (including Poker tournaments), subject 
to receiving the proper authorisations from the Italian 
authorities. 
USA/WTO
In the USA, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement 
Act (UIGEA) added a new section to the United States 
Code making it illegal for anyone engaging in the business 
of betting or wagering to knowingly accept any credit, 
electronic funds transfer, check, draft, etc. in connection 
with the participation of another person in unlawful 
Internet gaming. In essence, the UIGEA prohibits online 
gambling operators from receiving the proceeds of financial 
transactions in connection with Internet gaming if the gaming 
is illegal in the state where the bettor is located. In addition, 
the United States’ Treasury Department and Federal Reserve 
promulgated regulations that require financial institutions 
to implement measures intended to block transactions in 
connection with Internet gaming; these regulations entered 
into force on 19 January 2009, although their implementation 
date is delayed to 1 December 2009. In October 2006 the 
Group stopped taking bets from US customers.

Enhanced Business Review continued
On 5 June 2007, the Group announced that it had initiated 
preliminary discussions with the United States Attorney’s 
Office for the Southern District of New York regarding activity 
prior to enactment of the legislation. It is too early to assess 
any particular outcome of these discussions.
It was recently found by the World Trade Organisation that 
the US legislative position with respect to Internet Gambling 
violates US trade commitments. Following this decision, 
the USA is seeking to withdraw its trade commitment in the 
sphere of gambling; while several trade partners required 
compensation from the US following this withdrawal, none 
of the agreements reached, so far, between the USA and 
trade partners, have had an impact on the online gambling 
market. Antigua did not reach an agreement with the USA, 
and applied to the WTO to arbitrate a settlement between it 
and the USA, in connection with the withdrawal of the USA 
commitment. There are still ongoing negotiations between 
the US and Antigua in this respect. 
In December 2007, the Remote Gaming Association (a trade 
body representing several online gaming operators, of which 
the Group is a member) filed a complaint with the European 
Union against the USA in connection with the breach of its 
trade commitments. Following this complaint, the European 
Commission decided to open an investigation into whether 
the United States is in breach of its WTO obligations in the 
sphere of gambling (in relation to the period prior to the 
withdrawal of its commitment). The investigation is expected 
to conclude during the first few months of 2009, at which 
date the Commission will present its findings, which could 
lead to the initiation of WTO proceedings. 
The Board continues to monitor these developments closely, 
and is alert to changes as they may occur in areas where the 
Group operates.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Corporate Social Responsibility
CSR is fast becoming one of the key benchmarks of 
an organisation’s overall success and reputation in the 
marketplace and our commitment to CSR is a reflection of 
its importance to staff, customers, local communities and the 
environment in which our business operates.
Community
Our goal is to serve as a positive influence on the 
communities in which we operate.
During December 2008, 888 held its second Charity Day. We 
raised a significant sum which will be donated to global charity 
World for World which focuses on improving the nutrition and 
living standards of some of the world’s poorest communities. 
As part of the Group’s ongoing community projects, our staff 
have been involved in a number of projects throughout the year. 
In Gibraltar donations were made throughout the year to 
a number of local charities including the Research into 
Childhood Cancer charity and Childline Gibraltar. We 
continue to support St Martin’s School through various 
activities including a Gardening Day in March and the 
donation of a Christmas tree.
In Antigua we organised a poster competition for the Adele 
School for Special Children, a day’s event for the whole school 
and we held a Christmas lunch for the residents and donated 
much-needed supplies for craft activities to the National 
Vocational and Rehabilitation Centre for the Disabled. 
In Israel, for the second year running 45 employees joined 
the Ruach Hatova (the “Good Wind”) national volunteering 
organisation for a day of goodwill comprising an outing for 
refugees. We continue to support the Netanya-based non-
profit charity “Derech Ha’Etgar” that helps disadvantaged 
teenagers. In June we held a day’s cycle outing and in 
December we held a Hanukah party for the children and 
donated games, prizes and holiday treats. We have also 
helped to redecorate the centre.
Environment
888 has been a constituent member since 2007 of the 
FTSE4Good Index, which aims to provide a tool for investors 
to identify and invest in companies that meet globally 
recognised corporate responsibility standards.
Whilst pure online-based businesses have a low impact on 
the environment, the Group is still committed to taking a 
proactive approach to minimise its environmental footprint. In 
2008 we established a global green forum, the “Bee Green 
Forum”. The forum meets monthly to discuss and implement 
environmental policies and initiatives throughout the Group’s 
operational sites. 
The first of these initiatives was an awareness campaign 
to encourage employees to think about the impact of their 
actions on the environment and to recycle and save energy 
by switching off machinery and lights when appropriate. We 
produced a Bee logo to front the campaign with posters and 
signs displaying useful environmental 
information which has proved very 
popular with staff.
One of the key operational goals was the 
reduction of our electricity consumption. 
A pilot scheme that was introduced in our 
Israel office in 2007 was subsequently 
fully implemented and the following steps were taken:
l  Installation of energy efficient light sources
l  Automated control of air conditioning and lighting 
systems with motion sensors in meeting rooms 
l  Installation of solar energy device for water heating
l  Optimisation system installed to our air conditioning 
saving 15% of energy used
l  Anti-sun stickers installed on windows improving air 
conditioning efficiency
We have, through these actions, reduced our energy 
consumption by 11%. 
All our offices recycle as many materials as possible and 
employees are discouraged from using disposable cups. 
We use only ecological detergents in our offices and have 
installed a number of water saving devices.
In order to minimise the impact of travel on the environment 
we encourage employees to cycle by providing allocated 
parking, showers and changing rooms. In order to minimise 
international travel 888 has invested in state-of-the-art 
teleconferencing facilities which encourages staff to use 
virtual conference meetings instead of travel. 
Employees
In a fast-moving and competitive industry the management, 
communication, reward and retention of our employees is 
a key factor in our continued success. We strive to be an 
employer of choice where employees have an opportunity to 
be successful and fulfil their potential.
We recognise that our employees represent a centre of 
excellence for the online gaming industry and we are keen 
to nurture and maintain that pool of talent. We adopt a 
consultative approach with our employees through various 
means including the intranet and employee surveys.
In 2008 our focus was on employee engagement levels and 
how to improve employee satisfaction. We conducted a 
global employee opinion survey to understand, in a formal, 
well-structured, measurable and traceable manner, our 
employees’ feedback towards different aspects of their daily 
work, atmosphere and culture. The survey’s findings have 
formed the basis for defining objectives for improvement and 
a number of actions are being taken across the business as 
a direct result. This will become an annual event.
Professional Development
Beyond financial rewards, 888 aims to provide clear 
opportunities for development and progression enabling 
16254888COM FRONT.indd   31 16254888COM FRONT.indd   31 08/04/2009   17:47 08/04/2009   17:47 888 Holdings plc www.888holdingsplc.com 32

Corporate Social Responsibility
continued
employees to improve their skill set and performance. We 
have implemented an annual global appraisal system called 
“talking@888” using a web-based platform. The main target of 
the appraisal & goals process is to conduct an open dialogue 
between employees and their managers, while examining 
performance and achievement of goals throughout the past year 
and defining goals for the upcoming year. Each employee is also 
evaluated on the expression of the values in their everyday work. 
We hold an annual business leadership convention to keep senior 
managers informed of strategy and business performance; this 
information is then cascaded down to all employees.
In 2008 we also sent our key managers from different 
locations and divisions on an executive development 
programme for companies competing in global markets.
Training
Training and development programmes help employees 
develop their skills and experience and to reach their full 
potential, benefiting both themselves and the Group. During 
2008 over 80% of all Group employees participated in 
internal and/or external training courses including soft skills, 
technology and industry led training. 
Equal opportunity
We believe that inclusion is about ensuring everyone has an 
equal opportunity to access 888 as an employer. We value 
everyone’s contribution, regardless of their background or 
gender, and firmly believe that our diverse workforce helps us 
to meet the needs of our global customers.
At the year end, the Group had 931 employees (2007: 805) in 
the following locations: Gibraltar, Israel, Antigua and London.
Life@888 — the 888 Creed
Entertainment@888 — We believe that entertainment is what 
completes our lives. After the challenges and routine that occupy 
most of our time, everyone is entitled to some fun and excitement.
Customers@888 — We believe that our first responsibility 
is to provide the best experience and world-class service to 
our customers and business partners at all levels. This means 
tailoring the most perfect offering for each customer, client and 
partner from the high level of the business down to each and 
every player, at all locations at any given time. 
888 is proud to both develop and acquire new products to 
maintain its edge. We are always mindful of the complex 
regulatory environment that we operate in and the social 
responsibility that comes with our industry. 888 understands 
that in order to create value, it must protect values — and that 
demands an investment of time and resources in caring for its 
more vulnerable customers.
Employees@888 — We are responsible for our employees 
who work with us worldwide. We must provide an enjoyable 
work environment where people are challenged and motivated 
to excel, where flair is rewarded, compensation is fair and 
the balance between work and family is respected. Individual 
development is encouraged and advancement is based 
solely on merit. We must always invest in developing our 
employees so that they can achieve their personal aspirations. 
All employees should expect their managers to be capable, 
knowledgeable and motivating. We must always treat our 
suppliers and other partners with respect, enabling them to 
make a fair profit. We will never expose our employees to 
regulatory risk and all employees should be comfortable that 
their actions are just and ethical.
Responsibility@888 — We must use our financial success 
for the greater good. We are in a great position to invest 
back in to the charities and organizations that are important 
to our employees and to our customers. We must especially 
encourage and support the social responsibility that 
accompanies our work. We are committed to provide a 
fair and responsible gaming environment and to guide our 
customers to play responsibly.
Investors@888 — We must strive to operate as efficiently 
as possible, achieving profitable excellence always ensuring 
that we treat their capital as if it was our own. We must take 
risks that allow step-changes in performance while always 
calculating the risk and measuring our results, retaining 
knowledge and learning from our experiences. By doing all of 
the above we will increase shareholder value.
Our Values:
Excellence: We consistently challenge ourselves to reach the 
highest performance level in everything we do.
Innovation: We dare to question our own ‘way of doing 
things’, keeping an open mind, experimenting, and constantly 
creating new surprising and effective solutions.
 
Caring: We value every employee, colleague and customer. 
We show it by creating a nurturing environment of respect 
and sensitivity to the needs of others. We do not forget our 
commitment to provide a responsible gaming environment to all.
Customer centricity: We keep our customers (both internal 
and external) at the centre of all decision-making processes, 
we strive to exceed customer expectations and provide the 
best customer experience.
Leading: We strive to remain one step ahead of the competition. 
This means we are constantly on our toes, thinking ahead and 
keeping a close eye on industry developments.
Collaboration: We know our success depends on our ability to 
work as a single unit while sharing our knowledge, capabilities 
and opinions in an open, respectful and trusting environment.
These values underpin the Group’s strategic goals, giving 
all employees a sense of identification and a defined way 
of behaving as well as ensuring alignment between the 
organization’s business objectives and those of individual 
employees. These values serve us as our guidelines and we 
strive to obtain a high level of integrity in the way we work, 
communicate and act.

Risk Report
The Group operates in a new and dynamic business 
environment. In addition to the day-to-day commercial 
risks faced by most enterprises, the online gaming industry 
faces particular challenges in respect of Regulatory risk, 
Reputational risk, Information Technology risk and Taxation 
risk, each of which is detailed below. 
Regulatory risk
The regulatory framework of online gaming is dynamic and 
complex. Change in the regulatory regime in a specific 
jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on business 
volume and financial performance in that jurisdiction. A 
detailed regulatory review is set out below.
Reputational risk 
The Group is exposed to the risk of under-age and problem 
gamblers accessing its online real money gaming sites. The 
Group devotes considerable resources to putting in place 
prevention measures coupled with strict internal procedures 
designed to prevent under-aged players from accessing 
its real money sites. In addition, the Group promotes a 
safe and responsible gaming environment to its customers 
supplemented by its corporate culture. The Group has a 
dedicated Director of CSR & Responsible Gaming tasked 
with the responsibility of implementing such policies. Further 
details about the Group’s responsible gaming initiatives are 
set out on page 31.
Information technology risks 
As a leading online business, the Group’s IT systems 
are critical to its operation. The Group is reliant on the 
performance of these systems. 
Cutting-edge technologies and procedures are implemented 
throughout the Group’s technology operations designed to 
protect its networks from malicious attacks and other such 
risks. These measures include traffic filtering, anti-DDoS 
(Distributed Denial of Service) devices, Anti-Virus protection 
from leading vendors and other such means. Physical and 
logical network segmentation is used to isolate and protect 
the Group’s networks and restrict malicious activities. In order 
to ensure systems are protected properly and effectively, 
external security scans and assessments are carried out in a 
timely manner. The Group has a high-end storage solution to 
ensure storage availability and performance. All critical data 
is replicated to another storage device for disaster recovery 
purposes and all data is stored off-site on a daily basis.
In order to minimise dependencies on telecommunication 
service providers, the Group invests in network infrastructure 
redundancies whilst regularly reviewing its service providers. The 
Group has contracted with a second Internet service provider in 
Gibraltar in order to minimise reliance on one provider.
As a part of its monitoring system, the Group deploys set 
user experience tests which measure performance from 
different locations around the world. Network-related 
performance issues are addressed by re-routing traffic using 
different routes or providers. 
888 operate a 24x7 Network Operations Centre (NOC). The 
NOC’s role is to conduct real time monitoring of production 
activities using state-of-the-art systems. These systems are 
designed to identify and provide alerts regarding problems 
related to systems, key business indicators and issues 
surrounding customer usability experience. 
Taxation risk
The Group aims to ensure that each legal entity within 
the Group is a tax resident of the jurisdiction in which it is 
incorporated and has no taxable presence in any other 
jurisdiction. While the Group’s customers are located 
worldwide, certain jurisdictions may seek to tax such activity 
which could have a material adverse effect on the amount of 
tax payable by the Group or on customers’ behaviour. 
The Group benefits from favourable fiscal arrangements in 
some of the jurisdictions in which it has taxable presence 
without which its results would be adversely affected. All 
gaming activities are based in Gibraltar, where the Group 
currently benefits from a tax exempt status. A change of 
control or activity of a tax exempt subsidiary would result in 
the loss of its tax status. However, this is not expected to 
have a material adverse effect on the overall tax rate of the 
Group. The tax exempt status is due to expire by the end of 
2010 when the Government of Gibraltar intends to introduce 
a new fiscal regime that complies with EU requirements. 
Domestic corporate tax in Gibraltar is 27% (2008/2009). 
Gibraltar’s Chief Minister has announced further reductions 
in anticipation of the introduction of a flat tax rate of 10% 
in 2010. A consultation is in place with respect to the new 
tax regime in Gibraltar and it is widely anticipated, following 
Government indications that the new rules will be in place 
by July 2009 but not come into effect until July 2010 with 
gaming companies subject to an effective rate of tax well 
below the new flat tax rate. The Group is currently required 
to pay a gaming duty, currently set at 1% of gaming yield, 
with an annual maximum cap of £425,000 in aggregate, 
in respect of its Casino, Poker, Bingo and Backgammon 
activities and, separately, at the same rate in respect of the 
Group’s new Sports offering. The applicability of the gaming 
taxes following the implementation of the new tax regime is, 
as yet, unclear.
The Group’s subsidiary in Israel, Random Logic Limited, 
and the Israeli branch of Intersafe Global Limited, have each 
entered into separate transfer pricing agreements on an arm’s 
length basis with the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner. The 
arrangements for Random Logic Limited are effective until 
2010, while the arrangement for the Intersafe Global Limited 
branch terminated on 31 December 2007. Accordingly, the 
Group has discontinued the use of this branch. 
The operation in Antigua also benefits from a low tax regime 
further mitigated by the current small scale of the operation.

Corporate Governance
888 Holdings plc (the “Company”) is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange, but it is not subject to the UK Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance issued in June 2006 
(the Code) as it is a Gibraltar incorporated company. The 
Directors support high standards of Corporate Governance 
and will continue to comply with the Code as far as it is 
appropriate for a company incorporated in Gibraltar.
The Board
The Directors consider it essential that the Company should 
be both led and controlled by an effective Board.
Composition
The Board consists of eight Directors as follows: three 
Independent Non-executive Directors, two non-Independent 
Non-executive Directors, a Non-executive Chairman, and 
two Executive Directors, comprising the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The biographical details of 
all of the Directors are given on page 34.
Strategic approach
The Board focuses upon the Group’s long-term objectives, 
strategic and policy issues and considers the management 
of key risks facing the Group. The Board is responsible for 
acquisitions and divestments, major capital expenditure 
projects and considering Group budgets and dividend policy. 
The Board also determines key appointments. The Board 
receives regular updates on shareholders’ views. 
The Board has established a calendar of business. This 
provides for the financial calendar, strategic planning, annual 
budgets and performance self-assessments, as well as the 
conduct of standing business. The calendar forms the basis 
for effective integration of business activities as between the 
Board and its principal Committees (see pages 36 and 37), 
which individually consider their own operating frameworks 
against the Board’s business programme.
The Board has established a formal process for the annual 
evaluation of the performance of the Board, its committees and 
individual Directors. The evaluation process covered a range of 
issues such as Board processes, Board rols and responsibilities, 
Board agendas and committee processes. The Board and its 
committees were found to be operating effectively.
The Board plans to meet six times a year. During 2008, the 
Board met six times.
Set out below are details of the Directors’ attendance record at Board and Committee meetings in 2008.

The Chairman has responsibility for ensuring that agendas for 
Board meetings are set in advance. Board papers are issued 
to Directors sufficiently in advance of meetings to facilitate 
both informed debate and timely decisions. 
Non-executive review and performance appraisal
The Chairman holds meetings at least once per year with 
the Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors 
being present. Led by the Senior Independent Director, the 
Non-executive Directors meet once per year without the 
Chairman present in order to appraise the performance of 
the Chairman. The Directors have wide-ranging business 
experience, and no individual, or group of individuals, 
dominates the Board’s decision making.
The Board considers that Brian Mattingley, Michael 
Constantine and Amos Pickel satisfy the criteria of the Code 
to act as Independent Non-executive Directors. The Board 
is satisfied that, upon his appointment as Chairman, Richard 
Kilsby met the independence criteria of the Code. The other 
significant commitments of the Chairman during 2008 are 
detailed in his biography on page 34. The Board considers 
that Mr Kilsby’s other commitments do not interfere with the 
discharge of his responsibilities to the Group and is satisfied 
that he makes sufficient time available to serve the Company 
effectively.

Heading Corporate Governance continued
Reserved powers and delegation
A schedule of matters reserved to the Board has been 
adopted and its content is reviewed to align it with 
operational needs and the Board’s preference to monitor 
and, where appropriate, approve matters of substance to 
the Group as a whole. Senior executives have given written 
undertakings to ensure compliance within their business 
operations with the Board’s formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it for decision or approval. 
Division of responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Chairman are clearly and formally 
defined, with the Chairman being responsible for the effective 
operation of the Board as a whole and supporting key 
external relationships. 
Other issues
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and the Company’s nominated advisers, 
who are responsible for ensuring that Board procedures 
are followed. Directors are able to seek independent 
professional advice, if required, at the Company’s expense 
provided that they have first notified their intention to do so. 
The appointment or removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the Board as a whole.
The Board accepts that there should be a formal, rigorous 
and transparent procedure for the induction of new Directors, 
which has been formulated with the guidance of the 
Nominations Committee.
The opportunity to hold office as Non-executive Directors of 
other companies enables Directors of 888 to broaden their 
experience and knowledge, which will benefit the Company. 
Executive Directors may be allowed to accept non-executive 
appointments with the Board’s prior permission, so long 
as these are not likely to lead to any conflict of interest. 
Executive Directors may be required to account for fees 
received from such other companies.
The Company has arranged insurance cover in respect of 
legal actions against its Directors. To the extent permitted by 
Gibraltar law, the Company also indemnifies the Directors. 
Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover where 
a Director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Re-election of Directors
All Directors are subject to reappointment by shareholders 
at the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment, 
and thereafter, in accordance with the Articles of Association 
of the Company, at intervals of no more than three years. 
Gigi Levy and John Anderson were appointed as Directors 
(Mr Anderson for an initial period of three years) at the 2007 
Annual General Meeting. Richard Kilsby, Shay Ben Itzhak and 
Aviad Kobrine were appointed for a period of three years, 
following their reappointment by the shareholders at the 
2008 Annual General Meeting. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three independent Non-
executive Directors: Brian Mattingley (Chair), Michael 
Constantine and Amos Pickel. The Board is satisfied that 
Brian Mattingley has sufficient recent and relevant financial 
experience to Chair the Audit Committee. Normally, by 
invitation, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer and where appropriate the internal auditor 
and representatives of the Company’s external auditors 
attend the Audit Committee meetings. 
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference are available on 
request to the Company Secretary and are included on the 
Company’s website, www.888holdingsplc.com.
In summary, the Audit Committee assists the Board in 
discharging its responsibilities with regard to financial 
reporting, external and internal audits and controls, including 
reviewing 888’s annual financial statements, considering 
the scope of annual audit and the extent of non-audit work 
undertaken by external auditors, approving 888’s internal 
audit programme, advising on the appointment of external 
auditors and reviewing the effectiveness of internal control 
systems.
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee comprises three independent 
Non-executive Directors: Michael Constantine (Chair), 
Brian Mattingley and Amos Pickel as well as Richard Kilsby, 
Chairman. The Nominations Committee did not meet 
during 2008. 
The Nominations Committee assists the Board in discharging 
its responsibilities relating to the composition of the Board. 
The Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing, 
from time to time, the structure of the Board, determining 
succession plans for the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer, and identifying and recommending suitable 
candidates for appointment as Directors. The Nominations 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on request to 
the Company Secretary and are included on the Company’s 
website, www.888holdingsplc.com.
Remuneration Committee
The Company’s Remuneration Committee comprises three 
independent Non-executive Directors: Brian Mattingley (chair) 
Michael Constantine and Amos Pickel. 
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the 
framework of Executive remuneration and its cost. It is 
required to take account of any recommendation made 
by the Remuneration Committee in determining the 
remuneration, benefits and employment packages of the 
Executive Directors and senior management and the fees of 
the Chairman. 
16254888COM FRONT.indd   36 16254888COM FRONT.indd   36 08/04/2009   17:47 08/04/2009   17:47 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 37

The Remuneration Report, which outlines the Remuneration 
Committee’s work and details of Directors’ remuneration, 
is on pages 38 to 39. The Remuneration Committee’s 
terms of reference are available on request to the Company 
Secretary and are included on the Company’s website, 
www.888holdingsplc.com.
Risk Management and Internal Control
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the 
Company’s system of internal control, for setting policy on 
internal control, and for reviewing the effectiveness of internal 
control. It is management’s role to implement Board policies 
on risk and control, including reporting. The system of 
internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board has delegated responsibility to the Audit 
Committee to review the appropriateness and adequacy 
of systems of internal control on an ongoing basis and to 
make recommendations to the Board. The Company has an 
internal auditor who reports to the Audit Committee, whose 
audit programme for 2008 was reviewed and approved by 
the Audit Committee early in 2008. 
888’s payment risk management team, based in Gibraltar, 
has developed stringent payment risk management and 
fraud control procedures. The team makes use of external 
and internal systems to manage the payment risks faced 
by 888’s operational systems. Detailed procedures exist 
throughout the Company’s operations and compliance is 
monitored by operational management and the internal 
auditor.
The Directors periodically review the effectiveness of the 
Group’s systems of internal control. The review considers 
individual risk control responsibilities, reporting lines and 
qualitative assessments of residual risks. 
Relations with Shareholders and Key 
Financial Audiences
The Company maintains an active and regular dialogue 
with principal and institutional shareholders and sell-side 
analysts through a planned programme of investor relations 
and financial PR activity. The outcome of these meetings 
is reported to the Board. The programme includes formal 
presentations of full year and interim results, quarterly release 
of Interim Management Statements, analyst’s conference 
calls and periodic road shows.
Brian Mattingley, the Senior Independent Director, is available 
to shareholders to address any issues where contact with 
the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer is inappropriate or where such contact has failed to 
resolve the issue.
All shareholders are welcome to attend the 2009 Annual 
General Meeting and private investors are encouraged to 
take advantage of the opportunity given to ask questions. 
The Chairmen (or nominated members) of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees will attend the 
meeting and be available to answer questions.
Compliance with the Code Provisions
As 888 Holdings Public Limited Company is registered in 
Gibraltar, it is subject to compliance with Gibraltar statutory 
requirements and is not bound by the UK Combined Code. 
The main legislation relevant to companies in Gibraltar is 
the Gibraltar Companies Act, which is based on the UK 
Companies Act 1929. 
Going Concern
After careful review of the Group’s budget for 2009, its 
medium-term plans, liquid resources and all relevant matters 
the Directors are confident that the Company and the Group 
have adequate financial resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. They have therefore 
continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Corporate and Social Responsibility 
Statement
The Group’s Chief Executive Officer is the Director 
responsible for monitoring corporate and social responsibility 
within 888. The Board receives periodic reports on the 
Group’s activities in this area from the Chief Executive 
Officer. Further details are set out in the Corporate Social 
Responsibility report on page 27.
Community 
Sponsorship
888 is a sizeable employer with a visible presence in Gibraltar 
and enjoys a good relationship with the local community. 
During 2008, the Group continued its policy of reinforcing 
this relationship by making contributions to a number of local 
causes, primarily educational. 
Charities
In 2008, the Group made donations totalling US$107,821 
(2007: US$232,000) to organizations promoting various 
social causes in Gibraltar and Israel.  
16254888COM FRONT.indd   37 16254888COM FRONT.indd   37 08/04/2009   17:47 08/04/2009   17:47 888 Holdings plc www.888holdingsplc.com 38

Heading Remuneration Report
In accordance with the Listing Rules, the Company presents 
its report on the remuneration of its Directors for the year 
ended 31 December 2008. The Company is incorporated in 
Gibraltar and, therefore, is not required to comply with the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report requirements in Schedule 
7A to the UK Companies Act 1985, but has chosen to 
prepare this Remuneration Report on the basis of those 
requirements, as appropriate.
The report sets out the structure and details of the 
remuneration of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 
2008. It also describes the Board’s policy and approach to 
the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ 
remuneration.
A resolution to approve the Remuneration Report is 
proposed, annually, to shareholders for approval. This 
Remuneration Report will be put to shareholder vote at the 
2009 Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists solely of independent 
Non-executive Directors, currently Brian Mattingley (Chair), 
Michael Constantine and Amos Pickel. Details of attendances 
at Committee meetings are contained in the statement on 
Corporate Governance on page 35. The Remuneration 
Committee has formal terms of reference (which are available 
on request in writing to the Company Secretary and on the 
Company’s website, www.888holdingsplc.com).
Independent Advice
The Board intends that executive remuneration policies be 
both formal and transparent. It further acknowledges the 
importance of taking into consideration independent advice 
in setting remuneration policies and benefit levels. The 
Remuneration Committee has taken advice from New Bridge 
Street Consultants as independent advisors with respect to 
Executive Directors’ remuneration towards the end of 2006 
and therefore further advice was not required during 2008. The 
policies applied in 2008 remain consistent with that advice.
Remuneration Policy
Executive Directors
Remuneration packages must be sufficient to attract, 
retain and motivate Directors of the calibre appropriate 
to a global business in a competitive environment. The 
Remuneration Committee is mindful that most of the Group’s 
competitors are not UK listed companies and takes into 
account in determining appropriate remuneration levels.The 
components of the remuneration structure are set out below.
At least half of the total potential remuneration of the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer 
are represented by a variable element, dependent on the 
performance of the Company. The Remuneration Committee 
considers that these represent achievable and motivational 
levels of personal rewards commensurate with stipulated 
levels of corporate performance. 
The Remuneration Committee is mandated by the Board 
to satisfy itself that the level of the Directors’ and senior 
management’s remuneration is appropriate, having regard 
to pay and conditions throughout the rest of the sectors in 
which the Group operates. It will further satisfy itself that 
such remuneration aligns with the risks and rewards to 
shareholders. In this context the Remuneration Committee 
will regularly review individual and corporate performance 
targets. In the current volatile economic climate, executive 
leadership is more important than ever. The Remuneration 
Committee will continue to use careful and rigorous 
judgement to match remuneration to achievements. 
The Remuneration Committee has taken account of the 
volatile economic climate in considering the application of 
performance conditions which were set in previous years 
and has exercised its discretion to waive and amend such 
conditions as it has deemed appropriate and as further 
explained below.
Non-executive Directors
The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors receive fees 
only, and are not eligible to participate in any bonus plan, 
pension plan, share plan, or long-term incentive plan of 
the Company. The Chairman and the Executive Directors 
determine the fees paid to the Non-executive Directors. 
The Chairman’s fees are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee.
Fees paid to the Non-executive Directors are set by reference 
to an assessment of the time commitment and responsibility 
associated with each role. Levels take account of additional 
demands placed upon individual Non-executive Directors by 
virtue of their holding particular offices, such as Committee 
Chairman and/or Deputy Chairman and travel time to Board 
meetings and the Group’s headquarters in Gibraltar. The 
fees paid to each Non-executive Director during 2008 are 
disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration summary on 
pages 41 and 42.
Remuneration Structure
Base Salary and Benefits
Base salaries are subject to annual review. Gigi Levy’s last 
review took place in April 2008 and his salary for 2008 
remained GBP420,000. Aviad Kobrine’s last review took 
place in January 2008 and his aggregate salary for 2008 
which is paid by his employers, the Company and Cassava 
Enterprises (Gibraltar) Limited was raised in line with inflation, 
to GBP285,000. Benefits provided to Executive Directors 
include a car (in the case of Gigi Levy) and a car allowance 
(in the case of Aviad Kobrine) and health, disability and life 
insurance. 
Annual Cash Bonus
Gigi Levy and Aviad Kobrine are entitled to an annual cash 
bonus of up to 120% of annualised salary, subject to the 
achievement of predetermined targets. The Remuneration 
Committee sets bonus targets and levels of eligibility each 
16254888COM FRONT.indd   38 16254888COM FRONT.indd   38 08/04/2009   17:47 08/04/2009   17:47 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 39
16254 08/04/2009 Proof 8
year. For the 2008 financial year, the performance target 
was 20% growth in revenue* compared to 2007 for non-US 
business and provided that the EBITDA* margin for 2007 
was maintained. The pay out levels were set at 50% of base 
salary for 80% performance, increasing on a linear basis 
up to 100% where targets were fully satisfied. In the event 
that revenue growth exceeded 20%, the percentage bonus 
entitlement increased by 4% for every 1% additional revenue 
growth, up to a maximum bonus entitlement of 120%.
These targets were met during 2008 and both Gigi Levy and 
Aviad Kobrine are entitled to receive an annual cash bonus 
of 100% of their annualised 2008 salary. The bonuses are 
payable by their respective employers. The Remuneration 
Committee has rigorously reviewed the results achieved 
against the performance targets set for the 2008 financial 
year and is satisfied that the targets it set were challenging 
and the bonuses awarded were earned by outstanding 
performance. Notwithstanding their contractual entitlement 
to receive 100% of their annual cash bonus, in light of the 
current economic environment, the Executive Directorrs 
waived 25% of their contractual entitlement to cash bonuses.  
In addition, the Executive Directorrs, in order to further reflect 
their long-term commitment to the Group’s future, elected to 
receive 20% of their maximum potential annual cash bonus 
entitlement (after the waiver of 25%) in the form of a grant by 
the Remuneration Committee of a share award pursuant to 
the terms of the All Employee Plan which will vest over three 
years. Accordingly, the actual cash bonus received by the 
Executive Directorrs was only 55% of the total annual cash 
bonus entitlement.
Additionally, the performance conditions attaching to the 
share award granted to Gigi Levy in 2006, vesting of which 
was subject to the same conditions as for his annual cash 
bonus, were met in full for the financial year 2008. 
Pensions
Gigi Levy and Aviad Kobrine are each entitled to a cash 
payment in lieu of an annual contribution to their personal 
pension schemes of 15% of their respective base salaries 
(in the case of Aviad Kobrine, 15% of his basic salary under 
both service agreements). 
Long Term Incentives 
The Company has two employee share incentive plans: (i) 
the 888 All-Employee Share Plan, and (ii) the 888 Long Term 
Incentive Plan. 
The Company currently grants awards only under the 888 
All-Employee Plan. 
Performance-dependent options and awards were granted 
under the 888 All-Employee Plan to the Executive Directors 
on 14 September 2006, 30 April 2007 and 8 April 2008. 
Details of these awards and options are set out on page 43.
In 2008, the Remuneration Committee made additional share 
awards to the Executive Directorrs in recognition of their 
excellent performance during 2007. Gigi Levy’s award vests 
in equal portions over 4 years with annual vesting subject to 
the same performance conditions as his annual cash bonus 
in each of those years. Such conditions were met in full for 
the financial year 2008. Aviad Kobrine’s award vests over 4 
years and the Remuneration Committee did not impose any 
performance conditions on that award.
888 All-Employee Share Plan
All employees, exclusive consultants and Executive Directors 
of the Group who are not within six months of their normal 
retirement age are eligible to participate in the 888 All-Employee 
Share Plan at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Awards under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan can either 
be granted for no consideration (or with a nil exercise price 
for options) or at an exercise price that will normally be no 
less than the market value of an Ordinary Share at the time of 
grant or average share price during a period as determined 
by the Remuneration Committee at time of grant. In countries 
where an award or option involving real shares is not 
appropriate or feasible for legal, regulatory or tax reasons, a 
phantom award may be used.
The maximum number of Ordinary Shares that an eligible 
employee may acquire pursuant to share awards or options 
granted to him in any calendar year under the 888 All-
Employee Share Plan and the 888 Long Term Incentive Plan 
may not have an aggregate market value, as measured at 
the date of grant, exceeding 200% of his annual base salary 
or such higher limit as the Remuneration Committee may 
determine is appropriate in any individual case. Awards vest 
over a fixed period of up to four years. The Remuneration 
Committee may determine that the vesting and release or 
exercise of share awards and options under the 888 All-
Employee Share Plan are subject to performance conditions 
imposed at the time of grant. 
*  Subject to certain adjustments as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee.

Heading Remuneration Report continued
The performance conditions which determine the vesting of 
the options and awards granted on 14 September 2006, 
30 April 2007 and 8 April 2008 to Executive Directors are 
driven solely by financial performance, not by comparison 
to an external peer group. Vesting occurs over a period 
of four consecutive years starting in April 2007 and is 
subject to target growth as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. 
For the vesting of awards in the financial years 2006, 
2007 and 2008, the performance conditions set by the 
Remuneration Committee were a target growth in the 
Company’s annual EPS (excluding share benefit charges). 
In each year, EPS must grow by a target of at least 20% in 
order for 100% of the award for that year to vest.
Fifty per cent of the award vests upon achievement of 80% 
of the target EPS growth rate and increases on a linear basis 
up to 100% upon achievement of 100% of the target EPS 
growth. If the threshold of 80% of target EPS growth rate 
is not met in any one year, the portion of the award due to 
vest in that year lapses. Performance conditions may be 
amended by the Remuneration Committee if circumstances 
which prevailed at the date of grant have subsequently 
changed provided that the amended performance conditions 
would be a fairer measure of performance. 
EPS was taken as the parameter for these performance 
conditions as the Remuneration Committee is of the view 
that, given the nature of the industry in which the Company 
operates where its share price performance is heavily 
influenced by external factors outside its control, that EPS is 
a better measure of the Company’s own performance. The 
Remuneration Committee was of the view that, historically, 
these performance conditions provide a focus on delivering 
absolute financial returns.
In considering performance for the financial year 2008, the 
Remuneration Committee was of the view that economic 
circumstances had changed as a result of factors outside 
the control of management - volatile currency fluctuations 
and significantly reduced interest rates meant that EPS was 
not an appropriate parameter for measuring performance 
for that year. In light of the strong EBITDA performance of 
the Group in 2008, the Remuneration Committee waived 
the performance conditions and exercised its discretion and 
decided to allow vesting of 60% of the award capable of 
vesting in 2009 to Aviad Kobrine and eligible members of 
senior management. At his suggestion, the Remuneration 
Committee did not waive the performance conditions in 
relation to Gigi Levy and, accordingly, his award capable of 
vesting in 2009 lapsed. 
The Remuneration Committee has decided to amend 
the performance condition related to the portion of all 
awards capable of vesting in 2010 in order to take account 
of the changed economic circumstances. TOI in 2009 
must grow by 5% over financial year 2008 in order for 
100% of the portion of the awards due to vest in respect 
of 2009 subject to maintaining adjusted EPS (excluding 
share benefit charges, interest receivable and foreign 
currency impact) at the same level as 2008. 50% of the 
portion vests upon achievement of fifty per cent of the 
target TOI growth rate and increases on a linear basis up 
to 100% upon achievement of 100% of the target TOI 
growth. If the threshold of 50% of target TOI growth rate 
is not met, the portion of the award due to vest in 2010 
lapses. Performance conditions may be amended by the 
Remuneration Committee if circumstances which prevailed 
at the date of grant have subsequently changed provided 
that the amended performance conditions would be a fairer 
measure of performance.
888 Long Term Incentive Plan
All employees and Executive Directors of the Group who 
are not within six months of their normal retirement age are 
eligible to participate in the 888 Long Term Incentive Plan 
at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. As at the 
date of this report, no awards have been granted pursuant to 
the 888 Long Term Incentive Plan. 888 has given long-term 
incentive awards to Executive Directors under the 888 All 
Employee Plan. 
Scheme Limits 
Awards and options granted under the 888 All-Employee 
Share Plan and the 888 Long Term Incentive Plan may be 
satisfied through the issue of new shares. It is intended that 
grants of options and awards are to be planned so as not to 
exceed 5% of the issued Ordinary Share capital in any rolling 
ten year period for the 888 Long Term Incentive Plan, and 
10% of the issued Ordinary Share capital in any rolling ten 
year period for the 888 All-Employee Share Plan and the 888 
Long Term Incentive Plan, in the aggregate. The Committee 
intends to have regard to appropriate annual flow-rates so as 
to ensure that these limits are not breached.
Employee Trusts
The Company has established two Trusts to further the 
interests of the Company, its subsidiaries and shareholders 
by providing share incentives to employees (including 
Executive Directors) of any Group Company to enable the 
Group to attract, retain and motivate employees.
The 888 IPO Share Award Trust and the 888 Holdings plc 
Share Plan Trust were created pursuant to Trust Deeds dated 
14 September 2005. The 888 IPO Share Award Trust is 
operated in connection with the grant of share awards and 
nil cost options to employees of the Group at the time of the 
IPO. These trusts currently hold 162,361 Ordinary Shares in 
the Company.

service agreement is terminable on no more than 12 months’ 
written notice by either party. Each Executive Director’s

employment can be terminated by making a payment equal 
to the salary and pension contributions and the value of 
other contractual benefits due to the Executive Director in 
lieu of any unexpired notice period. The Executive Directors 
continue to be entitled to be paid a bonus during any 
unexpired part of the notice period even if the employment 
is terminated by making payment in lieu of notice. Share 
Awards granted under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan 
to Gigi Levy and Aviad Kobrine pursuant to their service 
agreements, on 14 September 2006, and 29 September 
and 4 October 2005 respectively, continue to vest during 
any unexpired part of the notice period and they shall be 
treated as a “good leaver” under the terms of the 888 All-
Employee Share Plan where their employment has been 
terminated by making a payment in lieu of notice. No other 
benefits upon termination of employment are payable. An 
Executive Director’s entitlement to share awards and share 
options under the 888 All-Employee Plan on termination 
of employment will be governed by the terms of that plan 
(and in the case of the initial awards made to Gigi Levy and 
Aviad Kobrine by the relevant provisions of their service 
agreements).

Heading Directors’ Report continued
Shareholder Agreements and Consent 
Requirements
There are no known arrangements under which financial rights 
are held by a person other than the holder of the shares.
A Relationship Agreement governing the relationship 
between the above Principal Shareholder Trusts and 
the Company was entered into in connection with the 
Company’s flotation. The Relationship Agreement provides 
that all transactions between the Group and the Principal 
Shareholder Trusts will be on a normal business basis, that 
the Group will be allowed to carry on business independently 
of them and that the Principal Shareholder Trusts will not 
cause the Group to contravene the Combined Code unless 
required by law or as contemplated in the Relationship 
Agreement. It further provides that each of the Principal 
Shareholder Trusts will not solicit Group employees without 
consent, that only independent Directors can vote on 
proposals to amend the Relationship Agreement, that the 
Principal Shareholder Trusts will consult the Group prior 
to disposing of a significant number of shares in order to 
maintain an orderly market and shall not disclose confidential 
information unless required to do so or having first received 
the Company’s consent. The Relationship Agreement also 
includes restrictions on the Principal Shareholder Trusts 
power to appoint Directors and includes obligations on the 
trusts to ensure that the majority of the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, is independent. The Principal Shareholder Trusts 
can nominate a Non-executive Director for appointment to 
the Board and the Directors will refer the appointment of the 
nominated person to the Remuneration Committee. In the 
event that this right is exercised and it results in fewer than 
half the Board (excluding the Chairman of the Board) being 
independent Directors, such appointment shall only become 
effective upon the appointment to the Board of an additional 
independent Director. Such restrictions and obligations apply 
whilst the E Shaked Shares Trust and O Shaked Shares 
Trust collectively or the Ben-Yitzhak Family Shares Trust 
individually hold not less than 7.5%.
Change of Control
Other than the Group’s gaming licences where change of 
control is subject to prior consent, there are no contracts to 
which the Group is a party which would allow the counterparty 
to terminate or alter those contractual arrangements in the 
event of a change of control of the Group.
Charitable Contributions
Contributions for charitable purposes were made during the 
year amounting to US$107,821 (2007: $232,000).
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company, for safeguarding 
the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the 
preparation of a Directors’ report which complies with the 
Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar 
Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the 
Gibraltar Companies Act.
Financial statements are published on the Group’s website 
in accordance with legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The 
maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is the 
responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility 
also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the financial statements. The Directors are required to 
prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and 
have also chosen to prepare financial statements for the 
Company in accordance with IFRSs.

Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial 
statements in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies 
(Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated 
Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Group and 
Company’s financial position, financial performance and cash 
flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards 
Board’s “Framework for the preparation and presentation 
of financial statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair 
presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable 
IFRSs. A fair presentation also requires the Directors to:
l consistently select and apply appropriate accounting 
policies;
l present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and
l provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to 
enable members to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance.
We confirm, to the best of our knowledge:
(a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
 as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
(b) the ‘Enhanced Business Review’, includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Group and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face. 
Auditors
A resolution for the reappointment of BDO Stoy Hayward 
LLP and BDO Orion Limited as auditors of the Company will 
be proposed at the 2009 Annual General Meeting.
During the year ended 31 December 2008 BDO Stoy 
Hayward LLP were appointed auditors for the purposes of

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Shareholders 
of 888 Holdings Public Limited Company
We have audited the Group and the Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of 888 Holdings Public Limited
Company for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group and Company 
Balance Sheets, the Group and Company Cash Flow Statements, the Group and Company Statement of Recognised Income 
and Expenses and the related notes 1 to 26 to the Group Financial Statements and notes 1 to 12 to the Company Financial 
Statements. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited 
the parts of the remuneration report described as having been audited.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities. 888 Holdings Public Limited Company has complied with the requirements of rules 9.8.6 and 9.8.8 of 
the Listing Rules in preparing its Annual Report and has also complied with schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985 as if it 
was incorporated in the UK.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated
Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act and the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited,
has been properly prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit or if information specified by the Listing
Rules and Gibraltar legislation is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Group’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does 
not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review,
Enhanced Business Review, Risk report, Corporate Social Responsibility Report, Corporate Governance Statement and the 
unaudited part of the Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other 
information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant to the terms of our engagement letter and for no other purpose. No person is entitled 
to rely on this report unless such a person is a person entitled to rely upon this report by virtue of the terms of our engagement 
letter or has been expressly authorised to do so by our prior written consent. Save as above, we do not accept responsibility for 
this report to any other person or for any other purpose and we hereby expressly disclaim any and all such liability.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited. It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the parts of the
Remuneration Report described as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited.

Opinion
In our opinion:
l the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the Group’s and the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
and
l the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999,
Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act; and
l the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited has been properly prepared in accordance with
Schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985; and
l the information provided in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements; and
l we have nothing to report to you in respect of our responsibility set out above in relation to the Company keeping proper
accounting records, the auditors receiving information and explanations for our audit and disclosures regarding Directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions
Emphasis of Matter — Regulatory issues
In forming our opinion, which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy of, and draw attention to, the disclosures made in
note 26 to the financial statements concerning the residual risk of an adverse impact arising from the Group having had customers in
the US prior to the enactment of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act.
Note 26 includes a statement that the Board has not been able to identify reliably at this stage what, if any, liability may arise and 
accordingly no provision has been made.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1 General information
Company description and activities 
888 Holdings Public Limited Company (the “Company“) and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) was founded in 1997 and originally 
operated as a holding company domiciled in the British Virgin Islands. On 12 January 2000, the Company was continued in Antigua and 
Barbuda as a corporation under the International Business Corporation Act 1982 with registered number 12512. On 17 December 2003, 
the Company redomiciled in Gibraltar with the Company number 90099. On 4 October 2005, the Company listed on the London Stock 
Exchange.
The Group is the owner of innovative proprietary software solutions providing a range of virtual online gaming services over the internet 
including Casino, Poker, Bingo, Sport and Backgammon to end users and also provide these services through business partners. In 
addition the Group provide payment services, customer support and online advertising.
Cassava Enterprises (Gibraltar) Limited and Brigend Limited (both subsidiaries) carried out the operations of the Group during the year,
principally under the name www.888.com under the terms of the gaming licences issued in Gibraltar.
Definitions 
In these financial statements:
The Company 888 Holdings Public Limited Company.
The Group 888 Holdings Public Limited Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries Companies over which the Company has control (as defined in International Accounting Standard 27 “Consolidated 
 and Separate Financial Statements” and whose accounts are consolidated with those of the Company).
Related parties As defined in International Accounting Standard 24 — “Related Party Disclosures”.
2 Significant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are as follows:
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, 
including International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) and Interpretations, adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”)
and endorsed for use by companies listed on an EU regulated market.
The significant accounting policies applied in the financial statements of the Group in the prior years are applied consistently in these 
financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in thousands of US dollars (US$’000) because that is the currency the Group primarily operates in.
The consolidated financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies (Accounts) Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies (Consolidated 
Accounts) Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act.
The following standards and interpretations, issued by the IASB or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
(IFRIC), are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its 
consolidated results or financial position:
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 — Group and treasury share transactions (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007). IFRIC 11 has 
been endorsed for use in the EU. The Group has adopted IFRIC 11 ‘Group and treasury share transactions’. The effect of adopting this is 
that the parent Company recognises as a cost of investment the value of its own shares that it makes available for the purpose of granting 
share options to employees or contractors of its subsidiaries. This has no impact on the Group financial statements, and no impact on the 
prior year profit or net assets of the parent Company.
IFRIC 12 — Service concession arrangements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008). IFRIC 12 was due to 
be applied in these financial statements but it has not yet been endorsed for use in the EU. However, it has no impact on these financial 
statements.
IFRIC 14 — The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction (effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2008). IFRIC 14 has been endorsed for use in the EU.
The following standards and interpretations, issued by the IASB or IFRIC, have not been adopted by the Group as these were not effective 
for the year 2008. The Group is currently assessing the impact these standards and interpretations will have on the presentation of its 
consolidated results in future periods:

Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience 
and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.

2 Significant accounting policies continued
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates and assumptions which 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. These 
policies together with references to the related notes to the financial statements can be found below:
Taxation Note 7
Intangible assets   Note 11
Impairment of Goodwill and intangible assets  Note 11
Share-based payments  Note 21
Regulatory compliance and contingent liabilities   Note 26
Discontinued operations
As a result of enactment of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (“UIGEA”) in October 2006, the Group withdrew from offering 
real-money activity to the US facing market.
Although the Group did not operate the US facing business as a separate business, it was a separate geographical segment of the 
Group’s business and in accordance with IFRS 5 — “Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” the income
statement and related notes were required to show continued and discontinued operations separately.
There was no impact of these matters in respect of the year ended 31 December 2008.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are companies 
controlled by 888 Holdings Public Limited Company. Control exists where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the parent gained 
control until such time as control ceases. 
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements using the purchase method of 
accounting. On the date of the acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values and any excess of the 
fair value of the consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Inter-Company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent Company and using consistent 
accounting policies.
Total revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably 
measured. Revenue is recognised in the accounting periods in which the transactions occurred.
Total revenue consists of revenue from online gaming and revenue generated from processing customers’ cross currency deposits and 
withdrawals. Total revenue comprises of the following: 
Casino
Casino winnings that are the differences between the amounts of bets placed by customers less amounts won by customers.
Poker
Ring games:  Rake, which is the commission charged from each winning hand played.
Tournaments: Entry fees charged for participation in Poker tournaments are recognised when the tournament has concluded.
Emerging Offerings 
Revenue from Emerging Offerings is defined as the commission charged from winnings or entry fees charged for participation in a
tournament and winnings from Sportsbook activity. In the case of white label activity, Revenue is the net commission charged.
Casino winnings, revenues from the Poker business and Emerging Offerings are stated after deduction of certain bonuses granted 
to customers. 
Other operating income 
Other operating income consists mainly of revenue generated from processing customers’ cross currency deposits and withdrawals.

2 Significant accounting policies continued
Foreign currency 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-US dollar currencies are translated into US dollar equivalents using year end spot 
foreign exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. 
Exchange rate differences on foreign currency transactions are included in administrative expenses.
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from US dollars are translated into the 
presentation currency as follows:
(i)  monetary assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(ii)  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at an average exchange rate (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are
translated at the dates of the transactions); and
(iii)  exchange rate differences on translation of Group entities that have functional currencies different from US dollars are included in 
administrative expenses.
Taxation
The tax expense represents tax payable for the year based on currently applicable tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs from its tax 
base. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the difference can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. The amount of the asset or liability is determined 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred 
tax liabilities/assets are settled/recovered. 
Intangible assets
Acquisitions
Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value 
at the acquisition date. The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets. For acquisitions during the year 
2007, the useful economic life of the intangible assets acquired is estimated to be between three months and four years. Intangible assets 
are reviewed annually for evidence of impairment. Any impairment in carrying value is charged to the consolidated income statement.
Internally generated intangible assets
Expenditure incurred on development activities is capitalised only when the expenditure will lead to new or substantially improved products 
or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete 
development. All other development expenditure is expensed. Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only 
where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates. The Group estimates the useful life of 
these assets as between 3 and 5 years.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities acquired. Cost comprises the fair value of any assets acquired, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued, 
plus any direct costs of acquisition.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement. 
Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is 
credited in full to the consolidated income statement on the acquisition.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. Carrying amounts are reviewed at each balance 
sheet date for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, at annual rates estimated to write off the cost of the assets less their estimated 
residual values over their expected useful lives. The annual depreciation rates are as follows:
IT equipment 33%
Office furniture and equipment 7%–15%
Motor vehicles 15%
Leasehold improvements Over the shorter of the term of the lease or useful lives

2 Significant accounting policies continued
Impairment of non-financial assets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually on 31 December,
and where applicable an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the income statement. Other non-financial assets are subject to 
impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the 
carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is 
written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the asset’s cash 
generating unit (i.e. the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows).
Financial instruments
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost and principally comprise amounts due from credit-card
companies and from e-payment companies. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer 
probable. Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash. They include short-term deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months or less. 
Equity
Equity issued by the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised at fair value and carried at amortised cost.
Liabilities to Customers
Liabiltiies to customers comprises the amounts that customers place in the Group’s electronic “wallet” or bankroll, including provision 
for bonuses granted by the Group, less management fees and charges applied to customer accounts, along with full provision for 
jackpots. These amounts are repayable on demand in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets comprise non-derivative financial assets not included in any of the above financial asset categories 
are classified as available-for-sale and comprise principally the Group’s investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries. They 
are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in a separate component of equity. Where there is a significant 
decline in the fair value of an available for sale financial asset the full amount of the impairment, including any amount previously 
charged to equity, is recognised in the income statement.
Chargebacks 
The cost of chargebacks is included in operating expenses.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases wherever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present or constructive obligation as a result of a past event from which it is probable that
it will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reasonably estimated.
Segment information
A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing an individual product or service or a 
group of related products or services and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. A 
geographical segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products or services within a particular 
environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments.

The Group operates in the following online gaming segments:
l Casino
l Poker
l Emerging Offerings comprises mainly the newly established B2B business, Bingo business, 888’s Sportsbook, Live dealer offering
and 888’s Backgammon offering.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends this is when paid. In the case of final 
dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Share-based payments
Where the Company grants its employees or contractors shares, nil priced options or market value options, the fair value at the date of 
grant is charged to the income statement over the vesting period. Non-market performance conditions are taken into account by adjusting 
the number of instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the 
vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest.

Severance pay liability — Israel
The Group’s employees in Israel are eligible to receive certain benefits from the Group in certain defined circumstances. As such the 
Group operates a defined benefit severance pay plan which requires contributions to be made to separately administrated funds.
The method used to determine the current service cost and the present value of the defined benefit obligation, according to IAS 19 
‘Employee Benefits’ is the Projected Unit Credit actuarial cost method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised by the Group using the 
equity method. In prior years, the Group neither recorded nor accrued any actuarial gains or losses using the equity method, since there
were no material adjustments or effects of actuarial changes.
In 2008, the Group recognised actuarial losses according to the equity method as reflected in the consolidated statement of Recognised 
Income and Expenses.

Gibraltar —The Company and its Gibraltar registered subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of the Gibraltar Companies (Taxation 
and Concessions) Act (the “CTCA”) as tax-exempt companies. Subject to a change of ownership or activity of a tax-exempt company,
the grandfathering of tax-exempt benefits in respect of existing tax-exempt companies will extend up to 31 December 2010.  Domestic 
corporate tax in Gibraltar is 27% (2008/2009). Gibraltar’s Chief Minister has announced further reductions in anticipation of the introduction 
of a flat tax rate of 10% in 2010. A consultation is in place with respect to the new tax regime in Gibraltar but it is widely anticipated, 
following Government indications that it is expected the new rules will be in place by July 2009 but not come into effect until July 2010.
Israel — 888 have entered into certain transfer pricing agreements with the Israeli Income Tax Commissioner. The agreement in respect 
of Random Logic Limited is effective until the end of 2010. The agreement in respect of the Israeli branch of Intersafe Global Limited was 
effective until the end of 2007. Accordingly, the Group has discontinued the use of this branch. Domestic corporate tax in Israel in 2008 is 
27% (2007: 29%) and is scheduled to go down to 25% from 2010 and onwards.
UK — 888’s subsidiary in the UK pays corporate tax in the UK at the applicable rate of 28% (2007: 30%).

8 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations
Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share
In accordance with IAS 33, “Earnings per share”, the weighted average number of shares for diluted earnings per share takes into account 
all potentially dilutive shares and share options granted, which are not included in the number of shares for basic earnings per share. In 
addition, certain employee options have also been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their exercise price is greater than the 
weighted average share price during the year and it would not be advantageous for the holders to exercise the option. The number of 
options excluded from the diluted EPS calculation is 3,117,110 (2007: 4,765,036).

10  Acquisitions made during the prior year 
Online Bingo business 
On 16 May 2007 the Group acquired the assets comprising the online Bingo business of Globalcom Limited (“Bingo Business”) for an all-
cash consideration. 
In calculating the goodwill arising on acquisition, the fair value of the net assets of the Bingo business were valued by a professional 
valuation firm and recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 and adjustments from book value have been made where necessary. These 
adjustments are summarized as follows:

The fair value relates to the recognition of customer lists (US$888,000), royalty agreements (US$1,113,000), licensing agreements 
(US$2,113,000) and other intangible assets (US$200,000) acquired as part of the acquisition. These intangibles are being amortised over 
their estimated useful economic lives of between three months and four years. All intangible assets on acquisition have been identified and 
fair valued. The remaining goodwill represents the access to future trade with the Bingo customers.

The revenue and operating profit generated from this acquisition in the post-acquisition period to 31 December 2007 were $14.4 million 
and $5.2 million respectively. Had the business been owned for the entire year, the revenue and operating profit for 2007 would have been 
$20.2 million and $8.3 million respectively.

Acquired intangible assets and Goodwill
Brought forward intangible assets and goodwill, including an increase in Goodwill during the year of US$166,000 due to a further
contingent consideration paid during the year, are associated with the cash-generating online Bingo business unit acquired during the prior 
year. The intangible assets include acquisitions of customer lists, royalty agreements, licensing agreements and certain software developed 
acquired as part of the acquisition of the assets comprising the online Bingo business of Globalcom Limited. These intangibles are being 
amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of up to four years. On acquisition, the intangible assets have been identified and 
valued using third party professional valuers. 
At the year end, the carrying value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the online Bingo business 
to their present value. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were those regarding discount rate and growth rates of 
the business. The Directors estimate discount rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks 
appropriate to the online Bingo business. The discount rate that is considered by the Directors to be appropriate is a discount rate of 12% 
being the Group’s specific weighted average cost of capital.
In estimating the future cash flows the Group has used conservative estimates in respect of revenues generated and costs incurred. 
Growth rates of the online Bingo business are based on past experience and projections of future changes in the online gaming market, 
taking into account external sources of information such as analysts’ research reports. These suggest that Bingo is expected to remain 
one of the fastest developing sectors with an estimated Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14% by the end of 2012. The Group 
has used lower and declining growth rates in estimating the future cash flows conservatively reflecting the current uncertainties about the 
medium term global economic outlook. The Directors have used forecasts for the next five years of the expected cash flows, of which the 
first year is based on the Group’s current approved budget. 
An annual growth rate of 4% was used for 2009 and 2010, 2% for 2011 and nil for 2012–2013. Following year five, the Group extrapolates 
cash flows in perpetuity, using an estimated growth rate of 1%, which is based upon the expected long-term growth rate of the UK 
economy. Costs associated with the Bingo cash generating unit were projected as a percentage of revenues and have been assumed to 
continue to increase by 10% in each of the five year period to 2013, over and above the level of growth in revenues.
The Directors are not aware at this time of any need to change their key assumptions on which they have based their determination of 
the recoverable amount of the goodwill which would cause its carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount. In fact, although such 
movements are not expected to arise, neither a 1% a decrease in the growth rate in each of the next three years nor a 5% increase in the 
discount rate would have led to an impairment of the acquired intangible assets and goodwill in the current year.
The Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its acquired intangible assets and goodwill, or when such events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that these may be impaired. The result of the review, undertaken at 31 December 2008, was that no impairment 
needs to be recognised and the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets and goodwill is considered appropriate.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
11 Intangible assets continued
During the year the Group acquired an Internet domain name based business which is used to generate traffic into the Group’s various 
websites. Consideration of US$513,000 was fully paid before year end. Contingent consideration of up to US$800,000 is not expected to 
be paid.
The Directors have performed a valuation of the intangible asset acquired. The Directors took into account the following factors, amongst 
others, in determining the fair value of this intangible asset:
l Domain’s ranking with search engines
l Traffic ranking as a measure of popularity
l Number of unique visitors to the site
l Number of links pointing to the domain
The Directors concluded that the fair value that should be assigned to the intangible asset is US$13,000 whilst the remainder of 
US$500,000 is to be recognised as goodwill (given that trade balances acquired were incidental). No further IFRS 3 disclosures have been
given on the grounds of materiality.
Internally generated intangible assets
During the year the Group has put in place processes and procedure which enable it to ascertain technological feasibility before
development costs are incurred and therefore be in a position to capitalise costs incurred after that point. Such expenditure is only 
capitalized when the development cost meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria as set out in IAS 38 
‘Intangible assets’. 
The Group estimates the useful life of these assets as between 3 and 5 years. These assets are subject to impairment test wherever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable on the same basis as described above for 
acquired intangible assets. At 31 December 2008 no impairment needs to be recognised and the carrying value of internally generated 
assets is considered appropriate.

21 Share-based payment
Prior to flotation, the Company adopted two equity-settled employee share incentive plans — the 888 All-Employee Share Plan and the 
Long Term Incentive Plan. Awards were granted under the 888 All-Employee Share Plan conditional upon flotation. The 888 All-Employee 
Share Plan is open to all employees and Executive Directors of the Group who are not within six months of their normal retirement age at 
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Awards under this scheme will vest in instalments over a fixed period of up to four years.
The Company grants awards to certain Executive Directors and members of its senior management. These awards are subject to 
performance conditions imposed by the Remuneration Committee at the dates of grant.

The Monte Carlo model takes into account all the minimum requirements set by IFRS 2 such as: the exercise price of the option, the 
current price of the underlying share, the expected volatility of the price of the underlying share, the expected dividend on the underlying 
share, the expected term of the option both contractual term and based on employees’ expected behaviour and the risk-free interest rate 
for the expected term of the option.
In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards a charge to the income statement in respect of any shares or options 
granted under the above schemes will be recognised and spread over the vesting period of the shares or options based on the fair value 
of the shares or options at the date at grant, adjusted for changes in vesting conditions at each balance sheet date. This charge has no 
cash impact.

24 Financial risk management 
The Group is exposed through its operations to risks that arise from use of its financial instruments. Policies and procedures for managing 
these risks are set by the Board following recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer. The Board reviews the effectiveness of these 
procedures and, if required, approves specific policies and procedures in order to mitigate these risks.
The main financial instruments used by the Group, on which financial risk arises, are as follows:
l Cash and cash equivalents
l Restricted cash
l Trade and other receivables
l Available-for-sale financial assets
l Trade and other payables
l Liabilities to customers
Detailed analysis of these financial instruments is as follows:

Restricted cash  922 803
Available-for-sale financial asset 223 654
117,234 124,492
In accordance with IFRS 7, with the exception of available for sale assets, all financial assets are classified as loans and receivables.

Liabilities to customers  33,284 26,414
71,138 88,323
In accordance with IFRS 7 all of the above financial liabilities are held at amortised cost.
At 31 December 2008 and 2007, the fair value and the book value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities were materially the same.
Capital
The Capital employed by the Group comprises equity attributable to shareholders. The primary objective of the Group is maximizing 
shareholders’ value, which, from the capital perspective, is achieved by maintaining the capital structure most suited to the Group’s size, 
strategy, and underlying business risk. Other than disclosed elsewhere in note 26 there are no demands or restrictions on the Group’s
capital.

24 Financial risk management continued
The main financial risk areas are as follows:
Credit risk
Trade receivables
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to trade receivables who are the Group’s payment service providers (“PSP”). These are third
party companies that facilitate deposits and withdrawal of funds to and from customers’ virtual wallet with the Group. These are mainly 
intermediaries that transact on behalf of the main credit card companies. 
The risk is that a PSP would fail to discharge its obligation with regard to the balance owed to the Group.
.
The Group reduces this credit risk by:
l Monitoring those balances on a regular basis.
l Arranging for the shortest possible cash settlements intervals.
l Replacing rolling reserve requirements, where they exist, with a Letter of Credit by a reputable financial institution.
l Ensuring a new PSP is only contracted following various due diligence and “Know Your Customer” procedures.
l Ensuring policies are in place to reduce dependency on any specific PSP .
The Group believes that based on the above and on extensive past experience the PSP receivables are of good credit quality and there is 
no requirement to provide for any potential bad debts arising from a PSP failing to discharge its obligation.
None of the balances owed by the various PSP are overdue or impaired.
An additional credit risk the Group faces relates to customer’s disputing charges made to their credit cards (“chargebacks”) or any other 
funding method they have used in respect of the services provided by the Group. Customers may fail to fulfil their obligation to pay which 
will result in funds not being collected. These chargebacks and uncollected deposits, when occurring will be deducted at source by the 
PSPs from any amount due to the Group. As such the Group provides for these eventualities by way of a provision based on analysis 
of past transactions. This provision is netted off from the trade receivables balance and at 31 December 2008 was $1,070,000 (2007: 
$845,000). 
The Group’s in-house Fraud and Risk Management department carefully monitors deposits and withdrawals by following prevention and 
verification procedures using internally developed bespoke systems integrated with commercially available third party measures. 
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group controls its cash position out of its Gibraltar headquarters. Subsidiaries in its other locations (Israel, Antigua and London) 
maintain minimum cash balances which are deemed required for their operations. Cash settlement proceeds from PSPs, as described 
above, are paid into bank accounts controlled by the Treasury function in Gibraltar. The Group segregates funds due to customers and
holds these funds in separate bank accounts. These funds are not used to fund activity other than that directly related to customers. The 
Group maintains its funds with highly reputable financial institutions and will not hold funds with financial institutions with low credit rating. 
The Group maintains its cash reserve in highly liquid deposits and regularly monitors rates in order to maximize yield.
Restricted cash
Restricted cash is mainly attributed to a deposit in respect of the Group’s obligation with the developer of the offices of its subsidiary 
in Israel.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk exists in the case where the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations as they become due. The 
Group monitors its liquidity in order to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to allow it to meet its obligations. In the case of 
the Group’s liability to its customers, the Group maintains these deposits in separate bank accounts which are not used for its day-to-day 
operations. The Group has ensured that cash earmarked to fund its final dividend payment for 2008 is in place. The Group expects to 
have sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances and will not need to resort to any 
borrowing.

24 Financial risk management continued
Market risk
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the interest bearing deposits in which the Group invests surplus funds. 
The Group’s policy is to invest surplus funds in low risk money market funds or on call over night facilities. The Group also arranged with 
its principal bankers that excess funds are swept automatically across its accounts, every night, in order to maximize availability of funds 
for investments. 
Downside interest rate risk is minimal as the Group has no borrowings. A 0.5% movement in bank interest rates would not have a 
significant impact on finance income for the year or the prior year.
Currency risk
The Group’s financial risk arising from exchange rate fluctuations is mainly attributed to:
l Mismatch between Balance sheet Liabilities to customers which is predominately denominated in US$ and the net receipts from
customers which are settled in the currency of the customer’s choice, of which sterling (GBP), euros (EUR), and Canadian dollar 
(CAD) are significant.
l Mismatch between reported revenue which is mainly generated in USD (the Group’s functional and reporting currency) and
significant portion of deposits which are settled in local currencies.
l Expenses, the majority of which are denominated in foreign currencies, including sterling (GBP), the euro (EUR) and the New Israeli 
Shekel (ILS). 
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure is kept to an 
acceptable level, inter alia, by using foreign exchange forward contracts designed to fix the economic impact of known liabilities. At 31 
December 2008 and 31 December 2007, there were no outstanding forward contracts. There were no significant fair value movements 
on these contracts during the year.

During 2008 the Board authorised the creation of a dedicated treasury function within the Finance division which was set up. Its 
responsibility is to manage the cash resources of the Group and minimise the various exposures associated with holding, and investing 
these funds.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
26  Contingent liabilities
From time to time the Group is subject to legal claims and actions against it. The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success 
of such claims and actions. 
Regulatory issues 
As part of the Board’s ongoing regulatory compliance and operational risk assessment process, the Board continues to monitor legal
and regulatory developments, and their potential impact on the business, and continues to take appropriate advice in respect of these 
developments. 
Following the enactment of the UIGEA on 13 October 2006, the Group stopped taking any deposits from customers in the US and barred 
such customers from wagering real-money on all of the Group’s sites.
Notwithstanding this, there remains a residual risk of an adverse impact arising from the Group having had customers in the US prior to the 
enactment of the UIGEA. The Board is not able to identify reliably at this stage what if any liability may arise and accordingly no provision 
has been made.
On 5 June 2007 the Group announced that it has initiated preliminary discussions with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern
District of New York. It is too early to assess any particular outcome of these discussions.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
1 General information and accounting policies
A description of the Company, its activities and definitions are included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company has applied accounting policies identical to the Group’s accounting policies listed in note 2 to the consolidated financial 
statements other than in relation to investments in its subsidiaries which are held at cost less any impairment provision required.
 
Under Section 10(2) of the Gibraltar (Consolidated Accounts) Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own 
income statement.
2 Investments in subsidiaries
The Company’s subsidiaries are listed in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and are held at cost less provision for any 
impairment. The Group has adopted IFRIC 11 ‘Group and treasury share transactions’. The effect of adopting this is that the parent 
Company recognises as a cost of investment the value of its own shares that it makes available for the purpose of granting share options 
to employees or contractors of its subsidiaries. This has no impact on the Group financial statements, and no impact on the prior year 
profit or net assets of the parent Company. The movement on investment in subsidiaries in both years was in respect of IFRIC 11. This 
amount was US$6,892,000 in 2008 (2007: US$4,623,000).

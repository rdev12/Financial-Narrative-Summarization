Moving. Adapting. Changing.
Lupus Capital plc was renamed Tyman plc, with effect from 
1 February 2013. Tyman is derived from the Old English word 
meaning “to turn”. Things that turn are always in process. Moving. 
Adapting. Changing. To turn things around is to revolve, change 
position, make progress.
Our name now reﬂects the re-focusing of the Group as a leading 
international supplier of components to the door and window 
industry worldwide.

Tym Tyman a plc
The Group is now a clearly focused 
building products company and a leader 
in the supply of components to the door 
and window industry worldwide. These 
characteristics should enable us to deliver 
sustainable margin improvement and 
long-term growth for shareholders.
Chairman’s statement
The past twelve months have been a period of signiﬁcant change 
for the Group, involving business disposals in the UK, acquisitions 
in the UK and US, a new organisational structure for our 
businesses outside of North America, all culminating in the change 
of name to Tyman plc.
In 2012 we completed the sales of Gall Thomson and our 
loss-making UK composite doors business. These successful 
disposals of non-core assets, combined with the acquisition of 
Unique Balance and Fab & Fix, means that the Group enters 2013 
as a focused supplier of components to the door and window 
industry worldwide.
At the operational level our new Divisional Managing Directors 
for grouphomesafe and Schlegel International have completed 
their ﬁrst full year in the business and the beneﬁts of the increased 
focus that our new organisational structure brings to the Group 
are becoming evident.
The change of the Group’s name to Tyman plc is another 
landmark in our development. For a number of years the name 
“Lupus Capital” promoted some confusion among the Group’s 
customers and suppliers, as well as with potential investors, in that 
it implied that the Group was a ﬁnancial institution, rather than a 
building products manufacturing business. Tyman is derived from 
the Old English word for “to turn” and is a simple, solid and more 
relevant expression of what the Group is about. 
Financial performance 
Performance for the continuing operations of the Group in 2012 
was creditable against a backdrop of difﬁcult markets worldwide. 
Group revenues increased by 5.8 per cent on a reported basis 
and were broadly ﬂat on a constant currency, like for like basis, 
after adjusting for recent acquisitions and for exchange rate 
movements. Underlying operating proﬁt before property provision 
releases increased by 3.6 per cent and underlying earnings per 
share increased by 16.9 per cent to 10.45 pence. 
These results, together with solid cash generation and conﬁdence 
in the medium term prospects for the Group, lead the Board to 
recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 3.5p per ordinary share, ahead of 
its commitment at the time of interim results of not less than 3.0 
pence per share. This makes a total dividend for the year of 4.5p, 
an increase of 28.6 per cent over last year.
Board and governance
The addition of Dr Angelika Westerwelle to the Board provides 
us with a more appropriate number of Non-executive Directors 
as the Group enters the next phase of its development. I am 
delighted to welcome Angelika to the Board and am sure her 
extensive and relevant experience in international manufacturing 
and in the development of medium sized businesses will be of 
great beneﬁt to Tyman.
The Board has continued its practice of holding Board meetings 
at operational locations on a regular basis and during 2012 met 
at Group sites in Sioux Falls (US), Gistel (Belgium) and Willenhall 
(UK). These visits allow the Board the opportunity to meet with 
local management and to see at ﬁrst hand the skills, expertise 
and energy of Group employees around the world.
While Tyman is presently traded on the AIM market of the London 
Stock Exchange, and therefore is not required to comply with 
the UK Corporate Governance code, the Board has taken the 
view that the Group should aspire to the corporate governance 
standard of companies listed on the Main Market. The Board is 
also committed to a programme of continuous improvement to 
the Group’s overall governance and risk management processes. 
As examples of this commitment, from 2013 the Board will 
implement a formal annual evaluation of performance and

Company Overview
Not so long ago, if a homeowner wanted all of the hardware 
on their front door to match, they would have had to choose 
a white powder-coated ﬁnish. This was because handles 
and knockers were typically die-cast zinc and letterplates 
were fashioned from aluminium pressings. These materials 
were impossible to colour match unless sprayed with paint.
The Nu Mail was the ﬁrst die-cast zinc letterplate the 
UK market had seen. It could be electro-plated to 
match other door hardware exactly – ﬁrst in chrome, 
then in gold and bronze, and now six different ‘Hardex 
Electro’ ﬁnishes. It was the innovation that really 
established Fab & Fix on the journey to offering the 
ultimate in window and door hardware. T oday over 250 
products are available in perfectly matching ﬁnishes.
Spotlight on new developments
The Nu Mail Letterplate from Fab & Fix
the Group will implement a more structured internal audit 
function as part of a wider reassessment of the Group’s risk 
management framework. 
Following the completion of the strategic refocusing of our 
businesses and the renaming of the Group, the Board feels 
that this is the appropriate time for Tyman plc to move to the 
Main Market. The Board therefore intends, during the course of 
the next twelve months, to seek a primary listing on the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange and admission to the 
Premium Segment of the Ofﬁcial List. We will keep shareholders 
informed in this regard.
Outlook
Tyman has leading positions in many of its global niches and is 
backed by a strong balance sheet which will allow us to invest in 
our businesses both organically and through acquisition at a time 
when many competitors are capital constrained. The Group is now 
a clearly focused building products company and a leader in the 
supply of components to the door and window industry worldwide. 
These characteristics should position us to deliver margin 
improvement and long-term growth for shareholders.

Tyman plc
2013 will see further difﬁcult markets, 
however we are committed to our well 
deﬁned plans to invest in our businesses, 
take market share, deliver further margin 
improvement, increase returns on capital 
and drive earnings for shareholders.
2012 saw the completion of a fundamental reshaping of Tyman 
plc along with creditable operational progress against a difﬁcult 
market backdrop.
The Group reported an increase in revenues in the year from 
continuing operations of 5.8 per cent. On a constant currency, 
like for like basis – after adjusting for recent acquisitions and for 
exchange rate movements – revenues were broadly in line with 
2012. Underlying operating proﬁt* increased by 3.6 per cent in the 
year to £23.0 million. Underlying earnings per share* increased 
by 16.9 per cent to 10.45 pence. 
These results reﬂect the initial beneﬁts that are being derived from 
the fundamental reshaping of the Group that has taken place over 
the past three years. 
* Before property provision releases.
2012 divisional performance 
Collectively our Amesbury business performed well in the year and 
took market share, with a particularly strong performance by our 
sealing systems business. Margins in the division in the year were 
impacted by some of the investments we made, most notably 
the start-up of our new Atlanta plant and the ﬁxed overhead of 
the Montreal facility acquired as part of the Unique Balance 
transaction; neither of which should repeat in 2013. Overall, on 
a constant currency, like for like basis, Amesbury revenues grew 
by 5.0 per cent in the year to £112.0 million. 
In the UK, grouphomesafe has seen further overall market 
contraction during 2012. Like for like revenues from continuing 
operations in the UK in the year decreased by 5.5 per cent and 
Underlying operating proﬁt decreased by 1.1 per cent.
However, once the acquisition of Fab & Fix is taken into account, 
reported revenues from continuing operations increased by 3.8 per 
cent to £73.3 million, Underlying operating proﬁt increased by 
10.0 per cent to £9.0 million and Underlying operating margins 
increased to 12.2 per cent. By comparison, the reported 
Underlying operating margins for UK element of the Building 
Products segment in 2011 was 8.7 per cent, demonstrating the 
transformational impact of the corporate activity undertaken in 
the UK business during the year.
Schlegel International had a difﬁcult trading year with revenues 
down 8.6 per cent and Underlying operating margins decreasing 
from 8.2 to 6.7 per cent. In Continental Europe, which remains a 
tough trading environment, we have addressed the ﬁxed cost base 
through the closure of our Building Products facility in Gistel, 
Belgium transferring production to the UK and Spain. During 2013 
we will take further steps to enhance the efﬁciency of Schlegel 
International in Europe.
Further aﬁeld, Australian markets contracted in the year, however 
we successfully grew the business through a combination of 
market share gain and new product introductions. Aligned with 
this, our Brazilian and Singaporean operations have shown 
continued growth.

Amesbury had previously faced a portfolio gap. Unable 
to sell high-volume door sweeps to major door Original 
Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), the company was 
missing a key sales opportunity. T o enable the business 
to become a one-stop solutions provider for key door 
OEMs and offer all components involved with entry-door 
systems, Amesbury invested in a 32,000 sq ft state-
of-the-art manufacturing facility in Covington, GA. 
The expanded capabilities of its new Covington, GA, 
plant have allowed Amesbury to meet the needs of more 
customers – and to potentially triple its total extrusion lines 
to keep up with demand. The plant has helped generate 
new extruded product business with leading OEMs such as 
Endura Products, Therma-Tru, and Trinity Feather River.
Spotlight on growth
Expanded capabilities with new 
manufacturing facility
Outlook for 2013
Across all of our businesses, alongside our well established 
self-help initiatives, we are seeking to drive through a consistency 
of approach and of excellence. This means for customers a 
differentiated product offering at appropriate pricing, delivered 
to speciﬁcation, on time and in full. Over time we believe this 
consistency of approach will deliver a signiﬁcant and sustainable 
improvement in the underlying quality and proﬁtability of 
the Group. 
In a number of our markets, the general macro-economic 
environment remains challenging. This in turn has a dampening 
effect on consumer conﬁdence and on the willingness of the 
end-consumer to invest in their properties which means that 
organic growth will predominantly come from expansion of our 
existing market shares. We will achieve this expansion by 
investment in our businesses at a time when a number of 
competitors are capital constrained and by delivering the highest 
quality of customer service and fulﬁlment along with competitively 
priced products that reﬂect the value add of our offer.
The housing market in North America appears more robust today 
than at any point in the past ﬁve years and 2013 has started well 
for Amesbury with order intake ahead of 2012. Provided repair 
and remodelling expenditure follows historic patterns, we would 
expect to see further growth for Amesbury in 2013 and should be 
well positioned for 2014 and beyond.

Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s review continued
The corporate activity undertaken in the UK in 2012 has 
transformed our grouphomesafe business. During 2013, while we 
expect the overall market will continue to contract, we will aim to 
take further market share through organic growth, new product 
introductions and growing the Fab & Fix offering still further.
For Schlegel International, European trading conditions are 
expected to remain difﬁcult for some time to come, however the 
rebalancing of our European footprint gives us the right platform 
for the manufacture and distribution of sealing products in Europe 
going forward. We expect Australasian markets to be more robust 
in 2013 and we will continue to promote our product offering in 
emerging markets – with South America and South East Asia 
being particular focuses in 2013. 
Growth acceleration
With limited market growth expected in the UK and Continental 
Europe in the near term and the full market recovery in the US 
yet to occur, we need to allocate our resources carefully in order 
to drive future returns. With this in mind, we will focus on ﬁve 
principal areas in 2013:
1. Acceleration of our new product development programme with 
the prioritisation of those product applications and markets 
that can contribute meaningfully to the Group in the near term.
2. Investment in our existing businesses and people and in our 
supply chain to ensure that we can deliver the best quality 
product at the appropriate price point in line with our 
differentiated marketing philosophy.
3. Expansion of our emerging markets presence, through 
accelerated investment in sales and technical resource in the 
key targeted territories.
4. Further improvements to our customer service programmes, 
our marketing and our communications to ensure that we 
understand the needs of our customers, communicate our 
capabilities and deliver on our promises.
5. Supplementing our organic initiatives through an active 
acquisition programme, prioritising the North American market 
where we believe there remains a structural cyclical opportunity 
and those emerging markets where market position may be most 
easily obtained through acquisition. Following the disposal of Gall 
Thomson we have a strong balance sheet and have a number of 
further acquisition opportunities in the pipeline.  Conclusion
Tyman plc has delivered a creditable set of results in 2012 against 
a backdrop of difﬁcult markets with good growth in Underlying 
operating proﬁt and earnings. These results, together with solid 
cash generation and conﬁdence in the medium term prospects for 
the Group, mean we are able to recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 
3.5p per ordinary share a total dividend for the year of 4.5p. 
Order intake in the early weeks of the new ﬁnancial year is ahead 
of the same period last year, with strong order intake seen in 
North America and satisfactory performance across other markets.
2013 will see further difﬁcult markets, however we are committed 
to our well deﬁned plans to invest in our businesses, take market 
share, deliver further margin improvement, increase returns on 
capital and drive earnings for shareholders. We remain optimistic 
that the Group will make further progress in 2013.

Enhancing margins and improving returns
Our growth will be funded through our ongoing initiatives 
to enhance margins and improve returns. Margin management 
will be a key objective for each of our divisions in 2013. Alongside 
margin expansion we will target signiﬁcant growth in the Group’s 
return on capital in future years which we will achieve through 
management of the supply chain, continued cost discipline and 
critical analysis of investment opportunities.
We will continue to focus on full recovery of material and other 
input cost inﬂation across all our businesses in line with our track 
record over the past three years. We will accomplish this through a 
combination of optimising prices, driving down supply chain costs 
and delivering productivity gains. 
In addition, we are putting in place long-term programmes that 
will secure the most cost effective and efﬁcient end to end supply 
chain for the Group. We will achieve this through a combination of 
measures:
 continuing to move production and procurement to lower cost 
countries when appropriate; 
 further development and extension of lean manufacturing 
techniques across the Group;
 continued rationalisation of our third party supplier base; and 
 increased near shoring of those products that are 
most economically made or sourced close to the point 
of consumption. Business Review

Financials
In Dollar terms, Amesbury delivered revenue growth from 
continuing operations of 11.2 per cent and an increase in 
Underlying operating proﬁt of 6.1 per cent in the year. Excluding 
the impact of acquisitions, Dollar revenues increased by 5.0 per 
cent during the year as we continued to gain market share in 
North America.
The division’s reported Underlying operating proﬁt and margin 
were impacted by certain one-off charges associated with 
the Atlanta start up, the ﬁxed cost base associated with the legacy 
Unique Balance manufacturing arrangements and non-cash 
accounting adjustments required by International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) (none of which are expected to 
be repeated in 2013). Once these impacts are stripped out, the 
trading drop-through for division – being the incremental 
operating proﬁt generated on the incremental revenues – was 
approximately 17.5 per cent for the year and the adjusted 
Underlying proﬁt margin would have been 11.0 per cent.
Market
The North American window market as a whole saw steady 
growth throughout 2012. There was a signiﬁcant uptick in new 
housing starts, skewed towards multifamily, however the Repair 
and Remodelling sector, which constitutes the substantial majority 
of the prime window market and typically lags new housing starts 
by c. 12–18 months, saw more muted performance. Overall, the 
Board believes that the market for window and door components 
grew by between one and three per cent in the year.
Operating performance
Within Amesbury, sealing products had a particularly strong year 
with revenues and proﬁtability increasing on the back of new 
customer wins and improved demand for Foamtite
®
 and pile 
weatherstrip products. Hardware beneﬁted from the contributions 
of Unique Balance and Overland, as well as strong performances 
from Door Hardware and our Fastek die casting operation. 
Extrusions saw good growth in revenues in the year. 
In 2012 we targeted a signiﬁcant expansion of sales into the 
US commercial and the Canadian residential market segments. 
Both of these initiatives have started well with a number of new 
accounts penetrated and encouraging levels of demand. Revenues 
in the year for these segments increased by c. 35 per cent (US 
commercial) and c. 20 per cent (Canadian) and we are targeting 
further share gains for 2013.
In 2012 we executed on our strategy to target the US extrusion 
market in a more structured manner, stratifying our product range 
into three categories based on complexity of process. 
Our Cannon Falls facility remains the national centre of excellence 
for extruded products and for the manufacture of highly complex 
extrusions. Our Bandlock and Atlanta facilities will manufacture 
less complex extrusions for the West and East Coast markets 
respectively. While ﬁrst year sales out of Atlanta were slower than 
we had hoped, 2013 has started promisingly and we remain 
conﬁdent that local manufacture remains the best route to market 
for less complex extrusions. 
Merger and acquisition activity
Overland has made a solid start within the Group and has 
integrated well since the acquisition in December 2011. Our 
North American stamping purchases are now substantially all 
manufactured in-house and there have been a number of 
new business wins during the year as the broader Amesbury 
customer base has become more aware of the Group’s 
enhanced stamping capabilities.
The acquisition of Unique Balance at the end of April extends the 
Group’s balance capabilities into heavy duty and commercial 
applications. Since the year end, production has ceased at the 
Montreal facility and has been transferred to our Statesville 
balance factory.
Prospects for 2013
2013 will see the ﬁrst implementations of our new ERP system 
within Amesbury as we move all our North American businesses 
onto a common platform, streamlining reporting and improving 
our customer and supplier interface. 
Provided repair and remodelling expenditure follows historic 
patterns, we would expect to see further growth and margin 
enhancement within Amesbury in 2013 and should be well 
positioned for 2014 and beyond. Business Review

Financials
grouphomesafe delivered revenue growth from continuing 
operations of 3.8 per cent in the year, including the results of Fab 
& Fix since acquisition. Like for like revenues from continuing 
operations decreased by 5.5 per cent for the full year, reﬂecting 
the overall contraction in the UK market and lower pricing on steel 
reinforcer products. Underlying operating margins however 
increased signiﬁcantly to 12.2 per cent following the M&A activity 
undertaken in this division in 2012; compared with 8.2 per cent 
reported for 2011 in the UK geographic split of the Building 
Products segment.
Market 
The UK market has seen further overall contraction during 2012. 
Small increases in demand have been observed for small ticket 
component products, however there has been continued 
signiﬁcant decline in demand for larger ticket fabricator products 
and in the social housing sector. Overall, the Board believes that 
the UK market for window and door components declined by 
between three and four per cent during the year and, on a volume 
basis, believes that the division gained market share and position 
during the year.
Operating performance
Despite this market backdrop, ERA was successful in winning a 
number of door hardware and Multi Point Lock tenders from 
fabricators which will more than offset the loss of some low 
margin business into the retail shed sector. Business generally 
within the Builders Merchant sector was positive, with revenues up 
c. three per cent year on year. EWS beneﬁted from a more benign 
steel pricing environment during the second half of the year and 
increased sales of support channel product. Demand for foam and 
pile weatherstrip in the UK market was broadly ﬂat across the year.
Our smaller portfolio businesses had a solid year. Balance UK grew 
revenues and proﬁtability in 2012. Ventrolla increased revenues 
on the back of higher commercial renovations and acquired three 
new franchises during the year; however domestic results were 
Operating review continued
impacted by the general lack of consumer conﬁdence across 
the UK. Linear is now reported as part of Schlegel International.
Our new management team has started well and has made a 
number of changes to the structure of the UK business. During 
the year a new sales director was recruited and a dedicated 
marketing director role was created as we look to invest in the 
UK team. For 2013 we are investing in product training for both 
customers and employees and are looking to improve our 
customer service still further. 
Merger and acquisition activity
The acquisition of Fab & Fix in August 2012 has been very well 
received in the UK market. Fab & Fix is highly complementary 
to grouphomesafe and signiﬁcantly enhances our offer for the 
UK market, as well as giving the Group a high quality hardware 
offering that has potential in our other international businesses. 
Since acquisition, integration has progressed well and the business 
has performed in line with our expectations. For the year as a 
whole, Fab & Fix increased its revenues by approximately 12.5 per 
cent when compared with 2011.
The disposal of the loss-making Composite Doors division of 
grouphomesafe not only removes a signiﬁcant management 
distraction but also addresses a perceived conﬂict of interest with 
grouphomesafe’s core fabricator customer base. During the year 
we also exited a legacy die casting operation based in T elford.
Prospects for 2013
We expect to see further declines in the UK market into 2013 and 
demand for imported products may be impacted by any sustained 
weakness in sterling; however, we are well positioned to gain share 
with our newly expanded product range. grouphomesafe has a 
strong order book at the year-end and a number of prospects in 
the pipeline which gives us conﬁdence that the business will 
continue to take market share in 2013.

Financials
Schlegel International had a difﬁcult trading year with revenue 
from continuing operations some 3.8 per cent behind the prior 
year on a constant currency like for like basis. Proﬁtability fell by 
21.2 per cent and was severely impacted by the decline in market 
demand seen in Continental Europe, where the majority of the 
Schlegel International business is located.
Markets and operating performance
Southern European markets remain very depressed, and reduced 
demand has impacted all of our European businesses with exports 
to Scandinavian markets also affected. Our largest International 
business, Germany, continued to generate encouraging growth 
through its exposure to Eastern European export markets, and 
increased both revenues and proﬁtability in the year. New 
legislation for the wood window market in South Africa has led 
to a number of export orders for our high performance QLon
®
 
seal product.
Despite further signiﬁcant declines in housing starts in the 
Australian market, our Australasian business had a satisfactory 
year with a small overall increase in revenues driven by new 
product introductions. Singapore had a good year and expanded 
the depth of its hardware range sold alongside existing Schlegel 
products. From 1 January 2013, Singapore has been incorporated 
as a standalone reporting entity as we seek to target the South 
East Asian markets in a more structured manner.
Our Brazilian business had another strong year with revenues 
increasing by approximately one third. During the year we 
strengthened the local team and further streamlined the Brazilian 
supply chain. The next stage in the development of this business 
will be to start manufacturing pile weatherstrip in Brazil and using 
this as a base to target the wider Mercosur region.
Our Linear business, based at Newton Aycliffe in the UK, supplies 
substantially all of its products to export markets and so is now 
reported as part of Schlegel International. In 2012, revenues and 
proﬁtability for this business were affected by the contraction in 
European demand levels. Utilisation levels at Linear are expected 
to improve in 2013 as a result of the European footprint 
consolidation and investment made in the expansion of its 
extrusion capabilities.
Management and restructuring activities
Our new management team has bedded in well and has made 
a number of structural changes to the Schlegel International 
business. During the year the European sales force was 
reorganised on a regional basis and a dedicated marketing 
director role was created. New product development has been 
reinvigorated and independent benchmarking of the high 
performance qualities of Schlegel seals has been established.
Production at our Belgian Building Products business ceased in 
December 2012 and was transferred to our Spanish and Linear 
pile manufacturing plants as planned. We retain a reduced 
presence in Gistel, Belgium, to focus on our range of industrial 
and paper handling products and as an R&D centre for Schlegel 
International. The Group now has clearly deﬁned centres of 
excellence for the manufacture of pile weatherstrip and foam 
compression seals in Europe.
Prospects for 2013
Within Schlegel International, while European trading conditions 
are expected to remain difﬁcult for some time to come, the 
rebalancing of our footprint gives us the right platform for the 
manufacture and distribution of sealing products in Europe going 
forward. Australasian markets are expected to return to growth 
in 2013. In addition, we will continue to promote our product 
offering in emerging markets – with South America and South 
East Asia being particular focuses in 2013.

Underlying earnings per share 
before property provision releases 
increased by 16.9 per cent to 10.45 
pence (2011 restated: 8.94 pence).
Revenue and operating proﬁt
Group revenues from continuing operations increased by 5.8 per 
cent to £228.8 million (2011: £216.3 million). On a constant 
currency, like for like basis, Group revenues were broadly ﬂat year 
on year. 
Gross margins from continuing operations decreased marginally 
compared with 2011 from 32.9 per cent to 32.7 per cent 
reﬂecting changes in business mix and the falls in demand seen 
in continental Europe, offset in part by improvements to the 
grouphomesafe gross margin following the acquisition of 
Fab & Fix.
Underlying administrative expenses increased by approximately 
£2.9 million principally reﬂecting the overhead acquired as part of 
the acquisitions made and the levels of investment in the business. 
Underlying operating proﬁt from continuing operations before 
property provision releases of £23.0 million (2011: £22.2 million) 
was some 3.6 per cent ahead of 2011. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional charges of £2.6 million were incurred during the year 
(2011: £0.6 million) principally comprising the redundancy and 
restructuring charges associated with the closure of the Belgian 
Building Products business and transaction costs associated with 
M&A activity. 
Finance costs
Net ﬁnance charges in the year reduced from £9.7 million to 
£4.5 million. The reduction in the ﬁnance charge reﬂects the 
signiﬁcantly lower Group levels of debt following the disposal of Gall 
Thomson, the Group’s improved margin grid together with lower 
amortisation of historic arrangement fees, and the initial beneﬁts of 
the revised hedging arrangements put in place in 2012. Of the total 
net ﬁnance charge, £0.6 million relates to the unwind of discounts 
on pensions and provisions (2011: £0.6 million). 
Interest rates 
Following the expiry of existing interest swaps in July 2012 the 
Group entered into new interest rate contracts to swap around 
80 per cent of the Group’s outstanding debt from ﬂoating rates 
to a weighted average ﬁxed rate of 1.1 per cent until maturity. 
As at 31 December 2012, the Group’s portfolio of swap 
contracts carried at fair value amounted to a liability of £0.6 
million. Any changes in fair value until maturity, classiﬁed as an 
effective hedge, will be recognised directly in other comprehensive 
income, with only the ineffective portion taken through the 
income statement.
Taxation 
The Group incurred an Underlying tax charge during the year of 
£6.4 million (2011: £4.9 million) equating to an underlying tax 
rate of 29.8 per cent (2011: 28.1 per cent).
As expected, cash taxes paid during the year increased to £4.9 
million (2011: £1.9 million) equating to a cash tax rate of 22.6 per 
cent (2011: 10.8 per cent) reﬂecting the reduction in taxable 
losses and deductible goodwill available to offset against earnings.

Company Overview
The new ERA Fortress multi-point lock is the ﬁrst lock to be 
launched on the UK market carrying a kitemark, certifying 
compliance with the latest security standards detailed in 
PAS 3621. ERA have often led the way in innovative high 
performance security products and Fortress is the latest 
in a long line of groundbreaking door locking systems. 
It follows in the footsteps of ERA Vectis, a door lock that 
removes the security vulnerabilities of a Eurocylinder, 
used on almost all UK multi-point doors and patio doors, 
by removing the need for a cylinder completely. Fortress 
is already available with a Vectis cylinder free option.

Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share before property provision 
releases increased by 16.9 per cent to 10.45 pence (2011 
restated: 8.94 pence). The increase reﬂects the improvement in 
Underlying operating proﬁt from continuing operations, the 
incremental impact of acquisitions, the reduction in ﬁnance 
charge, offset in part by the slightly higher effective tax rate for 
the year.
Underlying earnings per share increased by 20.6 per cent to 11.63 
pence (2011 restated: 9.64 pence). Basic loss per share from 
continuing operations was 16.93 pence (2011 restated earnings 
per share: 6.99 pence).
Dividends
In 2012 the Group declared and paid an interim dividend of 
1.0 pence per share (2011: Nil pence per share) amounting to 
£1.3 million and committed at the time of the interim results to 
a ﬁnal dividend of not less than 3.0 pence per share.
A ﬁnal dividend of 3.5 pence per share, equivalent to £4.5 million, 
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. The total 
dividend for the year therefore 4.5 pence per share (2011: 3.5 
pence per share). 
In accordance with IFRS, only dividends paid during the year 
have been charged in the 2012 ﬁnancial statements.
Acquisitions
The Group acquired Overland Products Company Inc. in 
December 2011 for approximately £10.3 million. On acquisition, 
ﬁnished goods inventory was revalued to its fair value reﬂecting 
its manufacturing proﬁt margin, in accordance with IFRS. This 
accounting treatment decreased 2012 operating proﬁt by 
approximately US$0.4 million. Business Review
Tyman plc
16
Financial review continued
The Group made two acquisitions during the course of 2012. 
Unique Balance International was acquired in April for 
approximately £1.9 million and Fab & Fix was acquired in August 
for approximately £14.8 million. The nature of these two 
businesses was such that there was no material impact on 
proﬁtability from the revaluation of inventories.
Discontinued operations
During 2012 the Group disposed of Gall Thomson in March and 
the Composite Doors business in August, both of which have been 
classiﬁed as Discontinued Operations in the Income Statement. 
Gall Thomson generated a proﬁt on disposal of £54.2 million 
after the write off of £11.5 million of goodwill and associated 
intangibles and Composite Doors generated a loss on disposal of 
£16.8 million after the write off of £14.9 million of goodwill and 
associated intangibles.
In aggregate, revenue of £11.3 million and trading loss of (£0.2) 
million arose from the Discontinued Operations. 
Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles
Amortisation of £10.8 million (2011: £10.6 million) represents the 
normal annual charge relating to the Group’s intangible assets. 
An accelerated amortisation charge of £12.6 million was recorded 
following a revision of the estimated useful lives of acquired 
intangibles. The disposal of the Discontinued Operations resulted 
in a further reduction in intangible assets of £0.6 million and a 
reduction in goodwill of £25.7 million.
In addition, in accordance with accounting standards, the Group 
has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible 
assets and concluded that an impairment charge of £20.3 million 
is appropriate. £13.4 million of this charge relates to Schlegel 
International, reﬂecting the continued difﬁcult trading conditions 
in its Continental European markets and £6.9 million relates to  
the write down in the valuation of brand names no longer in use. 
Segmental analysis
Following the fundamental reshaping of the Group that took 
place during 2012, the Board, in its capacity as the Group’s Chief 
Operating Decision Maker, has reassessed the appropriateness 
of the Group’s operating segment disclosures. 
The Group now operates through three clearly deﬁned divisions – 
Amesbury, grouphomesafe and Schlegel International – each 
headed up by a divisional CEO and each reporting to the Board, 
via the Executive Directors, on a regular basis. Accordingly, the 
Board feels that the most appropriate segmental analysis for 
stakeholders is based on the three reporting divisions with an 
allocation of Group central overheads made to each division.
Prior year disclosures have been amended to take account of 
the revised operating segments. There has been no material 
change to the Amesbury operating segment however Linear, 
which was previously reported as part of the UK geographic 
disclosure, will now be reported as part of the Schlegel 
International operating segment.
In the opinion of the Board there is no material difference 
between the Group’s operating segments and segments based 
on geographical splits. Accordingly, the Board does not consider 
geographically deﬁned segments to be reportable.
Liquidity and covenant performance
The Group maintains sufﬁcient cash balances and undrawn 
borrowing facilities to ﬁnance all investment and capital 
expenditure included in its strategic plan, with an additional 
margin for contingencies. 
At 31 December 2012 the Group had gross outstanding 
borrowings of £72.8 million (2011: £115.6 million), cash balances 
available of £35.9 million (2011: £20.4 million) and undrawn 
working capital facilities of £29.6 million (2011: £26.9 million).
Underlying net debt was £37.0 million (2011: £91.2 million). 
Under the IFRS deﬁnition, which reduces gross debt by the 
unamortised portion of ﬁnance arrangement fees, net debt at 
the year end was £35.2 million (2011: £88.8 million). 
At the year end, the Group had headroom on its banking 
covenants ranging from 17 per cent to 59 per cent and the 
Group’s net debt to Underlying EBITDA ratio was 1.22x (2011: 
2.25x), calculated on the same basis as banking covenants.
For 2013 the Group’s banks have agreed to an amendment to 
the mid-year covenant test to reﬂect the levels of investment 
being undertaken in the business and the working capital proﬁle 
of the Group.
Cash ﬂow
As we indicated at the start 2012, during the year we 
increased our capital investment programme by 39.8 per cent, 
or £1.9 million, to £6.9 million. T angible capital expenditure for 
the year increased to £5.5 million (2011: £4.4 million) or 1.1x 
depreciation and intangible capital expenditure increased  to 
£1.4 million (2011: £0.5 million) principally as a result of our 
investment in US ERP. 
We have continued to focus on management of working capital 
within the business. Inventories increased on a reported basis as 
a result of acquisitions, however inventory turns remained broadly 
in line with 2011. Total working capital at the year end was also 
impacted by December pre-buys of c. £1.6 million made at our 
EWS facility. 
During the year a number of our customers ceased trading, 
however vigilant management of customer credit risks throughout 
the year, starting at the point of sale, meant that bad debts 
written off amounted to only 0.3 per cent of revenue (2011: 0.4 
per cent). 
Cash conversion for the year from continuing operations was 79.4 
per cent (2011: 93.4 per cent) reﬂecting the signiﬁcantly increased 
capital expenditure that occurred in the Group in 2012. Over the 
past three years, cash conversion has averaged approximately 
93.7 per cent.
Pensions and post retirement medical beneﬁts
The Group’s gross pension and post retirement medical beneﬁt 
obligations under IAS 19 at 31 December 2012 were £24.2 million 
(2011: £21.8 million) with the majority of the movement over 
the course of the year being due to actuarial losses following 
reassessments of discount rates. The principal schemes are located 
in North America where the pension scheme is closed to new 
entrants and post retirement healthcare beneﬁts are capped.
Cash contributions made to the schemes during the year were 
£1.0 million (2011: £1.2 million).
Property
During the year we have continued to examine our manufacturing 
footprint as we seek to develop centres of excellence that give us 
sufﬁcient ﬂexibility to manage current demand levels but allow us 
the potential to respond quickly to changes in the market 
environment if required.  Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements

Company Overview
In 2012 we successfully assigned the lease on Unit A at Peterlee 
and have been released from all remaining obligations in 
connection with the Peterlee site. This resulted in a release to the 
income statement in 2012 of approximately £2.0 million of 
property provisions. 
This follows the successful assignment of the lease on Unit B at 
Peterlee in 2011. Together the exit of Units A and B will save the 
Group in excess of £3.0 million in cash costs of rent, rates, utilities 
and services over the period to March 2018. 
The exits from the Composite Door and T elford Die Casting

Risk Description Mitigation
Market conditions
The overall growth and demand for the 
Group’s products is subject to the usual 
drivers of construction activity (ie general 
economic conditions, interest rates, 
business/consumer conﬁdence levels, 
unemployment, population growth etc). 
This demand can be unpredictable and the 
Group has a low visibility of future orders 
from its customers. During any economic 
downturn customers and competitors may 
apply pressure to prices and this pressure 
can lead to lasting changes in terms of 
pricing policies, delivery capabilities and 
market expectations.
Reductions in the Group’s net debt and 
the negotiation of new banking facilities, 
committed until March 2016, have 
strengthened the Group’s ability to 
withstand future downturns in its markets. 
The geographic spread of our business and 
our ability to ﬂex our cost base helps to 
mitigate some of this risk. Management 
prepares regular forecasts and reviews that 
focus on remedial action plans required to 
deliver the desired performance during the 
balance of the year. Continuing to monitor 
and measure our commercial performance 
enables us to offer industry leading 
customer service which improves customer 
retention and wins new customers. The 
current investment in ERP systems will 
enhance management visibility of 
operational performance and drive 
continuous improvement in customer 
service, product availability and product 
quality. In addition, our recent disposal of 
the Composite Door business reduces the 
risk of direct exposure to social housing in 
the UK.
Risk Description Mitigation
Competitors
The Group may face signiﬁcant 
competition, both actual and potential, 
including competition from global 
competitors with large capital resources. 
Competition in the industry is based on: 
range and quality of products offered, 
geographical reach, product development, 
reputation and client relationships. 
Aggressive pricing from our competitors 
could cause a reduction in our revenues 
and margins.
Some of our markets are relatively 
concentrated with two or three key players, 
while others are highly fragmented 
and offer signiﬁcant opportunities 
for consolidation and penetration. 
Furthermore the Directors believe that, 
in view of its range of products, focus on 
setting industry leading standards for 
delivery on time and in full, geographical 
spread, strategic focus and reputation, 
the Group can compete effectively with 
its competitors. We aim to minimise 
the impact of aggressive pricing by 
competitors through a low cost 
manufacturing strategy supported by 
our programmes of continuous process 
improvements and building long-term 
relationships with our customers based on 
value, quality, service and added value 
technical support.
Risk Description Mitigation
Loss of major 
customers
The success of the Group will, to some 
extent, be dependent on the continuation 
of satisfactory commercial relationships 
with the major customers of the Group.
The Group aims to build long-term 
relationships with our customers based 
on value, quality and range of products, 
service and value added technical support. 
The Group has a well diversiﬁed customer 
base. The top 10 customers account for 
less than 25% of total Group sales.

Company Overview
Risk Description Mitigation
Raw material costs 
and supply chain 
failures
The raw materials used in the Group’s 
businesses include commodities that 
experience price volatility (such as oil 
derivatives, steel, aluminium and zinc) 
caused by changes in supply and demand, 
and commodity market ﬂuctuations. The 
Group’s ability to deliver according to 
market demands depends in large part on 
obtaining timely and adequate supplies 
of components and raw materials on 
competitive terms. Failure by any of the 
Group’s suppliers could signiﬁcantly limit 
the Group’s sales and increase its costs.
The Group is developing a strategic 
sourcing and procurement capability 
which will enhance our knowledge of 
raw material price risks and our risk 
management approach. The Group aims 
to minimise these risks through strong 
long-term relationships with suppliers, 
economies of purchasing, multiple 
suppliers and inventory management. In 
addition the Group will seek to increase the 
price of its products or apply surcharges to 
its customers to recover unavoidable input 
cost increases.
Risk Description Mitigation
Key executives and 
personnel
The Group’s future success is substantially 
dependent on the continued services and 
performance of its Executive Directors and 
senior management and its ability to 
continue to attract and retain highly skilled 
and qualiﬁed personnel.
The Remuneration Committee maintains a 
remuneration policy that aims to attract, 
motivate and retain key personnel for the 
Group. This incorporates a signiﬁcant 
element of performance related 
remuneration to align executive interests 
with those of shareholders. Key elements 
of this are the Long T erm Incentive Plan 
and the Deferred Share Bonus Plan. 
Remuneration packages are reviewed and 
externally benchmarked on a regular basis. 
The Group also maintains a strong culture 
of accountability, empowerment and 
personal development throughout its 
business units.
Risk Description Mitigation
Financial risks
The Group operates on a global basis and 
is therefore exposed to transactional and 
translational foreign exchange risk against 
Sterling. The Group is also exposed to 
interest rate risks, liquidity and credit risks.
The Group denominates some of its debt 
in foreign currency to match some of its 
exposure to the translational balance sheet 
risks associated with overseas subsidiaries. 
Ancillary bank facilities are available to 
manage some of the foreign exchange 
transactional risks and interest rate 
exposure through the use of derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments. The Group maintains 
adequate cash balances and credit 
facilities based on forecasts of expected 
cash ﬂow. Further information on these 
risks is given in note 23 to the Group’s 
ﬁnancial statements. Business Review

Tyman considers that minimising its impact on the environment, 
and ensuring that it has a positive interaction with its employees 
and the local communities it has a presence in, to be important 
factors in its success.
Health and safety
The Board is committed to providing a clean, healthy and safe 
working environment and accepts collective responsibility for 
health and safety management. The Board considers this to 
make good business sense and regards it as a duty owed to its 
stakeholders. The Chief Executive is the Board member responsible 
for the Group’s health and safety performance and through the 
Tyman Management Committee, the operational management of 
each individual operating unit is responsible for their unit’s health 
and safety performance. Health and safety performance is 
reviewed at each weekly meeting of the Tyman Management 
Committee and a Health and Safety Report is made by the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer to the Board at each of its meetings. 
It is essential that all employees are made aware of the 
importance to the Group of health and safety issues and ensure 
that the working environment is as safe as practical. Local 
management are tasked with creating a health and safety 
management system which:
 identiﬁes and assesses risks;
 takes actions to reduce risks;
 develops safe working practices; and
 emphasises training and development.
As part of this management system, each location is internally 
audited, corrective actions are identiﬁed and a plan is put in place 
to address deﬁciencies raised. The Group requires that the causes 
of all accidents, dangerous incidents and near-miss situations are 
promptly and thoroughly investigated. A range of investigatory 
procedures are used to achieve this with the intended purpose of 
avoiding or reducing the risk of repetition. Details of accidents, 
potentially serious hazards and remedial or preventative measures 
taken are shared between all sites.
Operations representing over 47 per cent of the value of total 
Group sales in 2012 have achieved accreditation for OHSAS 
18001 (Health and Safety) or for OSHA SHARP (the Safety & 
Health Achievement Recognition Program run by the Occupational 
Safety & Health Administration of the United States Department 
of Labor). Most of the other operations in the Group have 
programmes in place with the objective of achieving accreditation.
The key performance indicators ("KPIs”) for the health and safety 
performance of the Group are the number of lost time injuries per 
1,000,000 hours worked, which measures the frequency of lost 
time injuries, and the actual number of lost time injuries. Both 
KPIs show an improvement in the Group’s health and safety 
performance in 2012 over the prior year. The Group remains 
committed to a programme of continuous improvement in our 
health and safety performance.

Company Overview
Ethics
The Group aims to act responsibly and with integrity, respecting 
the laws and regulations of all the countries within which it 
operates as well as internationally accepted standards of 
responsible business conduct. The Group requires high standards 
of professional and ethical conduct from all employees and 
Directors. Every business within the Group is expected to operate 
with policies and procedures which are consistent with the Group’s 
values and standards. In all dealings, all employees and other 
persons acting on behalf of the Group are expected to: 
 engage in honest and ethical conduct, including the avoidance 
and reporting of any conﬂicts of interest;
 maintain effective procedures to prevent conﬁdential 
information being misused or used for personal gain;
 advance the legitimate interests of the Group, having regard to 
the Group’s values and standards;
 comply with all applicable laws and regulations in every country 
in which the Group operates, focusing in particular on avoiding 
bribery, corruption and fraud;
 maintain a healthy and safe working environment for 
employees to work in;
 treat customers fairly, openly and honestly;
 be intolerant of discrimination or harassment of any kind;
 maintain high standards of integrity in business relationships 
with suppliers; and
 encourage the use of those suppliers who operate with values 
and standards equivalent to those of the Group.
Employees
Training and development
Employees are provided with training in order to give them the 
necessary skills to perform their duties and where appropriate to 
develop those skills and progress their career. The Group invests in 
a range of development activities including National Vocational 
Qualiﬁcations (“NVQs”) and apprenticeship schemes and supports 
other professional and technical training.
Customers and suppliers
The Group seeks to be honest and fair in its relationships with 
customers and suppliers, to provide customers with standards of 
product and service that have been agreed and to pay suppliers 
and sub-contractors on agreed terms. It is Group policy to 
maintain accreditation to the quality management standard ISO 
9001 and encourage operating units to gain accreditation to any 
speciﬁc standards required by the markets served. Currently 
operating units with 91 per cent of the Group’s turnover have ISO 
9001 accreditation.
Community
The Board encourages and supports initiatives by operating units 
to engage with their local community. Operating units and their 
staff participate in a variety of local activities including projects 
with local schools and charity events. The Group policy on 
donations is to support local educational and charitable causes, 
and in particular those where employees and their families are 
involved in the fundraising.
Environment
The Board recognises its responsibilities as a manufacturing 
concern to continue to reduce the environmental impact of its 
factories. In addition, the Group aims to develop and supply 
products to help customers meet their own environmental 
objectives and the demands of their customers and 
of government.
The most signiﬁcant areas of environmental impact associated 
with the Group’s operations are energy consumption, waste to 
landﬁll, the use of outer packaging and transport.
 Process development: the Group seeks through internal 
developments and investment to reduce the resource 
consumption of manufacturing sites. The reuse of waste is 
encouraged across the Group.
 Energy consumption: the Group continues to invest in energy 
efﬁciency measures such as lighting and improved heating and 
cooling systems.
 Waste to landﬁll: the Group acts to minimise the amount of 
waste sent to landﬁll by selling for recycling any waste that 
cannot be used internally.
 Outer packaging and transport: the Group minimises the use of 
outer packaging where appropriate and encourages the use of 
returnable outer packaging formats. The Group reduces the 
environmental impact of transport through vehicle efﬁciency 
measures such as improved load ﬁll, reductions in empty 
running and route optimisation.
In developing new products, the Group aims to minimise the 
environmental impact and maximise energy efﬁciency and the 
potential for recycling, while continuing to meet the performance 
and customer requirements. The increasing dangers from climate 
change and rising fuel costs are making the speciﬁcation of 
thermally efﬁcient products imperative. The Group monitors 
developments in alternative materials and production processes 
which may reduce the environmental impact of its products.
The Group is committed to the introduction of environmental 
management systems such as ISO 14001. Currently thirteen of 
the Group’s manufacturing sites have achieved accreditation to 
the environmental management systems standard ISO 14001. Business Review

Corporate Governance
Tyman plc
Review of the business 
The review of the business along with the key performance indicators used to monitor performance are set out on pages 6 to 25, which 
are incorporated into this report by reference.
Principal activities 
On 1 February 2013, the Company, Lupus Capital plc, changed its name to Tyman plc. The Company is a holding company. The Group 
is a leading international supplier of building products to the door and window industry. 
Future developments 
The statements by the Chairman, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer set out on pages 6 to 17 contain details of 
the progress of the Group during the year together with an indication of future developments. 
Results and dividends 
The total Group proﬁt for the year after taxation amounted to £15,422,000 (2011: £15,483,000). 
The 2011 ﬁnal dividend of 3.5 pence per ordinary share, which amounted to £4,535,000 (2011: £2,596,000), and the 2012 interim 
dividend of 1.0 pence per ordinary share, which amounted to £1,297,000 (2011: £Nil), were paid in the ﬁnancial year ended 31 
December 2012. The Board is recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 3.5 pence per ordinary share (2011: 3.5 pence) to be paid on 25 
June 2013, subject to approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company on 24 June 2013, to shareholders on the 
register on 3 May 2013. The ex-dividend date will be 1 May 2013. This brings the total dividends for 2012 to 4.5 pence per ordinary 
share (2011: 3.5 pence).
The Board 
The names and biographical details of all the current Directors are set out on page 22. Dr Westerwelle was appointed as a Non-
executive Director to the Company with effect from 30 November 2012. There were no other changes to the Board and all the other 
Directors served throughout the period.
Except for their shareholdings, the Non-executive Directors are entirely independent. There were no contracts subsisting during or at 
the end of the year in which a Director was or is materially interested. The Company maintains a policy of insurance against Directors’ 
and ofﬁcers’ liabilities. 
A description of the Board’s method of operation, its work during the year and that of its Committees, is given in the report on 
Corporate Governance on pages 29 to 32. 
Re-election of Directors 
Dr Westerwelle, having been appointed by the Board since the last Annual General Meeting, will seek re-election at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. In accordance with best practice, the Board has agreed that each Director will voluntarily offer themselves for 
re-election at each Annual General Meeting that they are not required to retire from ofﬁce. Accordingly, Mr Pike, Mr Eperjesi, Mr 
Brotherton, Mr Tench and Mr Towers will voluntarily offer themselves for re-election at the 2013 Annual General Meeting. 
Acquisition
On 24 April 2012, the Group acquired the business and assets of Unique Balance International ("Unique"), located in Montreal, Canada 
for a cash consideration of £1.9 million. Unique is a balance manufacturer, specialising in heavy duty and commercial balances. This 
small acquisition rounds out our North American balance offering as well as giving us opportunities in certain export markets. The 
revenue included in the Group’s consolidated income statements since 23 April 2012 contributed by Unique was £997,000.
On 2 August 2012, the Group completed the acquisition of Window Fabrication and Fixing Supplies Limited (“Fab & Fix”) for a cash 
consideration of £16 million. Fab & Fix, based in Coventry, is the leading supplier of perfectly matching hardware to the window and 
door market in the UK. Despite difﬁcult market conditions in recent years, Fab & Fix has grown market share and improved proﬁtability. 
For the year ended 31 December 2012 Fab & Fix generated sales of £16.1 million, £6.6 million of which has been consolidated into the 
Group’s income statement for 2012.
Disposal
On 13 March 2012, Tyman plc entered into an unconditional agreement to sell the Group’s Oil Services division, Gall Thomson, to 
Copper Bidco Limited, a company controlled by Phoenix Equity Partners for a total cash consideration of £75 million. 
On 31 August 2013 the Group completed the disposal of the business and assets of Composite Doors to Britdoors Group Limited for 
consideration of approximately £748,000. The Group has also agreed to supply component products, including Fab & Fix products, into 
Britdoors on commercial terms following the disposal.

Onerous lease
On 2 March 2012, the Group concluded an agreement with a third party to assign the lease on Unit A at Peterlee and have been 
released from all remaining obligations in connection with the Peterlee site. This has resulted in a release to the income statement in 
2012 of approximately £2.0 million of property provisions.
Purchase of the Company’s own shares 
It is expected that the requirements of the Tyman Long Term Incentive Plan may be met by the purchase of shares in the market. A 
resolution concerning the purchase of the Company’s own shares was approved at the AGM on 25 May 2012 and 728,000 shares were 
purchased by the Company during the year ended 31 December 2012 at a cost of £1,147,000.
To be able to meet the future requirements of the Tyman Long Term Incentive Plan, the Directors believe that the Company should 
obtain an authority to purchase further shares of the Company. They therefore will propose a special resolution, in accordance with 
best practise, at the forthcoming AGM to obtain authority to make market purchases up to the date of the AGM in 2014. The authority 
will be limited to 14.99 per cent of voting shares in issue (that is, excluding shares held in Treasury).  
Directors’ remuneration 
The Company, being traded on AIM, is not required to comply with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 or the 
disclosure provisions of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 2006 and the UKLA Listing Rules. Nevertheless, the Company has chosen to 
present a report on Directors’ remuneration on pages 34 to 38. The Directors have also determined, on a voluntary basis, that this 
report should be submitted to shareholders for their approval at the 2013 AGM.
Allotment of shares 
Shareholders passed resolutions to authorise the Directors to allot shares and, within certain limitations, to do so free from pre-emption 
rights at the Annual General Meeting held on 25 May 2012. 
The Directors’ authority to allot shares does not expire until 1 July 2017, whereas the disapplication of pre-emption rights is only 
effective until the conclusion of the Company’s 2013 AGM. The Directors believe that the Company’s proceedings will be more 
transparent if they seek renewed authority to allot at the same time as they seek authority to disapply pre-emption rights. 
Therefore, at the forthcoming AGM the Directors will propose a resolution which will authorise the Directors to allot shares (subject to 
speciﬁed limits) until 1 July 2018, and a special resolution which will authorise the Directors to disapply pre-emption rights (in certain 
circumstances and subject to speciﬁed limits) until the conclusion of the Company’s 2014 AGM. 
Substantial shareholders 
In addition to the holdings of the Directors described in the Directors’ remuneration report, at the latest practicable date before 
publication of this report the Company had been notiﬁed of, or had identiﬁed, the following direct or indirect interests comprising 3% 
or more of its voting share capital (the issued share capital less shares held by the Company in Treasury):

Employees 
The Group’s excellent performance would not be possible without employees of the highest calibre with the motivation to perform to 
their full potential. The Group operates on a decentralised structure, reﬂecting the organisation of the Group. This underscores our 
belief that localised teams, operating under common principles, are best equipped to deal with the varying cultures, operating 
structures and geographic locations that exist in the Group. 
Each operating entity in the Group is encouraged to implement comprehensive employment policies designed to attract, retain and 
motivate the highest quality of staff and to determine ways in which their knowledge and skills can best contribute towards the success 
of the business. 
We are committed to ensuring that all our employees are treated equally, regardless of gender, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, race, 
disability, marital status, sexual orientation or religion. We are committed to regular communication and consultation with our 
employees and we encourage employee involvement in our performance. Each company in the Group endeavours to provide equality 
of opportunity in recruiting, training, promoting and developing the careers of disabled people. 
Going concern 
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budget and cash ﬂow forecasts. On the basis of this review, and in the light of the current 
ﬁnancial position and the existing borrowing facilities, the Board believes it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts, as stated in the Directors’ responsibilities statement on page 32.

Corporate governance
The Company, being traded on AIM, is not required to comply with the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code. Nevertheless, the 
Directors acknowledge the importance of the principles set out in the Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council, and have put in place a framework for corporate governance which they believe is appropriate for the Company. They have 
chosen to make the following voluntary disclosures: 
The Board 
Board composition 
The Board comprises two Executive and four Non-executive Directors and the names and biographical details of all the current 
Directors are set out on page 22. Dr Westerwelle was appointed as a Non-executive Director to the Company with effect from 30 
November 2012. All the other current Directors served throughout the year ended 31 December 2012 and there were no other changes 
to the Board.
Both Mr Eperjesi and Mr Brotherton are engaged exclusively on the Company’s business and have no outside interests that conﬂict with 
their responsibilities to the Company. Except for their shareholdings, all Non-executive Directors are independent. 
How the Board operates 
The Board meets regularly and is responsible for the overall leadership, strategy, development and control of the Group in order to 
achieve its objectives for continued earnings growth and to enhance shareholder value. The Board sets the Group’s strategic aims, 
ensures that the necessary ﬁnancial and human resources are in place for the Group to meet its objectives, reviews management 
performance and ensures that high ethical standards of behaviour are followed. The Board also ensures that there is an effective 
system of controls to safeguard the Company’s assets and to enable risks to be properly assessed and managed. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters speciﬁcally reserved for it and this includes key matters such as approval of the Group’s 
objectives, strategic plans, annual budgets, ﬁnancial reporting, risk assessment and internal controls, monitoring operating and 
ﬁnancial performance, capital and legal structure, material capital investments, material contracts and transactions, communication 
with shareholders, Board membership and appointments, Directors’ remuneration and contracts, corporate governance, Group policies, 
and delegation of responsibilities. Matters not speciﬁcally reserved for the Board are delegated to management. 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely information. The Company Secretary distributes 
brieﬁng papers to all Directors in advance of Board meetings. All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied 
with. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole. In addition, procedures are in place 
to enable the Directors to obtain independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s 
expense. 
Board meetings 
During the year ended 31 December 2012, the number of Board and Committee meetings held and attended by their members was

UK and Schlegel in Gistel, Belgium.
Re-election of Directors 
All Directors are subject to re-election by the shareholders at Annual General Meetings at a maximum interval of three years. The 
Articles of Association provide that Directors appointed by the Board will be subject to re-election at the ﬁrst AGM thereafter. In 
accordance with best practice, the Board has agreed that each Director will voluntarily offer themselves for re-election at each Annual 
General Meeting that they are not required to retire from ofﬁce.

Board balance and performance 
The Board believes that the Directors possess a wide range of business experience in some areas related to and in other areas 
complementary to the activities of the Group. This position has been strengthened with the appointment of Dr Westerwelle during 
the year. 
The Board is committed to introducing a Board performance appraisal process during 2013. Non-executive and Executive Directors will 
be required to complete questionnaires on an annual basis in relation to the Board and its three committees, the Audit Committee, the 
Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee. All responses will be reviewed and collated by the Company Secretary 
before further action relating to speciﬁc training needs is taken as necessary.
The Chairman will hold meetings with the Directors, including the senior independent Non-executive Director, Martin Towers, to discuss 
the performance of individual Executive Directors and the Board as a whole. The Non-executive Directors, led by the senior Non-
executive Director, will be responsible for the performance evaluation of the Chairman and will also take account of the views of the 
Executive Directors as part of this process.
Board Committees 
The Board has an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nominations Committee, each comprised of all the Non-
executive Directors. The existence of the Committees ensures that time is allocated on a formal basis to consider relevant issues. Terms 
of reference for the Board and each of the Board Committees were reviewed and refreshed during the year and are available for 
inspection on the Group website.
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee is made up of the Non-executive Directors and meets at least three times a year. The Executive Directors also 
attend certain meetings of the Committee. The Committee considers the appointment and fees of the external auditors and discusses 
the scope of the audit and its ﬁndings. Following the conclusion of an audit tender process in December 2011, new auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, were appointed as the Group’s external auditors. The Committee is also responsible for monitoring 
compliance with accounting and legal requirements and for reviewing the annual and interim ﬁnancial statements. This Committee 
was chaired by Mr Towers and met three times during 2012. 
The Audit Committee also reviews any non-audit services provided by the auditors. In accordance with best practices FRC guidelines 
the Company policy in relation to non-audit services is kept under regular review, it outlines which non-audit services are pre-
approved, which services require prior approval of the Audit Committee and which services the auditor is excluded from. Such services 
have been, and are, limited to the provision of transaction support services, some tax compliance work and tax advice. The Committee 
is satisﬁed that the provision of such services does not in any way prejudice the objectivity and independence of the auditors. 
Professional ﬁrms other than the auditors also provide tax compliance work and tax advice. 
The work of the Committee during the year included consideration of the following matters:
 The annual ﬁnancial statements and the preliminary results announcement for the year ended 31 December 2011 before their 
submission to the Board for approval, including consideration of the Group on a going concern basis.
 The interim ﬁnancial statements and interim results announcement for the six months ended 30 June 2012.
 Areas of signiﬁcance in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, including exceptional items, impairment reviews, and tax 
provisions.
 Reports from the external auditors on the annual and interim ﬁnancial statements, the approval of the audit plan and fee proposal 
for the 2012 year end audit.
 Developments in accounting standards and the Group’s responses.
 The internal control environment and risk management systems and the Group’s statement on internal control systems, prior to 
endorsement by the Board.
 Revisions to treasury policies and compliance with risk limits.
 Material legal developments.
 Whistleblowing systems in place within the Group and material whistleblowing reports.
 The effectiveness of the external auditors.
 The policy on auditor independence and non-audit services, and consideration of the nature, scope and appropriateness of 
non-audit services supplied by the external auditors.

Company Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Internal audit
As the Group plans for growth the Board considers it appropriate to augment internal resources with external auditing resources to 
establish an internal audit programme in 2013. A specialist internal audit team from BDO will provide internal audit services to the 
Group to complete a rotation programme, such that every operating unit will have an internal audit visit at least once every three years, 
with the largest operating units being audited at least once every two years. The internal audit programme will be reviewed and 
approved by the Audit Committee, who in turn will review the internal audit ﬁndings together with divisional management responses 
and action plans.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee considers and approves the remuneration and beneﬁts of the Directors. The Committee also determines 
the remuneration of the members of the Tyman Management Committee and the Company Secretary and of the service providers 
contracted to perform executive functions for the Group as well as long-term share incentive and share option schemes for 
all employees. 
The membership and work of the Committee during the year ended 31 December 2012 is described in detail in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 34 to 38. 
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee identiﬁes and nominates candidates for the ofﬁce of Director of the Company. It meets as and when 
required and is chaired by Mr Pike, except that Mr Pike would not chair the Committee or attend it if it were to consider the 
appointment of a successor Chairman. The Committee was chaired by Mr Pike and met once during 2012 to appoint Dr. Westerwelle 
as a Non-executive Director and to establish an induction programme following her appointment.
Internal control 
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and for reviewing the effectiveness 
of those controls. The Board, including the Executive Directors, reviews the internal control framework on an ongoing basis. 
Procedures have been developed to safeguard assets against unauthorised use or disposition of assets and to maintain proper 
accounting records to provide reliable ﬁnancial information both for internal use and for publication. In accordance with the revised 
version of the Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control, the procedures are regularly reviewed in the light of an ongoing process to 
identify, evaluate and manage the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Company. The process has been in place for the full year under review 
and up to the date of the approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. The procedures are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
risk and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Internal ﬁnancial controls
The Group has an established system for assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal ﬁnancial controls. This includes 
strategic business planning and monthly monitoring and reporting of ﬁnancial performance. A detailed annual budget, prepared by 
senior management, is reviewed and formally adopted by the Board. The budget and other targets are regularly updated and regular 
business review meetings are held monthly involving the Tyman Management Committee to assess performance. The results of these 
reviews are in turn reported to and discussed by the Board at each meeting.
Relations with shareholders 
Communications with shareholders are given high priority and there is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders. The Company 
aims to maintain a mutual understanding of objectives with its signiﬁcant shareholders with whom its Executive Directors have regular 
meetings with, following the announcement of its annual and interim results.
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. 
Details of resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting can be found in the Directors’ report. The Company has set up a 
website www.tymanplc.com which shareholders, investors and other interested parties may access. The website permits users to 
download copies of published ﬁnancial reports, press releases and Stock Exchange announcements.  32

Going concern
In order to satisfy themselves that the Group has adequate resources for the future, the Board reviewed the Group’s committed 
funding and liquidity positions, its ability to generate cash from trading activities and its ability to raise external funding in the future. 
The operational performance, as described in the Financial review on pages 14 to 17, the future plans for the Group and the risks facing 
the Group, described on pages 18 and 19, were also reviewed. In addition, notes 17, 18 and 23 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
include the Group’s policies and processes for managing capital, liquidity and credit risks as well as details of its ﬁnancial instruments 
and hedging strategies.
In performing their reviews, the Board acknowledged the current level of uncertainty in the ﬁnancial markets and has considered 
various sensitivity analyses when assessing the forecast funding and headroom requirements of the Group.
Consequently, based on the reviews outlined above, the Board concluded that both the Group as a whole and Tyman plc have 
adequate resources to meet their operational needs for the foreseeable future, and that it remains appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European 
Union and have elected to prepare the parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable laws). Under company law the Directors must not approve 
the ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and proﬁt or loss of the 
Company and Group for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements respectively; and
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors who held ofﬁce at the date of approval of this Directors’ report conﬁrm that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware and each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have 
taken as Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware 
of that information. 33 Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Remuneration report letter
Dear Shareholder
I would like to share with you a summary of the Company’s remuneration policy and practice over the last year.
Salaries
Below inﬂation salary increases of 2.0 per cent were awarded to the Executive Directors at the start of the 2012 and 2013 ﬁnancial 
years, consistent with the approach taken across the Group. 
Annual Bonus Scheme and Deferred Share Bonus Plan
In difﬁcult markets the Company performed creditably during the year, particularly when compared to its closest competitors. The 
bonuses awarded to the Executive Directors for 2012 averaged 68 per cent of the maximum bonus opportunity of 100 per cent of 
basic salary, reﬂecting the highly stretching performance targets that were set by the Committee at the start of the ﬁnancial year. 
Under the terms of the Group’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan, 50 per cent of bonus outcomes achieved by the Executive Directors will be 
deferred into share awards vesting after three years.
Long Term Incentive Plan
During 2012 a third tranche of awards, under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), were made to Executive Directors and 
Senior Managers. Vesting of 2012 Awards is based on the Company’s three year cumulative underlying earnings per share (“EPS”) for 
the ﬁnancial years 2012 to 2014.
In addition, for 2012 Awards made to the Executive Directors to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that the recorded underlying 
EPS is a genuine reﬂection of the underlying business performance of the Company over the performance period, having regard to 
the Company’s total shareholder return performance during that time. If the Committee is not satisﬁed on this matter it may reduce 
the number of 2012 Award shares that vest to the Executive Directors accordingly.
In accordance with the LTIP rules, and after extensive consultation with institutional and other shareholders, following the disposal of 
Gall Thomson in March 2012 the Committee has amended the existing EPS targets attached to the vesting of the 2010 and 2011 
LTIP Awards to broadly maintain the level of difﬁculty. All other terms and conditions attached to the 2010 and 2011 Awards remain 
as they were on the respective dates of grant of the awards.
The Committee has continued its practice of reviewing and discussing with the Group’s principal shareholders the proposed metrics 
and associated targets in advance of grants made under the LTIP. 
Shareholding guidelines
The Executive Directors continue to maintain a high level of personal share ownership in accordance with the Company’s 
shareholding guidelines and have agreed to retain at least half of all shares vesting (net of taxes) under the Company’s various share 
plans until such time as the target personal share ownership is achieved.
Conclusion
The outlook for 2013 remains challenging in terms of the Group’s end markets, but our remuneration policy and framework provide a 
balanced platform to incentivise, motivate, retain and reward our leadership team.

remuneration of each Director. The report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) 
and the AIM Rules for Companies as issued by the London Stock Exchange. 
A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 24 June 2013. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises all Non-executive Directors of the Company. The Executive Directors may, by 
invitation, attend meetings and provide advice to the Committee, except when their own remuneration is discussed. During 2012 the 
Committee was chaired by Mr Tench and met twice. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for:
 setting, reviewing and recommending to the Board for approval the Company’s overall remuneration policy and strategy;
 determining and reviewing the terms of appointment and the remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors of the 
Company and the Chairman;
 determining and reviewing the terms of appointment and the remuneration arrangements of the members of the Tyman 
Management Committee of the Company; and
 approving the rules, and launch, of any Company share, share option or cash-based incentive plan, and the grant, award, allocation 
or issue of shares, share options or payments under any such plan. 
During the year Kepler Associates were engaged by the Committee to provide it with independent remuneration advice. Kepler 
Associates did not provide any other services to the Company other than remuneration advice. 
Remuneration policy 
Executive Directors 
The Remuneration Committee considers the need to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior management in 
determining appropriate remuneration policies and packages. It also takes into account the internal pay and beneﬁts practice and 
employment conditions both within the Group as a whole and within the particular national context. External comparisons examine 
equivalent roles in similar companies taking into account their size, business complexity, international scope and relative performance. 
Consideration is also given to the risks arising from market comparisons and inappropriate performance criteria. 
Remuneration 
The current remuneration package for the Executive Directors comprises ﬁxed and variable components. The variable components are 
the performance related incentive arrangements referred to in detail below.
Executive Directors’ remuneration 2012
The key components of the remuneration of Executive Directors are set out below: 
Directors’ remuneration report
Target assumes that bonus of 50 per cent of base salary is earned and that 25 per cent of the Tyman shares awarded under the LTIP in 
respect of 2012, based on a market value of £1.54 at 31 December 2012, vest. Stretch assumes that bonus of 100 per cent of base 
salary is earned and that 100 per cent of the Tyman shares awarded under the LTIP in respect of 2012, based on a market value of 
£1.54, vest.  35 Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Company Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Salary 
Salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee, although not necessarily increased. This review takes into account an 
individual’s responsibilities, abilities, experience, performance, market competitiveness and pay and conditions in the relevant countries 
across the Group as described above. 
During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed Executive Director salaries and determined that, with effect from 1 January 
2013, Louis Eperjesi and James Brotherton’s annual salaries (comprising base salary plus an allowance in lieu of pension and beneﬁts) 
would be increased by two per cent to £320,000 and £213,300 respectively. 
Performance related remuneration 
Annual bonus 
The annual bonus framework for Executive Directors for 2012 is as follows: 
 Target and maximum annual bonus opportunities of 50 per cent and 100 per cent (respectively) of base salary, 70 per cent based 
on the underlying Group proﬁt before tax and 30 per cent based on free cash ﬂow. 
 50 per cent of bonus amounts will be deferred into share awards under the terms of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, vesting after 
three years. 
Based on the performance for 2012 against the underlying Group proﬁt before tax and the free cash ﬂow targets set, the Committee 
determined that the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer have each achieved a bonus level of 68 per cent of their 
respective base salaries, 50 per cent of which will be paid in cash in April 2013 and 50 per cent will be awarded in the form of nil-cost 
options deferred for three years under the terms of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan. 
Under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, 50 per cent of Executive Director bonuses that would otherwise have been payable are delivered 
in the form of nil-cost options, to strengthen alignment with shareholders’ interests. These awards will normally vest (together with 
dividend equivalents in cash or shares) after three years. Other key employees are also required to defer a proportion of their bonuses 
pursuant to the Deferred Share Bonus Plan. 
The Tyman Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) 
The LTIP provides for the grant of: (i) performance shares (or nil-cost options); and/or (ii) fair-market value options, vesting on the 
satisfaction of stretching performance criteria over three years (subject to individual and overall limits). The Remuneration Committee 
currently intends that long-term incentive awards will be in the form of nil-cost options; however, the Remuneration Committee retains 
the ﬂexibility to consider other forms of award (such as fair-market value options) for future cycles as it is mindful that alternative forms 
of award remain prevalent in some of the geographies (eg the US) in which the Company competes for senior executive management. 
On 3 July 2012 the Remuneration Committee granted nil or nominal cost options over 1,177,263 ordinary shares in the Company to 
around 32 senior managers, executives and Executive Directors (“2012 Awards”). In addition, the Remuneration Committee intends to 
make further awards under the LTIP in the period following the announcement of the Company’s full-year results (“2013 Awards”). 
Performance criteria 
The vesting of LTIP awards are subject to stretching performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee at the start of each 
performance period. Awards will vest, together with dividends foregone, based on three-year cumulative underlying earnings per share (“EPS”). 
The Remuneration Committee adopts a robust process to setting what it feels are stretching, but achievable, annual and long-term incentive 
performance targets. Performance targets are calibrated to be equivalent to at least “upper quartile” performance for awards to vest in full 
and take account of a number of reference points which reﬂect internal and external expectations, including: the latest internal forecasts, 
broker forecasts for sector comparators, EPS performance zones used in comparator long-term incentives, straight-line proﬁt growth consistent 
with median and upper quartile returns over the next three to ﬁve years and broker forecast data for the Company. 
Underlying EPS is the performance measure that determines vesting of LTIP awards as underlying EPS is well-aligned with shareholder 
interests, provides good line-of-sight and is well understood. In addition, for 2012 Awards granted to the Executive Directors to vest, the 
Committee must satisfy itself that the recorded underlying EPS is a genuine reﬂection of the underlying performance of the Company 
over the performance period, having regard to the Company’s total shareholder return performance during that time. If the Committee 
is not satisﬁed on this matter it may reduce the number of 2012 Award shares that vest to the Executive Directors. The Remuneration 
Committee is committed to reviewing the performance measures that determines vesting of LTIP awards in advance of each LTIP 
cycle. 
There is an overarching principle that for awards to vest on underlying EPS, the Remuneration Committee must satisfy itself that the 
recorded underlying EPS is a genuine reﬂection of the underlying business performance of the Company over the performance period. 
Following the disposal of Gall Thomson in March 2012, and after consultation with institutional shareholders holding c. 60% of the 
Company’s issued share capital, the Committee amended the existing EPS targets attached to the vesting of outstanding LTIP cycles 
to broadly maintain the level of difﬁculty, in a manner which supports the ongoing strategy. The methodology employed by the 
Committee involved re-stating the cumulative EPS targets for the continuing operations (based on the continuing operations 
percentage contribution to 2011 EPS, to capture the performance of the continuing business), and then adjusting the resulting targets 
for an acceptable rate of return on the sale proceeds. The resulting adjusted targets are summarised below. 36
Corporate Governance
Tyman plc
Performance criteria: 2010 Awards 
The  performance criteria adjusted for the sale of Gall Thomson for vesting of 2010 Awards is a three-year cumulative underlying EPS 
2011–13 performance range of 25.7p to 32.4p. In summary, if over the three ﬁnancial years 2011 to 2013, cumulative underlying EPS is 
less than 25.7p, no 2010 Awards will vest; 25 per cent of 2010 Awards will vest for cumulative underlying EPS of 25.7p, rising on a 
straight-line basis to full vesting for cumulative underlying EPS of 32.4p or higher. 
Performance criteria: 2011 Awards 
The performance criteria adjusted for the sale of Gall Thomson for vesting of 2011 Awards is a three-year cumulative underlying EPS 
2011–13 performance range of 27.5p to 34.2p. In summary, if over the three ﬁnancial years 2011 to 2013, cumulative underlying EPS is 
less than 27.5p, no 2011 Awards will vest; 25 per cent of 2011 Awards will vest for cumulative underlying EPS of 27.5p, rising on a 
straight-line basis to full vesting for cumulative underlying EPS of 34.2p or higher. 
Performance criteria: 2012 Awards 
The performance criteria for vesting of 2012 Awards is a three-year cumulative underlying EPS 2012–14 performance range of 33p to 
45.6p. In summary, if over the three ﬁnancial years 2012 to 2014, cumulative underlying EPS is less than 33p, no 2012 Awards will vest; 
25 per cent of 2012 Awards will vest for cumulative underlying EPS of 33p, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for cumulative 
underlying EPS of 45.6p or higher. 
Dilution limit 
Generally, it is the intention that LTIP awards will be satisﬁed through the transfer of existing shares by the Company’s employees’ 
beneﬁt trust unless the Remuneration Committee, in its discretion, feels that a new issue of shares would be more appropriate. In the 
event that LTIP awards are satisﬁed through new issue shares, the Company will operate within the Association of British Insurers’ 
(“ABI”) guideline dilution limit of 10 per cent in 10 years for all share based incentive schemes (excluding awards to the former 
Executive Chairman granted in 2004 and 2008). Expected dilution should not exceed the 10 per cent dilution limit, even if the awards 
made to the former Executive Chairman are taken into account. 
The Remuneration Committee has the ﬂexibility to operate outside the ABI guideline of 5 per cent in 10 years dilution limit for 
discretionary share based incentive schemes to accommodate LTIP awards for a broader employee population. In managing dilution, 
the Company will nevertheless be mindful of the 5 per cent in 10 years guideline and will be prudent in managing the ﬂow rates, 
keeping shareholders informed of actual and anticipated dilution levels over time. The majority of the 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTIP 
awards are likely to be satisﬁed through the transfer of existing shares rather than the issue of new shares. 
Assuming that all performance targets are met in full, the Remuneration Committee currently envisages that a maximum of 857,500 
of the 2,994,263 shares subject to all the Awards outstanding (approximately 29%) will be satisﬁed through new issue shares to ensure 
that local trusts, tax and securities laws are complied with in certain overseas jurisdiction. 
Shareholding guidelines 
The Remuneration Committee has also adopted shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors. Executive Directors will be expected to 
retain at least half of the shares vesting (net of taxes) under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan or the LTIP until such time as a total 
personal shareholding equivalent to 100 per cent of base salary has been achieved. The table below sets out the individual 
requirement and level of shareholding achieved for each Executive Director at 31 December 2012:

Notes to Directors’ minimum shareholding table above:
1 Base salary as at 31 December 2012.
2 Based on the closing price of a Tyman plc ordinary share of £1.54 on 31 December 2012.
Awards to Executive Directors 
The number of shares awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP for the 2012 Awards are as follows:
  2012 Awards
James Brotherton 153, 1 93
Louis Eperjesi 201,570
The 2012 Awards are granted by reference to a percentage of base salary and LTIP awards of performance shares or nil-cost options 
will be restricted to a maximum of 100 per cent of base salary. 
Senior executives below the Executive Directors 
The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Executive Directors who are members of the 
Tyman Management Committee is consistent with that for the Executive Directors. These senior executives all have a signiﬁcant 
portion of their reward package linked to performance. They all qualify for an annual bonus, and are eligible for awards under the LTIP, 
and their ﬁnancial targets are the same as, or cascaded from, the targets for the Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee 
Directors’ remuneration report continued 37 Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Company Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements
reviews and approves the individual remuneration packages for the Tyman Management Committee members and the Company 
Secretary in accordance with the overriding objectives of the Group’s remuneration policy. Their individual performance is reviewed and 
their increases in base salary, annual bonus payments and any LTIP awards are subject to approval by the Remuneration Committee 
each year. Other senior employees below Tyman Management Committee level are generally treated consistently with the Executive 
Directors and members of the Tyman Management Committee, with the exception that they may participate in local discretionary 
annual cash bonus plans.

Non-executive Directors’ fees and Chairman fees
Non-executive Directors

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Business Review Company Overview
Independent auditors’ report to the members of T yman plc 
(formerly Lupus Capital plc)
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Tyman plc (formerly Lupus Capital plc) for the year ended 31 December 2012 which 
comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash ﬂow statement and the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 32, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of 
the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion the Group ﬁnancial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year then 
ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the Group ﬁnancial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion: 
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements of Tyman plc for the year ended 31 December 2012.

Financial Statements
Tyman plc
1. General information and basis of preparation
The Group’s principal activities are the manufacture, supply and distribution of building products. Tyman plc (formerly Lupus Capital 
plc) is the Group’s ultimate parent company and it is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales at the address shown on 
page 88.
The Group’s shares are admitted to trading on AIM, a market of the London Stock Exchange.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Tyman plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRSs” as adopted by the “EU”), the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS, and IFRIC interpretations.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation to fair value of certain ﬁnancial 
assets and liabilities (including derivatives) through proﬁt and loss, as described in the accounting policies below.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates.
The Directors have, at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
1.2 New and amended standards adopted by the Group
There were no standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group since 1 January 2012 which had a material impact 
on the Group’s consolidated results or ﬁnancial position.
1.3 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the 
Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements. None of these is expected to have a signiﬁcant effect on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group:
 Amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of ﬁnancial statements” regarding other comprehensive income (effective 1 July 2012). The 
main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented in “other comprehensive 
income” (OCI) on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassiﬁable to proﬁt or loss subsequently (reclassiﬁcation adjustments). 
The amendments do not address which items are presented in OCI.
 IAS 19 “Employee beneﬁts” (effective 1 January 2013). The impact on the Group will be to replace interest cost and expected return 
on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability. The 
Group has yet to assess the full impact of the amendments.
 IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement” (effective 1 January 2013). IFRS 13 aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by 
providing a precise deﬁnition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across 
IFRSs. The requirements do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its 
use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on 
the Group.
2. Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies and basis of consolidation
2.1 Basis of consolidation
The ﬁnancial statements consolidate the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (note 31) drawn up to 31 December each year. The 
ﬁnancial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared to the same reporting date as the parent, using consistent accounting policies.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies generally accompanying 
a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. The Group also assesses existence 
of control where it does not have more than 50% of the voting power but is able to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies by virtue 
of de-facto control. De-facto control may arise in circumstances where the size of the Group’s voting rights relative to the size and 
dispersion of holdings of other shareholders give the Group the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies, etc.
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements 45 Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Business Review Company Overview
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control over ﬁnancial and operating policies is transferred to the Group and 
continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of a business combination is measured as the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, including contingent liabilities, 
and equity instruments issued by the Group which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The identiﬁable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at 
fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of 
the identiﬁable assets, including those of an intangible and tangible nature, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised as 
goodwill.
Inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Proﬁts and 
losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated, but are considered an impairment 
indicator of the underlying asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
2.2 Principal accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the ﬁnancial statements.
2.2.1 Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in 
the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Cash Generating Units 
(“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the 
goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair 
value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
2.2.2 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. On acquisition of Group companies, the Group 
recognises any separately identiﬁable intangible assets separately from goodwill, initially measuring the intangible assets at fair value.
Purchased intangible assets acquired through a business combination, including purchased brands, customer relationships, trademarks 
and licences, are initially measured at fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as 
follows:
 Acquired brands – 5 to 20 years.
 Customer relationships – 9 to 15 years.
 Computer software – 3 to 4 years.
The estimated useful lives of acquired intangible assets are reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a 
change in the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic beneﬁts embodied in the asset. Any amendments to the 
estimated useful lives of intangible assets are recorded as a change in estimate in the period the change occurred.
2.2.3 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying value or recognised as a 
separate asset as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the speciﬁc asset will ﬂow to the 
Group and the cost can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the ﬁnancial 
period in which they are incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on all other property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the 
cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, at the following annual rates:
 Freehold land – Not depreciated.
 Freehold buildings – 2% to 5%.
 Plant and machinery – 7.5% to 33%. 46

Tyman plc
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
2. Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies and basis of consolidation continued
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are 
reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each ﬁnancial year end.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income 
statement.
2.2.4 Impairment of assets
Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to cash-generating units (equivalent to the reported operating segments). The 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or more 
frequently when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. Goodwill that has been impaired previously 
cannot be reversed at a later date.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are reviewed for impairment when events 
or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss.
Where purchased intangible assets are considered by the Board of Directors to have an indeﬁnite life, they are not amortised but are 
subject to an impairment review on an annual basis or more frequently if necessary. Intangible assets not yet available for use are 
tested for impairment annually.
An impairment review is performed by comparing the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment, intangible asset or cash 
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated with its recoverable amount, being the higher of the fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. The fair value less costs to sell is the amount that could be obtained on disposal of the asset. The value in use is 
determined by discounting, using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks speciﬁc to the asset, the expected future cash ﬂows resulting from its continued use, including those on ﬁnal disposal. Impairment 
losses are recognised in the income statement immediately. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. Considerable 
management judgement is necessary to estimate discounted future cash ﬂows. Accordingly, actual cash ﬂows could vary considerably 
from forecast cash ﬂows. Impairment reversals are permitted to property, plant and equipment or intangible assets (but not goodwill) 
to the extent that the new carrying value does not exceed the amount it would have been if no impairment loss had been previously 
recognised.
2.2.5 Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes cost of materials determined on a purchase cost basis, 
direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity on a ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out basis. 
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Where necessary, a provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard to the nature and condition of 
inventory, as well as its anticipated saleability.
2.2.6 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
 the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event;
 it is probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
 a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
ﬂows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash ﬂows using a pre-tax rate that 
reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the obligation. The increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised in the income statement within net ﬁnance costs.
Property related provisions comprise onerous leases and dilapidation costs. Provisions for onerous leases are recognised where the 
unavoidable cost exceeds the expected beneﬁt.
Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments. A restructuring provision is 
recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those 
affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by 
it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those 
amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity. 47 Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Business Review Company Overview
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations under local sale of goods legislation are recognised at the date of sale of the 
relevant products, at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligation.
Other provisions relate to the tax consequences of international intragroup transactions for which the ﬁscal authorities may be 
expected to adopt opposing treatments in respect of revenue and cost recognition. Other provisions are recognised at the date the 
international intragroup transactions occurred, at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s 
obligation.
2.2.7 Leases
Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a ﬁnance 
lease. Assets held under ﬁnance leases and similar contracts which confer the rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned 
assets are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Lease payments are apportioned between the ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income statement.
Assets held under ﬁnance lease are depreciated over the lower of the useful lives and the term of the lease.
All other leases are treated as operating leases, and rentals payable are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
2.2.8 Employee beneﬁts
Pension obligations
The Group operates both deﬁned contribution and deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past-service 
costs. The deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂows using interest rates 
of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the beneﬁts will be paid, and that have terms to 
maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the 
market rates on government bonds are used.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity 
in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees 
remaining in service for a speciﬁed period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period.
The operating and ﬁnancing costs of the pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they arise and 
are recognised separately. The costs of past service beneﬁt enhancements, settlements and curtailments are also recognised in the 
period in which they arise. The net surplus or deﬁcit is presented with the other net assets on the balance sheet. The related deferred 
tax is shown with the other deferred tax balances.
For deﬁned contribution plans, contributions are recognised as employee beneﬁt expense when they are due. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash 
refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Other post-employment obligations
Some group companies provide post-retirement healthcare beneﬁts to their retirees. The entitlement to these beneﬁts is usually 
conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected 
costs of these beneﬁts are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension plans.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity 
in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualiﬁed 
actuaries. 48

Tyman plc

2. Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies and basis of consolidation continued
Termination beneﬁts
Termination beneﬁts are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an 
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these beneﬁts. The Group recognises termination beneﬁts when it is 
demonstrably committed to a termination when the entity has a detailed formal plan to terminate the employment of current 
employees without possibility of withdrawal. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination beneﬁts 
are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Beneﬁts falling due more than 12 months after the end 
of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
Proﬁt-sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and proﬁt-sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the 
proﬁt attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where contractually 
obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
2.2.9 Share based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled share based remuneration scheme (Long Term Incentive Plan, “LTIP”) for certain employees 
under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (share options) of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding 
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are 
expected to vest, with any changes in estimate recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The 
fair value of awards granted under LTIP is measured using a probability model to predict target EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised.
2.2.10 Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument and are generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are 
classiﬁed as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “trade and other receivables” and “cash and cash 
equivalents” in the balance sheet.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one 
year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classiﬁed as current assets. If not, they are presented as 
non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method, less appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between 
the carrying amount and present value of estimated future cash ﬂows.
Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash ﬂows and balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call 
with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, accruals, other payables, and interest bearing loans and borrowings.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Accounts payable are classiﬁed as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the 
business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. 49 Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Business Review Company Overview
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Interest bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.2.11 Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and 
are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value 
is negative.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
 hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash ﬂow 
hedge); or
 hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
For those instruments designated as hedges, the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between 
hedging instruments and hedged items. This documentation identiﬁes the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, 
the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected at 
inception to be highly effective.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Cash ﬂow hedges
Cash ﬂow hedges comprise derivative ﬁnancial instruments designated in a hedging relationship to manage interest rate risk to which 
the cash ﬂows of certain liabilities are exposed. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is designated 
and qualiﬁes for hedge accounting is recognised in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassiﬁed to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item 
affects proﬁt or loss. However, where a forecasted transaction results in a non-ﬁnancial asset or liability, the accumulated fair value 
movements previously deferred in equity are included in the initial cost of the asset or liability.
For all other cash ﬂow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income 
statement in the same year in which the hedged ﬁrm commitment affects the net proﬁt and loss.
Investments in foreign operations
A foreign currency exposure arises from net investments in Group entities whose functional currency differs from the Group’s 
presentation currency. The Group uses foreign currency loans to hedge foreign currency risk. This translation risk does not give rise to 
a cash ﬂow exposure. Its impact only arises from the translation of the net investment in the Group’s presentation currency.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash ﬂow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income 
statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
2.2.12 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders 
until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
2.2.13 Segment reporting
The Group’s operations are divided into three product segments: Amesbury, grouphomesafe and Schlegel International, which is 
consistent with the segments identiﬁed in internal reports which are reviewed by the chief operating decision makers, deﬁned as the 
Board of Directors. A product segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in providing a group of related products and is 
subject to risks and returns that are different from those of the other segments. IFRS 8 also requires disclosure of information on 
geographical areas with the Group’s system of internal reporting to key operating decision makers serving as a starting point. 50

2. Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies and basis of consolidation continued
2.2.14 Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the Group and when the amount of 
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and represents 
amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes. As such revenue from the sale of goods 
is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been substantially transferred to the buyer, usually on 
dispatch of the goods.
2.2.15 Current and deferred taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the 
year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current 
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date in the countries where the 
Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred income tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable proﬁt and is accounted for 
using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred income tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable proﬁt 
or loss nor the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, 
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet dates and that 
are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to proﬁt or loss, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt 
with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and where the intention is to settle the 
balances on a net basis.
2.2.16 Exceptional items
Where certain income or expense items recorded in the period are material by their size or incidence, the Group reﬂects such items as 
exceptional items within a separate line on the income statement, except for those exceptional items that relate to net ﬁnance costs 
and tax.
Separate presentation of exceptional items provides an improved understanding of the elements of ﬁnancial performance in the year 
so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in ﬁnancial performance.
Exceptional items, as disclosed in note 4, include one-off redundancy and restructuring costs, and transactions costs associated with 
merger and acquisition activity.
2.2.17 Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group. 51 Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Business Review Company Overview
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, 
except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash ﬂow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. These are 
recognised directly in equity, other than the ineffective element, until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are 
recognised in the income statement.
Group companies
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the 
exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated into Sterling at the average rates 
throughout the year.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets of Group companies, together with differences arising from the 
translation of the net results at average or actual rates to the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, are taken to other 
comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative translation differences recognised in other comprehensive 
income relating to that particular foreign operation are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
2.2.18 Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets and all assets and liabilities classiﬁed as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less 
costs to sell.
Non-current assets and all assets and liabilities, or disposal groups, are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is met only when a sale is highly probable, the asset or 
disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and management is committed to the sale which is expected to 
qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classiﬁcation.
2.2.19 Non-GAAP measure accounting policy
The Directors believe that the “underlying” proﬁt and earnings per share measures provide additional useful information to 
shareholders on the underlying performance of the business. These measures are consistent with how business performance is 
measured internally. The adjusted proﬁt before tax measure is not recognised under IFRS and may not be comparable with 
“underlying” proﬁt measures used by other companies. The adjustments made to reported proﬁt before tax is to include the following:
 Exceptional income and charges – these are largely one-off in nature and therefore create volatility in reported earnings.
 Amortisation and impairment of intangible items, amortisation of borrowing costs, unwinding of discount on provisions – these are 
non-cash in nature and the events giving rise to them are expected to be infrequent.
2.2.20 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following areas represent the key judgements made by management in order to facilitate the preparation of the Group’s ﬁnancial 
statements:
Taxation
The Group is subject to taxation in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income 
taxes as there are transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The amounts provided are accrued based on 
management’s interpretation of country-speciﬁc tax laws and the likelihood of settlement, which may differ from actual liabilities. This 
could have an adverse impact on the results and the net position of the Group (note 8).
Impairment reviews and discount rates
The Group tests intangible assets and goodwill for impairment in accordance with the stated accounting policy. The value in use 
calculations requires the use of estimates of future growth and assessment of appropriate discount rates. Future events could result in 
the assumptions used in the impairment reviews to change, with a resultant adverse impact on the results and net position of the 
Group. Details of estimates used and sensitivities in the impairment reviews are set out in note 10. 52

2. Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies and basis of consolidation continued
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are expense or income items recorded in a period which have been determined by management as being material by 
their size or incidence and are presented separately within the results of the Group. The determination of which items are disclosed as 
exceptional will affect the presentation of proﬁt measures including EBITA and adjusted earnings per share, and requires a degree of 
judgement. Details regarding exceptional items reported during the year are set out in note 4.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions. The key assumptions 
concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
There are a number of assumptions management have considered in performing impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible assets. 
In determining whether goodwill is impaired an estimation of value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been 
allocated has been prepared. The value in use calculation requires the Directors to estimate the future cash ﬂows expected to arise 
from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value (note 10).
Provisions
Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, 
and are discounted to present value where the effect is material (note 21).
Valuation of ﬁnancial instruments at fair value
Management makes a number of assumptions with regards to the models used to value ﬁnancial instruments at their fair value at year 
end. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative ﬁnancial instruments, assumptions are 
made based on quoted market rates adjusted for speciﬁc features of the instrument (note 18).
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
On acquisition of Group companies, the Group recognises any separately identiﬁable intangible assets from goodwill, initially 
measuring each group of intangible assets at fair value. Groups of intangible assets will include purchased brands, customer 
relationships, trademarks and licences. The determination of fair value requires the Directors to estimate the useful economic life of 
each asset and the future cash ﬂows expected to arise from each asset and to apply a suitable discount rate (note 11).
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-moving items. Net 
realisable value is based on current assessments of future demand, market conditions and new product development initiatives. Should 
demand for the Group’s products decline further during the next ﬁnancial year as a result of the current economic downturn, additional 
allowances may be necessary in respect of excess or slow-moving items (note 13).
Deﬁned beneﬁt pension and post-retirement beneﬁt schemes
The beneﬁt obligation is calculated using a number of assumptions including future salary increases, increases to pension beneﬁts, 
mortality rates and, in the case of post-employment medical beneﬁts, the expected rate of increase in medical costs. The present value 
of the beneﬁt obligation is calculated by discounting the beneﬁt obligation using market yields on high-quality corporate bonds at the 
balance sheet date. The plan assets consist largely of listed securities and their fair values are subject to ﬂuctuation in response to 
changes in market conditions. Effects of changes in the actuarial assumptions underlying the beneﬁt obligation, effects of changes in 
the discount rate applicable to the beneﬁt obligation and effects of differences between the expected and actual return on the plan 
assets are classiﬁed as actuarial gains and losses and are recognised directly in equity. Further actuarial gains and losses will be 
recognised during the next ﬁnancial year. An analysis of the assumptions that will be used by management to determine the cost of 
deﬁned beneﬁt plans that will be recognised in the income statement in the next ﬁnancial year is presented in note 20.
Deferred tax assets
Estimation is required of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax 
liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences but, where deductible temporary differences exist, management’s 
judgement is required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable proﬁts. It is 
possible that the deferred tax assets actually recoverable may differ from the amounts recognised if actual taxable proﬁts differ from 
management’s estimates (note 19). 53 Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

3. Segmental analysis
The following tables present Group revenue and proﬁt and certain assets and liability information regarding the Group’s product 
segments, which have been generated using Group accounting policies, with no differences of measurement applied.
During the year, the Group restructured its United Kingdom and International divisions, establishing separate management teams for 
each division. These organisational changes, together with the acquisitions and disposals, impacted how the segments are identiﬁed, 
measured and reported. Consequently, the Group has changed its reporting segments to reﬂect the manner in which performance is 
evaluated and resources allocated. The Group now has three reporting segments, namely: Amesbury, grouphomesafe and Schlegel 
International. Each segment broadly represents the Group’s geographical focus, being the US, UK and International operations 
respectively, apart from the Group’s UK-based sealing division, which has been included as part of the Schlegel International segment.
During 2012, the Group disposed of its Oil Services and Composite Doors businesses (refer to notes 25 and 26), included as part of 
discontinued operations in the analysis below.

The standard rate of Corporation tax in the UK changed from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012. Accordingly, the Group’s UK 
proﬁts for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 24.5% (2011: 26.5%). The tax rate of 23% was substantively enacted 
in July 2012, and UK deferred tax assets and liabilities have been provided at this rate.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Exceptional adjustments in respect of prior periods arose from the clariﬁcation with the tax authorities of the tax treatment of 
provisions, mainly those originally made at the time of the Schlegel acquisition in 2006 and the LSS acquisition in 2007.
8.2 Reconciliation of the total tax charge

Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net proﬁt attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be 
issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. There is no difference between the basic and 
diluted loss per share for 2012 as the effect of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares outstanding was anti-dilutive.

Underlying earnings per share from continuing operations before exceptional items
The Group presents an underlying earnings per share ﬁgure which excludes the impact of exceptional items, amortisation and 
accelerated amortisation of intangible assets, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, non-cash ﬁnance costs, and certain 
non-recurring items. Underlying earnings per share has been based on underlying earnings for each ﬁnancial year and on the same 
weighted average number of shares in issue as the earnings per share calculation.

10. Goodwill continued
In 2011, the Group reported two CGUs: Building Products and Oil Services (now discontinued). During the year the Group restructured 
its United Kingdom and International divisions, establishing separate management teams for each division. These operational changes 
together with acquisitions and disposals impacted the manner in which segments and CGUs are identiﬁed. The CGUs are now 
consistent with the way the business is reported to the Board on a monthly basis. The net book value of goodwill was allocated by CGU 
at 31 December 2011 as follows:
  £’000
Building Products 213,678
Oil Services

Impairment tests for goodwill
Assumptions
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. Value in use is determined by discounting the 
future pre-tax cash ﬂows generated from the continuing use of the CGU, using a pre-tax discount rate.
Cash ﬂow projections are derived from ﬁnancial plans approved by the Board and cover a ﬁve year period. They reﬂect management’s 
expectations of revenue growth, operating cost and margin for each CGU based on past experience. Cash ﬂows after the ﬁve year 
forecast period were extrapolated using a long-term growth rate of 1.5% in order to calculate the terminal recoverable amount.
Discount rates are estimated using pre-tax rates that reﬂect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk 
proﬁles of the CGUs.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations in each of the Group’s CGUs at 31 December 2012 are as follows:
 
Average pre-
tax discount 
rate
Average 
revenue growth 
for years 1 to 5
Amesbury 12.4% 8.1%
Fab & Fix 12.3% 5.3%
grouphomesafe 11.7% 3.6%
Schlegel International 14.5% 9.8%
As noted above, in 2011 the Group reported two CGUs: Building Products and Oil Services (now discontinued). The key assumptions 
used in the value in use calculations in each of the CGUs at 31 December 2011 were as follows:
 
Average pre-
tax discount 
rate
Average 
revenue growth 
for years 1 to 3
Average 
revenue growth 
for years 4 to 5
Building Products 11.2% 6.1% 3.0%
Oil Services 8.5% 4.8% 3.5%
Impairment review results
The results of the impairment review process indicated that the carrying value of goodwill in the Schlegel International CGU is currently 
unsupportable, and that impairment is necessary.  
The Group’s European businesses, which are part of the Schlegel International CGU, have continued to experience challenging market 
conditions and this has been reﬂected in reduced expectations of future proﬁtability in the value in use calculations for the Schlegel 
International CGU. As a result, an impairment charge of £10.7 million has been recognised in administrative expenses in the income 
statement. The carrying value of the remaining goodwill relating to the Schlegel International CGU was £15.6 million at 31 December 2012.
Sensitivity to assumptions
Sensitivity analysis was calculated on the basis of lowering the forecast revenues by a constant percentage each year from year one 
onwards in perpetuity until the excess of value in use over the carrying value of the CGU’s assets was reduced to zero. Revenues would 
need to decrease by 9.2 percentage points for each year from year one onwards in perpetuity before any impairment would arise in 
respect of the CGU with the lowest impairment headroom. 61 Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012

Change in estimate
During the year, the Group undertook to review the estimated useful lives of its intangible assets. Acquired brands, with a cost of 
£3,486,000 and an initial indeﬁnite useful life, now have an estimated useful life of 15 years. The change in estimate arose due to a 
revision of the expected usage of the intangible asset by the Group. The change in estimate gave rise to an additional amortisation 
charge of £922,000 to the income statement in the current year.  There was no change to the estimated useful lives of the remaining 
acquired brands.
The estimated useful lives of the United States (“US”) and United Kingdom (“UK”) customer relations intangibles, acquired in the Laird 
acquisition in 2007, were evaluated based on a review of revenue forecasts used in the initial intangibles valuation against actual 
performance. The results of the review have given rise to a change in the expected usage of the intangible assets by the Group. As such 
the estimated useful lives of these intangibles were revised, and the impact of the change in estimate, resulting in an additional 
amortisation charge to the income statement, is summarised as follows:

Impairment
The impairment charge on acquired brands of £6,223,000 relates to a US brand name which is no longer in use.
The remaining £1,510,000 impairment on acquired brands and the £1,837 ,000 impairment on customer relations relates to intangibles 
acquired as part of the Schlegel acquisition in 2006. As mentioned in note 10, the Group’s European businesses have continued to experience 
challenging market conditions, thus reducing the expectation of the future proﬁtability of products marketed in this segment, under the 
Schlegel brand. As a result, the recoverable amount of these intangible assets fell below cost, giving rise to an impairment loss. Impairment 
losses have been recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.

Fair value measurement
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of ﬁnancial instruments by valuation technique:
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
 Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have signiﬁcant effect on the recorded fair value are observable either directly 
or indirectly.
 Level 3: Techniques which use inputs which have a signiﬁcant effect on the recorded fair value which are not based on observable 
market data.
The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These 
valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and relay as little as possible on entity speciﬁc 
estimates. If all signiﬁcant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
If one or more of the signiﬁcant inputs is not based on observable market date, the instrument is included in level 3.
Speciﬁc valuation techniques used to value ﬁnancial instruments include:
 Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments.
 The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows based on observable 
yield curves.
 Other techniques such as discounted cash ﬂow analysis.
Derivatives shown at fair value in the balance sheet have been valued by reference to level 2 techniques described above.
Net investment hedges
The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge the value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to 
movements in foreign exchange rates. The value of the net investment hedge was £46,334,000 at 31 December 2012 (2011: 
£78,518,000). This hedge is considered highly effective, and no ineffective portion has been recognised in proﬁt or loss.

Factors that may affect future tax charges
There are estimated tax losses of £14,403,000 (2011: £13,745,000) within the Group, comprising capital losses of £4,581,000 (2011: 
£7,348,000) and trading losses of £9,822,000 (2011: £6,397,000). As the future use of these losses is uncertain, in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policy only a portion of these losses have been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
The standard rate of Corporation tax in the UK changed from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012. Accordingly, the Group’s UK 
proﬁts for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 24.5% (2011: 26.5%). 68

19. Deferred tax continued
A further reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 23% was substantively enacted on 2 July 2012 and will be effective from 1 April 
2013. The relevant deferred tax balances have therefore been re-measured.
In addition, further changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the Autumn statement 2012. This includes a further 
reduction to the main rate to reduce the rate to 22% from 1 April 2014.  This change had not been substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date and, therefore, is not included in these ﬁnancial statements. 
The proposed reduction in the main rate of corporation tax to 22% from 1 April 2014 will be enacted separately. The overall effect of 
this further change, if it applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to further reduce the deferred tax 
liability by £1,139,000.
The amounts of deferred tax not recognised are as follows:
 
2012
£’000
2011
£’000
Tax losses (915) (846)
Capital losses (1,054) (1,837)
(1,969) (2,683)
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £40,500,000 (2011: £32,900,000) relating to the unremitted 
earnings of overseas subsidiaries. As a result of UK legislation, which largely exempts from UK tax the overseas dividends received, the 
temporary differences arising on unremitted proﬁts are unlikely to lead to additional UK corporate taxes. Furthermore, although the 
remittance to the UK of those earnings could still result in a tax liability, arising as a result of withholding taxes levied by the overseas 
tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate, such jurisdictions provide currently for zero dividend withholding tax in their tax 
agreements with the UK.

20.1 Deﬁned contribution pension schemes
The Group operates a number of deﬁned contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held externally to the Group in 
separate trustee administered funds. The costs of the Group’s deﬁned contribution pension schemes are charged to the income 
statement in the period in which they fall due. The Group had unpaid pension contributions of £Nil (2011: £Nil) included within 
employee beneﬁt liabilities.
20.2 Deﬁned beneﬁt pension and post-retirement beneﬁt schemes
The Group’s principal deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme and post-retirement healthcare scheme is operated in the United States. An 
actuarial valuation was last performed as at 31 December 2012. When revalued, scheme assets are included at market value and 
scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the net periodic beneﬁt cost; these liabilities are discounted at the current 
rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term. Surpluses are only included to the extent that they are 
recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes.
The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption was developed as a weighted average rate based on the target asset 
allocation of the plan and the long-term capital market assumptions. The overall return for each asset class was developed by 
combining a long-term inﬂation component and the associated expected real rates. The development of the capital market 
assumptions utilised a variety of methodologies, including, but not limited to, historical analysis, stock valuation models such as 
dividend discount models and earnings yields’ models, expected economic growth outlook, and market yields analysis.
The current service cost and any past service costs are included in the income statement within administrative expenses and the 
expected return on the schemes’ assets, net of the impact of the unwinding of the discount on scheme liabilities, is included within 
other ﬁnance income and costs. Actuarial gains and losses, including differences between the expected and actual return on scheme 
assets, are recognised, net of the related deferred tax, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 69 Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Business Review Company Overview
The pension scheme is closed to new entrants; as a result the service costs to the Group will rise in future years. The expected level of 
contributions to the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme and post-retirement healthcare scheme in the year to December 2013 is £1,044,000 (2012: 
£1,314,000).
Other deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes had net liabilities of £Nil (2011: £Nil).

Current liabilities are those aspects of provisions that are expected to be utilised within the next year.
Property related
Property provisions relate to provisions for onerous leases of £4,661,000 (2011: £7,936,000), and leasehold dilapidations of £1,804,000 
(2011: £1,987,000), and are expected to be utilised by 2018.
For onerous leases, the Group has provided for the rental payments due over the remaining term of existing operating lease contracts 
where a period of vacancy is ongoing. The provision has been calculated after taking into account both the periods over which 
properties are likely to remain vacant and any likely sub-lease income on a property-by-property basis. The provision covers potential 
transfer of economic beneﬁt over the full range of current lease commitments disclosed in note 30.
The provision for leasehold dilapidations relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their original state of 
repair. The transfer of economic beneﬁts will occur at the end of the leases set out in note 30.
In 2012, the Group successfully assigned the lease on Unit A at Peterlee and have been released from all remaining obligations in 
connection with the Peterlee site.  This resulted in a release to the income statement of £2,021,000 of property provisions.
Restructuring
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs at restructured/closed business units and are expected to be 
utilised by the end of 2013.
Warranty
The warranty provision is calculated based on historical experience of the ultimate cost of settling product warranty claims and 
potential claims. Warranty provisions are expected to be utilised by the end of 2017.
Other
Other provisions relate to the tax consequences of international intragroup transactions for which the ﬁscal authorities may be 
expected to adopt opposing treatments in respect of revenue and cost recognition. Other provisions are expected to be utilised 
by 2014. 72

Share based payments
In 2012, the Group operated the LTIP. The nil cost options awarded under the LTIP were valued using a probability model to predict EPS 
levels. The charge to the income statement in 2012 was £482,000 (2011: £172,000).
LTIP
Conditional, annual awards of shares are granted under the LTIP to certain Executive Directors and senior managers at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee. Provided the participant remains an employee of the Group and the performance conditions are met, 
awards will vest three years after the date of the grant at no cost to the employee. The percentage of shares that will actually vest is 
dependent upon the Group’s earnings per share growth over a three year measurement period ending 31 December 2013. Further 
information on the LTIP and the performance conditions is given in the remuneration report.

23.2 Financial instruments: risk proﬁle
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital structure to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern. The capital structure of the Group 
consists of cash and cash equivalents (note 15), interest bearing loans and borrowings (note 17) and equity attributable to the 
shareholders of the parent as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Financial management
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial instruments comprise bank loans and cash and short-term deposits. The Group has various other 
ﬁnancial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. No trading in ﬁnancial 
instruments is undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each ﬁnancial instrument risk and they are summarised below.
Liquidity and credit risk
The Group maintains sufﬁcient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of credit 
facilities. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity on the basis of expected cash ﬂow.
The Group manages liquidity risk by the pooling of cash resources and depositing funds available for investment in approved ﬁnancial 
instruments with ﬁnancial institutions. Counterparty risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents is managed by only investing in 
banks and ﬁnancial instruments with independently assessed credit ratings of at least A-2 as published by Standard and Poor’s. 
Individual risk limits are assessed by management based on the external ratings. Management does not expect any losses from the 
non-performance of these counterparties.
Credit risk is also attributable to the Group’s exposure to trade receivables due from customers. Management assesses the credit 
quality of customers taking into account their ﬁnancial position, past experience and other factors. In order to mitigate credit risk the 
Group utilises credit insurance in those areas of its operations where such insurance is available. In areas where such insurance is not 
available, management monitors the utilisation of credit limits by customers, identiﬁed either individually or by group, and incorporates 
this information in credit risk controls. There are no signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk due to the diverse nature of the Group’s 
client base.
Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management 
based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of ﬁnancial assets recognised at the balance sheet date. 
Management considers all ﬁnancial assets that are not impaired for each of the reporting dates under review are of good credit quality, 
including those that are past due.
During the year ended 31 December 2012 the Group operated within its borrowing facilities. 74

Interest rate sensitivity
The impact of a 50 basis point movement in ﬂoating interest rates on borrowings would have a c. £400,000 (2011: £600,000) impact 
on proﬁts. This impact would be reduced by the tax effect on such a change.
Interest rate risk of ﬁnancial assets
The Board periodically reviews any exposure the Group may have to interest rate ﬂuctuations. The weighted average interest rate 
received on deposited funds was 1.24 per cent during the year (2011: 1.82 per cent). 75 Tyman plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Business Review Company Overview
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with 
respect to the US Dollar and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial and ﬁnancing transactions, recognised 
assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the Group’s functional currency and net investments in overseas entities.
The Group has a number of overseas subsidiaries, whose net assets are subject to currency translation risk. The Group borrows in local 
currencies as appropriate to minimise the impact of this risk on the balance sheet.

Capital management
The Group’s capital management objectives are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so as to provide returns 
to shareholders and beneﬁts to stakeholders. The Group deﬁnes its capital as total equity plus net debt.
In maintaining the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount paid as dividends to shareholders, issue new shares or dispose 
of assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors its ﬁnancial capacity by reference to ﬁnancial covenant ratios, including underlying net debt to adjusted EBITDA 
and interest cover. If the Group fails to meet its key ﬁnancial ratios required by its lenders, this could impact the Group’s average 
interest rate of borrowings and the future availability of credit to the Group.
The Group is in compliance with its ﬁnancial covenants within its committed bank credit facilities, and has been in compliance 
throughout the ﬁnancial year.

24. Acquisition of subsidiaries
24.1 Window Fabrication & Fixing Supplies Limited
On 2 August 2012, the Group completed the acquisition of Window Fabrication & Fixing Supplies Limited (“Fab & Fix”). Fab & Fix is the 
leading supplier of perfectly matching hardware to the window and door market in the United Kingdom. The company is a design-led 
business with a focus on total quality and customer service, based in Coventry. This acquisition signiﬁcantly deepens the 
grouphomesafe hardware offering and further diversiﬁes our supply chain.
Over time it is expected that the beneﬁts of the high quality Fab & Fix product range will be made available to other Group companies, 
with a particular focus on Schlegel International.

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Business Review Company Overview
The fair value of ﬁnancial assets includes trade receivables with a fair value of £2,762,000 and a gross contractual value of £2,909,000. 
The best estimate at the acquisition date of the contractual cash ﬂows not recoverable is £147,000.
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of £374,000 for professional fees paid for due diligence, other general professional fees 
and legal advice. These costs have been included in exceptional costs in the Group’s consolidated income statement.
The revenue included in the consolidated income statement since 2 August 2012 contributed by Fab & Fix was £6.6 million. Fab & Fix 
also contributed £0.7 million to the proﬁt before taxation from continuing operations over the same period.
Had the acquisition of Fab & Fix been completed on the ﬁrst day of the ﬁnancial year, an additional £9.5 million of revenue and £1.3 
million of loss before taxation from continuing operations would have been contributed to the Group.
Fair values remain provisional in relation to this acquisition and the Group will complete this review in 2013. Any adjustment to the 
carrying value is unlikely to be signiﬁcant to the individual acquisition.
The estimated value of intangibles, including goodwill, deductible for tax purposes is £Nil.
24.2 Unique Balance International
On 24 April 2012, the Group acquired the business and assets of Unique Balance International (“Unique”), located in Montreal, Canada.

25.1 Composite Doors
On 31 August 2012, the Group completed the disposal of the business and assets of its composite doors business (“Composite Doors”) 
to Britdoors Group Limited for a consideration of approximately £748,000.
Composite Doors has been loss-making since 2011 and has struggled to generate an acceptable return for the Group. Against this 
backdrop, the Board concluded that the prospects of Composite Doors returning to a sustained level of acceptable proﬁtability under 
the Group’s ownership as remote, and earlier this year decided to explore the strategic options available to the Group for Composite 
Doors. Following a targeted sales process, the disposal was completed on 31 August 2012, on which date control of the business and 
assets passed to the acquirer.
The results of the discontinued operations which have been included in the consolidated income statement were as follows:

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Business Review Company Overview
Independent auditors’ report to the members of T yman plc 
(formerly Lupus Capital plc)
We have audited the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements of Tyman plc (formerly Lupus Capital plc) for the year ended 31 December 
2012 which comprise the Parent Company balance sheet and the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 32, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the Annual Report and 
Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2012;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Business Review Company Overview
Notes to the Company ﬁnancial statements
1. Accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by that Act, 
the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards (UK GAAP).
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting 
policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the year, are set out below.
1.2 Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to proﬁt and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1.3 Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
1.4 Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated recoverable amounts.
Trade creditors are stated at their nominal amount.
1.5 Borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred, on an 
accruals basis, to the Company proﬁt and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
1.6 Share based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 “Share based payments”. The Company issues equity-settled share based 
payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding 
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are 
expected to vest, with any changes in estimate recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The 
fair value of awards granted under LTIP is measured using a probability model to predict EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as 
a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised 
over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity in the parent 
entity accounts.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the grant 
itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
2. Proﬁt attributable to the shareholders of the Company
The Company is an investment holding company. It receives dividend income from subsidiaries and bank interest. It pays loan interest 
to a subsidiary. The majority of administrative expenses are paid by the Company’s subsidiary, Tyman Management Limited, including 
the whole amount of relevant auditor’s remuneration and operating lease costs.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own proﬁt and loss account for 
the year. The Company reported proﬁt for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2012 of £52,870,000 (2011: £1,360,000). Included in 
the Company’s reported proﬁts for the year is a proﬁt on disposal of subsidiary of £55,700,000 (2011: £Nil). 86

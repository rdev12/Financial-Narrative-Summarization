Consumer Products
As the world’s leading manufacturer of power cords Volex
supplies an extensive range of international standard and
custom designed products suitable for a variety of markets
including PC’s, notebooks, printers, white/brown goods,
floorcare, gardening, power tools and small appliances. Volex
also supports the full range of cable assemblies required by
the digital and analogue home entertainment sector.
Data and Telecommunications
Volex has become a leader in the production of cable
assemblies used in advanced routing, switching, fixed line
applications and wireless communication systems. Increasing
demand for high-speed Internet access, the continued growth
in wireless communication and the roll-out of “Triple Play”
infrastructures (bundling voice, video and Internet) are
providing growth potential for the Group in the telecom sector
and demand for band width and data services, so creating
additional opportunities in the server and storage markets.

off-highway vehicles, aerospace and industrial engines,
avionics and flight management systems and defence
applications, such as weapons systems and armoured
fighting vehicles. 
Leveraging our core competency of interconnect technology
cable assemblies and power cords, Volex provides a Total
Solution to its customers centred around a broad product
portfolio, superior quality and wide variety of assembly and
supply services.
Total Product
Volex offers a complete product portfolio, ranging from
commodity style cables such as power cords, small

end custom cable assemblies, such as radio frequency, high
speed and fibre optic cables.
Volex is a leading global producer of electronic and fibre optic
cable assemblies and electrical power cords. The Group
currently operates from 18 manufacturing facilities with 21 sales
and support offices located strategically in Asia, Europe and
North and South America. Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 03
Our design and development capabilities enable us to design
a product from the early concept stage, improve product
performance, provide alternative material sourcing and
improve the manufacturing efficiency of the product. 
Our global footprint allows the transfer of products quickly
from one location to another, enabling us to develop our
products close to our customers and produce them in lower
cost regions to offer a competitive product solution in every
region of the world.
With our Total Product Solution Volex can service a wide
range of customer product supply requirements and offers the
customer an opportunity to utilise Volex as its consolidated
supplier of products across the cable assembly spectrum.
Total Quality
Volex is recognised industry wide for its quality products and
we continue to invest in training and equipment to maintain
our leadership in this area. 
Our commitment to quality is shown in our extensive range of
industry-specific product safety approvals, our customer
quality awards and our investment in various ISO
certifications, ranging from ISO 9001:2000 to ISO 14001,
OHSAS 18001 and other industry specific certifications such
as TL 9000 and QS 9000.
In the electronics industry the production of environmentally
friendly products has become increasingly important with the
forthcoming implementation of the Restriction of Hazardous
Substances (RoHS) directive on 1July 2006 and the future
implementation of the Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE) directive.  Both directives are aimed at
reducing the hazardous materials content in electronic
products as well as increasing the recycling of these products.
In preparation for complying with RoHS, Volex initiated a
management project working with its customers and its
extensive supply base to ensure that as a minimum it
conformed with the legislative requirements.  In addition, the
design of our products is aimed at reducing their
environmental impact in terms of production, product usage
and disposal which will assist producers in complying with the
WEEE directive either prior to or upon implementation. 
Minimising the environmental impact from our products has
been an approach adopted by Volex for a number of years.
For instance, since 2003 Volex has used lead-free injection
moulding compound for its power cords and currently
supplies a range of lead-free cord sets to its customers.
Total Service
Volex operates in rapidly changing and highly competitive
markets characterised by increased consolidation and
outsourcing from OEM’s (Original Equipment Manufacturers)
to EMS (Electronics Manufacturing Service) providers,
dramatically reduced supply bases, increased price erosion
and a shift from regional to global supply sourcing. 
In this dynamic environment value-add services play an
important role in winning and maintaining customer
programmes. Our customers have become truly global
players and expect Volex to work with them on a global level.
Our Global Accounts organisation meets that requirement and
offers customer relationship management on a global level,
managing global project activities, co-ordinating local
programmes and offering a single point of contact for our
customers.
With the continuing globalisation of our market place and the
importance of manufacturing in lower cost areas, supply chain
management and logistical services are a vital part of our Total
Services offering. Our customers and product diversity drive a
wide and deep supply chain that enable us to aggregate an
individual customer’s demand and maintain material availability
to support rapid swings in demand. Volex can provide a range
of logistical services that increase the flexibility for our
customers, enabling shipment directly to local hubs, third
parties or even to the point of installation. Our global position
also enables us to benefit from global supply contracts and
provides us with opportunities to use locally sourced
materials, which reduces lead times and cost.
With our global presence and our vast range of quality
products and services, Volex is well positioned to service our
targeted markets and to be a preferred supplier to our
customers, offering a Total Solution for their cable assembly
demand. Products & Global Footprint

Wiring Harness Chairman’s Statement
06
The last year has seen the later stages of the restructuring
programme that the Company embarked on four years ago.
In June 2005 we raised £17.6m net of costs by way of an
equity placing with existing and new shareholders in order to
provide the financial and strategic stability to allow us to
execute a long-term strategy that will result in sustainable
returns over the forthcoming years.  We have made significant
progress in achieving the key elements of the strategic plan
set out in the Circular to shareholders on 6 June 2005.
Specifically we have:
• Realigned the manufacturing footprint and moved to
lower cost locations. By the end of FY2006 we have
closed seven facilities and downsized two more and plan
to close three further facilities in FY2007 and downsize
one more. Over 95% of our direct labour force is now
located in the low cost areas of Asia, Mexico and Eastern
Europe.
• Restructured the organisation into three global product
groups to align with the market and better serve our
customers.
• Strengthened the management team through the addition
of key staff in engineering, sales, sourcing and operations.
The new team members join us from leading companies
both inside and outside the industry.  
• Enhanced our penetration of high growth and emerging
markets such as medical, high speed assemblies and
WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access).
• Focused on cost reduction and cash generation to
improve profitability and balance sheet.  The Group
generated cash flows from operations of £11.7m,
compared with £1.6m in the previous year.
• Seen the operating profit before the £8.6m major
restructuring programme charge triple to £5.3m from
£1.8m.  We managed to increase our operating margin
despite a significant increase in commodity prices and
pricing pressure from our customers.  We saw benefits of
the cost saving and restructuring programmes during the
second half of the year when we generated £3.9m
operating profit against £1.4m in the first half of FY2006.
• Reduced net borrowings from £30.5m to £13.3m. 
Results
The revenues for the financial year ended 2 April 2006 were
up 2.4% at £250.4m and operating profit (before the cost of
the major restructuring programme) was £5.3m  (2005:
£1.8m).  Net borrowings closed at £13.3m, down from
£30.5m a year ago.
The Group took a gross £8.9m charge in respect of the
accelerated restructuring programme but a £0.3m credit in
respect of higher fire insurance proceeds reduced the charge
to £8.6m.  The net loss for the year after this charge was
£3.3m (2005: loss £5.0m).
The Board is not proposing a dividend in respect of the 
year. 
Board and management changes
As the Group is now transitioning from a restructuring phase
to one of growth, changes have been made to the Board and
management of the Company.  Heejae Chae was appointed
as the Chief Executive Officer of the Group.  Heejae has
already served as the Chief Operations Officer and has
successfully guided the Group through the restructuring in the
past year, particularly in North America.  Heejae was
previously the worldwide General Manager of the Radio
Frequency Group of Amphenol Corporation.  Martin May
resigned as Chairman after providing leadership during the
restructuring phase.  Additionally, Derek Walter, 58, has
tendered his resignation as Finance Director but will remain
with the Group until a new Finance Director has been
appointed and an orderly handover period has been
completed.  This new management team, together with a
significant number of other new team members, will meet the
requirements of the next stage of the Group’s development.
Dimitri Goulandris has also been appointed a non-executive
Director of the Board.  Dimitri is a partner of Cycladic Capital
LLP , which is a major shareholder of Volex.
“The stability provided by the injection of funds by existing
and new shareholders will allow the Group to maximise the
available market potential and build a Company capable of
sustainable returns over the forthcoming years.”
Richard Arkle Chairman
“We have now passed the inflexion point of
restructuring into a path of growth and profitability
but we nevertheless recognise the significant
challenges ahead of us.” Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 07
Future
The Group is well positioned to take advantage of the
dynamics of the global cable assembly and power cord
marketplaces.  Based on independent research, Volex is the
third largest player in the cable assembly market (which
includes power cords) and, using internal research material,
the largest player in the power cord assembly market.
Despite our leading market positions, our market share is
single digit providing us the opportunity for significant growth.
We are uniquely positioned to grow by leveraging our global
footprint, broad technology capabilities and strategic and
preferred relationships with customers that are leaders in the
markets they serve.
We have now passed the inflexion point of restructuring into a
path of growth and profitability but we nevertheless recognise
the significant challenges ahead of us.  The industry dynamics
of customers reducing their vendor base, rising commodity
prices and pricing pressure are issues we face daily.
Predicting the future in today’s uncertain environment is
difficult but we are confident that following the major changes
that have been achieved over the last twelve months, we are
well placed to make further progress towards bottom line
profitability and enhancing shareholder value.
In closing, I would like to thank everyone in the organisation.
Our people span the world and many cultures and the
business has over one hundred years of history.  We would
not have achieved our leadership position if not for the
dedication, hard work and passion of our people.  As we
move forward to an exciting future, we recognise that respect,
teamwork and collaboration with all our stakeholders must be
the cornerstones that will drive the Group forward on a global
footing and produce the anticipated returns for our
shareholders.  We will be asking the shareholders to support
a new long term incentive plan for the senior team and details
of the plan will be presented for approval at the Annual
General Meeting.

13 June 2006 Chief Executive’s Review
08
During FY2006, Volex Group went through a significant
transformation financially, organisationally and culturally.  We
emerged from the year poised to build on our leadership
position in the PowerCord, Infocom and Wiring Harness
markets we serve.
We have:
• Restructured the organisation into three global product
groups - PowerCord, Infocom and Wiring Harness - to
align with the market and better serve the customers.
We believe that the global nature of our customers and
supply chain require that we operate as a global
organisation.  Each product group is responsible for all
aspects of the business on a global basis.  We can
respond and service consistently the customers’ needs
anywhere in the world.  We believe that the global
structure allows us to leverage the knowledge,
technology and scale to achieve greater efficiency and
lower cost to better serve all our customers across the
world.  
• Accelerated the global restructuring programme.  By
the end of FY2006 we have closed seven
manufacturing facilities and downsized two more and
we plan to close three further facilities and downsize
one more in FY2007.  As a result, we significantly
reduced our costs enabling us to enter FY2007 with a
much lower cost base and over 95% of our direct
labour is now located in the low cost areas of Asia,
Mexico and Eastern Europe.
• Streamlined central functions and corporate structure.
In order to empower each global product group, the
global purchasing and IT functions were merged into
each product group.  Additionally, we have taken action
to benefit from lower costs at headquarters in the
coming year.  We believe that the responsibility for
business decisions should rest with the product
groups, not the corporate office.  The product groups
are closer to the customers and can react much more
quickly to the changing marketplace.  
• Transformed the organisation’s cultural mindset to
Global from Regional.  With the reorganisation into
global product groups, our perspective and mindset
have become global.  We are breaking down the
barriers to better share knowledge and competencies
across the organisation.  This change will allow us to
better manage our knowledge and technologies to
ensure that we provide the best service consistently to
all of our customers throughout the world.
• Developed a performance driven organisation.  We
enter FY2007 with a focus on results and
accountability.  Everyone in the organisation
understands our strategy and goal.  We recognise that
we must benchmark ourselves against the competition
and drive the organisation to outperform, measuring
ourselves against quantifiable metrics and performance
goals.  
• Reinforced the organisation with new team members.
We believe that people are our most important asset
and we continuously look to invest in developing new
talent at all levels.  During the past year, we added key
staff in engineering, sales, sourcing and operations.
These individuals bring with them new perspectives
that will fuel our growth. 
• Placed emphasis on a common value system.  We
recognise that our organisation comprises people from
many countries and cultures.  Each one of us brings
unique skills and perspectives.  It is important that we
operate under common values yet recognise our
diversity.  We believe that the following values are
universal at Volex: leadership, respect and integrity.  We
must promote them through communication and
teamwork that will lead to knowledge sharing across
our diverse people. 
“The Group has benefited from the general
improvement in demand across most of the
markets that we service but has also made
significant strides in developing new business
opportunities in targeted markets.”
Heejae Chae Group Chief Executive
“Volex Group went through a significant
transformation financially, organisationally and
culturally. We emerged from the year poised to
build on our leadership position....” Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 09
Markets
The cable assembly market, which encompasses
PowerCord, Infocom and Wiring Harness, is estimated at
approximately US$20 billion in annual sales.  Volex’s range
of technologies and products allow us to participate in a
broad variety of industries including consumer products,
data and telecommunications, industrial, medical,
automotive and military.
The consumer product market continues to remain strong
as a result of healthy consumer spending across the world.
New applications and development further drive the growth
through the introduction of “must have” products.  Volex
has experienced solid gains in the consumer products
sector especially for flat-screen televisions, gaming and
music consoles.  We anticipate future growth through
continued new product introductions; however, as with
other competitive markets, we expect significant pricing
pressure going forward.  Our participation in the sector is
primarily through our PowerCord product line, which carries
significant copper content.  This commodity has recently
experienced large price increases which are continuing
through the early half of FY2007, further stressing the
competitive nature of this business.
The Group’s second largest segment comprises data and
telecommunications products.  We provide an array of
products in telecom infrastructure, computers and Internet
equipment (servers, storage systems and datacom
equipment) and have preferred supplier status with
customers that are leaders in the markets they serve.  We
expect the telecom market to continue to grow, in particular
the wireless sector whose indicators remain strong; wireless
subscriber growth continues with new and improved
services and lower tariffs; 3G rollouts continue to gain
traction with launches in many geographies; and the
convergence of data and voice is a driver for future growth.
As the system requirements increase and product cycles
shorten, we continue to see growth in the sector; however,
with competition from existing players and new entrants
from low cost regions, pricing pressure remains significant.
The medical equipment segment is expected to continue to
grow, driven by the demographics of an ever growing and
ageing population.  The cable assembly supply base for
medical equipment is highly fragmented but evolving:
equipment providers are aggressively managing their supply
chains as they look to generate efficiency and reduce cost.
Volex is a major supplier in the sector and now has
established a leadership position with leading medical
equipment providers through leveraging our technology,
product offerings, superior service and global footprint. 
In the automotive and military markets we supply niche
wiring harness systems for off-highway equipment,
specialist vehicles and aerospace harness systems.  Our
sectors have remained steady, unlike the broader
automotive markets, and experienced positive growth
trends as a result of the increasing complexity of harnesses
for specialty vehicles as well as the general growth in
defence spending.
Product performance
PowerCords:
Revenue increased 6.7% in sterling terms.  The growth in
net sales was a result of volume increases and higher
average selling prices due to a shift in the mix towards
higher end products as well as price increases driven by
escalating copper prices.  New sales in consumer game
consoles and increased sales to our Japanese OEM
customers were the leading contributors to organic growth.
Although the competitive pricing environment dampened
the net sales increase, we continue to compete successfully
on the basis of performance, quality, reliability, brand
reputation, service and support.
Competitive pricing pressures and escalating copper costs
contributed to an increase in cost of sales.  Copper prices
rose from US$3,300/tonne to US$5,400/tonne, compared
with a reasonably stable average of approximately
US$3,000/tonne in FY2005.  The negative impact on the
cost of sales was partially offset by aggressive supply chain
management and improvements in labour and operating
costs. 10
During FY2006, we reorganised the PowerCord division into
a single global product group, allowing us to rationalise our
marketing, manufacturing and technology strategy.  We
have closed three facilities and downsized one and intend
to close a further site in FY2007, moving the business to
our expanded China operations.  This expanded low-cost
capacity will provide labour savings, fixed cost consolidation
and supply chain leverage.  Additionally, we have invested
in the engineering resources across all regions to enhance
our value to customers on a global basis.
Infocom:
The revenue from the Infocom business declined 4.8% as a
result of our rationalising low margin business, increased
pricing pressure and a one-time award of a contract for
telecom infrastructure deployment in India completed in
FY2005.  However, revenue and profitability improvements
were realised in key market sectors including medical and
telecommunications throughout the year.  
The Infocom division went through significant changes in
FY2006 designed to align the manufacturing footprint with
our customers’ requirements and cost targets.  As a result,
we consolidated our manufacturing locations into three
principal manufacturing centres: China, Eastern Europe and
Mexico, entering FY2007 with almost 100% of our direct
labour based in low cost regions.  Additionally, we
undertook significant action to reduce overhead cost by
reorganising the general and administrative structure.  The
sales organisation was realigned to provide global coverage
of our key accounts and focus on new account
development, enabling us to identify opportunities to
leverage our technologies across application specific
opportunities.  Capitalising on our preferred supplier
position at market leading customers, we look to leverage
our technologies and products to gain new customers in
similar applications.  Going forward, technologies and
competencies will be shared and leveraged across the
entire Group to best supply our customers with a broad
offering of technology and capabilities.  
The Infocom market continues to be highly competitive
through the entrance of low cost suppliers, the need for
aggressive year on year cost reductions and the desire of
customers to consolidate their supply bases.  Additionally,
we face rising commodity prices with limited visibility of
customer demand.  With the need to improve our market
position and profitability, the actions we took in FY2006 and
those we will continue to take in FY2007 will create
additional competitive advantage and allow us to achieve
our goals.  We have begun to see the benefits of these
actions during the second half of the year through improved
profits and cash flow for the Infocom product group.
Wiring Harness:
The revenue from the Wiring Harness business increased by
11.8%, despite price reductions and was a result of the
positioning in the growing markets of construction
equipment and military/aerospace.  The automotive market
remains highly competitive with the entrance of new low
cost suppliers, as well as aggressive year on year cost
reductions.  Whilst revenue increased, profitability came
under severe pressure being impacted by an unexpected
administration proceeding at one of our larger customers
and rising commodity prices, as well as significant
operational challenges.
The Wiring Harness business in FY2006 continued its drive
to improve its operational performance and cost base.  We
merged the two separate Wiring Harness businesses into
one organisation and announced the closure of one of our
manufacturing sites in the UK.  Throughout the year we
transferred projects to low cost manufacturing locations.
The sales and engineering organisations were reorganised
and strengthened to continue the business development
activities already showing success in FY2006.  The drive in
FY2007 is to continue the downsizing in high labour cost
areas, whilst improving our operational performance, focus
on business development and build on our very strong
reputation of quality and customer service.
Chief Executive’s Review (continued) The future
As we look to the future, there is much uncertainty
regarding rising commodity prices, customer pricing
pressures, low cost competition and limited demand
visibility.  Challenging as these factors may be, this
environment has been the reality of the industry for the past
five years.  The competitive landscape is littered with those
unable to adapt to this new environment.  Nevertheless,
market leaders have emerged stronger and better and we
recognise our challenge is to outperform them.  Volex has
struggled for the last five years and has now emerged to
compete aggressively in this challenging marketplace.  We
believe that our transformation – financially, organisationally
and culturally – will bring us to the forefront of the
competitive landscape.  We have aligned our manufacturing
footprint and cost basis to support the most demanding
customers; we have the technology to satisfy cutting edge
customers: and we have the supply chain and logistic
competencies to support our global customers.  But most
importantly, we have the people who are able to adapt to
these constant changes and continue to provide the best
service to our customers.

Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 13
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and
changes to previous year’s figures
FY2006 has been the first year in which Volex Group plc has
produced its financial statements in accordance with IFRS and
the comparative figures for the previous year have been
restated accordingly.  Details of Volex’s IFRS accounting policies
have already been published in the IFRS transition document
produced with the Interim Results for the 26 weeks to 2
October 2005 and published on the Company’s website, and
will be included in the Annual Report and Accounts for FY2006.
The major restatement in the Accounts has been the inclusion
in the balance sheet of the pension fund deficit of two defined
benefit schemes, which were closed on 31 March 2003 and
replaced by defined contribution arrangements.  At 2 April 2006
the combined deficits on the two defined benefit schemes
amounted to £3.5m (2005: £4.1m).
Overview
The major financial event in FY2006 has been the raising in
June 2005 of new equity (£19.0m before expenses), which has
funded the implementation of the strategy set out in the 
6 June 2005 Circular, most notably to date the realignment of
the manufacturing footprint of the Group. 
Trading for the year
Turnover for the 52 weeks ended 2 April 2006 at £250.4m
increased by £5.8m, 2.4%, over FY2005, including a £7.3m
positive currency effect.  Thus Group sales in real terms
decreased in the year, due to several factors including the
pruning of approximately US$6m of revenue, which derived
from low margin customer accounts in North America.
Operating profit before the £8.6m major restructuring
programme charge, was £5.3m, giving a return on sales of
2.1%, compared with £1.8m operating profit and a return on
sales of 0.7% in FY2005.
Year on year the average exchange rate for the US dollar
appreciated by 2.2% against sterling and the Singapore dollar
by 3.7%, with other less significant currencies including the
euro also appreciating against sterling. 
Sales by destination in Asia and South America increased by
8.1% to £77.0m, in North America by 3.2% to £74.0m and in
Europe, excluding the UK, by 2.7% to £64.8m.  Sales in the UK
were down by 10.3% to £34.6m.  
Sales of PowerCord products grew by £7.4m, 6.7%, to
£118.3m but Infocom product sales, reflecting the customer
base rationalisation in North America and some pricing
pressures particularly in Europe, fell by £5.0m, 4.8%, to
£99.4m.  Wiring Harness sales grew by £3.4m, 11.8%, to
£32.7m.  Operating profits for each division were impacted by
the restructuring programme with most of the restructuring
charge in FY2006 affecting the Infocom division, compared with
FY2005 where most of the charge related to the PowerCord
division.
A comparison of Group sales by source or manufacturing
location, based on net sales showed a year on year growth in
Asia of £8.8m, 9.7%, to £98.8m, accounting for 39.4% of the
Group’s output (2005: 36.8%).  North America’s net output
increased by £0.8m, 1.1%, in sterling terms to £75.6m over the
previous year and represented 30.2% of Group’s total output
(2005: 30.6%).  Sales sourced from Europe (excluding the UK)
fell by £7.6m, 14.8%, to £43.3m and accounted for 17.3% of
the Group’s net output (2005: 20.8%).  UK sourced sales
increased by £3.8m, 13.0%, to £32.7m, 13.1% of the Group’s
net output (2005: 11.8%).  
Gross profit increased by £3.6m to £39.1m and the gross
margin to 15.6% compared with 14.5% in the previous year.
The impact of raw material prices, in particular copper,
continued to affect the Group but the restructuring programme,
some sales price increases and the ongoing cost reduction
programmes including procurement and value added
engineering programmes contributed to the increase in margin. 
The Group recorded an operating profit (before the £8.6m
major restructuring programme charge) for the year of £5.3m
(2005: £1.8m).  The translation of foreign currency operating
profits into sterling had a positive impact of £0.6m.  
Major restructuring programme
As indicated in the Chairman’s statement in the Interim Report,
we have accelerated the restructuring programme in the latter
part of the year.  The charge taken at the half year of £1.8m
was in respect of the downsizing of the Kanata site and some
“As a result of the equity raising and the
new three year banking facilities, the
Group’s financial position has been very
significantly strengthened and enhanced.”
Derek Walter Group Finance Director
“The major financial event in FY2006 has
been the raising of new equity which has
funded the implementation of the strategy,
most notably to date the realignment of the
manufacturing footprint of the Group.” Finance Director’s Review (continued)
14
global management reduction.  A further charge of £6.8m was
taken in the second half of the year in respect of the closures
either already implemented by the year end (Fremont,
Aguascalientes and Thailand), or already announced and to be
implemented in FY2007 (Clinton and Stoke-on-Trent, the
consolidation of business from Butts Mill, Leigh, onto an
adjacent site and the downsizing of the Hermosillo factory).
The £8.6m charge for the year comprised £3.9m in respect of
severance and relocation costs spent or to be spent, £3.1m in
respect of property lease provisions and £1.9m in respect of
asset write-offs and other non-cash items less a £0.3m credit in
respect of the settlement of the insurance claim in respect of
the September 2004 fire at Tijuana.
The operating loss after debiting the £8.6m major restructuring
programme charge (2005: £6.8m) was a loss of £3.3m (2005:
loss £5.0m).  
Interest
Finance charges were £3.5m compared with £4.3m in the
previous year, reflecting the lower debt levels following the
equity raising. Higher Libor rates and stronger exchange rates
added £0.2m to the charge in FY2006.  Refinancing and
amortisation of debt interest costs were £0.7m compared with
£0.9m and the interest charge of £2.8m included interest on
the pension deficit and interest on the restructuring provisions,
which combined totalled £0.3m.  
Taxation
Despite an overall Group loss before tax, there was a tax
charge of £2.4m (2005: £4.4m).  This charge related to taxes
paid in countries where taxable profits were made and also
included a charge of £0.6m in respect of prior years’ taxes,
mainly comprising withholding tax in Brazil. 
Earnings and earnings per share (“EPS”)
The basic loss after tax was £9.1m (2005: loss £13.7m) and
the basic loss per share for FY2006 of 18.5p compares with a
loss of 46.2p in the prior year.  The adjusted loss (arrived at
after adding back the charge for the major restructuring
programme of £8.6m) was a loss of £0.5m and in EPS terms
shows an improvement from a loss of 23.4p in FY2005 to a
loss of 1.0p per share.  The earnings figures are distorted by
the higher than normal tax charge, as referred to above, and
adding back £0.6m in respect of the prior years’ tax charge,
the adjusted earnings would have been positive in FY2006. 
Excluding the major restructuring programme Volex made pre-
tax profits of £2.2m in the second half of the year and 2.3p
earnings per share, compared with a £0.2m loss in the first half
of the year and 3.3p loss per share.   
Net assets
Net assets increased, as a result of the equity raising, from
£15.1m to £26.1m at 2 April 2006.  A share premium
cancellation exercise was approved by the High Court in
October 2005 whereby the share premium account was
applied to reduce the deficit on distributable reserves.
Other significant balance sheet changes
Apart from the increase in equity and reduction in debt levels,
which together with the funds flow is discussed below, the
other significant change in the balance sheet in the year
requiring explanation was the increase in the level of provisions.
The long-term provisions have increased from £3.0m to £5.0m
and the short-term provisions have increased from £0.6m to
£4.0m.
Onerous lease provisions were set up in the previous year in
respect of two sites. As a result of the restructuring programme,
onerous lease provisions have been established in FY2006 for a
further four sites.  The short-term provisions of £4.0m relate to
the severance and other relocation costs that are expected to
be paid in the current fiscal year as well as the current year’s
lease payments in respect of the sites where onerous lease
provisions have been accrued. 
Funds flow and borrowings
Cash generated by operations was £11.7m, net of £1.5m
restructuring payments, compared with £1.6m in the previous
year.  The increased inflow arose from improvements in working
capital of £7.4m - a £4.6m inflow in FY2006 compared with a
£2.8m outflow in the previous year - as well as from improved
profits.  Net interest payments fell to £2.5m against £3.8m in
the previous year but taxation payments at £4.4m were £2.2m
higher mainly due to £1.9m spent on prior year tax issues
arising in Brazil and Hong Kong.  Capital expenditure on fixed
assets was £2.5m (including £0.1m of finance leases),
compared with £2.2m in FY2005.  New equity raised £17.6m
net of expenses and with the strengthening of the currencies
there was an adverse foreign exchange impact of £2.3m in the
year on the net debt.  Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 15
As a result of the above movements, net debt fell by £17.2m
from £30.5m at the start of the year to £13.3m, resulting in a
year end gearing level of net borrowings to shareholders’ funds
of 51% (2005: 202%).  The net debt at 2 April 2006 included
£2.1m (2005: £nil) of unamortised financing costs.
Banking facilities
In conjunction with the equity raising, the Group entered into a
new three year banking facilities agreement on 30 June 2005
with its principal bankers.  The total costs incurred in FY2006 in
the renegotiation of the Group’s facilities amounted to £2.5m
and are being amortised over the life of the facilities within the
finance costs.
Treasury
The Group has a central treasury function, which monitors and
updates treasury controls throughout the Group in line with
Board policies. Subject to these controls, day-to-day foreign
exchange transactions are dealt with at the operating unit level
with the Group’s foreign exchange policy being generally to
hedge material transaction exposures. 
The Group regularly reviews its asset risk management strategy
and through internal financial controls and the use of
appropriate risk limitation instruments, principally insurance
policies, considers it has adequate financial protection against
potentially significant operating risks.
The Group holds or issues financial instruments for three main
purposes: to finance its operations; to manage the interest rate
and currency risks arising from its operations and from its
sources of finance; and for trading purposes. In addition,
various financial exposures – for example, trade receivables,
trade payables, accruals and prepayments – arise directly from
the Group’s operations.
The Group finances its operations by a mixture of retained
profits and bank borrowings. During the year the Group has
entered into new facilities which continue to allow the Group to
borrow in a range of currencies. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are
interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.  The
Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these
risks and they are summarised below. These policies have
remained unchanged during the year.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to borrow in currencies at both fixed and
floating rates of interest so as to generate the desired interest
profile and to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate
fluctuations. The Group’s policy is to keep its medium term
borrowings at rates of interest fixed for up to 6 month periods.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between
continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of
borrowings with a range of maturities. The Group’s new three-
year revolving bank facilities, which include an overdraft and
revolving facilities, provide this flexibility.
Currency risk
Although the Group is headquartered in the UK, it has a
significant investment in operations in China, Singapore, USA,
Mexico, Canada, Ireland, Brazil, Croatia and Poland.  As a
result, the Group’s sterling balance sheet can be significantly
affected by movements in exchange rates between sterling and
the currencies of these countries.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these structural
currency exposures by borrowing in the same currencies as the
operating (or “functional”) currencies of its main operating units.
In managing its structural currency exposures, the Group’s
objectives are to maintain a low cost of borrowings whilst
hedging against currency movements.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.  Such
exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in
currencies other than the unit’s functional currency. The Group’s
policy is that all its operating units use forward currency
contracts to eliminate the currency exposure on any significant
receivables and payables balances.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Presentation of financial statements
Volex Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985 and listed on the London Stock
Exchange.  The address of the registered office is given on page 77.  The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal
activities are set out in the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s and Finance Director’s Reviews on pages 6 to 15.
The Group prepares its accounts for the period ending on the Sunday following the Friday which falls closest to the accounting
reference date of 31 March each year.
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.  These policies have
been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.  The financial statements have been prepared on the
historical cost basis.
Adoption of International Financial Reporting and Accounting Standards (‘IFRS’)
Until 3 April 2005, Volex Group plc’s Group and Company financial statements were prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’).  This is the first set of consolidated and Company financial statements
prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted for use in the European Union (‘EU’).
The financial information presented on pages 17 to 53 has been prepared based on the adoption of IFRS, including International
Accounting Standards (‘IAS’) and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and the
International Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) of the IASB, as interpreted by any regulatory bodies relevant to the
Group.
First time adoption of IFRS
For the 52 weeks ended 2 April 2006 the Company and the Group have applied the principles set out in IFRS 1, ‘First-time
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ (‘IFRS 1’).  IFRS 1 sets out the procedures that must be followed when
adopting IFRS for the first time as the basis for preparing the Group’s and the Company’s financial statements.  It is necessary to
establish IFRS accounting policies and, in general, apply these retrospectively to determine the opening balance sheet at the date
of transition, 5 April 2004.  IFRS provides a number of optional exemptions to this general principle.  The most significant of these
are set out below, together with a description, in each case, of the exemption adopted.
• Business combinations
The accounting for business combinations completed prior to the date of transition has not been restated.
• Property, plant and equipment
Previous revaluations for certain properties have been treated as ‘deemed cost’ on the date of transition.
• Employee benefits
All cumulative actuarial gains and losses with respect to the defined benefit pension plans have been recognised in
shareholders’ equity at the date of transition.
• Financial instruments
IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation’ (‘IAS 32’) and IAS 39, ‘Financial instruments: recognition and
measurement’ (‘IAS 39’) have been adopted from 4 April 2005.  The comparative information in respect of financial
instruments is presented in accordance with UK GAAP .
• Share based payments
IFRS 2, ‘Share-based payments’ (‘IFRS 2’) has been applied to all share based awards and options granted post 7
November 2002 and not vested at 1 January 2005.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 35.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Volex Group plc incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entities
which it controls (its subsidiaries) and are drawn up to the relevant period end date. Control is achieved where the Company has
the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to be able to obtain benefits from its activities.
The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.  On acquisition, the assets and
liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.  Any excess of the
cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.  If the cost of acquisition is
less than the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.

Notes to the Financial Statements
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Basis of consolidation (continued)
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into
line with those used by the Group.
On consolidation, all intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated.
Investment in subsidiary undertakings
In the Company balance sheet, investments in subsidiary undertakings are recorded at cost less provision for impairment.
For those investments in subsidiaries acquired by the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by
reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued.
Foreign currency translation
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’).  The consolidated financial statements are
presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
Transactions in a foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of transaction.  Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at
that date.  Gains and losses arising on translation are included in the income statement.
The results of operations that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated at the
average rate of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the date of the balance sheet.
Exchange differences arising on translation are taken directly to a separate component of equity, the translation reserve.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities and borrowings
designated as hedges of such investments are taken to a separate component of equity, the translation reserve.  The gain or
loss relating to any ineffective portion of a net investment hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group has adopted Amendment to IAS 21, ‘The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates - net investment in a
foreign operation’, such that exchange gains and losses arising on loans between Group entities that are not expected to be
repaid in the foreseeable future and that are not in the functional currency of either party to the loan are recognised in the
translation reserve.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from third parties for goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.  Revenue from the sale of
goods is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred tax charges.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.  Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.  The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.  Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.  Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the
temporary differences arise from goodwill.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on retained earnings in subsidiaries and
associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is
realised.  Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited
directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves. 22
Notes to the Financial Statements
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings comprise factories, warehouses and offices.  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.  Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and
equipment, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a
straight-line basis over the expected useful life, as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings up to 50 years
Plant and machinery up to 10 years
Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the fixed asset might not be recoverable.  An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount
if the asset’s carrying amount exceeds the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and value in use.  Any impairment charge is
recorded in the income statement.
A gain or loss on disposal is determined by comparing the proceeds with the asset’s carrying amount and is recognised in
the income statement.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases and similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to
owned assets, are capitalised as property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and
their useful economic life.  The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest
elements are charged to the income statement over the period of the lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the
balance of the capital repayments outstanding. 
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if payments are not made on
such a basis. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses, represents an excess of the cost of acquisition over the
fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired at the date of acquisition and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment
losses. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable
amount if the asset’s carrying amount exceeds the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and value in use.  The gain
or loss on the disposal of an entity includes the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 1998 and earlier periods has been written off to reserves and
has not been reinstated in the balance sheet and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and use specific software.
These costs are included in the balance sheet within intangible assets and are amortised over their estimated useful lives, not
exceeding three years.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  Cost includes materials, direct labour and an attributable
proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling
price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and
defective items where appropriate.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by an appropriate allowance for
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value. Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 23
Notes to the Financial Statements
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  Direct issue
costs are amortised and recognised as a finance cost over the term of the borrowings.
Provisions
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of
past events, when it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and when the
amount has been reliably estimated.  Restructuring provisions comprise largely property, employee termination and relocation
costs.  Property provisions represent the anticipated net costs of onerous leases and are set up for payment of annual rental
costs on empty properties and to meet shortfalls on sub-tenanted properties. Provisions are not recognised for future
operating losses.
Retirement benefits
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. 
For defined benefit schemes, the retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value
of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets.  The cost of providing benefits is determined using the
Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.  Actuarial gains and
losses are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense in full in the period in which they occur.  As the
defined benefit schemes are now closed, no service cost is incurred.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the income statement in the period is the amount of contributions
payable in the period.  Difference between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown
either in accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Share based payments
The requirements of IFRS 2 have been applied, in accordance with the transitional provisions, to all grants of equity
instruments made after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.  Equity settled share based payments are
issued to certain employees and are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the date of grant
of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, based on the estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest.  Cash-settled share based payments are
measured at the fair value at the balance sheet date and the movement in this liability is recorded in the income statement.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model.
Major restructuring programme costs
These items are deemed to be non-recurring by virtue of their nature and size.  They are included under the statutory
classification appropriate to their nature but are separately disclosed on the face of the income statement to assist in
understanding the financial performance of the Group and the Company.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new share or options are
shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax. Non-equity share capital is classified in non-current liabilities.
Critical judgements and estimates in applying the accounting policies
In the process of applying the accounting policies described above, management has made the following judgements and
estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Major restructuring programme costs and restructuring provisions
As at 2 April 2006, the Group had restructuring provisions of £8.5 million arising as a result of the major restructuring
programme being undertaken. These provisions include amounts relating to onerous leases, termination and relocation costs.
The initial determination of the size of these provisions and the subsequent timing and amounts of the expenditure in relation
to these provisions, is inherently difficult to estimate and is based on best management judgement at the time. The
provisions are regularly reviewed in the light of the most current information available.
Taxation
Provisions for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax issues and
exposures. Amounts provided are based on management’s interpretation of country specific tax law. Tax benefits are not
recognised unless the tax positions are probable of being sustained. In arriving at this position, management reviews each
material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit.  24
Notes to the Financial Statements
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Newly issued IFRSs
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been
applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
• IFRS 7, Financial instruments: disclosures; and related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures
• IFRIC 4, Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
• IFRIC 5, Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds
• IFRIC 6, Liabilities from participating in a specific market – waste electrical and electronic equipment
• IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in hyperinflationary economies
• IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2
• IFRIC 9, Reassessment of embedded derivatives
The Directors expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact
on the financial statements except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant Standards
come into effect for periods commencing on or after 3 April 2006.
3. Business and geographical segments

During the year, as part of the Group’s major restructuring programme, the Global management team has been restructured.
The Group’s global manufacturing footprint has been changed, with additional provisions being recorded against four
properties. Impairment charges have been recorded against property, plant and equipment at these properties.
Settlement of the insurance claim relating to the Tijuana fire was finalised in January 2006, at a higher level than had been
expected at the previous year end.
In 2005, an impairment charge against goodwill at the Brazilian operation was recorded and impairment charges against an
automated manufacturing line, which was no longer being utilised (£1,223,000) and plant and equipment at sites being
closed (£228,000) were also recorded. 
The taxation effect of the major restructuring programme was £nil (2005: £nil).
Company
During 2006, the Company recorded major restructuring programme costs associated with the Global management restructuring
and the closure of its facilities in Stoke-on-Trent.  In 2005, the impairment charge related to property, plant and equipment
associated with the automated manufacturing line and a property provision was recorded against a vacated property.

12. Dividends
The Directors do not recommend a dividend on the ordinary shares for the year (2005: £nil).
13. Loss per ordinary share
The calculations of the loss per share are based on the following data:
2006 Per share 2005 Per share
£’000 p £’000 p
Basic loss (9,106) (18.5) (13,660) (46.2)
Major restructuring programme costs 8,598 17.5 6,746 22.8
Adjusted loss (508) (1.0) (6,914) (23.4)
No. shares No. shares
Weighted average number of shares 49,247,645 29,540,692
Basic loss represents net loss attributable to equity holders of the Company.
The adjusted loss per share has been calculated on the basis of continuing activities before major restructuring costs, net of
tax.  The Directors consider that this loss per share calculation gives a better understanding of the Group’s loss per share in
the current and prior year.  As the Group recorded a loss per share, the share options are anti-dilutive and therefore there is
no difference between the basic and diluted loss per share.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the business units that are expected to benefit
from that business combination.  After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated
as follows:

Infocom 435 435
1,930 1,930
The Group annually tests goodwill for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions used in the value in
use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, revenue and costs growth rates and the level of capital expenditure
required during the period.  The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recently approved three-year
budgets of the relevant businesses.  The cash flows forecasts reflect the risk associated with each asset.  Cash flows for
years beyond 2009 are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates, which do not exceed the average long-term growth
rates for the relevant markets. Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 31

The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 70 days.  An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable
amounts from the sale of goods. This amounts to £353,000 (2005: £475,000) and £141,000 (2005: £196,000) for the Group
and the Company respectively.  This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.  The Directors
consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables.
Bank and cash balances comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three
months or less.  The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.  The Group has no significant concentration of credit
risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.   Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 35

At 2 April 2006, Group and Company bank loans are recorded net of debt issue costs of £2,061,000 (2005: £nil).
On 30 June 2005, new three-year banking facilities became effective with the Group’s principal Bankers.  These facilities
incorporate a US dollar based revolver facility and a sterling based overdraft facility.  These facilities are secured by fixed and
floating charges over the assets of certain Group companies.  The facilities currently incur interest at a margin of 3.25%
above LIBOR.
At 2 April 2006, the Group had available £15,784,000 (2005: £6,781,000) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities. 
Both the revolver and overdraft arrangements allow drawings in various currencies.  Borrowings can be analysed by currency
as follows:

2005, the denomination of the Company’s bank loans is the same as that for the Group and the overdrafts were denominated
as follows: US dollars £953,000; Canadian dollars £292,000; and euros £1,749,000.
The weighted average interest rate paid was 6.5% (2005: 5.6%).
21. Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group occasionally utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows. The Group can
be party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and options in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group’s principal markets. 
The Group currently designates certain amounts of its foreign currency denominated debt as a hedging instrument for the
purposes of hedging the translation of its foreign operations.
At the balance sheet date no forward foreign exchange contracts were outstanding (2005: none). 36

At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of £30 million (2005: £26 million) available for offset against
future profits.  No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profit
streams.  Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of £14 million (2005: £10 million) that cannot be carried forward
indefinitely.  Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely. 38
Notes to the Financial Statements
22. Deferred tax (continued)
Group (continued)
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of
subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was £55 million (2005: £51 million).  No liability has
been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the
temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Company
The Company has no recognised deferred tax assets or liabilities.  At the balance sheet date, the Company had unused tax
losses of £6 million (2005: £5 million) available for offset against future profits.  No deferred tax asset has been recognised in
respect of these losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain of its plant and machinery under finance leases.  The average lease term is 3 years.
For the current and prior year the average effective borrowing rate was 9%.  Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.  All
leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. The fair
value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.  The Group’s obligations under finance leases are
secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.  The average
credit period taken for trade purchases is 70 days.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates their fair value.

Property provisions represent the anticipated net costs of onerous leases. The provisions have been recorded taking into
account management’s best estimate of the period for which the properties will remain vacant and the level of rental income,
if any, that can be obtained from sub-tenants. This provision will be utilised as the rental payments fall due through 2016.
Other restructuring provisions principally represent employee termination and relocation payments associated with these
items are expected to be paid out in the next financial year.
Other provisions relate to ongoing legal costs.

In addition to the ordinary shares of 25p each, the Company has also authorised and allotted 80,000 (2005: 80,000)
cumulative preference shares of £1 each. At 3 April 2005, these are classified as non-equity share capital; however upon
adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 4 April 2005 these have been reclassified as non-current liabilities.  See notes 21 and 27
for further details. 40
Notes to the Financial Statements
26. Share capital (continued)
On 29 June 2005, an Extraordinary General Meeting approved an increase in the authorised ordinary share capital of the
Company to £18,750,000.  On 30 June 2005, the Company issued 25,850,340 ordinary shares for gross proceeds of £19.0
million.  
During the year 67,500 shares were issued on the exercise of share options for proceeds of £58,725.
At 3 April 2005 there were 494,945 unexercised warrants.  As a consequence of signing the new banking facilities (see note
20), these warrants were amended to include a re-pricing to 73.5p and an extension of the expiry date to June 2008.  As a
result of these changes, the warrants were fair valued utilising the Black-Scholes model and the difference in the fair value
from that previously recorded was debited to debt issue costs (£227,000).  The Group utilised the following inputs into the
valuation model: share price 99.5p; exercise price 73.5p; expected volatility 60%; expected life 2 years; and risk-free rate 4%.
Subsequent to these amendments, 213,996 of the warrants were cancelled and 93,167 were exercised.  At 2 April 2006
187,782 warrants remain unexercised.
27. Preference shares
The Company has in issue 80,000 cumulative preference shares of £1 each with the rights to a fixed cumulative preference
dividend payable, at the rate of 7% per annum, on the amount paid up or credited as paid up thereon on 31 March and 30
September in each year but not to any further participation in the profits of the Company.  The preference shares confer the
right on a winding up to have the capital paid or credited as paid up, including all arrears of dividend whether declared or not
up to the commencement of the winding up, paid in priority to any payment of capital on the ordinary shares but without any
further right to participate in profits or assets.  There is no fixed repayment date.
Since the dividends are in arrears for more than three months, the preference shares currently confer on the holders the right
to have notice and to attend and vote, either in person or by proxy, at any General Meeting. 
As stated in notes 21 and 26, these preference shares have upon adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 been restated as non-
current liabilities, reducing the Company’s and the Group’s net assets on 4 April 2005 by £80,000.

On 12 October 2005 the cancellation of the Company’s share premium account was confirmed by High Court of Justice,
Chancery division.  The balance on that account at that date has been utilised to eliminate the deficit on the Company’s
retained earnings account.
Group retained earnings include non-distributable reserves in subsidiary companies of £2.3 million (2005: £1.1 million).

Expected volatility 60% 75%

Expected volatility was determined with reference to historical volatility of the Group’s share price and FTSE Electronic and
Electrical Equipment Sector index over the previous 30 months.  The expected life used in the model has been adjusted,
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural
considerations.
The Group and Company recognised a total expense of £350,000 and £339,000, respectively, including £228,000 as major
restructuring programme costs (2005: Group and Company £15,000) relating to equity-settled share based payment
transactions in the year. 
Cash-settled share based payments
During the year, the Company issued share appreciation rights ‘SARs’ that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the
SARs at three fixed dates.  At 2 April 2006, the Group has recorded a liability of £242,000 (2005: £nil).  At 2 April 2006, the
fair value of the SARs was determined by using the Black-Scholes model utilising the following assumptions : share price
126.5p exercise price 73.5p; expected volatility 60%; average expected life 1.25 years; and risk free rate 4.4%.  In 2006 the
Group recorded total expense of £242,000 (including £147,000 as major restructuring programme costs) (2005: £nil).  The
total intrinsic value at 2006 was £286,000 (2005: £nil).
32. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Company operates two HM Revenue and Customs approved defined contribution schemes and makes contributions to
a Group pension plan.  Overseas the Group operates two defined contribution schemes, one in the USA and one in Ireland. 
The total cost charged to the Group’s income in the year was £1,507,000 (2005: £1,592,000). The total cost charged to the
Company’s income in the year was £355,000 (2005: £316,000).  
Defined benefit schemes - Group and Company
The Company maintains two HM Revenue and Customs approved defined benefit schemes that are funded by payments
held in independent trusts.  Future accrual of retirement benefits under both schemes ceased on 31 March 2003 when the
schemes were replaced with defined contribution arrangements. The last full actuarial valuation of the schemes was carried
out by a qualified independent actuary in August 2004. This valuation has been updated on an approximate basis to 2 April
2006 and utilises the projected unit valuation method.   44

Expected long-term rates of return
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of
expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of risk premium associated with
the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.  The
expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term
rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.
The expected long-term rates of return are as follows:

The Mexican government has issued a claim against Volex de Mexico, a subsidiary company, for 22 million pesos (approximately
£1 million) alleging misstatements on customs returns for fiscal years 2000 and 2001.  The Directors have instructed legal counsel
to file a response on the company’s behalf strongly rebutting such allegations and requesting that the case be dismissed.
The Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other Group companies.  The
Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such
time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.   46

35. Explanation of transition to IFRS
This is the first year that the Group and Company has presented its financial statements under IFRS.  The following
disclosures are required in the year of transition.  The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 3
April 2005 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 5 April 2004.
Reconciliations from UK GAAP to IFRS of the Group and Company balance sheets as at 5 April 2004 and 3 April 2005
together with the Group and Company income statement for the year ended 3 April 2005 are presented below.  The changes
can be summarised as follows:

As restated under IFRS (13,660) 15,125 28,991
(a) Intangible assets
IFRS requires certain computer software assets to be shown separately as intangible fixed assets.  Under UK GAAP such
items were previously classified as property, plant and equipment.
(b) Retirement benefit obligations
The Group has applied the requirements of IAS 19, Employee Benefits (revised 2004), to its closed defined benefit
schemes.  The net deficit of the scheme assets, which are recorded at fair value, less the obligations, which are measured
at discounted present value, has been shown on the balance sheet and the movement thereon has been reflected in the
statement of recognised income and expense. 
The financing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Since the schemes are
closed no service cost is required to be recognised at the operating profit level.  Interest costs of £142,000 have been
recognised in the year to 3 April 2005 whilst UK GAAP service costs of £255,000 have been removed. Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 47
Notes to the Financial Statements
35. Explanation of transition to IFRS (continued)
(b) Retirement benefit obligations (continued)
Adjustments to liabilities to recognise the IFRS net pension deficit are calculated as follows:       
UK GAAP IFRS Net
Accruals Provisions Total Provisions Difference
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Pension liabilities at:
5 April 2004 88 - 88 3,628 3,540
3 April 2005 - 181 181 4,095 3,914
(c) Effect of changes in foreign exchange rates
Under IFRS, exchange differences arising on consolidation, when translating the net assets of overseas subsidiaries, are
required to be recognised as a separate equity reserve. The Group has adopted the transitional provision of IFRS 1, which
allows cumulative translation differences to be deemed as zero at the date of transition to IFRS.  On transition at 5 April
2004, £4,032,000 and £6,041,000 have been credited to Group’s and the Company’s translation reserve, respectively, and
debited to the profit and loss account.
(d) Goodwill
UK GAAP required that goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses was amortised over
its useful economic life. Under IFRS an amortisation charge is not made. Hence the UK GAAP amortisation charge in the
52 weeks to 3 April 2005 of £302,000 has been reversed thus increasing IFRS profit by this amount. As a result of
reversing the amortisation charges, the impairment charge recorded in 2005 financial year, with respect to the Group’s
Brazilian operations is increased under IFRS by £132,000, which was the UK GAAP amortisation charge recorded post 5
April 2004 but prior to the impairment being recognised.
(e) Share based payments
In accordance with the transitional rules of IFRS 1, IFRS 2, has been applied to share options granted after 7 November
2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
A cumulative expense of £33,000 has been recognised in the transition balance sheet at 5 April 2004. For the 52 weeks to
3 April 2005 additional costs of £15,000 have been recorded.
(f) Presentation of financial statements
In a number of circumstances, IFRS requires a different presentation of items in the financial statements compared with
UK GAAP .  These requirements for the balance sheet include deferred tax assets to be shown as non-current assets and
for provisions to be split between current and non-current.  From an income statement perspective, IFRS does not require
the profit or loss on sale of fixed assets to be disclosed separately on the face of the statement.
(g) Exchange gains and losses (Company only) 
Under UK GAAP , investments in Group undertakings that were denominated in a foreign currency were restated at each
year end based on year end exchange rates. This movement was taken to the translation reserve.  Under IFRS,
investments are stated at cost and are not restated at each period end to reflect current exchange rates.  At 5 April 2004
and 3 April 2005 investments have been increased by £1,040,000 and £892,000, respectively, to remove the foreign
exchange losses recorded since the date of the investment.
Under UK GAAP within the Company’s financial statement, hedging of overseas net investment and external foreign
currency borrowing was possible such that where hedging was achieved exchange movements on the external debt were
taken to the translation reserve.  Under IFRS, hedging of overseas net investments is not applicable at the Company level
and as such in the Company’s financial statements exchange gains and losses recorded on the Company’s external debt
are required to be recorded in the income statement.  Furthermore, under IFRS all exchange gains and losses on Group
balances, including where they relate to balances which are not repayable within the foreseeable future, are recorded in
the Company’s income statement. Under UK GAAP such gains and losses were recorded in the translation reserve.
For the 52 weeks ended 3 April 2005 exchange losses of £563,000 have been recorded in the Company’s IFRS income
statement. 48

Under UK GAAP the cash flow statement reconciles the combined movement in cash and overdrafts.  The IFRS cash flow
statement reconciles movements in cash and cash equivalents only, with movements in overdrafts shown within the financing
section of the statement.
Other cash flow differences between UK GAAP and IFRS are either presentational or movements within classification.  There
is no impact on the final net debt position or the movement in net debt during the periods presented. Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 51

Independent Auditors’ Report to the
Members of Volex Group plc
We have audited the Group and individual Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Volex Group plc for the 52
weeks ended 2 April 2006 which comprise the consolidated and individual company income statements, the consolidated and
individual company balance sheets, the consolidated and individual company cash flow statements, the consolidated and
individual company statements of recognised income and expenses and the related notes 1 to 35. These financial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.  We have also audited the information in the Directors’
remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use in the European Union
are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been
audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with the relevant
financial reporting framework and whether the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as
having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation.   We report to you whether, in our opinion, the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial
statements.  We also report to you if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not complied with any of the four Directors’ remuneration disclosure
requirements specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.  These comprise the amount of each
element in the remuneration package and information on share options, details of long term incentive schemes and money
purchase and defined benefit schemes.  We give a statement, to the extent possible, of details of any non-compliance.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003
FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls or form an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report as described in the contents section including the unaudited part of
the Directors’ remuneration report and we consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes an assessment of
the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
remuneration report described as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited. Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 55
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Volex Group plc
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union, of the
state of the Group’s and the individual Company's affairs as at 2 April 2006 and of the Group’s loss and the individual
Company’s profit for the 52 weeks then ended; 
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs 
As explained in note 2 to the financial statements, the Group and Company, in addition to complying with their legal obligation to
comply with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union, have also complied with the IFRSs as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board.  Accordingly, in our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs,
of the state of the Group’s and Company’s affairs as at 2 April 2006 and of the Group’s loss and the Company’s profit for the year
then ended.

Corporate Governance Report
The Board is responsible for the governance of the Company, governance being the systems and procedures by which the Company
is directed and controlled.  It is recognised that a presented set of rules does not itself determine good governance or stewardship of a
Company and the Directors believe that in fulfilling their responsibilities, they govern the Company in the best interests of the
shareholders, whilst having regard to the interests of other stakeholders of the Company.
Throughout the reporting period ended 2 April 2006 there have been a number of changes to the composition of the Board, which
have been made in response to changing business needs and the implementation of the restructuring and growth programmes.  The
Board has continued to try to ensure that, where possible, its procedures achieve compliance with the provisions of Section 1 of the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance, issued by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 ("FRC Combined Code").
Statement of Compliance with the Code of Best Practice
In the opinion of the Directors the Company has complied with the provisions of Section 1 of the FRC Combined Code throughout the
financial year ended 2 April 2006 (the "Year") and up to the date of reporting except for the following matters. These have arisen as a
result of the changes to the Board discussed above.
The former Chairman, Mr Molloy, was a member of the Remuneration Committee although he was not independent in terms of the
FRC Combined Code (sections A.3.1 and B.2.1), in view of his previous employment as Chief Executive of the Group.   All the other
members of the Remuneration Committee during the Year were independent. Following the appointment of Mr Arkle as Chairman,
there is now only one independent non-executive Director on the Board (section A.3.2) and consequently neither the Nominations
Committee, Remuneration Committee nor the Audit Committee have the required number of independent non-executive directors as
recommended by sections A.4.1, B.2.1 and C.3.1 respectively.  The composition of the Board and its Committees will be reviewed
during the current financial year with a view to complying with these requirements.  As at the date of reporting, the roles of Chairman
and Chief Executive are performed by separate individuals, Mr Chae having been appointed Group Chief Executive on 5 May 2006 and
Mr Arkle having been appointed Chairman on 6 May 2006.  However, prior to these appointments, Mr May held the role of Executive
Chairman following the resignation of Mr Corcoran as Group Chief Executive on 29 November 2005 and accordingly, there was no
division of responsibilities between the role of Chairman and Chief Executive for a period of five months (section A.2.1).  This situation
was only intended to be on an interim basis until such time as a new Chief Executive Officer was found.  Due to the number of changes
to the Board composition during the Year a view was taken that it was not appropriate to undertake a performance evaluation of the
Board, its Committees or the individual Directors during the Year (section A.6.1).   Performance reviews will be resumed in financial year
2006/2007.
The Board and its Committees
The Board currently comprises a non-executive Chairman and three non-executive Directors, one of which is independent, together
with two executive Directors.  The biographies of the Directors can be found on page 16.  The Board views the size of the Board to be
satisfactory in that the balance of skills and experience is appropriate for the business of the Company.  
Changes to the Board during the year can be summarised as follows:
20 April 2005 Mr RM Arkle appointed as a non-executive Director
30 June 2005 Mr DJ Molloy resigned as Chairman
30 June 2005 Mr DMM Beever appointed interim Chairman
30 June 2005 Mr HR Chae appointed as an executive Director in the capacity of Chief Operating Officer
30 June 2005 Mr C Mullett appointed as a non-executive Director 
8 September 2005 Mr MK May appointed Chairman 
8 September 2005 Mr JE Roberts resigned as a non-executive Director
21 September 2005 Mr D Payzant resigned as an executive Director
14 October 2005 Mr M Ashcroft resigned as Company Secretary
14 October 2005 Ms W Tate appointed Company Secretary
25 October 2005 Mr M Ashcroft resigned as an executive Director
29 November 2005 Mr J Corcoran resigned as Group Chief Executive
29 November 2005 Mr MK May appointed Executive Chairman
5 May 2006 Mr HR Chae appointed Group Chief Executive
5 May 2006 Mr MK May resigned as Chairman
6 May 2006 Mr RM Arkle appointed Chairman
6 May 2006 Mr D Goulandris appointed as a non-executive Director
On 5 May 2006, Mr Walter tendered his resignation with due notice. There have been no other changes to the constitution of the Board
either during the Year or since the end of the Year. Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 57
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
On 30 June 2005, Mr Mullett was appointed as a non-executive Director of the Board.  At that time the Company also entered into a
consultancy services agreement with Mr Mullett’s company, Branison Group LLC, to provide services relating to specific designated
projects. Accordingly, Mr Mullett would not be viewed as independent within the meaning of the FRC Combined Code due to the fact
that he has a material business relationship with the Company.  The Company has recently given notice to terminate such services. 
On 6 May 2006, Mr Goulandris was appointed as a non-executive Director of the Board. Mr Goulandris is a partner of Cycladic Capital
LLP , which is a major shareholder in the Company, and accordingly he has a material interest in the Company and is not therefore
independent within the meaning of the FRC Combined Code.
On appointment, Directors are briefed regarding the activities of the Group and the Chairman and Company Secretary ensure that a
new Director has access to appropriate training or advice in relation to the duties of Directors.
Mr Beever is the senior independent Director who makes himself available to meet with shareholders.
The Board is scheduled to meet at least ten times a year and during the Year met fifteen times. It has a formal list of matters specifically
reserved to it including an overview of the business, all major strategy, policy and investment decisions affecting the Group and
development of Group policies in a number of areas including health and safety and social environmental and ethical issues.  It also
meets, by telephone conference call, to discuss ad hoc issues from time to time.  All Directors attended all Board meetings held during
the Year (either in person or by telephone conference) with the exception that Mr Beever was unable to attend three meetings, two of
which were called at short notice; Mr Mullett and Mr Roberts were each unable to attend one meeting which was called at short notice
and Mr Chae was unable to attend one meeting. During the Year the Chairman has met with the non-executive Directors without the
executive Directors being present.  The non-executive Directors have also met without the Chairman or the executive Directors being
present. 
The Chairman, the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director are responsible to the Board for the timeliness and quality of
all financial information submitted to the Board.  The Company Secretary is responsible for the timeliness and quality of all other
information submitted to the Board and for advising the Board through the Chairman on governance issues.  The normal procedure is
to distribute Board papers one week in advance of meetings.  The Chairman is primarily responsible for ensuring the Board has
adequate information provided to it before making decisions.  The Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary and the Board has adopted a policy under which the Directors are able to take independent advice at the Company’s
expense.
Directors are subject to re-election at the next Annual General Meeting following the initial date of appointment and then at least every 3
years.  In addition, a Director is required to vacate his office at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting commencing next after he
attains the age of 70.  As disclosed in the Directors’ report, Mr Beever (being 3 years since his last re-appointment) and Mr Goulandris
(having been appointed since the last Annual General Meeting) are offering themselves for re-election and election respectively at the
2006 Annual General Meeting.  In accordance with the FRC Combined Code, the Board recommends the re-appointment and
appointment of the Directors on the basis that they each bring business experience and expertise to the Board, which enhances the
Board’s ability to respond flexibly and promptly to the needs of the Company.  
Board Committees
The Board has appointed an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nominations Committee.  Each Committee has
adopted written terms of reference dealing clearly with the Committee’s authority and duties and which are available on request and
can be found on the Company’s website (www.volex.com).
The Audit Committee consists of Mr Beever, an independent non-executive Director and the Chairman.  Mr Arkle currently chairs the
Committee. Both Mr Arkle and Mr Beever have recent and relevant financial experience.  The Committee monitors the integrity of the
financial statements of the Company and any formal announcements in relation to the Company’s financial performance.  It reviews the
Company’s internal financial controls and also reviews the scope and effectiveness of the internal audit function, although the Group’s
internal control risk management processes are considered by the Board as a whole.  The Committee recommends to the Board the
appointment and re-appointment of the external auditors. It considers the scope and results of the external audit and its cost
effectiveness.  Furthermore the Committee monitors the independence and objectivity of the auditors and the nature and extent of non-
audit services supplied by the external auditor by analysing fees for audit and non-audit work; by receiving from and discussing with the
auditors their annual report regarding their independence policies and procedures; and by receiving from the auditors confirmation that
they have complied with APB Ethical Standards. During the Year the Audit Committee met three times and all members of the
Committee were present at each meeting.
The Audit Committee recommends the re-appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors to the Company. 58
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
The Nominations Committee currently consists of Mr Arkle who is the Committee Chairman, Mr Beever who is an independent non-
executive Director and Mr Mullett, a non-executive Director. Throughout the Year the majority of members were independent non-
executive Directors.  Board appointments are discussed initially by the Nominations Committee, which makes recommendations to the
full Board for further consideration and approval. The Nominations Committee takes advice from a variety of sources including external
recruitment consultants where necessary. During the Year, Oxygen, the search consultants, were used for the appointment of Mr Arkle
as a non-executive Director. However, neither external recruitment consultants, nor open advertising were used for the appointments of
Mr Mullett and Mr Goulandris as non-executive Directors or the appointment of Mr May nor Mr Arkle as Chairman, although, the
appointments were made on merit, against an objective criteria and based, where appropriate, on the recommendations of external
third parties and also following discussions with major shareholders.  The Board seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between
executive and non-executive Directors and the composition of the Board will be reviewed again during the current financial year
following consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.  There is an induction process for newly appointed Directors involving
the Chairman, the Company Secretary and the executive Directors, together with visits to the Group’s operations.  The Board also has
a rolling programme of meetings with senior operational management throughout the Group in order to further enhance the
Board’s understanding of key regional developments.  During the year the Nominations Committee met three times and all
members of the Committee were present at each meeting.
The structure and business of the Remuneration Committee are summarised in the Directors’ remuneration report on page 62.
In addition, the Board has established a number of other committees, such as the Finance Committee and the Sealing Committee
and also establishes ad hoc committees from time to time to deal with specific issues.  All committees have clear terms of
reference specified by the Board and the Secretary records the minutes.  
Directors and Officers insurance against legal action is in place providing cover for Directors and Officials of the Company and its
subsidiaries.  In addition, following the changes to the Companies Act 1985 (section 309C), the Company has granted indemnities
to the executive and non-executive Directors. Copies of the indemnities will be available for inspection at the Annual General
Meeting.
Internal controls
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.  It must be
understood, however that such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has applied principle C.2 of the FRC Combined Code by establishing a continuous process of identifying, evaluating
and managing the significant operational, management and financial risks faced by the Group which accords with the guidance on
internal control published in September 1999 (the Turnbull Guidance).  The Board regularly reviews the process, which has been in
place throughout the financial year and up until the date of approval of this report.  The process is built around the established
management systems of the Group and is reviewed on a regular basis.  In the third quarter of each financial year the Senior
Executive Committee (comprising the executive Directors and senior operational and corporate managers) carries out an exercise
to identify the significant risks currently faced by the business.  Each operating unit then evaluates the potential financial impact of
the risk and sets out the preventative and mitigating actions it will implement. The results are reviewed by the Board. The risks and
actions are monitored through the monthly accounts process and a full update at the half year.
In addition to this process, the policy regarding insurance of risk is a matter reserved to the Board; the Audit Committee monitors
financial control and risk in conjunction with both the internal audit function and external auditors; and the Group finance
department monitors and develops internal financial control systems throughout the Group.
The Board receives with the monthly management accounts a monthly management report covering each of the Group’s
operations and the consolidated results.  The Board also receives following the end of each quarter, commentary on the identified
risks and the internal control processes dealing with those risks.  This is considered by the Board each quarter.  The Board
considers this process satisfies the requirements set out in the Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code.
Whistle-blowing policy
The Company has adopted a whistle-blowing policy, which has been made available to employees on the Company’s website and
on site notice boards.  The aim of the policy is to encourage all employees, regardless of seniority, to bring matters which cause
them concern to the attention of the Board. Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 59
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
Relations with shareholders
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional shareholders by
making annual and half-year presentations to institutional investors and stockbroking analysts, meeting existing and potential
institutional shareholders and organising occasional factory tours.  Individual shareholders have the opportunity to discuss issues
with the Directors on an informal basis at the time of the Annual General Meeting and are welcome to communicate with any
Director at any time during the year.  It is the Company’s policy that all Directors attend the Annual General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements. The Directors have chosen to prepare
accounts for the Company and the Group in accordance IFRS. Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial
statements in accordance with IFRS, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial
statements’ requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, financial
performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International
Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all
circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial
performance.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the accounts.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a Directors’ report that complies with the requirements of the Companies
Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions. 60
Social, Ethical and Environmental Report
The Board has adopted a Statement of Social, Ethical and Environmental Policy (the Policy Statement) which applies to the entire
Volex Group of companies. It is circulated through the unit Managing Directors to all employees via the normal regional
communication channels and is available on the Company’s web site www.volex.com and in hard copy from the Secretary.
Volex is committed to:
• respecting the rule of law, conducting our business with integrity and showing respect for the rights of the
individual; 
• creating mutual advantage in all our relationships so that people both inside and outside the Group trust us and
want to work with us;
• demonstrating respect for the environment and working continuously to improve business processes and
practices to reduce the impact of our operations; and
• managing our financial performance to maximise long-term value for our shareholders.
This policy statement is the foundation on which we build and conduct our business and we expect all Volex employees to
support all elements of the policy.
The Policy Statement is based on the commitments set out above and outlines specific minimum standards in respect of five
particular areas. These deal with corporate conduct regarding our employees; health and safety; the environment; relationships
with various stakeholder groups; and the personal conduct of everyone employed by the Group. The Policy Statement concludes
with the outline of a compliance process, which reflects our normal management structures.
Corporate conduct and employment practices
In all aspects of our business we seek to operate in compliance with the law, rules and regulations of the country of operation and
this applies to all areas of our Policy Statement. However, in a number of areas we look to establish specific minimum standards,
which will override any lower legal requirements. For example, in our employment practices we will not use indentured or forced
labour, we will not employ anyone below 16 years old and we do not discriminate on the basis of sex, colour, race, religious belief,
disability, sexual orientation or marital status.
Health and safety
In matters of health and safety we will provide a safe and clean working environment with systems and procedures of a standard
at least equivalent to those of comparable manufacturing companies of good reputation in the geographical area of operation. 
The Board receives reports on health and safety performance throughout the Group. Our regional operations have adopted formal
health and safety policy statements and are implementing specific health and safety programmes to improve identified risks. We
collect and review various performance data ranging from monthly key performance indicators to annual insurance claims records
and use these to identify areas for further improvement.
Environment
We are committed to meeting the needs of our customers in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner through
continuous improvement in all activities, using the best available technology not entailing excessive cost. 
At Volex we work towards the requirements stated in the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System. As part of this system
we review our environmental objectives and targets on a regular basis and ensure continuous improvement. Our plan is to achieve
the international environmental standard ISO 14001 in all our manufacturing locations over a number of years. At the date of this
report, certification has been achieved at each of our 3 facilities in China, at our 2 facilities in Indonesia, at facilities in Vietnam,
Croatia, Poland, Ireland and at 3 facilities in the UK. These sites are now maintaining and improving their environmental
management systems to retain their ISO 14001 certification status. A number of other locations are developing their systems with
a view to applying for certification in the future.
In the electronics industry the production of environmentally friendly products has become increasingly important with the
forthcoming implementation of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive on 1 July 2006 and the future
implementation of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive. Both of these directives are aimed at reducing
the hazardous materials content in electronic products as well as increasing the recycling of these products. In preparation for
complying with RoHS, Volex initiated a management project working with its customers and its extensive supply base to   Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 61
Social, Ethical and Environmental Report (continued)
ensure that, as a minimum, it conformed with legislative requirements.  In addition, the design of our products is aimed at reducing
their environmental impacts in terms of production, product usage and disposal, which will assist producers in their compliance
with the WEEE directive either prior to or upon implementation. 
Relationships with stakeholder groups
The standards we set ourselves in our relationships with our various groups of stakeholders are typified by the values of honesty,
respect, integrity, diligence and professionalism. These values are the common thread linking our communications with
shareholders, our business relationships with customers, suppliers, sub-contractors and agents, our interaction with local
communities around the world and all our dealings with employees.
Standards of personal conduct
The Group relies on its employees as individuals to practise the highest moral and ethical standards in all their business activities.
While we fully respect the privacy of employees’ personal lives, we expect all employees to conduct their personal affairs so that
the performance of their obligations to the Group is not prejudiced and the reputation of the Group is maintained.  Strict
adherence to the Policy Statement is a condition of employment in the Group. 62
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 (the “Act”).  The report also meets the
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the FRC Combined Code.  A resolution to
approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be
approved.
Schedule 7A to the Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on the "auditable part" of the Directors’
remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the
requirements under the Act.  The report has therefore been divided into separate sections, for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a well-established part of the Company’s governance structures.  On 2 April 2006 the members
of the Committee were Mr Beever and Mr Arkle and the Remuneration Committee was constituted in accordance with the
recommendations of the FRC Combined Code.  During the year Mr Molloy and Mr Roberts were also Committee members until
resigning as Directors on 30 June and 8 September 2005 respectively and during that time the constitution of the Remuneration
Comittee had not been in compliance with the FRC Combined Code in view of the fact  Mr Molloy was not an independent non-
executive Director as he was previously employed as Group Chief Executive (section A.3.1 and B.2.1).  Following the appointment
of Mr Arkle as Company Chairman, Mr Beever is now the only independent non-executive Director of the Remuneration
Committee and as such the constitution does not comply with section B.2.1 of the FRC Combined Code.  The composition of the
Board of Directors and the Remuneration Comittee will be reviewed during the Financial Year 2006/07 with a view to fulfiling
compliance. Mr Beever chairs the Committee and the Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.  During the year
the Remuneration Committee met seven times and all members of the Committee were present at each meeting with the
exception that Mr Beever was unable to attend one meeting.
None of the Committee members have any personal financial interest or conflicts of interests arising from cross-Directorships or
day-to-day involvement in running the business and no Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee agrees with the Board of Directors of the Company the broad policy for the remuneration of the
executive Directors and those other senior executives of the Group reporting directly to the Chief Executive (together the "Senior
Executive Team").  In the context of that broad policy the Remuneration Committee then determines and reviews, at least annually,
the specific remuneration packages of each of the Senior Executive Team.  In addition, the Remuneration Committee approves the
terms of all service agreements for the Senior Executive Team and determines the grant of all discretionary share options within
the Group.
During the year New Bridge Street Consultants LLP provided advice and services to the Remuneration Committee. In determining
the executive Directors’ remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee used a benchmarking report produced by New
Bridge Street Consultants LLP which showed market comparatives and acted to achieve median levels of remuneration.
Ordinarily, it would be the Remuneration Comittee which would determine the Chairman’s fees; however, given the circumstances,
Mr Arkle’s fees were reviewed by Mr Beever who consulted with the Group Chief Executive and New Bridge Street Consultants LLP .
The balance of this Report deals solely with the remuneration and terms of service of the Board of Directors of the Company.
Remuneration policy
The policy of the Remuneration Committee in relation to the executive Directors is to maintain remuneration packages sufficient to
attract, retain and motivate executives of the calibre and experience necessary to provide a successful future for the Group. 
The Remuneration Comittee also determines and reviews, at least annually, on behalf of the Board the level of fees payable to the
Chairman.
The objective is to provide a balanced remuneration package, which includes an appropriate level of basic salary and benefits in
kind (including pension provision where appropriate), together with both short-term and long-term incentives.  Short-term
incentives are linked to challenging targets, which support and reinforce the objectives of the Company.  The standard long-term  Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 63
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
incentives, currently being options granted under the Company’s share option schemes, focus the executives on the sustained
development of the Company and align their interests with those of the shareholders.  The remuneration of the non-executive
Directors is determined by the Board of Directors of the Company within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors:
- basic annual salary (including Directors’ fees) and benefits;
- annual bonus payments;
- long-term share related incentives; and
- pension arrangements.
The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performance
related.  
The Remuneration Committee has considered the future provision of long-term share related incentives and has determined that a
long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) would in future be more appropriate than the current share option scheme.  A resolution
proposing the adoption of a LTIP will be put to the 2006 Annual General Meeting and will be detailed in a circular which will be
issued with the Notice of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Basic salary
In deciding and reviewing appropriate remuneration packages, the Remuneration Committee considers:
- the positioning of the Group relative to other companies;
- the positioning of individual Directors relative to positions in other companies;
- remuneration expectations in the geographical area of operation;
- surveys published by leading remuneration consultants supplemented by occasional specific advice and benchmarking
exercises by external consultants and the knowledge and experience of the members of the Remuneration Committee;
- remuneration relativities within the Group;
- the competition, risks, challenges, complexity, diversity and international spread of the Group’s business; and
- the particular expertise and understanding required of the Director concerned.
The Remuneration Committee determines executive Directors’ basic salaries annually, with adjustments being made with effect
from 1 April and when an individual changes position or responsibility.   
In addition to basic salary and pension benefits, the executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car allowance
and fuel costs (or a fully expensed Company car), private medical insurance, permanent health insurance and life assurance.
Bonus arrangements
A discretionary annual cash bonus scheme represents the short-term incentive element of the overall remuneration package for
executive Directors.  The Remuneration Committee establishes the objectives that must be met in each financial year if a cash
bonus is to be paid, reflecting the strategic objectives set by the Board for the year in question. The bonus plan for the financial
year to 2 April 2006 rewarded performance relative to financial targets, the achievement of the equity raising exercise in June
2005; and specific personal objectives.  Details of the bonuses payable in respect of performance during the financial year ended
2 April 2006 are set out in the table on page 68.  Maximum bonus levels are set annually, currently at 100% of basic salary for the
Group Chief Executive and 60% of basic salary for the Group Finance Director.  Whilst Mr May was Executive Chairman, he was
eligible to earn a 40% bonus upon the targeted operating profit for the Year being achieved.  In addition, on 7 July 2005, a special
bonus arrangement was agreed whereby the Company would make a one-off payment of £159,000 to Mr Chae, provided that on
4 July 2008 the ordinary share price is not less than £1.00 and that Mr Chae is still an employee of the Company. The special
bonus was agreed as a further incentive, Mr Chae having already been granted share options equivalent to three times his salary.
The bonus is not pensionable.
Share options
The executive Directors hold options to purchase ordinary shares granted pursuant to the Volex 1994 Share Option Scheme (the
1994 scheme) and the Volex 2001 Share Option Plan (the 2001 plan) (together the “Option Schemes”).  These Option Schemes
are the Company’s standard long-term incentive schemes for executive Directors and other senior executives.  They are
discretionary share option schemes and are intended to align executives’ financial interests directly with those of the shareholders.
Executives are encouraged to retain shares after exercise of options, save for sales for the provision of the exercise price and
associated costs and for taxes.   64
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
Subject to the aggregate and individual limits built into the rules of the Option Schemes, the Committee’s policy is to grant options
to executive Directors on an annual basis, thereby building option holdings progressively over a period of time.  Executive Directors
are not normally granted in any one-year options over shares with a market value greater than 100% of basic salary.  However, in
exceptional circumstances grants of up to 3 times basic salary may be made. In addition, executive Directors are encouraged to
retain shares following the exercise of options, after allowing for sales to fund the exercise and related tax liabilities.
The exercise of options granted under the Option Schemes is subject to the satisfaction of a financial performance condition set
by the Remuneration Committee at the time of each grant.
The performance condition attached to options granted since June 1995 is that the growth in Earnings Per Share (EPS) over the
initial three-year vesting period is equal to or in excess of the movement in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus 2% per annum. With
effect from July 1998 this was adjusted to growth in EPS over the vesting period equal to or in excess of RPI plus 3% per annum.
The performance condition attached to options granted in July 2002 is that the growth in EPS over the performance period is
equal to or in excess of 30p per share, increased by the movement in RPI plus 3% per annum measured from April 2003 to the
end of the performance period.
The performance condition attached to options granted in July 2003 is that the growth in EPS over the performance period is
equal to or in excess of 13p per share, increased by the movement in RPI plus 3% per annum measured from April 2004 to the
end of the performance period.
The performance condition attached to options granted in June 2004 is that the growth in EPS over the performance period is
equal to or in excess of 22p per share, increased by the movement in RPI plus 6% per annum measured from April 2005 to the
end of the performance period.
The performance condition attached to options granted in July 2005 and January 2006 is that the growth in EPS over the
performance period is equal to or in excess of 5p per share, increased by the movement in RPI plus 3% per annum measured
from April 2006 to the end of the performance period, in order for 50% of the options to be exercisable. In order for 100% of the
options to be exercisable the growth in EPS of the performance period is equal to or in excess of 5p per share increased by the
movement in RPI plus 6% per annum measured from April 2006 to the end of the performance period. Where the performance is
between 3% and 6% a sliding scale will apply.
At the time of the grant of the relevant options the Remuneration Committee considered that the performance condition selected
represented good practice for such schemes generally and were appropriate given the Company’s size and business.  In the case
of the 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 grants of options the Remuneration Committee adapted its previous practice in view of
the negative EPS for the financial years 2002 to 2006.  EPS here means the adjusted earnings per share published in each Annual
Report and Accounts of the Company subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee to make such adjustments to
"normalise" the figures as it sees fit.  This approach to the calculation of EPS has been chosen since the base figure is
independently audited and transparent, whilst reserving to the Remuneration Committee the appropriate level of discretion.  
Options granted up to and including 2001 allow for annual re-testing of the performance condition from the fixed base of the date
of grant.  Options granted in 2002 and 2003 allow for such testing only in the third, fourth and fifth years after grant.  Options
granted in 2004, 2005 and 2006 did not allow for re-testing but have a single testing period of 3 years.  Once the performance
condition attaching to any of the options has been satisfied, the option may be exercised at any time during the rest of its ten-year
life without further test.  
The exercise price of each of the options granted under the Option Schemes is equal to the market value of the Company’s
shares at the time when the options are granted. 
Mr Walter and Mr Chae each participates in the 2001 Plan.  Mr Molloy participated in the 1994 Scheme; however, these options
subsequently lapsed six months following his retirement, in accordance with the Scheme rules.  Mr Ashcroft participated in the
Volex 1994 Share Savings Scheme, the 1994 Scheme and the 2001 Plan.  Mr Corcoran participated in the 1994 Scheme and the
2001 Plan.  Both Mr Ashcroft and Mr Corcoran are able to exercise their share options within 12 months following their respective
dates of termination of employment. Mr May also participated in the 2001 Plan; however, these options lapsed upon his
resignation, in accordance with the Scheme rules. 
Up until 2001 the executive Directors were eligible to apply for options pursuant to the Volex 1994 Share Savings Scheme which
was open to all UK employees upon general invitation by the Company.  This was an all employee Scheme to which performance
conditions do not apply.  Since this Scheme was closed no further invitations are possible under it. Volex Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006 65
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
The Company does not currently operate any long-term incentive schemes for Directors, other than the share option schemes
described above, the share appreciation rights issued to Branison Group LLC and the special bonus awarded to Mr. Chae.
However, the Remuneration Committee has made proposals to establish a new LTIP and a resolution relating to this is to be put to
the 2006 Annual General Meeting, details of which will be provided in a seperate circular which will be issued with the notice of the
Annual General Meeting. No significant amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a
Director to existing share options.
Pension arrangements
The provision of pension benefits for executive Directors is considered in the context of the overall remuneration package and in
the light of each executive Director’s particular circumstances. Mr Corcoran, accrued defined contribution benefits via an Irish
pension arrangement with a Company contribution of 20% of basic salary.  Since April 2003 Mr Ashcroft accrued defined
contribution pension benefits via a UK approved pension arrangement with a Company contribution of 20% of basic salary.  In
addition he has deferred pension benefits within two contributory defined benefit schemes in respect of earlier periods of service.
These are the Volex No.1 Pension Scheme (30ths of final salary accrual rate) and the Volex Executive Pension Scheme (60ths of
final salary accrual rate) both of which closed to future accrual of pension benefits on 31 March 2003.  Mr Corcoran’s pension
benefits are affected by the pensions cap applied by the Irish Revenue Authorities.  None of the other Directors’ pension benefits
are affected by the HM Revenue and Customs’ pensions cap.  Mr Walter received pension contributions to a UK approved
pension arrangement equivalent to 20% of his basic salary. Mr Chae is a member of the Volex Inc., 401K Employee Retirement
Plan and Mr Payzant was also a member of this plan during his executive employment.  The Group contributed up to 1.5% of Mr
Payzant’s and Mr Chae’s basic salary.  Only basic salary is pensionable in all cases. Mr May did not receive any pension benefits
from the Company.

Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that service contracts for each executive Director continues until the Director’s contractual retirement
date (or such date as agreed between the Director and the Company) unless terminated earlier by either party, subject to the
contractual notice period of no more than one year.  However, it may be necessary occasionally to offer longer notice periods or
initial terms to new Directors.  Mr Chae and Mr Walter have service contracts which are subject to twelve months notice from
either party.  
The Company’s policy for non-executive Directors is to have contracts for services with an initial period of appointment of 3 years,
renewable by agreement for successive periods.  
Under the Articles of Association of the Company at each annual general meeting any Director then in office who has been
appointed by the Board since the previous annual general meeting, and any Director then in office who at the date of the notice
convening the annual general meeting had held office for more than 30 months since he was appointed or last re-appointed by
the Company in general meeting, is required to retire from office but is eligible for re-appointment.  Mr Goulandris, a non-executive

Outside appointments
Prior to his appointment and whilst Chairman of Volex, Mr May, was also Executive Chairman of Cape Plc. None of the other
executive Directors hold outside Director appointments.
Non-executive Directors
All non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their fees are determined by the Board within the limits set by
the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive Directors of similar companies.  The

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)

As at the end of the year Mr Ashcroft had deferred pension entitlements under the Volex No.1 Pension Scheme and under the
Volex Executive Pension Scheme, which are both defined benefit schemes, and had accrued entitlements under the schemes as
follows:

Mr M Ashcroft 31,064 39 31,942
* This amount reflects the difference in inflation factors used for the purposes of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension element of the
pension entitlement arising from the Executive Pension Scheme compared with the Limited Price Indexation rate otherwise
used for the purposes of this note.
The pension entitlement shown above is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service and final pensionable
salary at the end of the year.
The following table sets out the transfer value of the Director’s accrued benefits under the schemes calculated in a manner

The Volex No.1 Pension Scheme and the Volex Executive Pension Scheme were both closed to future accrual of benefits on 31
March 2003.  They have been replaced by defined contribution pension arrangements with the individuals concerned, with a
Company contribution of 20% of basic salary in the case for the executive Director.  Members of the scheme have the option to

of such schemes. The contributions paid or payable during the year by the Group in respect of those individuals were as follows:

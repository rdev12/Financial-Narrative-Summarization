Introduction
Bloomsbury Publishing is an independent global publisher listed on the 
London Stock Exchange with offices in London, Oxford, New York, New 
Delhi and Sydney. Over its 30-year history, Bloomsbury’s mission has been 
to publish works of excellence and originality. Bloomsbury has built up a 
valuable portfolio of content and rights-based intellectual property assets.
“A long track record of dividend growth can be seen as a hallmark of a high quality and resilient business. It shows  
a company has been able to prosper in good times and bad and might be able to keep on doing so.
But investors also need to be wary. Sometimes management can become slaves to a dividend policy and pay 
dividends which aren’t sustainable. Investors need to keep an eye on the levels of dividend cover and whether  
a company might be borrowing to pay its dividend due to a lack of cash flow.”
Phil Oakley, analyst at SharePad, said:
Why these are Britain’s best dividend shares
Research for Telegraph Money by SharePad, a portfolio analysis tool, filtered the UK stock market for companies 
that have grown dividends every year for at least two decades.
It looked at every share in the FTSE All Share, excluding investment trusts. In applying the screen some shares, 
such as Royal Dutch Shell which has not cut its dividends since 1945, do not feature. This is because there has been 
at least one year when the dividend was maintained rather than increased.
A total of ten shares qualified as dividend kings: 
Share Name Industry Dividend Cover Dividend Yield
Vodafone Telecoms 5.2% 0.5
Cranswick Food 1.8% 2.8
SSE Energy 6.2% 1.2
RPC Plastics specialist 2.2% 2.6
Fuller Smith & Turner Brewer and pubs 1.6% 3.2
Halma Health and safety devices 1.4% 2.7
Bloomsbury Publishing 4.3% 2.2
PZ Cussons Household goods 2.7% 2.1
Capita Outsourcing 3.3% 2.2
Mitie Group Outsourcing 4.6% 2.0
Source: SharePad. Please note data used is the forecast dividend yield, based on analysts’ expectations in one year’s time.
This “cover” is calculated by comparing profits and dividends. As a rule of thumb, a low dividend cover score, 
around one or lower, suggests dividends are vulnerable, as the company is using most, if not all, of its profits to 
fund the dividend. A figure of two or more is comfortable.

Chairman’s Statement
A
s it approaches its 30th birthday in September, I am pleased 
to report that Bloomsbury has had a good year in terms 
of the quality of both its publishing and its financial results. 
Total revenue is up 11% and operating profit before highlighted 
items is up 8%. The overall results of the business are in line with 
market expectations. Based on this the Board proposes a final 
dividend of 5.34 pence per share to Shareholders on the register on 
26 August 2016, which gives an increase in full year dividend of  
5% and continues Bloomsbury’s long-term stable dividend growth.
The Group continues to pursue its strategy of increasing the 
proportion of its business in non-consumer areas. In order to 
leverage our entrepreneurial workforce and valuable portfolio 
of intellectual property, I am delighted to report on a new major 
strategic growth initiative, Bloomsbury 2020. This initiative will 
accelerate the expansion of the Group’s range of digital content 
products and will invest in the B2B sales processes to grow sales 
and revenues. This will build on the success of our platforms such 
as Drama Online, Bloomsbury Collections and Berg Fashion Library. 
From the time of Bloomsbury’s foundation in 1986, our overarching 
mission – to publish works of excellence and originality – has guided 
the business and will continue to do so with this new initiative.
We are also simplifying our organisational structure by combining 
our Adult and Children’s consumer books divisions and combining 
Business Information with Academic & Professional along with 
Special Interest and Educational into a Non-Consumer division. 
These changes will help to streamline our internal processes.
More details on Bloomsbury 2020 and the restructuring are given in 
the Chief Executive’s Review that follows this Chairman’s Statement. 
We are delighted that Richard Charkin has agreed to stay on the 
Board when, at the end of this financial year, he reduces his formal 
time commitment to two days a week.
I am pleased to confirm that the two most recent appointments 
to the Board made following the 2015 AGM in July 2015, namely 
Jonathan Glasspool as an Executive Director and John Warren as 
the Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Audit Committee, 
have both settled in well. The Corporate Governance section of 
the Annual Report explains the Board’s evaluation process and 
provides a summary of the findings and conclusions of this year’s 
Board evaluation. The Board has concluded that it can best support 
the business as it evolves through a programme of regular new 
board appointments. This will ensure that, at a time of considerable 
change, there is a steady inflow to the Board of new insights from 
other businesses. We plan that the size of the Board will remain at  
8 and, generally speaking, we anticipate appointing one new  
non-executive director each year and for the average duration  
of non-executive appointments to be around 4 years.
We recently welcomed two new institutional Shareholders to our 
portfolio, namely Fidelity UK and Majedie Asset Management 
Limited. The Board continues to be keen to receive any feedback 
from Shareholders.
We are proud of the high social value of our core business of 
promoting literature and literacy. Bloomsbury’s authors enrich 
the lives of millions of people across the world. I would like, on 
behalf of the Board, to thank all our staff for their hard work and 
commitment to publishing the Bloomsbury way.
Bloomsbury is a highly innovative publishing group with a Board 
and management team who demonstrate their capacity to adapt in 
order to stay ahead of the challenges of a rapidly changing market. 
The depth of talent across Bloomsbury gives me confidence that we 
are very able to continue to face and to exploit future challenges 
over the years to come.
Sir Anthony Salz
Non-Executive Chairman

Chief Executive’s Review
“We announced in May a major  
new strategic growth initiative 
called Bloomsbury 2020, and  
the creation of Bloomsbury  
Digital Resource Publishing.  
We plan to accelerate significantly 
the growth of digital revenues 
by implementing a new digital 
publishing plan in our move  
to become primarily a non-
consumer publisher in the B2B 
academic and professional 
information market. ”
Nigel Newton
Chief Executive
I
t has been a very good year for Bloomsbury, with revenues 
growing by 11% year on year to £123.7 million and profit before 
tax and highlighted items increasing by 8% to £13.0 million. 
Book sales grew by 17% year on year to £113.1 million, with digital 
sales, within this total, increasing by 28% to £15.0 million. Digital 
sales make up 13% of book sales (2015: 12%). Rights and services 
revenues were £10.6 million (2015: £14.1 million), being 9% of 
total Group revenues compared to 13% in the previous year. The 
operating profit margin before highlighted items for the Group 
was maintained year on year at 11%. Operating profit before 
highlighted items grew year on year in all territories except India, 
where we saw significant sales growth but where we continue to 
invest for that growth. 
The Children’s & Educational division delivered an excellent 
performance, with its third consecutive year of strong double 
digit revenue growth. The Illustrated Edition of Harry Potter and 
the Philosopher’s Stone by J. K. Rowling and Jim Kay, which was 
published in October, was a major international seller. 
The Academic & Professional division had strong digital revenues 
contributing to a growth in book sales but, as expected, did not 
match last year with its exceptional rights sales. In the Adult division 
revenues were higher and included a full year of Osprey Publishing, 
which was acquired in December 2014, but profits reflected a 
change in revenue mix and a tough comparator that included the 
paperback release of Khaled Hosseini’s exceptionally successful 
And the Mountains Echoed. Bloomsbury Information division profits 
grew year on year. The strength of our overall result, despite the 
variations in individual divisional performance, again demonstrates 
the virtues of our portfolio approach encompassing four different 
publishing genres. 
Planned synergies following the acquisition of Osprey Publishing in 
December 2014 have been achieved. Osprey contributed £7.2 million 
of revenue and £1.1 million of operating profit before highlighted 
items to Bloomsbury in 2016. Excluding the results of Osprey in both 
years, Group like for like revenues grew by 6% and profit before tax 
and highlighted items was flat year on year. 
We continue to keep costs closely under review and this year 
renegotiated our US mono print contracts with little or no movement 
on cost in a highly competitive marketplace (previous contracts 
having expired in 2015). Planned savings on freight from Far East 
printers were achieved through consolidation with other publishers 
using the same UK warehouse and distribution service provider.
Highlighted items of £2.7 million (2015: £2.5 million) include  
£1.8 million (2015: £1.8 million) of amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets. Other highlighted items in this period of £0.9 million are 
primarily as a result of the Group’s acquisition activities and the 
restructuring of the Bloomsbury Information division.

Chief Executive’s Review
The effective rate of tax for the year was 6.3% compared to 8.9% 
for the year ended 28 February 2015. The rates in both years 
are low, but are expected to increase to a more normal level of 
approximately 25% in 2016/17. In 2016 the rate includes £0.5 million 
benefit from the utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses 
arising as a result of the resolution of an HMRC tribunal over the 
use of Bloomsbury Verlag losses dating back to 2003 and 2004. In 
addition there is a £0.6 million double tax relief benefit arising in 
2016 following the filing of prior year US tax computations. The  
2015 rate includes the recognition of additional deferred tax assets.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding highlighted items, were  
15.24 pence, up 3% from 14.73 pence in 2015. Total diluted earnings 
per share for the year were 12.93 pence compared to 11.90 pence 
in 2015.
The Group’s net cash balance was £5.2 million at 29 February 2016 
(2015: £7.5 million). Cash from higher profits was offset by a higher 
working capital outflow due to the timing of receipts from rights 
and services revenues. 
Academic & Professional
Total revenues for the division were £32.7 million (2015:  
£36.0 million). As expected, rights and services revenues reduced 
year on year following the inclusion last year of several key 
contracts. Book revenues, which make up 92% of total revenues, 
grew by 2% year on year to £30.1 million. Within this, digital 
revenues grew by 24% year on year to £5.3 million, more than 
treble the overall industry growth rate in calendar year 2015. In 
particular we had very good revenues from home-grown digital 
institutional products such as Bloomsbury Collections and Drama 
Online. Digital now represents 16% of total revenues in the division 
(2015: 12%), with digital growth offsetting continuing print revenue 
weakness. We were successful in our two key targets for growth 
in the year, which were digital revenues and revenues in the US 
– where there was 5% growth in total revenues. Operating profit 
before highlighted items was £3.2 million (2015: £5.1 million) in 
total and £0.8 million (2015: £0.4 million) excluding the effect of the 
higher margin rights and services contracts. 
In December 2015 we announced the acquisition from RELX Group 
of the publishing rights to six must-have family law titles including 
Duckworth’s Matrimonial Property & Finance and Hershman and 
McFarlane: Children Law and Practice. The consideration was  
£0.5 million in cash (after adjusting for deferred income). These  
are some of the most authoritative family law products in the UK and 
they provide Bloomsbury Professional with a high quality foundation 
for a new digital family law service. Bloomsbury Publishing is now the 
largest independent legal publisher in the UK. During the year its 
UK tax business delivered some strong titles including Tax Advisers 
Guide to Trusts, Principles of International Taxation, Revenue Law 
and Tax Planning for Family and Owner-Managed Companies. It 
also expanded its Tax Online service and, in its second full year of 
ownership, the Hart list delivered very significant revenues from its 
digital collections. 
Bloomsbury Professional has a range of online services.
Bloomsbury Collections is the online academic platform for 
delivering scholarly texts.
Drama Online is a subscription service providing a resource for plays, 
critical analysis and performance featuring pre-eminent drama lists.

The Academic division had particular success in its performing 
arts lists. We had notable successes with student edition play text 
publishing following the launch of the new GCSE English Literature 
exam resulting in increased sales of bestselling set texts, Simon 
Stephen’s adaptation of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night- 
Time and Willy Russell’s Blood Brothers. 
The 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death in 1616 was marked 
with a range of publications in print and online, notably with a 
volume featuring leading contemporary poets and their responses 
to the Sonnets. The Arden Shakespeare’s On Shakespeare’s Sonnets 
is published in collaboration with the Royal Society of Literature and 
the British Council and has been nominated as one of the Telegraph’s 
Top Ten New Books on Shakespeare. New editions of the major set 
texts Hamlet and Othello will also be published this year.
The success of our institutional products to date, such as Drama 
Online, Berg Fashion Library, Bloomsbury Collections, and 
Bloomsbury Professional Online, led to 24% growth in the last 
financial year, and we are projecting higher growth in this financial 
year. In 2016 we will be launching a new collection of drama films 
from the BBC which will significantly increase the video presence of 
Drama Online in schools and universities worldwide. The collection 
includes the film adaptation of the Royal Shakespeare Company’s 
critically acclaimed Hamlet starring Patrick Stewart alongside 
David Tennant in the title role; an award-winning National Theatre 
production of King Lear; core curriculum plays by Henrik Ibsen, 
Anton Chekhov and Sophocles as well as the recent film adaptation 
of major GCSE set text An Inspector Calls by J. B. Priestley. In addition, 
Bloomsbury, together with Faber & Faber, are pleased to announce 
a new digital content platform for libraries, educators, students 
and researchers to be sold via subscription and perpetual access to 
academic institutions. Building on the success of the award-winning 
Drama Online initiative, Screen Studies, launching in January 2018, 
will combine iconic and contemporary screenplays, works by 
leading directors, critical and contextual works covering theory and 
history, as well as practical instruction on screenwriting, film and TV 
production, documentary film-making and animation techniques.
The division was shortlisted for the IPG Independent Publishers 
Awards – Academic & Professional Publisher of the Year and for the 
Bookseller Academic & Professional Publisher of the Year, in both 
cases for the fourth year in a row.

Chief Executive’s Review
Children’s & Educational
Children’s & Educational division revenue for the year increased 
by 57% to £41.8 million (2015: £26.6 million). Operating profit 
before highlighted items increased by 111% to £6.0 million (2015: 
£2.9 million). There was revenue growth across all territories in 
local currency, 42% in Australia, 31% in the US, 62% in India and 
a standout growth of 70% in the UK. This excellent result in the 
division reflects the success of our five-year strategy focusing on 
commercial title acquisitions, targeted and strategic marketing 
and brand management of our major authors. Continued success 
with the picture book list and activity list has led to growth in our 
illustrated publishing, in which we hold world rights. This financial 
year saw the creation of a children’s non-fiction publishing team, 
which will lead to further trade growth in the future. Our UK  
Nielsen BookScan value increased by 60% in a market up by  
7%, and our market share increased from 2.3% to 3.4%. 
Our sales of Harry Potter in the year grew by 133%. Harry Potter  
and the Philosopher’s Stone Illustrated Edition by J. K. Rowling and 
Jim Kay was published to great acclaim. Reviews were consistently 
good, with the Telegraph saying the book was “a triumph – a book 
so alive it seems to jump, explode and slither out of your hands as 
you read.” We sold rights to Jim Kay’s illustrations in 28 languages.  
Our re-jacketed Jonny Duddle editions of the seven Harry Potter 
novels continued to perform strongly in all territories. 
Sales of Sarah J. Maas titles grew by 184%. The launch of her new 
trilogy, A Court of Thorns and Roses, sold in 13 languages and hit the 
New York Times Young Adult bestseller list for eight weeks. A Court of 
Mist and Fury, the second book in this trilogy, has just hit number  
one on the New York Times Young Adult bestseller list. Her new  
Throne of Glass novel – Queen of Shadows – has sold in 24 languages 
and was on the New York Times Series bestseller list for four weeks and 
hit number five on the Bookseller UK children’s chart. It was also voted 
Goodreads' Winner: Best YA Fantasy and Science Fiction of 2015. 
We capitalised on a film adaption of John Green’s Paper Towns 
starring Cara Delevingne with two new editions of this evergreen 
Young Adult novel. The film tie-in edition was a Bookseller children’s 
number one, remaining there for five weeks, and we have sold  
more than one million copies. 
Our two best performers on the Bloomsbury Picture Book list were 
You Can’t Take an Elephant on the Bus by Patricia Cleveland-Peck, 
illustrated by David Tazzyman, selling 33,000 copies through the 
UK BookScan (Nielsen TCM), and Never Tickle a Tiger by Pamela 
Butchart, illustrated by Marc Boutavant, selling 20,000 copies 
through UK BookScan and translation rights in nine territories.  
I Love You Night and Day by Smriti Prasadam Halls and Alison Brown 
continued to sell strongly in the US following a month in the Barnes

international audience of readers and hit number one in the New 
York Time Young Adult bestseller list.

Chief Executive’s Review
Adult 
Revenue increased by 3% year on year to £46.0 million (2015:  
£44.7 million). Osprey Publishing, which was acquired in December 
2014, generated revenue of £7.2 million in the year (2015:  
£1.5 million). On a like for like basis, excluding the results of this 
acquisition, Adult revenues were down by 10% year on year. 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £2.7 million (2015: 
£3.0 million). Results last year included the success of two major 
cookery titles as well as the release of the paperback of And the 
Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini.
Our global publishing strategy continues for both our general and 
special interest markets and was strengthened by the acquisition of 
global publishing rights and by investment in the US market for our 
niche publishing activities, in particular in Osprey military history 
and popular science through our Bloomsbury Sigma imprint.
The market for print books throughout the English-speaking 
world was robust with many bookshop chains showing improved 
performance in spite of intense competition from internet retailers 
and e-books. Some of this improvement has been driven by 
the extraordinary performance of a number of adult colouring 
books but there is an underlying confidence in the future of 
traditional bookselling and traditional books for pleasure, leisure, 
enlightenment and giving.
Our focus on special interest niches is paying off, with that part 
of the business representing 14% of total Bloomsbury sales 
(2015: 10%). The value of this strategy is the ability to pinpoint 
market sectors and promote and sell direct to a community of 
shared interest. Our chosen niches are military history (through 
Osprey), natural history (through Helm and Poyser), sport 
(through Nautical, Reed’s, and Wisden), popular science (through 
Sigma) and reference (through Who’s Who, Whitaker’s, and 
www.writersandartists.co.uk). In each of these areas we have 
strengthened our editorial positioning, and invested in digital 
marketing, new products and portfolio widening. The results  
have been impressive and there is much opportunity  
still to be uncovered.
On the general trade side our key authors continue to grow.  
Celia Imrie’s Not Quite Nice hit the bestseller lists as did William 
Boyd’s Sweet Caress, while both James Runcie’s Grantchester 
series (with six million viewers for each TV episode) and Hannah 
Rothschild’s debut novel, The Improbability of Love (which has been 
shortlisted for the Bailey’s Prize), have garnered extraordinary 
attention and sales. In addition we had new books from our 
established authors such as Margaret Atwood, TC Boyle, Esther 
Freud and Colum McCann. In non-fiction we had great success 
with Adam Sisman’s superb biography of John le Carré, Elizabeth 
Gilbert’s Big Magic, Peter Frankopan’s Silk Roads, Patti Smith’s  
M Train, and our Christmas special, A Guinea Pig Pride & Prejudice, 
which introduced a whole new generation to Jane Austen. 
Other highlights included the film tie-in edition of Carol by Patricia 
Highsmith and Kamila Shamsie’s A God in Every Stone being 
shortlisted for last year’s Bailey’s Prize; Sheila Hancock’s Miss 
Carter’s War being selected for the Richard and Judy book club;  
Osprey Publishing has settled in well following its acquisition by 
Bloomsbury in the previous financial year.
Writers and Artists provides information, training and advice for 
authors who seek to develop their skills.
Bloomsbury Adult has had a strong publishing list during the year,

Our digital-first list, Bloomsbury Reader, has now generated over 
£1.0 million of revenue since launching in September 2011 with 
the aim of bringing literary backlists into circulation alongside 
new titles as e-books and, based on consumer demand, print 
editions. Bestsellers include The White Cottage Mystery by Margery 
Allingham, first serialised in 1927 and Bloomsbury’s Outsider, first 
published in 2015 and shortlisted for the James Tait Black Award  
for Best Biography.  
Bloomsbury Information
Bloomsbury Information provides innovative content marketing 
and publishing services to external partners. This includes the 
development of IP-rich knowledge hubs; large-scale, multi-year 
digital content and community platforms provided as a full service 
for other organisations; publishing, management and consultancy 
services; and content creation and licensing, customised for 
other organisations. Bloomsbury Information also publishes the 
Bloomsbury Business list. 
Revenue in the year was £3.2 million (2015: £3.9 million), with much 
of this change due to the end of the seven-year term of contracts 
with Qatar Foundation ("QF"). Operating profit before highlighted 
items was £1.2 million (2015: £1.1 million).
The contracts for Bloomsbury to provide QF with publishing services 
reached the end of their term in December 2015. The original 
objective of the QF relationship was to achieve knowledge transfer 
to QF to enable it to run its own self-sufficient publishing company. 
We have handed over to the strong local team we developed 
having completed this mission. QF now has the tools, knowledge 
and experience to take the reins and run its own publishing house. 
Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Publishing published more than 200 
titles in Arabic and English, winning awards and having bestselling 
titles over its first seven years. In April we reached an agreement 
with Kalimat, a publisher in Sharjah, to translate Arabic books into 
English for the global market and to translate English-language 
books into Arabic.
The IZA World of Labor knowledge hub had a strong year of global 
engagement with policymakers and the media. It now contains more 
than 230 peer-reviewed articles written by leading labour economists, 
and achieved more than 250 global media mentions in 2015, 
including articles in the Washington Post, The Times, the Economist and 
Bloomsbury authors published by the Adult division continue to win 
a wide range of literary prizes for outstanding works. .

the Financial Times. The knowledge hub covers important and timely 
topics such as asylum policy in Europe and the impact of robots on 
employment, and its content helped inform the B20 Employment 
Taskforce Report. We continue to grow key partnerships with leading 
organisations like the World Bank, OECD and UCL.
From 2016, Bloomsbury is pleased to be providing publishing 
services to the Arcadian Library to digitise it and sell access to a 
new digital platform containing images of its unique collection 
of rare books and manuscripts. The Arcadian Library is one of the 
best collections of books about relations between the West and the 
Arab and Islamic worlds, including travel, medicine and science. 
The Library was assembled over decades and always held as a 
private collection. Bloomsbury will be digitising these books for the 
first time and making them available to universities, libraries and 
individuals around the world as a subscription product.
Bloomsbury provided Lloyds Bank with business content aimed 
at their SME business customers during the year, including a new 
business glossary that went live on the Lloyds Business Resource 
Centre. Lloyds will continue to launch more Bloomsbury content in 
the coming year, which will provide business thought leadership, 
insight and best practice to its business customers. 
The Bloomsbury Business list continued to grow this year, as did  
our partnership with Ashridge/Hult Business School. Titles published 
from this partnership included Capitalism’s Toxic Assumptions by 
Eve Poole and Creating Financial Value by Malcolm Allitt. Other titles 
in the list were well received, including Rewire: A Radical Approach 
to Tackling Diversity and Difference by Chris Yates and Pooja Sachdev 
and Managing for Success: Spotting Danger Signals – and Fixing 
Problems Before They Happen by Morgen Witzel, both of which  
were covered by the Financial Times.
Outlook 
We announced in May major new strategic growth initiative called 
Bloomsbury 2020, and the creation of Bloomsbury Digital Resource 
Publishing. We plan to accelerate significantly the growth of digital 
revenues by implementing a new digital publishing plan in our 
move to become primarily a non-consumer publisher in the B2B 
academic and professional information market. The increased 
range of digital products will include reversioning and updating 
content from Bloomsbury’s extensive and deep backlists, as well 
as licensing in high quality third party intellectual property, and 
primary resource material from a wide range of international 
content providers. Bloomsbury aims to become the go-to scholarly 
partner for copyright holders looking to reach HE institutions 
around the world, but who lack the expertise and infrastructure to 
do so effectively.
The budget for academic libraries worldwide is estimated to be 
worth $5 billion. Academic & Professional digital output to date 
has been highly successful in terms of profit margins (mature 
digital resources often yield an operating profit margin of 25% 
to 40%) and in terms of growth (24% total revenue growth in 
the last financial year). Bloomsbury 2020 will build rapidly on this 
success, by increasing the output and speed to market of a range 
of new products, providing a robust scalable set of platforms and 
IZA World of Labour knowledge hub (http://wol.iza.org)
In addition to its focus on rights and services based projects, 
Bloomsbury Information division publishes the Bloomsbury  
Business list.

improving the strength, depth and geographical spread of our 
institutional digital sales team. Existing services like the award-
winning Berg Fashion Library, Drama Online and Bloomsbury 
Professional Online are proof that Bloomsbury can deliver high 
value, repeat-income digital resources; it is this capability that 
Bloomsbury 2020 seeks to grow dramatically. We are targeting 
revenues rising to £15 million and profits of £5 million from 
Bloomsbury Digital Resource Publishing by financial year 2021/22. 
The peak effect on our Income Statement is expected to be an 
extra £2 million of net cost in 2017/18 and on our cash flow an extra 
£1.7 million of outflow is expected in 2017/18. Cash payback on the 
investment is expected to be in the fourth full year, 2020/21. 
We announced in May 2016 a  reorganisation of the business into 
two divisions: Consumer and Non-Consumer, reflecting the core 
customers for our different operations. The Consumer division 
will be created by merging the Children’s trade and Adult trade 
businesses and from 1 June will be managed by Emma Hopkin, who 
is currently the Managing Director of our Children’s & Educational 
division. All other operations will be in the Non-Consumer division 
which will be managed by Jonathan Glasspool, who is currently 
Managing Director of our Academic & Professional division, 
reporting to Richard Charkin. Richard will remain on the Board; in 
addition to the Non-Consumer division he will focus on strategic 
growth areas including special interest and the Bloomsbury India 
business. He will continue full time until 28 February 2017, after 
which he will change to two days a week. This reorganisation will 
simplify our business, and lead to system and structural efficiencies 
as well as increase our customer focus and facilitate our digital 
expansion. 
Since the year end, Group revenues have been in line with our 
expectations, with the Children’s & Educational division very strong. 
In the current year our publishing programme includes Harry Potter 
and the Chamber of Secrets Illustrated Edition by J. K. Rowling and 
Jim Kay, two front list Sarah J. Maas titles, new cookery titles from 
Tom Kerridge with Tom’s Table and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall 
with River Cottage A to Z, and the new edition of Fantastic Beasts  
& Where to Find Them with new content from J. K. Rowling. 
Bloomsbury continues its strategy of growing academic, 
professional, special interest and educational revenues. Bloomsbury 
has shown that its Academic & Professional intellectual property 
in particular is capable of creating significant value when sold in 
a digital format. Our exclusive content can be monetised as an 
individual title, in collections, as a subscription or through perpetual 
access. We will be accelerating growth in this area, leveraging 
content across both Bloomsbury and third parties, providing 
significant opportunities to create more value from these assets. 
The Bloomsbury 2020 strategy to grow revenues from academic 
and professional digital resources for academic libraries worldwide 
will lead our repositioning in the market from a primarily consumer 
publisher to a digital B2B publisher, whilst continuing our long 
track record of huge bestsellers in the adult and children’s markets, 
which remain a very important part of Bloomsbury’s mission.

Group Overview
Group Strategic Summary
Bloomsbury is a global fully integrated publisher of books and other 
media for general readers, children, students, researchers and 
professionals. Bloomsbury offers authors access to these multiple 
markets in multiple formats throughout the world: in print, through 
e-books, through digital downloads and apps; in schools, in libraries, 
in universities, and in terrestrial and internet bookshops; with 
entrepreneurial teams in New York, London, New Delhi and Sydney 
serving all territories. 
Area of focus Reason for the focus Progress in the year
Growing non-consumer* 
revenues so that they 
match or exceed our 
consumer revenues
Non-consumer revenues have higher margins, 
are generally a more predictable revenue 
stream, are less reliant on the retail bookshop 
environment and have more digital opportunities. 
They are typically derived from our Academic 
& Professional and Information divisions and 
Educational and Special Interest books.
In January 2016 we acquired several family law 
publishing assets from Lexis Nexis and Jordan 
Publishing.
Non-Consumer products made up 47% of 
revenues in 2015/16, up from 39% in 2014/15.
Continuing acquisition 
of rights to publish 
outstanding works 
by undiscovered and 
established authors
Bloomsbury differentiates its brand by the quality 
of its publishing.
Bloomsbury titles won a significant number of 
prizes in the year– these are listed on pages 17  
to 22 of these accounts.
Expanding internationally 
in English language 
markets
This reduces the Group’s reliance on the UK 
market and, in particular, takes advantage of the 
biggest academic market worldwide in the US and 
the significant growth potential in India.
A full year of Osprey revenue has helped expand 
the Group’s presence internationally. Over 50% 
of Osprey’s revenue is generated outside the UK, 
principally in the US.
Revenues sourced from outside the UK grew by 
19% in the year and now account for over 35%  
of Group revenue (2014/15: 33%)
Creating and exploiting 
copyright and IP, 
including by licensing 
information databases to 
support major institutions 
and corporations
This reduces the Group’s reliance on consumer 
revenues and increases higher value B2B 
transactions.
IZA World of Labor website had a strong year of 
global engagement with policy makers and the 
media. A new publishing services contract was 
signed to digitalise and sell the Arcadian Library.
Benefiting from the digital 
opportunity
It expands the markets we are in and our revenue 
opportunities.
Bloomsbury titles available as e-books up 39% year 
on year to 22,000. Academic & Professional digital 
revenues increased by 24% on the prior year.
Delivering excellent 
service to our authors
Excellent service is core to attracting and keeping 
our authors.
We continue to monitor the service we provide 
authors via a monthly author survey. As a result 
we now offer all authors the ability to receive their 
royalty statements electronically by pdf. 
Key areas of focus and the progress we have made in the year are as follows:
* Non-consumer: This includes Academic & Professional, Bloomsbury Information, Education and Specialist titles (excluding Cookery) 
During the year the Group was organised as four worldwide publishing divisions supported by global functions. A review of these follows.
Our overall strategy is unchanged and is to grow a high quality 
global publishing business delivering high value to its authors and 
other contributors, readers and Shareholders.
We achieve this by:
 ✷ publishing authors and works of excellence and originality; 
 ✷ delivering professional services to those seeking publication; 
 ✷ combining tradition and technology to achieve excellence; and
 ✷ establishing solid profit streams.

About the publishing division
The division sells and markets titles to the global trade, education 
and mass market sectors in both print and digital. The trade list 
acquires books from both the UK and US markets and publishes 
titles for all ages from 0 to 16. Imprints include Bloomsbury Activity 
Books, Bloomsbury Children’s Books and Bloomsbury Spark, an 
e-first list for Young Adult readers. In the UK education market we

Social responsibility
Bloomsbury Children’s & Educational publishes many books 
each year that contribute significantly to improving the literacy of 
children across the world. We believe books can open the minds of 
children to a world of possibility. 
We are happy in the year to 29 February 2016 to have supported the 
White House led Open eBooks initiative that gives underprivileged 
students access to e-books.
We worked with the National Literacy Trust on two major projects 
to help raise funds for the charity. The New Fiction Prize offered the 
opportunity of having a novel published by Bloomsbury and the 
winner was announced early in 2015. The winning book, Malkin 
Moonlight by Emma Cox, is set to be published this year. The second 
project focused on poetry – and finding future children’s poets – and 
asked entrants to create a funny poem about reading. The winning 
poem will be designed up as a poster sent out to all primary schools 
in the UK.
Bloomsbury also hosted a Reading for Pleasure roadshow at their 
offices where book/reading charities were given the opportunity to 
talk about their work and how Bloomsbury staff could get involved. 
Over 70 members of staff attended the roadshow and made 
pledges to support the promotion of reading for pleasure. 
Staff continue to volunteer to read with pupils at schools worldwide.

n 2015/16 Bloomsbury increased sales by £12.6 million to 
£123.7 million generating £13.0 million of profit before tax 
and highlighted items (2014/15: £12.1 million).
The results for this year largely reflect:
 ✷ excellent revenue growth driven by the Children’s & 
Educational division with Harry Potter, Sarah J. Maas,  
Paper Towns;
 ✷ additional sales contribution of £5.7 million from Osprey 
Publishing, which we acquired on 22 December 2014, 
reflecting an extra ten months’ sales in the current year; 
Excluding Osprey, like for like Group sales grew by 6%, and 
like for like Group operating profit was flat, year on year;
 ✷ strong Group digital revenue, now 13% of book sales, with 
33% growth in revenues from digital platforms; and
 ✷ excluding the results of Osprey there was a reduction in year on 
year like for like sales in the Adult division of £4.4 million or 10%; 
results in the year ended 28 February 2015 included the success 
of major cookery titles as well as the release of the paperback of 
And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini.
There have been no changes in accounting policies in the  
year, with the exception of the adoption of a number of new 
accounting standards which have not had a material impact  
on the Group’s results.

Financial Review
There was growth year on year of 57% in the Children’s & 
Educational division, and growth in the Adult division of 3%, offset by  
a decline in the Academic & Professional division of 9% and decline 
in the Information division of 17%. Within the Adult division Osprey 
contributed £7.2 million to revenue and £1.1 million to operating 
profit before highlighted items. Excluding the impact of the Osprey 
acquisition, the Group’s underlying revenue in the year ended 29 
February 2016 of £116.6 million grew on a like for like basis by £6.9 
million or 6%. Total title sales grew by 17% year on year. Print sales 
grew by 15% year on year, driven by an excellent year from the 
Children’s & Educational division, with print sales outperforming the 
prior year by £12.4 million or 54%. The Digital sales growth of 28% 
or £3.3 million was driven by Academic & Professional growth split 
evenly across e-book and digital resources sales, Adult’s growth from 
Osprey’s full year impact and Children’s growth due to the Sarah J. 
Maas series. Digital sales are 13% of Group book sales (2014/15: 12%).
There are now 22,000 Bloomsbury titles available as e-books  
(28 February 2015: 16,000; 28 February 2014: 13,000).

STRATEGIC REPORT
The two key areas that drive this revenue are copyright licence sales 
and management contract income.
Copyright licences include the sale of foreign language, online 
and other rights to our titles. Although this year’s revenues were 
strong, they are compared to an exceptional prior year result which 
included two large license deals worth in excess of £1.5 million each.
Management contracts revenues include monies from the IZA 
World of Labor contract worth £0.5 million and £1.5 million from our 
management contract in Qatar which expired in December 2015. 
The top three copyright licence revenue sources in 2015/16 
delivered profit of £2.3 million (29% of total rights and services 
profit) (2014/15: £6.3 million or 58%).
The following chart shows where Group revenues were generated 
for the year ended 29 February 2016. Revenue growth has been 
achieved year on year in all Bloomsbury’s territories: India 20%; US 
11%; Australia 31%; UK 8% (growth quoted is in local currencies). 
The revenue mix sees an increased share of Group revenues 
achieved in all of the US, Australia and India.
UK 65%
US 28%
Australia 6%
India 1%
Gross profit margin and operating profit
The gross margin declined year on year to 55% from 57% due  
to the reduction in high margin rights & services revenues. 
Excluding these revenues in both years, the gross margin was 
constant year on year at 54%.
Group marketing and distribution costs remained constant at  
14% of revenues.
Overheads grew £2.4 million to £37.0 million, reflecting the full year 
impact of Osprey (£1.5 million) and a core overhead increase of 3% 
year on year. Group operating profit before highlighted items for 
the year was £13.1 million, up 8% on last year. The operating profit 
margin for the Group was 11% (2014/15: 11%).

Divisional financial highlights are noted below and further 
information by division is given in the Divisional Review section of 
the Chief Executive’s Review.
Academic & Professional revenue for the year was £32.7 million 
(2014/15: £36.0 million), reflecting an exceptional prior year result 
which included two large license deals worth in excess of  
£1.5 million each. Academic digital title sales grew by 24% year  
on year, more than treble the overall industry growth rate,  
to £5.3 million, boosted by robust online subscription revenue 
growth and now representing 16% of total revenues in the division 
(2014/15: 12%). Within the year the Group invested in an expanded 
institutional sales team to support the long-term growth of our 
digital resources, the cost of which was offset by savings in third 
party commissions compared to the prior year. On 21 December 
2015 the Group signed a sale and purchase agreement to acquire 
from RELX (UK) Limited publishing rights to six must-have family 
law titles including Duckworth’s Matrimonial Property & Finance 
and Hershman and McFarlane: Children Law and Practice; the 
consideration was £0.5 million in cash (after adjusting for deferred 
income). These are some of the most authoritative family law 
products in the UK and they provide Bloomsbury Professional 
with a high quality foundation for a new digital family law service. 
Operating profit before highlighted items was £3.2 million  
(2014/15: £5.1 million).
In the Adult division total net sales grew by £1.3 million or 3% 
year on year to £46.0 million (2014/15: £44.6 million). However, 
this includes the full year impact of Osprey Publishing, which was 
acquired in December 2014, which generated revenue of £7.2 
million (2014/15: £1.5 million); revenue performance on a like for 
like basis declined by £4.4 million or 10%. Results in the year ended 
28 February 2015 included: the success of major cookery titles 
(notably Tom’s Table, the largest Adult title in 2015/16), as well as the 
release of the paperback of And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled 
Hosseini. Operating profit before highlighted items was £2.7 million 
(2014/15: £3.0 million). However, this includes the full year impact of 
Osprey Publishing; year on year operating profit performance on a 
like for like basis declined by £1.4 million.
The Children’s & Educational division sales were up 57% year on 
year, £41.8 million (2014/15: £26.6 million). There was revenue 
growth across all territories: 42% in Australia, 31% in the US, 62% 
in India and standout growth of 70% in the UK. Sales of Harry 
Potter titles in the year grew by 133%, including Harry Potter and 
the Philosopher’s Stone Illustrated Edition by J.K. Rowling and Jim 
Kay. E-book and other digital revenue grew by £1.2 million to £3.0 
million, driven by the success of Sarah J. Maas. Sarah J Maas title 
sales grew by 184% globally, including her new trilogy A Court  
of Thorns and Roses. The Children’s & Educational division’s 
operating profit before highlighted items was £6.0 million (2014/15: 
£2.9 million).
The Information division’s revenue for the year was £3.2 million 
(2014/15: £3.9 million). The Information division’s net title sales 
(from the Bloomsbury Business list) continued to grow with revenue 
up by £0.2 million to £0.6 million (2014/15: £0.4 million). The 
Information division’s rights and services revenue declined by  
£0.8 million largely due to the expiration of the management 
services agreement with the Qatar Foundation, worth £1.5 million 
in the year ended 29 February 2016. The IZA World of Labor 
knowledge hub had a strong year of global engagement and now 
contains more than 230 peer-reviewed articles, achieving more 
than 250 global media mentions in 2015. From 2016, Bloomsbury is 
pleased to be providing publishing services to the Arcadian Library, 
one of the finest collections of books about relations between the 
West and the Arab and Islamic worlds. The Information division 
operating profits before highlighted items grew to £1.2 million 
(2014/15: £1.1 million).

Acquisitions
On 21 December 2015 the Group signed a sale and purchase 
agreement to acquire from RELX (UK) Limited certain LexisNexis 
and Jordan family law publishing assets as a pre-condition of 
the Competition and Markets Authority ("CMA") approval of the 
purchase of Jordan Publishing Limited by RELX (UK) Limited. The 
clearance from the CMA was obtained on 22 January 2016, at 
which point the completion of the acquisition took place for a total 
consideration of £1.4 million or £0.5 million after adjusting for 
deferred income.  
Bloomsbury has acquired the publishing rights to six highly 
regarded family law titles including Duckworth’s Matrimonial 
Property & Finance and Hershman and McFarlane: Children Law  
and Practice. The titles are sold in a practical loose-leaf format and 
are available in an online digital form.
Interest
The net interest expense for the Group for the year was  
£0.09 million compared with a net interest expense of £0.05 million 
for 2014/15 due to lower net cash levels, which reduced following 
the acquisition of Osprey Publishing Limited in December 2014.
Taxation
Taxation was £0.7 million for the year, compared to £0.9 million 
for the year ended 28 February 2015. The effective tax rate was 
6.3% (2014/15: 8.9%). Excluding the effect of highlighted items, 
the effective tax rate for the Group was 8.5% (2014/15: 8.4%). The 
effective rate of tax is low this year due to the following factors:
 ✷ There was a £1,070,000 current tax adjustment in respect of prior 
years relating to the carry back of double taxation relief to prior 
years and an adjustment to align the prior year Group tax charge 
with recently submitted tax returns particularly for the US entities.
 ✷ Subsequent to the successful First-Tier Tribunal decision on 
Bloomsbury Verlag, a prior year adjustment of £543,000 has been 
recognised for the utilisation of previously unrecognised losses. 
 ✷ Linked to the above successful First-Tier Tribunal decision on 
Bloomsbury Verlag there was a release of a £213,000 tax provision 
in respect of prior years. This went through highlighted items in 
prior years and thus has been released in the same place.
 ✷ We anticipate the tax rate in 2016/17 to be back in line with the 
statutory tax rates in respective territories.
Earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share, excluding highlighted items, were up 
by 3% year on year to 15.24 pence (2014/15: 14.73 pence) reflecting 
the growth in profit before tax and highlighted items. Diluted 
earnings per share were up by 9% year on year to 12.93 pence 
(2014/15: 11.90 pence).
Dividend and dividend policy
The Group has a progressive dividend policy and aims to keep 
dividend cover in excess of two. In line with this policy the Directors 
are recommending a final dividend of 5.34 pence per share, which 
subject to Shareholder approval at our Annual General Meeting 
on19 July 2016 will be paid on 21 September 2016 to Shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 26 August 2016. 
Together with the interim dividend, this makes a total dividend  
for the year ended 29 February 2016 of 6.40 pence per share,  
a 5% increase on the 6.10 pence dividend for the year ended  
28 February 2015. Over the past 11 years the dividend has increased 
at a compound annual growth rate of 7%.

Property, plant and equipment 2.5 – 2.5

Total as at 28 February 2015 171.5 47.3 124.2
Increase/(decrease) 5.2 (3.6) 8.8
The Group’s key assets were goodwill and intangible assets, net 
trade receivables and inventories. 
Net assets increased by 7% to £133.0 million (2015: £124.2 million) 
and net assets per share by 7% to 177 pence (2015: 166 pence).  
The main movements in the balance sheet are explained below. 
Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets increased by £0.4 million to  
£64.5 million (2015: £64.1 million) principally due to:
 ✷ additions to Imprints and Subscriber and customer relationships 
for the family law publishing assets of £1.3 million; and
 ✷ additions to product and systems development and assets 
under construction of £2.6 million (which includes Academic & 
Professional online knowledge hubs); less
 ✷ £3.9 million of amortisation offset by £0.5 million of exchange 
differences.
Inventories decreased 6% to £27.6 million (2015: £29.2 million). 
Stock levels have decreased across the Group following a Group- 
wide plan to reduce the level of stock. This is despite the US dollar 
strengthening in the year having the impact of increasing year  
end stock by £1.4 million.
Trade and other receivables were £72.5 million (2015: £61.7 million). 
There was an increase of £7.4 million in trade receivables from 
increased trading and an increase to accrued income of  
£1.6 million from other income deals. Corporation tax also moved 
into a net receivable position of £0.9 million due to the prior year 
adjustments noted in the taxation section above. Since books 
sold are generally returnable by customers, the Group makes a 
provision against books sold in the accounting year. The unused 
provision at the year end is then carried forward and offset against 
trade receivables in the balance sheet, in anticipation of further 
book returns subsequent to the year end. A provision for the 
Group of £5.8 million (2015: £6.1 million) for future returns relating 
to 2015/16 and prior year sales has been carried forward in trade 
receivables at the balance sheet date. This provision was 13% of 
gross trade receivables (2015: 16%), reflecting the higher level of 
returns within our Academic & Professional division and the Adult 
division’s year with fewer major bestsellers.

Stock Code: BMY
Equity and liabilities
At 29 February 2016 total equity was £133.0 million (2015:  
£124.2 million). The increase of £8.8 million was due to an increase 
of £3.2 million from cumulative currency translations (driven by  
the US dollar strengthening against the GB pound), the retained 
profit for the year of £9.7 million (2015: £8.7 million) after 
highlighted items of £2.7 million (2015: £2.5 million), offset by  
share-based payment transactions of £0.4 million (2015:  
£0.4 million) and dividends of £4.6 million (2015: £4.3 million).
Current liabilities decreased 10% to £38.5 million (2015:  
£42.6 million). Trade payables increased to £20.4 million (2015: 
£18.7 million) due to the timing of printing of key titles and the 
reclassification of royalties payable to authors for the six months  
to December from accruals. Accruals and deferred income, which 
is included in trade and other payables, decreased to £14.6 million 
(2015: £16.5 million). This includes deferred income on database 
contracts, subscription revenues and royalty payments due to 
authors, which vary year on year depending on revenue and 
authors’ royalty rates. Deferred income is up £0.6 million due to 
the purchase of the RELX and Jordan family law publishing assets. 
Royalty accruals due to authors are down due to reclassifying 
royalties payable to authors for the six months to December to 
trade payables. Other payables of £2.6 million (2015: £1.5 million) 
increased by £1.1 million which included £0.7 million of deferred 
and contingent acquisition consideration.
Non-current liabilities decreased by 19% to £3.8 million (2015:  
£4.7 million). The deferred tax liability of £2.7 million primarily 
relates to intangible assets arising on acquisitions. This is reducing 
as the relevant intangibles are amortised.
Cash 
Cash and cash equivalents were £5.2 million at the year end 
(2015: £10.0 million). The net cash inflow from operating activities, 
including the effect of highlighted items, was £5.0 million,  
£5.2 million down on 2014/15. This difference is principally due 
to the increase in Group trade and other receivables in the year. 
Investing activities for the year ended 29 February 2016 resulted 
in an outflow of £3.1 million (2014/15: £9.1 million), the difference 
largely due to the acquisition of Osprey last year and lower product 
and systems development investment this year. The net cash of  
£7.1 million used in financing activities was predominantly made 
up of dividend payments of £4.6 million (2014/15: £4.3 million) plus 
a £2.5 million repayment of the revolving credit facility during the 
year (2014/15: £2.5 million drawdown). 
Liquidity 
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility with Lloyds 
Bank plc. At 29 February 2016 the Group had at its disposal 
£14.1 million of undrawn borrowing facilities (2015: £13 million) 
comprising a £13.5 million committed revolving loan facility and 
£0.6 million undrawn on the overdraft. 
In May 2016 Bloomsbury extended the revolving credit facility with 
Lloyds Bank plc under new terms. The existing facility expires in  
July 2016 and the new facility will take over from then for a further 
five years. The new facility comprises a £14 million committed 
revolving loan facility, an uncommitted incremental term loan 
facility of up to £6 million and a £2 million overdraft facility. The 
overdraft facility is available until December 2016. All facilities are 
subject to two covenants, being a maximum net debt to EBITDA 
ratio and a minimum interest cover covenant. 
The Group’s net cash position changes over the course of the year 
as a result of the seasonality of the business with the most significant 
expenses being the payment of royalties in March and September 
and the most significant sale receipts being in February from the 
Christmas sales.

Risk Factors
O
utlined in the table on pages 34 and 35 is a description 
of risk factors that management considers are relevant 
to the Group’s business. Not all the factors are within 
management’s control and other factors besides 
those listed below could also affect the Group. Actions being taken 
by management to mitigate risk factors should be considered 
in conjunction with the cautioning note to Shareholders in the 
Directors’ Report on page 47 with regards to forward looking 
statements. Details on financial risk management are given in  
note 24. 
Viability statement
Provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code requires 
the Directors to assess the viability of the Group over a period 
significantly longer than 12 months from the date the financial 
statements are approved.
The Group prepares five-year projections developed from the long-
term plans for each of the global publishing divisions. As well as the 
existing backlist titles, the projections for the first three years of the 
plan are based on the future title, online platform and other income 
pipelines. There is inherently less certainty in years four and five.  
The Board therefore concludes that three years is an appropriate 
period for the viability statement.
The Group’s principal risks (see pages 34 to 35) and its approach 
to managing them have formed the basis for the assessment of 
longer-term viability. The Board believes the principal risks to 
viability are primarily:
 ✷ volatility of book sales for the consumer market;
 ✷ the increasing importance of internet retailing;
 ✷ volatility of closing rights and services deals; 
 ✷ changes that might occur to the digital book market; and 
 ✷ erosion of copyright.
We have developed plausible downside scenarios for each of these 
risk areas and quantified the impact on the Group’s revenue, profit 
and cash for each scenario. We evaluated all the principal risks 
below and focused our sensitivity analysis on the key risks.
Individual and multiple scenarios were overlaid on our three-year 
projections. Through this analysis, the Board concludes that the 
Group does not face a risk to longer-term viability except in the 
event of remote combinations of material events. The analysis took 
account of the Group’s current funding, forecast requirements and 
existing committed borrowing facilities.
Based on this assessment, the Board has a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period to 28 February 2019.

Overview of Bloomsbury’s processes
Bloomsbury is an independent publisher and has been listed on 
the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange since 1994. Over 
a period of almost 30 years the business has built up a substantial 
body of publishing rights.
The Group is structured as fully integrated worldwide publishing 
divisions  under a global brand supported by centralised sales, 
marketing, production and head office functions (this structure is 
named "One Global Bloomsbury"). Each publishing division reports 
to the Chief Executive. The Group encourages each publishing 
division to develop and grow diversified income streams. Each 
division has the capability to publish books in all formats but may 
also produce other products such as online content accessible 
through subscription. Each division may also use its expertise to 
provide publishing-related services to clients. 
Book publishing
Book publishing (e-books, printed books etc.) is the main activity  
of Bloomsbury. This generates two core income streams: book  
sales and rights sales. 
In competition with other publishers, Bloomsbury’s publishing 
teams acquire the intellectual property rights to publish the 
works of authors. Ultimately, the authors and their literary agents 
control which rights each publisher acquires. Bloomsbury focuses 
on publishing worldwide in English but getting the specific 
rights desired can entail acquiring an assortment of other rights. 
Bloomsbury re-sells on to other publishers any rights it does not 
need, which generates an income stream. When it makes financial 
sense, Bloomsbury also sells the publishing rights to titles in its 
extensive backlist e.g. for a book in a series published by another 
publisher which is valuable to them to complete the series.
Bloomsbury sells its own books typically through online retailers 
such as Amazon, through bookshops, through supermarkets and 
direct to customers.
Bloomsbury’s global production function produces books in all 
formats. Bloomsbury has produced e-books since 2005 and as an 
early adopter benefited from the worldwide growth in e-book sales. 
Printed books that are sold through retail outlets are normally sold 
on a sale-or-return basis. The Group does not print its own books 
but subcontracts the printing, warehouse storage and distribution 
of printed books to a number of long-term global partners.
Positioning the business towards non-consumer 
revenues 
Bloomsbury is a cash generative business and has enjoyed the 
benefit of publishing many bestselling titles over a prolonged 
period. Bloomsbury has balanced its core consumer book 
publishing business with academic and professional publishing.  
This addresses a number of risks: 
 ✷ Long-term growth potential, less sales volatility and higher 
margins: The demand for academic and professional books is 
more regular which reduces the volatility of book sales compared 
to consumer book sales; 
 ✷ Barriers to entry: Since acquiring Methuen Drama in 2006, 
Bloomsbury has continuously invested in growing its academic 
publishing business through organic growth and acquisitions 
of publishing businesses, lists of academic books and online 
databases. The time, cost and expertise required to build up an 
academic publisher acts as a barrier to entry for significant new 
competitors; 
 ✷ Exploiting intellectual property: Bloomsbury is developing 
innovative academic online products which are sold under 
annual subscriptions and which exploit the Group’s content 
assets and expertise; and 
 ✷ Lower risk: Academic publishing acquisitions require lower 
advances to authors.
Growth in emerging markets 
India has one of the world’s largest English-speaking populations 
and an increasing number of highly educated readers of English. 
Bloomsbury has a growing publishing business in India that 
publishes the works of local talented authors in addition to the 
works of Bloomsbury authors with works originally published in  
the UK and US.

Risk Factors
Principal Risks
The table below provides a description of risk factors that management considers relevant to the Group's business. Other factors besides 
those listed could also affect the Group.
During the financial year ended 29 February 2016 the principal risks have not changed substantially.
Key area Risk Description Mitigation
Market Volatility of consumer 
book sales 
Sales of books to the consumer 
market can be seasonal and 
volatile
Develop special interest, academic and 
professional publishing where revenues are less 
volatile
Develop other revenue streams, including from 
rights and services, increasing the scope to enter 
annually renewing agreements
Increased dependence 
on internet retailing
Readers might not discover, and 
so buy, Bloomsbury’s print and 
e-books sold through internet 
retailers
Grow expert marketing teams skilled in internet 
sales
Engage with multiple internet retailers
Increase focus on developing other marketing 
opportunities and other revenue streams, e.g. 
A&P digital products, rights and services
Grow e-book sales
Rights and 
services
Volatility of timing 
of closing rights and 
services deals
The timing for completing high 
margin rights and services deals 
can depend on the performance 
by multiple parties including the 
main customer
Increase the number of rights and services deals 
to reduce the dependency on individual deals
Generating new/non-
renewal of subscription 
and services 
agreements
The pipeline of new products and 
agreements might be uneven
A customer or partner might not 
renew larger agreements that 
generate significant ongoing 
income
Senior managers are responsible for ensuring 
strong performance by Bloomsbury of its 
obligations and strong customer care
Increase the portfolio of products and 
agreements to grow income and reduce the 
dependency on individual agreements
Entrepreneurial risk A deal may require upfront staff 
time and costs but fail to close 
resulting in lost investment
Similar to ordinary publishing risks: increase the 
portfolio of deals to leverage economies of scale 
and absorb volatility
Move to digital Development of the 
digital book market
Consumer e-book prices may not 
hold up in the longer term
Possible emergence of not yet 
known reading technology, e.g. 
involving subscription services for 
consumer books
Continue to supply books in all formats through 
multiple digital delivery systems aligned with the 
demands of readers
Ensure the Group is positioned to take advantage 
of e-book (or any new format) growth in 
international markets
Use social media and other digital marketing to 
encourage direct sales to consumers
Develop non-consumer offering where revenues 
are less volatile and there is a direct relationship 
with the customers

Corporate Responsibility
T
he following section provides an outline of Bloomsbury’s 
work as a good corporate citizen. More examples of 
the contribution to this made by our global publishing 
divisions is provided in the Group Overview on pages  
16 to 23.
Our literary and literacy heart
Bloomsbury’s core business is the worldwide promulgation and 
promotion of literature, literacy and information for readers of 
all ages, which has a high social value. The Group has a significant 
beneficial social impact globally through sales of e-books and print 
books and access to online resources that are embraced by many 
adults and children in all walks of life. 
Our ethos
We aim for integrity in all our activities, consider our impact on 
society and the environment and maintain high ethical standards. 
This is key to our commercial success and ability to deliver good 
returns to our Shareholders, which depends on attracting and 
retaining talented authors who want us to publish them and on 
products for which there is a significant demand.
The Board recognises that the achievements of the Group have 
depended upon the high standards of social responsibility 
demonstrated by the Directors and employees for more than 25 
years. The Board takes account of the relevant social, environmental 
and ethical issues and associated risks and opportunities to the 
Group’s short-term and long-term value. The Company continues 
to be included in the FTSE4Good index.
Community 
Bloomsbury has a significant direct beneficial impact on the 
community through its commercial activities. Our publishing teams 
share a common passion for promoting the enjoyment of reading 
and high quality literature that is often cutting edge and provides 
new authors with opportunities to establish themselves. We have a 
substantial Children’s & Educational division focused on promoting 
literacy for young readers of all abilities and ages, including 
specialist ranges for ‘Hi-Low’ pupils (high age, low attainment) 
which provide parents and teachers with the tools needed to 
engage their children in reading.
Support by Bloomsbury
In addition to our direct commercial activities and with a focus 
mainly on promoting literature, literacy and education, we actively 
support numerous organisations worldwide including schools, 
universities, libraries and other good causes and charities. The 
following examples illustrate the range of our support worldwide:
Corporate volunteering and educational 
development
 ✷ Our growing collaboration between Methuen Drama and Prison 
Reading Groups (PRG) is supporting and encouraging the 
reading of plays by the inmate community within an increasing 
number of HM prisons. For example, we provide gratis copies of 
the books and arrange for playwrights and authors to visit the 
prisons to run drama workshops.
 ✷ A Bloomsbury UK employee recently travelled to Nigeria to train 
170 teachers on the importance of reading and how to set up an 
effective classroom library.
 ✷ Our Australia office supports the Indigenous Literacy Foundation 
with fundraising and time given for administrative support. 
Our India office in partnership with the Hope Foundation 
recently published Ten Steps To Good Health, a guide for children 
particularly in schools in non-urban areas. The book is promoted 
through the India state education system for distribution to 
school children. 
 ✷ Bloomsbury’s Chief Executive is President of Book Aid 
International that gifts approximately 500,000 books a year to 
libraries in Africa.
 ✷ We provide work experience days for secondary school pupils, 
have sponsored achievement prizes for students within US and 
UK universities and invite students to visit us for presentations on 
working in publishing.
Corporate donating
 ✷ Our Australia, US and UK offices donate, or provide at a reduced 
cost, a substantial quantity of books each year, which includes 
donations of mainstream titles to schools and libraries, e.g. by our 
US office to the White House supported Open e-Books scheme 
that gives underprivileged students access to ebooks. Other 
book donations worldwide have been to good causes such as 
to Book Trust, Barnardos, Oxfam, Red Cross, Salvation Army and 
smaller organisations local to our offices worldwide; e.g. our UK 
office donated books to an appeal for children living in poverty 
in London, our Adlard Coles Nautical imprint donates sea-related 
books to the RNLI for fundraising and our Australia office donated 
books to the NSW Red Cross Bush Fire Appeal amongst others.
 ✷ The Bloomsbury Institute (the events function of Bloomsbury) 
organises charitable fundraising events such as for Book Aid and 
to celebrate International Women’s Day, with guest speakers who 
have included Bob Geldof, William Boyd and Aminatta Forna. Our 
Writers & Artists team organises masterclasses to raise money for 
Book Aid International.
 ✷ We support good causes that promote literacy and literature; e.g. 
we are a sponsor and partner with World Book Day, which was 
established by UNESCO to promote reading amongst children 
and adults, and our Australia office supports a major award that 
celebrates Australian women’s writing.

We make a small number of targeted minor cash donations each 
year predominantly to not-for-profit organisations that support 
literature, literacy and education, which in recent years has 
included to Book Aid International, the Independent Publishers 
Guild, The Charleston Trust and Woodland Trust.
Support by employees of Bloomsbury 
We encourage the spare time involvement of staff worldwide in 
supporting good causes and in the promotion of literature, literacy 
and education. These voluntary activities by employees are often 
directly or indirectly assisted by the business and by Bloomsbury 
colleagues. Examples of the many such activities recently 
undertaken are as follows.
Staff volunteering
 ✷ A significant number (over 30) of our employees worldwide, both 
through a Bloomsbury coordinator and privately, are involved in 
formal volunteer reading schemes and regularly attend schools 
in the UK and US. These provide supervised reading support to 
young readers often from disadvantaged backgrounds where 
their opportunities to develop reading skills may be hindered. 
 ✷ Bloomsbury employees attend schools and colleges to give 
talks which have included on careers, such as in publishing and 
IT, and on reading skills required in the workplace. They have 
also assisted young people with interview practice and school 
magazines.
 ✷ In their spare time, employees are unpaid public speakers 
at presentations, and have published articles and hosted 
discussions, on various publishing topics such as Open Access, 
how to write books and be published and careers in publishing.
 ✷ In our offices worldwide the employees volunteer regularly to 
help their local communities and to assist good causes such as for 
homeless and vulnerably housed people and for providing meals 
to sick and disadvantaged people.
Many employees worldwide are involved in their local communities 
promoting literacy, literature and education, such as by sitting on 
committees or as governors of schools and by supporting special 
interest groups: e.g. a Bloomsbury employee has established a 
scholarship scheme for a US University.
Staff donating
Bloomsbury employees worldwide often call on their colleagues 
for fundraising sponsorship such as with marathons, cake sales 
and many other employee-inspired activities. Our offices will put 
up teams to participate in events: e.g. an Australia office employee 
participated in Diabetes Walk for Cure.
Diversity
We have a diverse workforce and management team led by 
a gender diverse Board. The majority of senior managers and 
employees worldwide in the Group are women. As at 29 February 
2016 the numbers of employees by each sex is:
Female Male

Corporate Responsibility
Employees and human rights
We recognise that people are a key asset and employment policies 
are directed at creating a workplace that attracts, motivates, 
develops and retains high calibre employees.
Supported by territory heads of human resources, the managing 
directors of the four publishing divisions, the heads of each 
Group function and managing directors of regional offices have 
responsibility for the employment matters (including human 
rights) of their teams. The Chief Executive has overall Board level 
responsibility for employment matters. For example, where 
employment matters have a Group-wide impact or cannot be 
resolved at a lower level in the business then they may be referred 
to the Chief Executive. 
Key features of the Group’s employment policies and practices are: 
 ✷ Openness: Bloomsbury provides a high degree of openness 
and transparency on its activities and performance through 
information provided to employees. Employees are kept updated 
frequently on sales, book releases, project achievements, 
internal newsletters, corporate news and feedback from external 
media and other sources. The Bloomsbury Institute arranges 
regular events, which enable staff to meet socially. Weekly and 
other regular team meetings and internal annual conferences 
bring employees together from across the Group’s worldwide 
sites allowing team members to formally and informally share 
information about the business and develop strong working 
relationships. 
 ✷ Engagement: we promote a friendly collegiate culture in which 
employees are encouraged to discuss their concerns and issues 
with their line managers and senior colleagues. The senior 
management team meets frequently to discuss employee matters 
and is supported by regular operational meetings attended by 
managers covering all of the Group’s worldwide sites. 
 ✷ Ethical behaviour: we expect employees, Directors, 
subcontractors and others to exercise the highest ethical 
standards at all times in respect of the relationships and dealings 
that Bloomsbury has with other third parties. Bloomsbury at  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk publishes:
 — Whistleblower procedures, which it publishes to enable 
employees, other categories of workers and third parties to 
have their concerns confidentially addressed; and
 — Ethical behaviour Group policies such as for anti-bribery and 
corruption, dealing in Bloomsbury shares and anti-slavery 
and human trafficking. Compliance with these policies is an 
employment term with Bloomsbury.
 ✷ Employee development: Bloomsbury is acquisitive and has 
benefited from an intake of high calibre entrepreneurs who 
support the Group’s capacity to innovate. The Group develops 
its management structure to serve the changing needs of the 
business. This creates opportunities for suitably high calibre 
individuals to progress to increasing levels of seniority as they 
gain capabilities and expertise. External recruitment is supported 
by territorial Human Resources functions enabling vacancies 
across sites worldwide to be filled internally where employees of 
an appropriately high calibre seek new opportunities. 
 ✷ Performance and merit: senior employees agree personal 
objectives and are rewarded based on performance determined 
by business results and appraisals. Senior managers are 
accountable for the performance of their teams and determine 
the most appropriate approach to performance management 
for each team. Promotions and external recruitment are based 
on merit and ensure that the most suitable person is selected for 
each position. 
 ✷ Employee participation: the Group offers UK employees the 
opportunity to participate in an all employee HM Revenue and 
Customs approved Sharesave scheme to encourage employee 
participation in the performance and growth of the Group. High 
performing senior managers may also be eligible to participate 
in the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan. 
 ✷ Flexible working: we encourage family friendly working 
practices such as flexible working hours and recognise that 
experienced employees returning to work following maternity, 
paternity or other career breaks are an asset. 
 ✷ Equality of opportunity: Bloomsbury has a diverse workforce 
and follows a policy that no employee or other person receives 
more or less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, 
sexual orientation, colour, race and ethnic origin, nationality, 
religion, disability or age. This extends to any person known 
to be HIV positive. The Human Resources function monitors 
compliance with the policy and with applicable legislative 
requirements to ensure the equality of opportunity in the 
recruitment, selection and promotion of employees. Grievance 
and disciplinary procedures protect employees from 
discriminatory behaviours and attitudes.

 ✷ Disabled persons: Group policy is to offer equal treatment in 
respect of the recruitment, training, career development and 
promotion of disabled persons. Should people become disabled 
during the course of their employment, the Group will seek to 
retain their services and to provide retraining where necessary. 
 ✷ Human rights: Bloomsbury is committed to meeting its 
responsibility to respect human rights. The regional human 
resources managers monitor for human rights issues and 
ensure any remedial action that is needed is taken promptly. 
Bloomsbury is committed to complying with employment and 
other legislation applicable to the locations in which it employs 
people, ensuring the human rights of individuals are protected. 
Health and safety
The Company Secretary reporting to the Chief Executive in respect 
of Health and Safety ("H&S") heads an H&S team that ensures 
Group-wide compliance with H&S policy. At least annually, the main 
Board and senior team review H&S including risks assessments, 
developments and incident reports. The H&S team works closely 
with management and employees to ensure that the H&S policy is 
effectively communicated, implemented and maintained across  
the business. Managers of the worldwide sites are accountable  
for ensuring their areas of the business are in compliance with  
H&S policy.
The Group maintains H&S risk assessments and accident books 
for all its locations worldwide (including where there is no local 
legal requirement to do so) and staff are encouraged to report all 
accidents or near misses. 
During the year there were no serious injuries, fatalities or 
reportable incidents. Accidents have typically included infrequent 
bumps and scalds from hot drinks associated with the office 
environment.
Environment 
The Board recognises that a responsible approach to the 
environment is attractive to the Group’s existing and prospective 
stakeholders. Customers can require Bloomsbury to demonstrate 
that the Group is a good corporate citizen during the tender 
process for new and existing contracts. 
The Executive Committee (which consists of the Executive Directors 
and the managing directors of the publishing divisions and Group 
functions) have responsibility for environmental matters of their 
teams. These people report to the Chief Executive who has overall 
Board level responsibility for environmental matters and issues. 
The impact on the environment of our business predominantly 
arises from the activities the Group subcontracts to its suppliers 
including the printing, production, distribution, recycling and 
disposal of printed books. Bloomsbury also has office-based 
editorial, product development, sales and administrative activities, 
which operate through an employee workforce based at offices in 
the UK, US (New York), India (New Delhi) and Australia (Sydney). 
Our policy is to reduce both the financial cost to the business 
and the impact of the business on the environment. We employ 
specialist independent external advisors, Trucost, to monitor 
our impact on the environment. Key areas where we are active 
in reducing the direct and indirect environmental impact of the 
business include: 
 ✷ Online print: we are increasingly moving to e-books and online 
products that have very little environmental impact and will 
save on using natural resources. Our strategy embraces digital 
publishing and the potential benefits this may bring to the 
environment. 
 ✷ Book manufacture: we require all of our contracted print 
suppliers, worldwide, to be FSC-certified and we make regular 
trips to their factories to monitor their recycling and other locally 
relevant environmental initiatives. These visits also provide 
an opportunity to view employment practices at first hand, 
including employee minimum age and working conditions. 
Other required accreditations to act as a supplier to the Group 
are ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. Where the manufacture/handling 
of novelty items is involved, e.g. on our Children’s lists, we also 
require ICTI accreditation. 
 ✷ Building and office facilities: most of our employees travel to 
work by public transport and we support part-time and home-
working. We provide bicycle storage for staff who ride to work. 
For most employees we have implemented separate recycling 
bins for different waste materials so that a significant proportion 
of our office waste is recycled. Lights are generally fitted with 
motion detectors and our office policy is to turn off lights out of 
hours when not in use. 
We have previously taken advice from the Carbon Trust and 
continue to apply their recommendations to reduce our carbon 
footprint. For example, we use point of use instead of bottled 
water coolers, fit energy efficient lamps, ensure heating systems 
are regularly maintained and programmed efficiently and turn 
off unnecessary electrical equipment out of hours amongst other 
measures.

Corporate Responsibility
Environmental targets 
We aim to beat the greenhouse gas and waste production 
normalised tonnes per £m revenue averaged for the previous 
two years. By setting such a target we are focused on continuously 
increasing our efficiency at using natural resources.
Our direct operations are predominantly office-based and have been 
independently assessed as having a low impact on the environment. 
The Group’s consumption of natural resources, although relatively 
minor, is significantly impacted by ambient weather conditions 
beyond our control and by the buildings we lease. 
Greenhouse gases
Our independent external advisor, Trucost, has calculated the 
tables below based on data we have provided. We report on our 
waste production and greenhouse gas emissions aligning with 
the 2006 Government Guidelines, Environmental Key Performance 
Indicators, Reporting Guidelines for UK Businesses. In respect of 
greenhouse gases, we report consumption of natural gas, vehicle 
fuel and electricity in kWh, converted to CO
2
-e following the 
protocols provided by the Department for Environment, Food and 
Rural affairs (DEFRA). Emissions have been categorised against the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol scopes of reporting. This information is 
unaudited.
The Board reviews the emissions and environmental impact of the 
Group as a formal agenda item at least annually. During the year 
CO
2
 emissions for the Group rose primarily due to the addition of 
the Oxford premises that came with Osprey Publishing acquisition. 
The Group's two Oxford premises have been consolidated during 
2016 into a single building which we expect will improve the Group's 
emissions.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE
Details of Directors’ service contracts and Directors’ interests 
in shares, awards and options are shown in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 74. Other than as disclosed 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, none of the Directors held 
any interest, either during or at the end of the financial year in 
any material contract or arrangement with the Company or any 
subsidiary undertaking. The terms of termination of the Directors’ 
contracts are described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report set 
out in pages 58 to 74, which includes details of any agreements by 
which the Company would pay compensation to its Directors for 
loss of office, for loss of employment or would make payments in 
respect of a change of control of the Company.
Company policy is to appoint Directors to the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee. This may be as 
part of the progressive refreshing of the Board, to reappoint a 
Director retiring by rotation, to fill a vacancy arising as a result of a 
retiring Director or as part of measures taken to enhance the skills, 
experience, capability and balance of the Board. 
Directors retiring by rotation at an Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) may offer themselves for re-election at the AGM. The 
Company’s Articles of Association (the “Articles”) require as a 
minimum:
 ✷ new Directors appointed by the Board must offer themselves for 
election at the next AGM;
 ✷ any Director who did not stand for re-election in either of the two 
preceding AGMs must retire by rotation at the next AGM; and 
 ✷ one third of Directors who have remained in office for the longest 
period since being elected or re-elected must retire by rotation 
at the AGM.
The Board applies the FTSE350 best practice and requires all 
directors to stand for re-election.
The Chairman on behalf of the Board confirms that each Director 
proposed for re-election at the AGM continues to contribute 
effectively and to demonstrate commitment to the role (including 
commitment of time for Board and committee meetings and any 
other duties).
Directors’ indemnities and insurance 
In accordance with the Articles, Directors are granted an indemnity 
from the Company to the extent permitted by law in respect of 
liabilities incurred as a result of their office. The Group maintained 
insurance throughout the year for its Directors and Officer (the 
Company Secretary) against the consequences of actions brought 
against them in relation to their duties for the Group. 
Director conflicts of interest 
Procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the Directors’ 
conflict of interest duties set out in the Companies Act 2006. 
These procedures have been complied with during the year and 
the Board considers that these procedures operate effectively. 
During the year, details of any new potential conflict matters were 
submitted to the Board for consideration and, where appropriate, 
these were approved. Authorised conflicts or potential conflict 
matters will be reviewed by the Board on an ongoing basis.
Charitable and political donations
The Group made charitable donations of £4,009 in respect of the 
year (2015: £4,621). Details of the non-cash support given by the 
charitable and voluntary activities of the Company are as set out in 
the Corporate Responsibility section on pages 36 to 41. 
No political donations were made by the Group during the current 
or previous year. 
Financial instruments 
Details of financial risk management are given in note 24. 
Share capital and rights attaching to the 
Company’s shares 
The share capital of the Company comprises a single class of 
ordinary 1.25p shares ("Ordinary shares"). During the year the 
Company allotted new shares as follows:
Fully paid Ordinary 
shares in issue Reason for allotment
As at 1 March 2015 75,003,734
Allotted 15 January 2016 77,443 2012 LTIP exercise
As at 29 February 2016 75,081,177
As at the date of this Directors’ Report, there were 75,081,177 fully 
paid issued shares, all listed on the London Stock Exchange, with a 
further 24,921,301 Ordinary shares that the Directors are authorised 
to issue. 
Details of the issued share capital of the Company can be found 
in note 21 together with details of the shares issued and cancelled 
during the year. 
No Ordinary shares carry special rights with regard to control of the 
Company. At a general meeting of the Company every member 
has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll one vote for each 
share held. The notice of general meeting specifies deadlines for 
exercising voting rights either by proxy or present in person in 
relation to resolutions to be passed at a general meeting.
Under the Articles, any share in the Company may be issued with 
such rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, 
return of capital or otherwise as the Company may from time to 
time by ordinary resolution determine (or, in the absence of any 
such determination, as the Directors may determine). 
No Shareholder is, unless the Board decides otherwise, entitled to 
attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general meeting 
or to exercise any other rights conferred by being a Shareholder 
if he or she or any person with an interest in shares has been sent 
a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 (which 
confers upon public companies the power to require information 
with respect to interests in their voting shares) and he or she or

Directors’ Report
any interested person failed to supply the Company with the 
information requested within 14 days after delivery of that notice. 
The Board may also decide to apply to the court for an order 
under section 794 of the Companies Act 2006 so that no dividend 
is payable in respect of those default shares and that no transfer of 
any default shares shall be registered. These restrictions end seven 
days after receipt by the Company of a notice of an approved 
transfer of the shares or all the information required by the relevant 
section 793 notice, whichever is earlier. 
The Directors may refuse to register any transfer which is not a fully 
paid share, although such discretion may not be exercised in a 
way which the Financial Conduct Authority regards as preventing 
dealing in the shares of that class from taking place on an open 
proper basis. The Directors may likewise refuse any transfer of a 
share in favour of more than four persons jointly. 
The Company is not aware of any other restrictions in the transfer 
of Ordinary shares in the Company other than certain restrictions 
that may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for 
example, insider trading laws); and pursuant to the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Conduct Authority whereby certain employees of the 
Group require approval of the Company to deal in the Company’s 
shares. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
Shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of the 
securities or voting rights. 
Share dilution 
In respect of dilution limits, the Company adheres to “Investment 
Association principles of remuneration” issued 11 November 2015. 
In particular: 
 ✷ The rules of the Company’s LTIP scheme ensure that; 
 — commitments to issue new shares or re-issue treasury shares 
under executive (discretionary) schemes do not exceed 
5% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company 
(adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) in any rolling 
ten-year period; and
 — commitments to issue new shares or re-issue treasury shares, 
when aggregated with awards under all of the Company’s 
other schemes, do not exceed 10% of the issued Ordinary 
share capital (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) in 
any rolling ten-year period.
 ✷ The Remuneration Committee ensures that appropriate policies 
regarding flow-rates exist in order to spread the potential issue of 
new shares over the life of relevant schemes so that the limit is not 
breached. 
As set out below in this report, the Bloomsbury Employee Benefit 
Trust purchases shares in the market to be used for satisfying LTIP 
awards and other employee share options that vest. 
Authorities to purchase shares, to allot shares and 
pre-emption rights 
Notice of the 2016 Annual General Meeting and explanatory 
foreword to the meeting on pages 132 to 138 form part of the 
Directors’ Report and set out: 
 ✷ an ordinary resolution renewing the authority for the Directors to 
allot shares under section 551 of the Companies Act; 
 ✷ a special resolution renewing the authority given to the Directors 
to disapply statutory pre-emption rights under section 571 of that 
Act to allow shares to be issued for cash or treasury shares to be 
sold for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis; and 
 ✷ a special resolution renewing the authority given to the Directors 
to purchase the Company’s own shares on the stock market. 
Employee Benefit Trust 
Throughout the financial year, Elian Employee Benefit Trustee 
Limited (“Trustee”) acted as the trustee of the Bloomsbury 
Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”). 
During the year the EBT held Ordinary shares of 1.25 pence in the 
Company as follows:
Fully paid Ordinary 
shares held by EBT Comment
As at 1 March 2015 268,293
(84,739) Sharesave exercise
(177,762) 2012 LTIP excercise
As at 29 February 2016 5,792
As at 29 February 2016 the EBT held 5,792 Ordinary shares of  
1.25 pence in the Company being less than 0.1% of the issued 
Ordinary share capital. Between 29 February 2016 and signing of 
this report the EBT acquired 500,000 Ordinary shares in the market 
bringing the total holding after the exercise of Sharesave options  
to 500,269 (0.67%) shares. The Trustee may vote on shares held by 
the EBT at its discretion, but waives its right to a dividend. 
Share purchases of own shares 
During the year, the Company made no purchases of its own shares.

Changes of control 
The Group has established close relationships over a long period 
within the publishing markets in which it operates. It relies heavily 
on its goodwill and reputation and in particular on its reputation 
as an autonomous independent publisher with authors, customers 
and key employees that could be affected by a change of control.
The Company’s share incentive schemes contain provisions relating 
to a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid 
(see note 22 for further details of the share incentive schemes). 
Under these provisions, a change of control of the Company would 
normally be a vesting event, facilitating the exercise of awards, 
typically subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Contracts and arrangements essential to the 
business 
The Group has a diverse base of authors, customers and general 
suppliers so that its dependency on any one individual author, 
customer or supplier is reduced. Primarily for printed books, the 
Group develops longer-term relationships with a reduced number 
of business partners, printers and distributors to maximise process 
efficiencies and economies of scale. Failure of a main supplier 
could temporarily disrupt the supply of books to market or result 
in increased cost of working whilst alternative arrangements are 
made. 
The Group depends on its reputation which strongly influences 
authors and customers in their selection of publisher.
Future developments 
The Group intends to continue to develop its range of publishing 
businesses and services. Although the primary focus of the Group  
is on organic growth, acquisitions in these areas of business will  
be considered. 
Cautionary statement 
Under s417 of the Companies Act 2006, a company’s Directors’ 
Report is required, among other matters, to contain a fair review 
by the Directors of the Group’s business through a balanced and 
comprehensive analysis of the development and performance 
of the business of the Group and the position of the Group at the 
period end, consistent with the size and complexity of the business. 
The Directors’ Report together with all sections incorporated into 
it by reference has been prepared only for the Shareholders of 
the Company. Its sole purpose and use is to assist Shareholders to 
exercise their governance rights. In particular, the Directors’ Report 
has not been audited or otherwise independently verified. The 
Company and its Directors and employees are not responsible for 
any other purpose or use or to any other person in relation to the 
Directors’ Report. 
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely future 
developments and other forward looking statements that are 
subject to risk factors associated with, among other things, the 
economic and business circumstances occurring from time to 
time in the sectors, countries and business divisions in which the 
Group operates. These factors include, but are not limited to, those 
discussed under Risk Factors on pages 32 to 35. These and other 
factors could adversely affect the Group’s results, strategy and 
prospects. Forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties 
and assumptions. They relate to events and/or depend on 
circumstances in the future which could cause actual results and 
outcomes to differ materially from those currently anticipated. No 
obligation is assumed to update any forward looking statements, 
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
Auditor 
a) Reappointment of the Auditor 
A resolution to reappoint KPMG LLP as Auditor will be proposed at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
b) Statement as to disclosure of information  
to the Auditor 
The Directors who were in office on the date of approval of these 
financial statements have confirmed that, as far as they are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the Auditor is 
unaware. The Directors have each confirmed that they have taken 
all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that it has been communicated to the Auditor. 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
Bloomsbury Publishing AR2016 Strategic and Governance.indd   47 14/06/2016   10:27:10 48

Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Directors’ Report
have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements 
on the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company 
and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and parent Company financial statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
 ✷ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 ✷ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 ✷ state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU; and 
 ✷ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent Company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. Legislation in the 
UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We consider the Annual Report and accounts, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.  
Annual General Meeting 
The notice of the 2016 Annual General Meeting of Bloomsbury 
Publishing Plc is set out on pages 135 to 138 and an explanation of 
the resolutions to be put to Shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 19 July 2016 is set out on pages 132 to 134 which forms 
part of this Directors’ Report. 
Safe harbour
Under the Companies Act 2006, a safe harbour limits the liability 
of Directors in respect of statements in and omissions from the 
Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. Pages 1 to 138 of 
the Annual Report are included within the Directors’ Report by 
reference and so are included within the safe harbour.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect 
of the annual financial report 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 ✷ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 ✷ the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. 
The Strategic Report and Directors' Report were approved by the 
Board on 13 June 2016.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE
Corporate Governance
T
he Board takes its responsibility to achieve sound 
governance of the Bloomsbury Group seriously and 
continuously maintains high standards of corporate 
governance that focus on serving the interests of the shareholders. 
Confirmation of compliance with the code 
The UK Corporate Governance Code edition issued September 
2014 (the “Code”) is published on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website (www.frc.org.uk). 
The Company has complied fully throughout the year with the 
provisions of the Code in addition to the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Conduct Authority. 
The following sections provide information on how the Company 
has applied the Code principles and adhered to Code provisions.
Board and the Directors
Board effectiveness 
The Board is responsible to the Shareholders for ensuring that 
the Company is appropriately managed and that it achieves its 
objectives. The Board determines the strategy for the Group and 
sets and monitors targets for the management team to achieve  
the strategy. 
The Board comprises the Independent Non-Executive Chairman, 
Senior Independent Director, a further two Independent Non-
Executive Directors, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director and 
two further Executive Directors. The biographies of the Directors 
appear on pages 42 and 43. 
The agendas for all main Board meetings provide standing items 
for each Director to provide updates on areas of their responsibility 
and items for the Chairs of each Board committee to update  
the Board. 
The Board has approved the matters specifically reserved 
for consideration by the Board. The Board determines the 
responsibilities and authority of its committees, individual Directors 
and the level of authorities delegated to management. The Audit 
Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee 
have terms of reference approved by the Board that can be found 
on the Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
Matters considered at Board meetings during the year have 
typically included: 
 ✷ review and setting of strategy for the Company’s operations; 
 ✷ review of the management accounts, short and long-term 
forecasts, key performance indicators and full year forecasts; 
 ✷ approval of the annual and interim results statements; 
 ✷ review and approval of the annual budget; 
 ✷ regular reports by the Chief Executive, proposals and updates on 
developing business operations, significant investments, major 
initiatives, other organisational changes, environmental impact 
of the business and health and safety;
 ✷ reports of the chairs of Board committees and minutes following 
committee and subcommittee meetings; 
 ✷ review and approval of decisions, transactions and sensitive 
policies that are significant to the Company such as dividends, 
the organisational, legal and capital structure of the Company, 
acquisitions of literary titles, businesses and companies and major 
contracts;
 ✷ risk management and review of the risks of the Company; and 
 ✷ evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board including the 
appropriateness of the terms of reference of Board committees. 
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the 
Company, with the Chairman responsible for the effective 
operation of the Board, encouraging the active participation of 
all Directors, and the Chief Executive responsible for the strategic 
running of the Company’s businesses. The Board has approved 
formal statements describing the role and remit of both the 
Chairman and Chief Executive, which further emphasise this division 
of responsibilities and can be found at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk .
The Executive Directors regularly hold formal meetings with senior 
managers as a management team to assist the Chief Executive in 
fulfilling his operational and strategic objectives. This management 
team makes recommendations to the Board and seeks approval 
from the Board where required. The Non-Executive Directors 
constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy 
and proposed corporate initiatives such as acquisitions at meetings 
specifically set up for the purpose attended by all Board members. 
All Directors and Board committees have access to the advice and 
services of the Group Company Secretary, who is responsible for 
ensuring that Board procedures are followed and advising the 
Board, through the Chairman, on governance matters and best 
practices. Directors also have access to independent professional 
advice, if required, at the Company’s expense. 
The Chairman has held meetings during the year with the Non-
Executive Directors without the Executive Directors present to 
discuss relevant matters. 
Conflicts of interest procedures
A standing item on Board agendas at the start of meetings is 
for Directors to disclose their significant interests. The Board has 
reviewed the interests of the Directors and maintains a register of 
areas of conflict of interest for Directors. In accordance with the 
Board’s formal policy, should a matter arise where there is a risk of 
a conflict in the Board discussing matters or making decisions then 
the Director affected by the conflict will absent themselves from the 
room whilst the matter is considered.

Board evaluation 
The Board conducts a formal evaluation annually that considers 
the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
of the Board, its diversity including gender, how the Board works 
together as a unit and other factors relevant to its effectiveness. 
The evaluation reviews the progress made by the Board with 
developing strategy and with the underlying processes supporting 
the effective operation of the Board including the quality of 
information it receives. 
The evaluation of the Board and of each individual Director is 
through: 
 ✷ one-to-one interviews by the Chairman, using evaluation 
questionnaires to facilitate discussion, of each Director to 
appraise the performance of the Director on the Board and to 
discuss any improvements needed to the Board processes;
 ✷ the Senior Independent Director evaluates the performance of 
the Chairman through confidential discussions with the other 
Directors and a one-to-one interview with the Chairman;
 ✷ the chair of each Board committee leads the evaluation of their 
committee and reports the findings and recommendations  
to the Board;

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE
The conclusions of the Board evaluations are considered by 
the Nomination Committee when reviewing the structure and 
composition of the Board and succession planning. As a result of 
the review of performance, the Chairman on behalf of the Board 
confirms that each of the Directors proposed for re-election at 
the AGM continues to contribute effectively and to demonstrate 
commitment to the role (including commitment of time for Board 
and committee meetings and any other duties). 
Examples of the matters arising from the 2015/16 Board and 
committee evaluations include:
 ✷ The Board is working well; new Directors have settled in and are 
making effective contributions.
 ✷ More Board time should be given to risk and mitigation.
 ✷ In view of the increasing delivery of our content digitally and the 
expansion of A&P digital content products and sales processes 
under Bloomsbury 2020, Board refreshing should take account of 
the need for new relevant expertise.
 ✷ Increased Board time should be spent on discussing the 
development of talent in the levels below the Board.
Relations with Shareholders 
The Board led by the Chairman is responsible for ensuring an open 
dialogue with Shareholders based on the mutual understanding of 
objectives. 
The Annual Report, interim reports, AGM, market updates and 
post-results announcement presentations are the principal means 
through which the Company communicates its strategy and 
performance to Shareholders. All Shareholders are welcome to 
attend the AGM, at which senior managers give presentations on 
the business and investors are encouraged to take advantage of 
the opportunity given to ask questions. The chairs of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees attend the AGM and 
are available to answer questions.
The Company maintains an active dialogue with its institutional 
Shareholders and City analysts through a planned programme of 
investor relations. The programme includes formal presentations 
of results and post-results meetings with the major Shareholders 
and other investors who request meetings. The presentations are 
made available at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The meetings and 
presentations provide an opportunity for Shareholders to ask 
questions and to meet Directors. The outcome of regular meetings 
with the main Shareholders, presentations and post-results meetings 
is reported to the Board. This includes both feedback from individual 
Directors and feedback collated from discussions by the Company’s 
corporate broker or public relations representative with the main 
Shareholders and City analysts. The Company’s corporate broker 
provides regular analysis of Shareholder holdings. Feedback from 
Shareholders and other members of the Shareholder corporate 
governance community is used to help review and develop 
Bloomsbury’s procedures. 
The Chairman writes to the major Shareholders each year to 
provide Shareholders with the opportunity to discuss corporate 
governance matters, including remuneration, and to raise any 
concerns. Following the meetings the Chairman reports to the 
Board on the discussions held including any feedback from the 
Shareholders.
Training and development of the Directors 
The Board evaluation including Director appraisals by the Chairman 
considers whether each Director has refreshed their skills and 
knowledge sufficiently and provides an opportunity for Directors 
to identify where training and development can assist them in 
the performance of their duties. Development may include, for 
example, meetings with senior managers to gain an improved 
understanding of the business. 
Directors are provided with extensive director knowledge checklists 
to help them self-assess their personal learning needs and they 
have access to numerous relevant publications by Bloomsbury. 
Formal training is provided to the Board by the External Auditor 
and external remuneration consultants, who assign time in 
meetings to provide updates on and to explain topical areas of 
corporate governance, remuneration, auditing and financial 
reporting. 
The Board is progressively refreshed, bringing in new skills and 
experience to the pool of knowledge on the Board from which each 
Director on the Board can learn. 
Nomination Committee 
The Committee comprises the Non-Executive Chairman of the 
Board, who chairs the Committee, and the three Independent  
Non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive.
The Committee operates under terms of reference agreed by  
the whole Board, which are available on the Company’s website  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. Its role is to review the composition of the 
Board, consider succession planning and nominate to the Board, 
for approval, candidates to fill Board vacancies. The Committee 
determines the Directors who should stand for re-election at the 
AGM in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company. 
Starting from the 2016 AGM on 19 July 2016, all Directors will 
stand for re-election annually. The Board formally approves the 
appointment of all new Directors on the recommendation of  
the Committee.

Board appointment process
The Board adopts a formal and rigorous approach to the 
appointment of Directors. The following outlines the Board 
appointment process typical to that followed: 
 ✷ the need to appoint a new director is identified by an existing 
Board member retiring or by a review by the Nomination 
Committee of the Board’s structure, balance, succession 
planning and the need for progressive refreshing which may 
take account of the findings of the annual Board evaluation of 
the skills and capabilities of Board members; 
 ✷ the Nomination Committee considers the strengths and 
weaknesses of the Board and the senior management team and 
the needs of the business in order to define the experience and 
capabilities required for a new appointment;
 ✷ the Nomination Committee determines the recruitment process;
 ✷ for appointing independent NEDs, an independent external 
recruitment consultant is appointed and performs an extensive 
search to identify candidates meeting criteria agreed with the 
Nomination Committee. The external consultant performs initial 
interviews with candidates and carries out background research 
on them to formulate a shortlist to put forward to the Committee 
together with an evaluation of each candidate;
 ✷ several Directors separately interview each candidate and feed 
back to the external consultant on the interview evaluation of the 
candidate;
 ✷ multiple references are taken and further background checks 
are made on candidates;
 ✷ the Nomination Committee sitting together selects the final 
candidate and makes a recommendation to the Board on their 
appointment; and
 ✷ the Board decides appointments recommended by the 
Committee.
The Group Company Secretary ensures that new Directors receive 
a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board. Newly 
appointed Directors are provided with induction packs and one-to-
one meetings are arranged for them with the senior management 
team. Directors are provided with a detailed knowledge self-
assessment questionnaire to help them consider any further 
training needs they may have.
The significant Shareholders are invited to contact or meet with  
a new Chairman. Any request by a Shareholder to meet with a 
new Director would be considered by the Board. Investors will 
typically get the opportunity to meet with Directors at AGMs, at 
presentations and meetings following the announcements  
of the results.
Re-election of Directors 
The Board may require all Directors to retire for rotation at an AGM 
and stand for re-election.
As a minimum all Directors are subject to reappointment by 
the Shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting after their 
appointment and thereafter at intervals of no more than three 
years.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for periods of three years 
upon the end of which their appointment terminates subject 
to their reappointment by the Board. A policy is followed of 
progressive refreshing of the Board and the Independent  
Non-Executive Director team aligned with the changing needs  
of the business.
The notice periods by the Company of the Directors are set out in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 74.
Board diversity
The Board aims for at least one third, or the nearest number 
to a third, of Directors on the Board to be women. The Board 
presently comprises two women out of eight Directors. The Board 
is progressively refreshed and new appointments are selected by 
the Nomination Committee using independent search consultants 
based on merit as the best candidate for the role.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee comprises two Independent  
Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman of the 
Board and is chaired by Jill Jones. The role of the Committee is set 
out in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 74.

Operation of the Audit Committee
The Committee comprises three Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Chair of the Committee is John Warren, a Fellow 
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. 
The Board is satisfied that the experience and qualifications of 
John Warren are sufficient for him to meet the experience and 
qualification requirements to be a member of the Audit Committee, 
with recent and relevant financial experience under the Code and 
the UK listing authority Listing Rules appropriate to the Company.
The Committee typically invites the External Auditor, Internal 
Auditor, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive, Finance Director 
and the other Executive Directors to attend meetings. It meets at 
least once in respect of each reporting period. There is a standing 
item on the agenda for each meeting is for the External Auditor to 
meet the Committee alone without management present, which 
provides an opportunity for Committee members and the External 
Auditor to share any concerns that they may have.
The terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the 
Company’s website, www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk, and set out the 
role and authority of the Committee. Responsibilities and matters 
reserved for the Committee include:
 ✷ to monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the 
Company and any formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s financial performance, reviewing significant financial 
reporting judgements contained in them;
 ✷ to review the Company’s internal financial controls and, 
unless expressly addressed by a separate Board risk committee 
composed of independent Directors, or by the Board itself, to 
review the Company’s internal control and risk management 
systems;
 ✷ to monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal audit function;
 ✷ to make recommendations to the Board, for it to put to the 
Shareholders for their approval in general meeting, in relation  
to the appointment, reappointment and removal of the External 
Auditor and to approve the remuneration and terms  
of engagement of the External Auditor; 
 ✷ to review and monitor the External Auditor’s independence 
and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking 
into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements;
 ✷ to develop and implement policy on the engagement of the

 ✷ to report to the Board, identifying any matters in respect of which 
it considers that action or improvement is needed and making 
recommendations as to the steps to be taken; and
 ✷ to report to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.
The Committee’s annual evaluation, which forms part of the 
Board evaluation, reviews how the Committee has discharged its 
responsibilities. The findings of the evaluation and recommendations 
arising are reported to the Board. 
The Committee formally reviews the whistleblowing arrangements 
of the Company by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns 
about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting 
or other matters. The Committee’s objective is to ensure that 
arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent 
investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up action. 
The Group’s whistleblower policy and procedures are found at 
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk and are available to all staff.
The Committee reviews the plans, findings and recommendations 
of the Internal Auditor, and management’s responses to internal 
audit recommendations. It ensures that the internal audit function 
is adequately resourced in light of the system of risk management 
and has appropriate standing within the Company. The Committee 
approves the appointment and removal of the Head of Internal 
Audit, who for the financial year up to the time of signing this report 
was the Group Company Secretary.

The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for making a 
recommendation on the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the External Auditor.
The appointment of the External Auditor was tendered following 
the 2013 AGM and the Board appointed KPMG LLP as External 
Auditor for the Group and for the Company for audits for the year 
ended 28 February 2014 and onwards. The detailed tender process 
followed is set out in the Annual Report for the year ended

The Committee assesses the effectiveness of the audit process as an 
item on the agenda for Committee meetings. In forming its view on 
the effectiveness of the audit process the Committee considered: 
 ✷ the quality of audit work undertaken and resulting audit findings;
 ✷ whether the Auditor's scope has been limited and whether the 
Auditor has had sufficient resources to complete their agreed 
work programme; and 
 ✷ the independence of the External Auditor.
The annual evaluation of the Board considered the effectiveness 
of how the external audit process integrated with the business 
processes for the Group.
The Committee is satisfied that KPMG has performed an effective 
audit that provided the Committee with adequate assurance.

for which prior approval is deemed to have been given.
 ✷ A maximum of £10,000 +VAT per annum may be spent on 
permitted non-audit services undertaken by the External Auditor, 
above which Committee approval is required.
 ✷ External Auditor annual fees for non-audit work may not exceed 
50% of the total fees charged by the External Auditor.
Internal control and risk management 
The Code requires the Directors to assess at least annually the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control, which 
include financial, operational and compliance controls, and the 
system of risk management. This review has been carried out by  
the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, for setting policy 
on internal control, and for reviewing the effectiveness of internal 
control. The role of management is to implement Board policies 
on risk and control. The system of internal control is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material financial misstatement or loss. 
The Board operates both formally, through Board and committee 
meetings, and informally, through regular contact amongst 
Directors. High level decisions on such matters as strategy, financial 
performance and reporting, dividends, risk management, major 
capital expenditure, major acquisitions and disposals are reserved 
for the Board or Board committees. For its regular formal meetings, 
the Board receives appropriate information in advance from 
management. Other decisions outside of these areas are delegated 
to the Company’s management, who report to the Chief Executive. 
The Board has put in place an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the 
Company in accordance with "Financial Reporting Council, Internal 
Control Revised Guidance For Directors On The Combined Code 
October 2005" (formerly Turnbull guidance on internal control). 
This process has been in place for the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of this Annual Report. The process is regularly 
reviewed by the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board to ensure 
that the procedures implemented continue to be effective and, 
where appropriate, recommendations are made to management to 
improve the procedures. The Company’s system of internal financial 
control aims to safeguard the Company’s assets, and ensure that 
proper accounting records are maintained, that the financial 
information used within the business and for publication is reliable, 
that business risks are identified and managed and that compliance 
with appropriate legislation and regulation is maintained. 
Internal control and risk management framework 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements of 
the Company is the responsibility of the Finance Director and is 
overseen by the Audit Committee and the Board. This includes 
responsibility for ensuring appropriate internal controls are in place 
over financial reporting processes and related IT systems. The Audit 
Committee monitors the risks and associated controls over financial 
reporting processes, including the consolidation process. 
Relevant features of the Company’s system of internal controls and 
risk management in relation to the financial reporting process and 
preparation of the Group financial statements include: 
 ✷ Organisational culture: The Company has a highly skilled, 
professional and committed workforce. The Board is committed 
to developing a culture of openness, integrity, competence 
and responsibility. The Board concentrates mainly on strategic 
and significant organisational issues, approving objectives 
and monitoring, at a high level, the financial and operational 
performance against objectives.

Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate Governance
 ✷ Organisational structure: The One Global Bloomsbury structure 
comprises the worldwide publishing divisions supported by Group 
functions (finance, IT, production, sales & marketing) which 
provide an internal control service to the business as internal 
control pillars within the Group’s internal control framework. 
 ✷ Risk and control review: The Executive Committee (which 
comprises the divisional and Group function heads and Executive 
Directors) maintains Group level and Group function level risk 
analysis and control assessments for each risk. This ensures that 
risks and control issues from around the Group worldwide are 
reported openly to the senior management team and addressed. 
The Board has regularly reviewed the significant Group and 
functional risks to ensure appropriate action is taken to address 
the risks. The Audit Committee reviews the risks, in particular the 
financial risks and issues that could impact on reporting, when 
considering the financial statements.
 ✷ Financial internal control and risk review: The Finance Director 
formally reviews the internal financial controls, taking account 
of the risks within the financial information systems, and reports 
the findings of this review to the Audit Committee. Analytical 
review of operating results and detailed control questionnaires 
completed for the publishing divisions and overseas offices 
supplement management’s knowledge of the business for the 
evaluation of the risks and assessment of the internal financial 
controls. The Audit Committee also receives reports on the 
internal controls and risks provided by the Internal Auditor.  
The Audit Committee receives other reports from management 
relevant to the internal financial controls such as reports on the 
progress of key projects. 
 ✷ Authority levels: The Board maintains a detailed register of 
delegated authorities and sets the level of authority required, 
before Board approval is needed, to commit the Company or 
to undertake transactions. It also approves budgets and other 
performance targets. The publishing divisions and Group 
functions operate within these authority levels and budgets.  
The Executive Directors determine the authority to be delegated 
to individual managers.
 ✷ Financial management reporting: The Board approves the annual 
Group budget. Sales are reported daily, weekly and monthly. 
Financial results of the business operations are reported monthly 
and compared to budget and forecasts. Detailed forecasts for the 
Company are updated regularly and reviewed by the Board. 
 ✷ Book title acquisition procedures: Established procedures, 
such as the review and approval by an Executive Director of 
acquisition proposals of rights to new books, are operated within 
set authority limits and used for transactions in the ordinary 
course of business. Acquisitions exceeding delegated authority 
limits require approval by the Board. Significant acquisitions of 
companies and businesses are approved by the Board. The Board 
has set authorised limits for the total author advances held on the 
Statement of Financial Position as a percentage of net assets and 
for the total value of committed but unpaid advances.
 ✷ Accountability: The Company has clearly defined lines of 
responsibility headed by the Chief Executive and Executive 
Committee to control the publishing divisions and business 
functions. Detailed operational and financial performance 
data are monitored by supervisory management to ensure the 
performance of operations is in line with targets. The reasons for 
variances and underperformance are established by supervisory 
line management and followed up with managers and staff.
 ✷ Overseas offices: Each overseas office has a local manager 
or managing director who is responsible for operational 
effectiveness and local internal controls. Accounting for the 
Group is centralised and overseas subsidiaries hold limited cash 
balances. Senior managers and Executive Directors regularly 
visit the overseas offices and the finance function conducts 
operational review visits to review the procedures. The Board has 
implemented a Group Whistleblower Policy and an Anti-bribery 
and Corruption Policy which are communicated to all staff 
worldwide and may be found on the Company’s website at  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. 
 ✷ Internal Audit: An internal audit function conducts risk-based 
audits of the processes to review the internal controls. Its 
conclusions are communicated to senior management and the 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee considers reports from 
External and Internal Audit to ensure that adequate measures are 
being taken by management to address risk and control issues. 
The Group Company Secretary is the Head of Internal Audit 
and reports to the Chair of the Audit Committee and the Chief 
Executive in respect of risk management and internal audit work. 
Significant failings or weaknesses in the internal controls
Pursuant to provision C.2.3 of the Code, the Committee concludes 
from its review of the systems of risk management and internal 
control that the internal controls are adequate for the business of 
Bloomsbury, including all the Group companies. From this review, 
the Committee has not identified any significant internal control 
weaknesses that challenge the Group in achieving its objectives.
The One Global Bloomsbury structure of four worldwide publishing 
divisions supported by Group functions ensures an effective 
internal control framework and provides a platform for integrating 
acquisitions as the Group grows and evolves.
Management assigns and monitors control effectiveness ratings 
to the internal controls across all the business processes worldwide 
based on the benefits expected from making improvements given 
the investment of resources that would be required. Based on this, 
management has identified that the Group’s information systems 
is the process area where most improvement can be made to help 
increase productivity and effectiveness of the business. In particular, 
work is ongoing to simplify the legacy systems and introduce new 
reporting systems to help manage the risks from expansion across 
new markets, new product types and acquisitions.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE
Significant issues in relation to the financial 
statements 
In accordance with Code Provision C.3.8, the following are the issues 
that the Committee considers significant in relation to the financial 
statements and how these issues are addressed. 
For each item below, the Committee has reviewed the assumptions 
and judgements made and has considered the risks to the integrity 
of information reported in the financial statements. In accordance 
with the Code the Committee has taken account of the disclosure 
of the issues when forming an opinion on the fair, balanced and 
understandable view of the Annual Report.
1. Inventories provision
The level of inventories and the inventory provision are set out in 
note 15 to the financial statements.
For each line of inventory, a provision is made against the cost of 
the inventory, where the Net Realisable Value is less than cost. Net 
Realisable Value is the estimated selling price for inventories less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. 
The estimated selling price for each inventory line is a judgement 
based mainly on recent selling patterns for a title. A formulaic 
provision is applied to each inventory line where titles have been 
published for more than one year. The Committee considered the 
judgements applied to estimating the selling prices of inventory. 
This was to ensure that the total level of provision for all inventory 
was adequate.
2. Sales returns provision
The level of sales return provision is set out in note 16 to the  
financial statements.
Printed books are normally sold on a sale-or-return basis. The timing 
of returns of unsold books is uncertain. A provision is made against 
sales for the expected future returns of books that have not occurred 
by the end of an accounting period. This provision is a judgement 
based on the assumption of the time lag following a sale before a 
return is made and the calculation of the historic returns rate. 
The Committee considered the judgements made in estimating the 
key assumptions. This was to ensure that the sales return provision 
was adequate.
3. Revenue recognition
Included within rights and services revenues are licenses over 
Bloomsbury’s IP to third parties, as stated in note 3 to the financial 
statements. The revenue recognised from these licences in any 
one period mainly reflects the value of contracted performance 
obligations satisfied in that period. The revenue recognition 
treatment for more complex deals is reviewed by the External 
Auditors as soon as contracted.
The Committee considered the judgements applied to the most 
significant licenses. This was to ensure that the revenue recognition 
treatment was adequate.
4. Valuation of goodwill on acquisition of companies
The carrying value of goodwill arising on the acquisition of 
companies (or groups of companies) by the Group is set out in note 
11 to the financial statements. 
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For 
the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each 
of the Group’s cash generating units ("CGUs") that is expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable 
amount of a CGU is less than its carrying value, an impairment 
charge reduces goodwill and is recognised in the Income 
Statement. There is more detail on this process in note 2j to these 
financial statements. The recoverable amount is based on future 
cash flow projections based on a Board approved budget and the 
five-year plan. 
The Committee considered the judgements and assumptions made 
in selecting CGUs and performing the impairment tests for each 
CGU, to ensure that the carrying value for goodwill was adequately 
supported. In particular, the Committee reviewed the annual budget 
and five-year plan for the Group, as approved by the Board, which is 
used as the basis for forecasting future cash flows from the CGUs.
5. Unearned advance provision
Trade and other receivables in the Group Statement of Financial 
Position, in note 16 to the financial statements, include net unearned 
author advances of £22.2 million (2015: £21.4 million).
A provision is made against gross advances (paid and payable) 
to the extent that they are not expected to be fully earned from 
anticipated future sales of a title. This provision is a judgement that 
depends on recent royalty earnings and known future new format 
releases.
The Committee considered the assumptions made for the titles with 
the largest net advances across the Group to ensure that the net 
carrying value of advances was adequately supported.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual Statement
Dear Shareholder
I am delighted to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for Bloomsbury Publishing Plc for the year ended 29 February 2016  
(the “Report”). The Report has been prepared on behalf of the Bloomsbury Board by the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”)  
and has been approved by the Board. 
Outline of the Remuneration Report
The Report is split into the following two sections:
 ✷ Part A, the Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the Remuneration Policy for the Executive and Non-Executive Directors which  
was approved by the Shareholders at the 2014 AGM and has operated from 1 March 2014. No changes are proposed to the Remuneration 
Policy Report; and
 ✷ Part B, the Annual Report on Remuneration, which discloses how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented for the year ending  
28 February 2017 and how it was implemented for the year ended 29 February 2016. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory Shareholder vote at the forthcoming AGM on 19 July 2016. The 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report will be subject to a binding vote every three years (sooner if changes are made to the policy), next 
due at the 2017 AGM.
Performance and reward for 2015/16
Bloomsbury delivered another good performance for the year ended 29 February 2016 against the background of a publishing 
marketplace that continues to evolve. The Committee set a stretching annual bonus threshold target for Group performance (see below) 
for the year based on the City analysts’ consensus forecast for PBTA. Although the business came close to meeting the threshold target, 
given the target was not exceeded the Committee has determined that no bonus should be paid for the year.
The PSP awards granted on 29 November 2013 were determined to have vested at 16.5% of the maximum (100% of awards) in 2015/16 
based on earnings per share (50% of awards) over the three years ended 29 February 2016. Relative total shareholder return (50% of 
awards) over the three years from the date of grant was below the threshold target so did not trigger vesting.
Remuneration plans for 2016/17
The Committee continually reviews the Executive Director Remuneration Policy to ensure it promotes the attraction, motivation and 
retention of the high quality executives who have been key to delivering the Company’s strategy in the past and who will be key to 
delivering sustainable earnings growth and Shareholder return in the future. For 2016/17, the Committee has concluded that:
 ✷ basic salaries (other than for Jonathan Glasspool) should be increased by 2% in line with the general workforce for the Group;
 ✷ Jonathan Glasspool, who was appointed, as an internal appointment, to the Board on 23 July 2015 at a starting annual salary of £200,000, 
should be awarded a one-time enhanced annual increase to an annual salary of £225,000 following his strong performance and 
development during his initial period as an Executive Director;
 ✷ there will be no changes to other elements of fixed pay (i.e. benefit and pension provision);
 ✷ the structure and quantum of the annual bonus arrangement continues to work well as an incentive. Therefore, the maximum bonus 
potential will remain at 100% of salary and the structure of the 2016/17 annual bonus will be broadly similar to that operated for 2015/16. 
A clawback provision will operate in respect of the annual bonus for the Executive Directors; and
 ✷ the long-term incentive scheme, operated under the Bloomsbury Share Plan 2014 (“PSP”), whereby nil-cost awards are granted annually 
with vesting performance conditions based on earnings per share (EPS) growth relative to RPI (50% of awards), relative total shareholder 
return (50% of awards) and continued service provide strong alignment between the Executive Director team and Shareholders. PSP 
awards based on relative total shareholder return performance have a concurrent performance condition based on EPS growth relative 
to RPI. This supplements the financial underpin in the PSP scheme rules that provides the Committee with discretion to reduce the level  
of vesting should the Committee, in its opinion, consider that vesting is not reflective of Bloomsbury’s performance.
In line with best practice, the LTIP awards in respect of 2016/17 and onwards will be granted subject to a two-year post-vesting holding  
period in addition to the existing shareholding guidelines so that, during the holding period, vested shares may not be sold by the 
Executive Director and remain subject to a clawback provision. The holding period will continue to apply should an Executive Director  
leave Bloomsbury.

Review of the Remuneration Policy
The current Remuneration Policy was approved by the Shareholders at the 2014 AGM held on 22 July 2014. In line with the regulations 
requiring the renewal of the Remuneration Policy at least every three years, the Committee will review the policy in light of best practice and 
will seek Shareholder approval to renew the policy at the 2017 AGM. 
Shareholder feedback
In applying the Remuneration Policy, the Committee’s priority is to ensure that the interests of the Shareholders and, where beneficial to the 
Shareholders, other stakeholders are served whilst the Executive Directors and senior management team are treated fairly. In reaching its 
decisions the Committee considers the views and feedback it receives from Shareholders and other members of the Shareholder corporate 
governance community together with the views of management. 
In conclusion, the Committee considers that the Remuneration Policy will incentivise the sustainable delivery of the Board’s strategy, strong 
financial performance and the creation of long-term Shareholder value.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
PART A – REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
Introduction
The Committee has adopted the principles of good governance relating to Directors’ remuneration as set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued September 2014 (the “Code”). This Report, together with the Annual Report on Remuneration, complies with 
the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”), the UKLA Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and Directors’ Remuneration: the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Code relating to Directors’ remuneration throughout the year. 
In determining the Remuneration Policy the Committee applies the key principles that remuneration should:
 ✷ attract and retain suitably high calibre Executive Directors and ensure that they are motivated to achieve the highest levels of 
performance including delivering strategic initiatives and objectives;
 ✷ align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Shareholders; and
 ✷ not pay more than is necessary.
Consideration of Shareholder views
The Committee considers Shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year. This feedback, plus any additional feedback 
received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Group’s annual review of the Remuneration Policy. In 
addition, the Remuneration Committee will seek to engage directly with major Shareholders and their representative bodies should any 
material changes be made to the Remuneration Policy. Major Shareholders and representative bodies were consulted in early 2014 in 
respect of the proposed changes to the long-term incentive policy.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report and any matters discussed with 
Shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary 
increases for the Executive Directors. Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the Group’s Executive Director 
Remuneration Policy, although the Committee will keep this under review. 
The relative increase in CEO pay for the year under review, as compared with that of the general workforce, is set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. The Committee also considers environmental, social and governance issues, and risk when reviewing executive pay 
quantum and structure.

Notes to the summary policy table:
1. A description of how the Company intends to implement the policy set out in this table from the 2015 AGM is set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration on pages 65 to 74.
2. Remuneration arrangements below Board tend to be skewed more towards fixed pay with less of a focus on share-based long-term 
incentive pay. These differences have arisen from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the 
various categories of individuals.
3. The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflect the Committee’s belief that any incentive 
compensation should be appropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of profit growth and personal and strategic objectives. 
4. The TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to the PSP were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they 
reward the delivery of long-term returns to Shareholders and the Company’s financial growth and are consistent with the Company’s 
objective of delivering superior levels of long-term value to Shareholders. The TSR performance condition is monitored on the 
Committee’s behalf by New Bridge Street whilst the Group’s EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements.
5. PSP awards currently vest after three years subject to continued service and performance targets. Awards granted from 2016 and 
onwards will be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period, in addition to the existing shareholding guidelines.
6. The all-employee Sharesave scheme does not have performance conditions. 
7. For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former Directors (such as the payment of a pension, payment of last year’s annual bonus or 
the vesting/exercise of share awards granted in the past). Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration as they arise.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE
Discretion of the Committee
The Committee will operate the annual bonus and PSP schemes according to the respective scheme rules (or relevant documents) and 
in accordance with the applicable regulations. Executive Director incentive schemes and remuneration plans are designed to align the 
interests of management with those of the Shareholders and are kept as simple as possible. Where the outcome of incentives is not as the 
Committee intended it may use its independent discretion to intervene and modify the outcomes to align the interests of management 
with those of the Shareholders.
The Committee has adopted terms of reference based on best practice and may apply its independent discretion in a number of ways 
through its conditional approval including for:
Share-based incentives
 ✷ granting of all discretionary share awards/options and determining the participants (including for Executive Directors and below the 
Board), timing of grants, size of awards, performance conditions and how vested awards should be satisfied;
 ✷ running Sharesave to ensure that the scheme is run within applicable dilution limits;
 ✷ vesting of all discretionary share awards/options including the timing and level of vesting;
 ✷ non-routine vesting of all-employee share options in the unlikely event needed to ensure the effective operation of the schemes under 
the applicable regulations and rules;
Annual bonuses
 ✷ making annual bonus awards to the Executive Directors and determining the level of awards, targets and conditions and calibration  
of bonuses;
 ✷ the Group bonus pool and the level of bonus payouts for the Executive Directors and managers below Board who participate in the 
Group bonus scheme;
 ✷ bonus payments to the Executive Directors so may determine the level of payments following the assessment of performance measures 
and achievement against bonus objectives;
Routine payments
 ✷ all changes to Executive Director basic salaries, pensions and eligibility to benefits; and
Non-routine payments
 ✷ all non-routine payments to the Executive Directors including but not limited to leavers, to new appointees and in respect of a change of 
control.

Notes:
1. The minimum performance scenario comprises the fixed elements of remuneration only, based on salary and pension as per policy  
for 2016/17 and estimated benefits based on 2015/16.
2. The target level of bonus is taken to be 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity (100% of salary), and the target level of PSP vesting 
is assumed to be 50% of the face value assuming a normal grant level (100% of salary). These values are included in addition to the 
components/values of minimum remuneration.
3. Maximum assumes full bonus payout (100% of salary) and the full face value of the PSP (100% of salary), in addition to fixed components 
of remuneration.
4. For simplicity, no share price growth has been factored into the calculations. The value of any Sharesave awards and notional dividends 
accruing on vested LTIP shares has been excluded.
Executive Director share ownership guidelines
Under the guidelines the Executive Directors are expected to build and maintain a shareholding valued at 100% of basic salary with no 
upper limit on the number of shares they may hold. A time limit is not set to accumulate the shareholding; however, Executive Directors 
are required to retain all shares arising from vested PSP awards (net of tax) or purchase shares until the shareholding guideline is met. 
The number of shares needed to satisfy the shareholding is recalculated annually at the close of the next business day following the 
announcement of the full year results taking account of changes to basic salary.
Remuneration earned by the Executive Directors from outside appointments
Significant external appointments of the Directors are given in the bibliographic details on pages 42 and 43. The Committee considers that 
the external appointments of the Executive Directors have no detrimental impact on the performance of their duties. The Committee has 
approved that each Executive Director may retain his or her remuneration earned from external appointments up to £15,000 per year.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s prevailing approved 
Remuneration Policy at the time of appointment and take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for  
a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate and may be set initially at a below mid-
market level on the basis that it may progress towards the mid-market level once expertise and performance has been proven and 
sustained. The annual bonus potential would be limited to 100% of salary and grants under the PSP would be limited to 100% of salary 
(150% of salary in exceptional circumstances). In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to 
replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an Executive leaving a previous employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these 
awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue. 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and/or incidental 
expenses as appropriate.
If appropriate the Committee may agree, on the recruitment of a new Executive Director, a notice period in excess of 12 months but to 
reduce this to 12 months over a specified period.

Service contracts for Executive Directors
Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors, which are not of a fixed term and are terminable by either the Company or the 
Director, are set out below:
Executive Directors Date of agreement Date of expiry Notice period
Nigel Newton 24 June 2003 – 12 months
Richard Charkin 1 October 2007 – 12 months
Wendy Pallot 10 March 2011 – 12 months
Jonathan Glasspool 23 July 2015 – 12 months
At the Board’s discretion, early termination of an Executive Director’s service contract may be undertaken by way of payment of salary 
and benefits in lieu of the required notice period (or shorter period where permitted by the contract of service or where agreed with the 
Executive Director) and the Committee would take such steps as necessary to mitigate the loss to the Company and to ensure that the 
Executive Director observed his or her duty to mitigate loss. 
Annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the financial year served although it will be prorated for time and paid at the 
normal payout date. Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Company’s share plans will be determined 
based on the relevant plan rules. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, 
retirement, sale of employing business or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, “good leaver” status may be applied.  For 
good leavers, awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions at that 
time and reduced prorata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. However, the Remuneration Committee has 
the discretion to determine that awards vest at cessation of employment and/or not to prorate awards.
The service contracts for Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
Non-Executive Directors
Each of the Non-Executive Directors (“NEDs”) has similar general terms for their agreement, which can be found on Bloomsbury’s investor 
relations website at www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk. The agreements provide for three months’ notice by the Director or by the Company with 
the option for the Company to terminate an appointment at any time on payment of three months' fees in lieu of notice. Termination of the 
agreements is without compensation. Details of the NED agreements are as follows:
Non-Executive Director Date of appointment Date of agreement Date of expiry

Notice period
Jill Jones 23 July 2013 22 July 2013 July 2016 3 months

John Warren 23 July 2015 26 May 2015 July 2018 3 months 
1. The dates of expiry of NED appointments are set relative to Annual General Meetings which are expected to occur during July each year.
The annual fees of NEDs, excluding the Chairman, are determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The annual fee of the 
Chairman is determined by the other NEDs and the Executive Directors. NEDs receive a basic annual fee plus an extra annual amount 
for additional responsibilities such as chairing Board committees. The fees of the NEDs and Chairman are periodically reviewed against 
benchmark data provided by external remuneration consultants. Where NEDs and the Chairman receive an increase in annual fee this is 
normally limited to the budgeted annual increase in salaries for Bloomsbury employees. The NEDs and Chairman do not participate in the 
Company’s annual bonus or share incentive schemes including Sharesave.

Appointment of Jonathan Glasspool as an Executive Director
Following the close of the AGM on 23 July 2015, the Board made the internal appointment of Jonathan Glasspool as an Executive Director. 
Jonathan Glasspool joined Bloomsbury in 1999 and has a held a number of senior positions in the Company including leading the 
Academic and Professional publishing division from its start. Further biographical details can be found in the Directors Report.
Jonathan Glasspool was appointed to the Board at an entry-level salary of £200,000 set by the Committee, with the intention of salary 
enhancement to our targeted market pay positioning over time to reflect his development during his early period in role. The Committee 
is satisfied that he has proven himself and, after considering mid-quartile basic salaries of executive directors for companies with a similar

market capitalisation as the Company, has awarded a one-time enhanced increase of £25,000 (12.5%) to his basic salary from 1 March 2016 
to align his salary with market. The Committee has no plans to award a further enhanced increase to his basic salary, outside of the normal 
cycle and considerations for the broader executive director group. Pension and minor benefits for Jonathan Glasspool are in line with the 
other the Executive Directors of the Company and are in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
Prior to his appointment to the Board, Jonathan Glasspool received LTIP awards including grants under the Company’s CSOP market price 
share option scheme (see below). Under the Remuneration Policy, CSOP options may not be granted to Executive Directors. The Committee 
has approved that Jonathan Glasspool may retain his CSOP options on his appointment as permitted by the Remuneration Policy. Future 
LTIP awards for Jonathan Glasspool will be grants made under the Company's PSP conditional share scheme at a level of 100% of basic 
salary in line with the other Executive Directors.
Basic salary
From 1 March 2016, the Group’s employees generally, including Nigel Newton, Richard Charkin and Wendy Pallot, received a pay increase 
of 2% reflecting the underlying performance of the publishing business and in line with the market generally.
Jonathan Glasspool was appointed to the Board on 23 July 2015 at a lower initial salary. In view of his strong performance following his 
recent appointment, the Committee awarded Jonathan Glasspool a 12.5% increase taking his basic salary to £225,000 from 1 March 2016.

2. Jonathan Glasspool was appointed to the Board from 23 July 2015 at a salary of £200,000 per annum.
Pensions
In accordance with the policy, pension contributions will be set at 15% of basic salary for Nigel Newton, Wendy Pallot and Jonathan 
Glasspool. Directors may elect to receive a cash alternative in lieu of payments by the Company into their private pension arrangements. No 
pension contributions will be made by the Company for Richard Charkin.
Other benefits
Benefits will continue to comprise a car or car allowance (excluding Richard Charkin), medical cover, permanent health cover, life 
assurance and Company schemes offered to staff generally, such as buying books for private use at the staff discount rate.
Annual bonus
For 2016/17, the maximum bonus potential will continue to be set at 100% of salary based on profit with 30% of the bonus paid subject to 
achieving further objectives comprising 10% on personal objectives and 20% on strategic objectives.
The Group Management Bonus scheme used in previous years for the Executive Directors will continue to be adopted for 2016/17. 
Under this scheme bonuses for the Executive Directors and approximately 40 managers are paid from a bonus pool determined by the 
Committee. The bonuses for the participants of the scheme are scaled back where the pool is not sufficient to pay maximum bonuses. The 
maximum bonus for each participant is capped and depends on them achieving their individual bonus objectives.
The pool is calculated as the excess of Adjusted Profits (before bonus) above a stretching target set by the Committee. No bonuses are paid 
if Adjusted Profits fall below the target.
Long-term incentives
Reflecting market practice for a FTSE SmallCap company, the PSP individual annual award limits under the current PSP is 100% of salary. The 
Committee has discretion to apply the exceptional limit of 150% of salary but envisages doing this only rarely when in the interests of the 
Shareholders. 
The annual PSP awards granted in 2016 will be subject to the following targets:
 ✷ relative EPS (50%) – 25% of this part of an award will vest for annualised growth in EPS over the performance period of RPI +3% 
increasing pro rata to 100% vesting for annualised growth in EPS over the performance period of RPI + 8%; and
 ✷ relative TSR (50%) – the Company’s TSR measured against the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap (excluding investment trusts). 25% of 
this part of an award will vest at median increasing pro rata to 100% vesting at top quartile or higher. Relative EPS and TSR are considered

to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance for the Group, in that they ensure Executives are incentivised and 
rewarded for the earnings performance of the Group as well as returning value to Shareholders.
The awards for Executive Directors will be subject to clawback provisions and to a two-year post-vesting holding period in addition to the 
existing shareholding guidelines. During the holding period, an Executive Director (including if they stand down from the Board) may not 
sell their vested shares, which will remain subject to a clawback provision.
The Remuneration Committee has approved that the Executive Directors may participate in the Company’s Sharesave scheme if operated 
during 2016/17.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual bonus calculation for 2015/16
As set out in the Strategic Report, Bloomsbury delivered another good performance for the year ended 29 February 2016 achieving profit 
before taxation and highlighted items of £13.0 million. The Committee set a stretching annual bonus threshold target for profit before 
taxation and highlighted items of £13.0 million based on the City analysts’ consensus forecast. Although the business came close to meeting 
the threshold target, given the target was not exceeded, the Committee has determined that no bonus should be paid for the year. In 
making its determination, the Committee decided not to use its discretion to allow a bonus to be accrued.
Bonus objectives for 2015/16
The maximum bonus for each Executive Director is subject to 70% financial, 20% strategic and 10% personal objectives. The table below 
summarises the personal and strategic bonus objectives set for each Executive Director by the Committee. These would have been used to 
determine individual bonuses had a bonus been paid.

During the year, the Committee set the criteria for each objective for "high" (stretching target for full bonus), "medium" (threshold target 
for partial bonus) and "low" (no bonus accrues) achievement. 
Notes to the table:
1. Each bonus objective is classed as strategic or personal denoted respectively by a letter "S" and "P" which is preceded by a figure for the maximum bonus as a percentage of 
salary. E.g. "10S" in the table indicates a strategic objective for 10% of salary.
2. Actions taken by the Executive Directors to achieve a number of the bonus objectives are commercially sensitive in respect of which the Committee has concluded that 
disclosing the details could undermine the interests of the Company. The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 41 describes how various other bonus objectives have been achieved. 
Examples of how objectives have been achieved are:
a) The acquisition of picture rights, publishing work, production and marketing for the Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone: Illustrated Edition regular and deluxe editions 
has been executed effectively resulting in significant sales worldwide of books.
b) Staff, stock and the publishing processes of the acquired Osprey Publishing group of companies have been effectively integrated into the Group with minimal disruption to 
the businesses.
c) The rollout of new systems across the Group has been effective and provides greater visibility and analysis of sales.
d) During the year, the Group completed the acquisition of certain significant LexisNexis and Jordan family law publishing assets from RELX (UK) Limited.

In determining the level of the PSP awards to Jonathan Glasspool the Committee took account of: 
 ✷ the normal annual grant policy of 100% of basic salary in total for EPS and TSR awards;
 ✷ the length of service as a Director during the year ended 29 February 2016 (approximately 61% of the full year); and
 ✷ the awards granted before appointment to the Board during the year ended 29 February 2016, namely market-priced share options with 
a concurrent EPS performance condition granted under the Bloomsbury 2014 Company Share Option Plan with a face value of £50,000. 
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, the Committee approved that Jonathan Glasspool may retain these options upon his 
promotion to a Director.
The Committee anticipates the normal grant policy of 100% of salary will be applied to Jonathan Glasspool for future awards.
Payments to past Directors
There were no payments made during the year to past Directors.
Payments for loss of office
Ian Cormack stepped down as Non-Executive Director at the close of the 2015 AGM on 23 July 2015. No payment for loss of office was made 
to Ian Cormack.

shares needed to satisfy a shareholding is recalculated at the close of the next business day following the announcement of the full year results (the “Review Date”).  
The recalculation is based on the Executive Director’s prevailing base salary and the closing mid-market share price 153.25 pence) on the Review Date.
2. Owned includes shares held directly by the Director and indirectly by a nominee on behalf of the Director where the Director has the beneficial interest. It includes the shares  
of the Director and of connected persons defined under the Model Code annexed to the UKLA Listing Rules.
3. At the time of retiring from the Board on 23 July 2015, Ian Cormack held 11,975 Bloomsbury shares. John Warren and Jonathan Glasspool were appointed to the Board on  
23 July 2015. 
No Director has or has had any interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, contract or arrangement (excluding service agreements), 
which is or was unusual in its nature or conditions or significant to the business of the Group during the current or immediately preceding 
financial year.
The closing market price of an Ordinary share at 29 February 2016 was 156.5p (2015: 149.25p) and the range of intra-day market prices from 
1 March 2015 to 29 February 2016 was 141.1p to 185.0p (2015: 140.5p to 190.0p).

Remuneration Committee
Responsibilities and activities of the Committee
The Committee determines the Remuneration Policy and annual remuneration plans for the Executive Directors for approval by the Board. 
In particular, the Committee approves for each Executive Director the basic salaries, pensions, other benefits, bonus awards and the awards 
made under Bloomsbury’s Long Term Incentive Plan (see above). The Committee approves all payments of bonus and the vesting and 
exercise of share-based awards before payments are made for each Executive Director. 
The Committee considers it is appropriate for the Executive Directors to determine the remuneration plans of senior management. In 
respect of employees below the level of the Board, the Committee approves the bonus pool from which bonuses are paid and approves the 
grant and vesting of all share incentives before payments are made.
Membership
For the year ended 29 February 2016 up until signing the Report, the Committee has comprised three Independent Non-Executive Directors 
as follows: 
Director
Appointed in the year
(if applicable)
Resigned in the year
(if applicable)
Jill Jones (Chair of the Committee) – –
Sir Anthony Salz – –
John Warren 23 July 2015 –
Ian Cormack – 23 July 2015
The Group Company Secretary, Michael Daykin FCIS FCA, acts as secretary to the Committee. All meetings or business of the Committee 
have been conducted during the year with two Independent Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman present.
The Committee met formally on five occasions during the year, including one occasion without the Executive Directors present and four 
occasions with Executive Directors attending part of a meeting at the request of the Committee for specific items on the agenda. New 
Bridge Street attends Committee meetings where needed to provide technical support. The Committee Chair has a standing item on the 
agenda at each main Board meeting, which provides the opportunity for them to update on and raise remuneration matters for discussion 
by the Board. Minutes of the Committee are circulated to the Board once they have been approved by the Committee.
Assistance to the Committee
During the year the Committee took advice from external remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street, which does not perform  
other services for and has no other connection with the Company (a statement to this effect is included on the Company’s website,  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk). The Committee is free to choose its advisors and is satisfied that New Bridge Street continues to provide advice 
that is objective and independent. Fees paid to New Bridge Street for 2015/16 totalled £7,900.
The Committee received assistance from the Group Company Secretary and, where specifically requested by the Committee, the Chief 
Executive and Finance Director. The Committee has considered any feedback received from the major Shareholders during the year as part 
of Bloomsbury’s ongoing investor relations programme and considers the reports and recommendations of Shareholder representative 
bodies and corporate governance analysts.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Independent Auditors’ Report
To the members of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc only
Opinion and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc for the year ended 29 February 2016, set out on pages 79 to 129. In 
our opinion: 
 ✷ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 29 February 2016 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 ✷ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
 ✷ the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
 ✷ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion on the financial statements the risks of material misstatements that had the greatest effect on our audit were 
as follows:
The risk Our response
Revenue – £123.7m; Returns provision – £5.8m
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 86 (accounting policy) and pages 91 to 93 (financial disclosures)
There are contracts entered into by the Group for Rights and 
Services revenue (including sales of copyright and trademarks) 
that are complex. These arrangements may include: the licensing 
or outright sale of the Group’s intellectual property; the provision 
of ongoing consultancy services; or a bundled combination of 
these. 
The complexity of the contractual terms requires the Group to 
make judgements in assessing when the triggers for revenue 
recognition have been met, particularly as to when the Group has 
sufficiently fulfilled its obligations under the contract (licensing, 
consultancy or outright sale) to allow revenue to be recognised. 
The Group is also required to make judgement in allocating 
fair value of the consideration to each deliverable included in a 
bundled arrangement, especially in instances where fair value of 
the individual deliverables is not observable on the open market. 
For all individually significant Rights and Services contracts signed 
during the year, our audit procedures included:
 ✷ Reviewing the Group’s determination of fair value for each 
deliverable in a bundled arrangement by reference to other 
available sources of information on fair value 
 ✷ Identifying from review of the contracts and discussions with the 
directors, the triggers for revenue recognition and assessing the 
risk of revenues being recorded in the incorrect period in respect 
of bundled contracts straddling the year end
 ✷ Obtaining evidence that the Group had fulfilled its obligations 
under the contract so as to recognise revenues, which included, 
where appropriate, evidence of customer acceptance
 ✷ For revenue on licensing arrangements that was recognised by 
the Group on delivery of the intellectual property, we considered 
whether there were any remaining contractual obligations or 
separate deliverables in the agreement which may preclude the 
recognition of revenue.
The Group typically sells its books on a sale or return basis. 
Estimating the level of returns from customers is subjective in 
nature due to the longer period of returns allowed in the industry 
and may have a material impact on the reported result at any 
given year end. As such this is a significant focus area for our audit.
 ✷ For the returns provision, our procedures included an assessment 
of historical returns from customers and comparing this against 
the returns rate used in the underlying provision calculation. 
We obtained evidence of actual returns received in the year to 
prior year’s provision to assess historical accuracy of the Group’s 
provisions.

Independent Auditors’ Report
To the members of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc only
The risk Our response
Goodwill – £42.1m
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 87 (accounting policy) and pages 99 to 100 (financial disclosures) 
The Group has completed a number of significant acquisitions 
in the past four years. The recoverability of the goodwill is 
dependent on individual businesses acquired sustaining sufficient 
profitability in the future and the Group realising synergy savings 
associated with the acquisitions. Due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows, which 
are the basis of the assessment of recoverability, this is a significant 
risk area that our audit is focused on.
 ✷ Our audit procedures included testing of the budgeting 
procedures upon which the forecasts are based and assessing the 
integrity of the discounted cash flow model. 
 ✷ We have used our knowledge of comparable companies and 
market data to challenge the assumptions, in particular the inputs 
and methodology in determining the discount rate used to 
calculate the present value of projected future cash flows. 
 ✷ We considered the historical accuracy of key assumptions by 
comparing the accuracy of the previous estimates of revenue 
and cost growth to the actual amounts realised. We sensitised key 
assumptions, including the revenue growth rate and the discount 
rate and considered whether the disclosures about the sensitivity 
of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key 
assumptions properly reflected the risks inherent in the valuation 
of goodwill.
Inventory – £27.6m
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 88 (accounting policy) and page 104 (financial disclosures)
The Group has significant inventory balances which could be at 
risk of obsolescence if stock levels exceed future sales volumes.
There is an inherent uncertainty in estimates of future sales 
volume and the related estimates of stock obsolescence, which 
may have a material impact on the reported result. As such this is a 
significant focus area for our audit
 ✷ We assessed the recoverability of inventory items based on 
sales made in the year and the Group’s historic stock turns. We 
compared the estimates used in the stock provision calculation 
to the actual stock turnover rates in the year and assessed if the 
actual trend is followed while making predictions for future years.
 ✷ In addition we assessed whether inventory was recorded at the 
lower of cost and recoverable value by comparing, on a sample 
basis, the recorded unit cost of stock against the market sales 
price at the time of testing.
 ✷ We also evaluated whether the Group’s provisioning policy was 
consistently applied.
Advances – £22.2m
Refer to page 54 (Audit Committee Report), page 88 (accounting policy) and pages 104 to 105 (financial disclosures)
The Group pays royalty advances to its authors prior to the 
delivery of a manuscript. The Group recovers these advances 
from future sales by deducting royalties due to the author under 
the terms of the relevant royalty agreement. 
The advances balance is made up of a significant number of 
individual advances to authors and requires the Group to forecast 
sales to monitor recoverability of advances.. 
In determining whether advances are recoverable, the Group 
must make judgements over the likely future sales of individual 
titles. Where insufficient sales are forecast by the Group, a 
provision is recorded against each advance. 
This is a significant risk area as there is inherent uncertainty 
regarding the future sales of individual titles arising from the 
changes in the economic environment, actions of competitors 
and forecasting risk.
 ✷ For individually significant advance balances, we challenged 
forecasts for future sales by analysing the accuracy of historical 
estimates of recoverability, both by genre and by title.
 ✷ We considered any specific adjustments made by management to 
the historical trends in arriving at the final provision and provided 
challenge on whether such a position was justified. This involved 
discussing specific promotions or market events planned for the 
future which could have a material impact on the title’s future 
recoverability.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £500,000, determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit 
before taxation, of which it represents 5%.
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £25,000 in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the group’s five reporting components, audits for Group reporting purposes were performed at the two reporting components 
in the UK and the USA, covering 93% of total Group revenue; 98% of Group profit before taxation and 95% of total Group assets. We 
have performed specific procedures over the year-end balance sheet of Osprey Group, which include obtaining inventory and cash 
confirmations. For the remaining components in Australia and India, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine 
our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. 
The Group audit team performed the audit of the UK component and instructed the USA component auditor as to the significant areas 
to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group audit team approved the 
component materialities, which ranged from £400,000 to £450,000, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the 
components.
The Group audit team also visited the USA component, to assess the audit risk and strategy and to review the audit files. Telephone 
conference meetings were also held with the US component auditors. At the visit and meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit 
team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component 
auditor.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion:
 ✷ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
 ✷ the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 ✷ the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 54 to 56 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial 
statements.
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks 
 ✷ Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
 ✷ the directors’ statement of longer-term viability on page 32, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the 
directors’ assessment and expectations of the group’s continuing in operation over the 3 years to 28 February 2019; or 
 ✷ the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.

 6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a 
material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if:

they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or
 ✷ the Audit Committee section of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 54 does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
 ✷ Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 ✷ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 ✷ the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
 ✷ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 ✷ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 ✷ a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 ✷ the directors’ statement, set out on page 48, in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; and
 ✷ the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 53 relating to the company’s compliance with the eleven provisions of the 
2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 47 to 48, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit 
of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is

Notes to the Financial Statements
Accounting Policies
1. Reporting entity
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the Company’s registered 
office can be found on page 131. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 29 February 2016 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). The Group is primarily involved in the publication of 
books and other related services.
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
a) Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations adopted by the European Union (“EU”) at the time of preparing 
these financial statements and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
b)  Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis.
c)  Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic Review on pages 1 to 41. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Financial Review 
on pages 25 to 31. In addition, note 24 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments, and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Directors believe that the Group’s diversification of product and geographical spread together with its monitoring and forecasting 
processes place the Group well in managing its business risks. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonable 
possible changes in trading performance, indicate that the Group is able to operate within the level of its current available facilities 
including compliance with the bank facility covenants. Details of the bank facility and its covenants are shown in note 24c).
After making enquiries of senior management and reviewing cash flow forecasts, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence at least until June 2017, being the period of the 
detailed going concern assessment reviewed by the Board. They therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the annual financial statements.
d)  Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Critical judgements and areas where the use of estimates is significant are 
disclosed in note 2v). 
e)  Application of new and amended standards and interpretations
The following amendments and interpretations were introduced to accounting standards relevant to the Group during the year ended  
29 February 2016. The table below summarises the impact of these changes to the Group:
Accounting standard Description of change Impact on financial statements
IAS 19 Employee Benefits The amendment simplifies how to account for contributions that are made 
independently of the number of years of employee service.
The amendment has not had 
any impact on the Group.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
The Directors are currently assessing the potential impact of other new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are currently endorsed but not yet effective. They have not been adopted 
early by the Group and are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.
f)  Basis of consolidation
 i) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. 
The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 ✷ the fair value of consideration transferred; plus
 ✷ the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; less
 ✷ the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Where the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are 
generally recognised in the income statement.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with 
the business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured and recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the 
fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in the income statement. 
For acquisitions before 1 January 2010, the Group applies IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (2004) in accounting for business 
combinations. All changes to contingent consideration in respect of these acquisitions are recognised as an adjustment to 
goodwill.
 ii) Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control 
commences until the date on which control ceases.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned with accounting policies adopted by the Group to ensure consistency.
All subsidiaries except Bloomsbury Publishing India Private Limited have a reporting period end of 29 February. Bloomsbury 
Publishing India Private Limited has a reporting period end of 31 March, which aligns with the Indian government’s financial year. 
 iii) Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any non-controlling 
interests and the other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the 
former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. 
 iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-Group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-Group transactions, are 
eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the 
extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

Notes to the Financial Statements
Accounting Policies
g)  Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received from the provision of goods, services and rights falling within the Group’s 
ordinary activities, after deduction of trade discounts, value added tax and anticipated returns. 
 ✷ Revenue from book publishing is recognised when title passes. A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical 
return rates. If these do not reflect actual returns in future periods then revenues could be understated or overstated for a particular 
period. 
 ✷ Revenue from the sale of publishing and distribution rights, including film, paperback, electronic, overseas publishing rights, and spon-
sorship, is recognised when the Group has discharged its obligations under the arrangement to deliver the associated material, and the 
Group has either received appropriately enacted contractual documentation or received payment, whichever occurs first. 
 ✷ Revenue from database contracts is recognised in accordance with the stages of completion of contractual services provided. The 
degree of completion is calculated as a proportion of the content generated against the contractually agreed milestone, for example 
number of words generated. Where the degree of completion of milestones cannot be reliably measured, revenue is only recognised 
in full on completion. 
 ✷ Revenue from management services contracts is usually recognised on a straight-line basis over the period that the service is provided. 
 ✷ Revenue from e-book sales is recognised when content is delivered.
Where contractual arrangements consist of two or more separate elements, such as access to multiple titles, revenue is recognised for each 
element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
h)  Foreign currencies
 i) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). These consolidated financial statements are presented in 
sterling (£) as this is the most representative currency of the Group’s operations. All financial information presented in sterling has 
been rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise stated.
 ii) Transactions and balances
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded in the functional currency at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at closing rates of 
exchange at the date of the statement of financial position. 
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement within administrative expenses.
 iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency 
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 ✷ Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that 
statement of financial position;
 ✷ Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates; and
 ✷ All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in 
equity. On disposal of a foreign entity these exchange differences are recycled to the income statement. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity.
i)  Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
 i) Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
 ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which those deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that 
affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the 
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be generated to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled 
based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 
 iii) Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged 
directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or equity respectively. 
j)  Goodwill and other intangible assets
 i) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business  
(see note 2f) i) less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-
generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is 
an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised 
directly in profit or loss in the consolidated income statement. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in 
subsequent periods. 
On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit 
or loss on disposal. 
 ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Except for goodwill, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in the income statement over their expected useful lives 
by equal annual instalments at the following rates:
 Publishing relationships — 7% to 20% per annum
 Imprints — 3% to 10% per annum
 Subscriber and customer relationships  — 7% to 17% per annum
 Product and systems development — 14% to 20% per annum
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted prospectively if 
appropriate.
 iii) Product and systems development
Costs that are directly associated with the purchase and implementation of systems, such as software products, are recognised as 
intangible assets. Likewise costs incurred in developing a product, typically an online platform, are recognised as intangible assets.
Expenditure is only capitalised if costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and commercially feasible, future 
economic benefits are probable and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development and use the asset.

Notes to the Financial Statements
Accounting Policies
k)  Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated in order to write down their cost less residual value using the straight-line method over 
their expected useful lives at the following rates: 
Short leasehold improvements — over the remaining life of the lease
Furniture and fittings — 10% per annum
Computer and other office equipment — 20% per annum
Motor vehicles — 25% per annum
Depreciation is prorated in the years of acquisition and disposal of an asset. The estimated useful lives, residual value and depreciation 
method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from 
the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the 
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
l) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At the end of each reporting period the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments and the risks specific to the asset for 
which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. 
m) Inventories
Inventories include bound stock. The cost of work in progress and finished goods represents the amounts invoiced to the Group for 
origination, paper, printing and binding. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using 
the weighted average cost method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Provisions are made for slow-moving and obsolete stock.
n) Royalty advances to authors
Advances of royalties to authors are included within current receivables when the advance is paid less any provision required to adjust  
the advance to its net realisable value. The royalty advance is expensed at the contracted or effective royalty rate as the related revenues 
are earned. 
o) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated 
reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. When a provision is measured using 
the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the 
time value of money is material).
p) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group has become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are as below:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially stated at fair value after provision for bad and doubtful debts and anticipated future sales returns and 
thereafter they are held at amortised cost.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows comprise cash in hand and at bank, other short-term deposits held by the Group, 
repayable on demand and overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included in current liabilities in the statement of financial position.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An 
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
q) Operating leases
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating lease by the 
lessee. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
r) Employee benefits
 i) Defined contribution plans
Pension costs relating to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised in the income statement in the period for which 
related services are rendered by the employee. 
 ii) Defined benefit plans
Until 1997 a subsidiary company operated a defined benefit pension scheme. The retirement obligation recognised in the 
statement of financial position represents the net of the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan 
assets at the statement of financial position date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries 
using the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to 
equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. The service cost, representing benefits accruing over the 
year, is included in the income statement as an operating cost. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
defined benefit obligation and is presented as finance costs or finance income.
 iii) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of 
withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan either to terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination 
benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
 iv) Share-based payment transactions
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payment instruments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-
based payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate 
of the shares that will eventually vest. 
Options granted under the Group’s share option schemes and sharesave scheme are equity settled. The fair values of such options 
have been calculated using the Black–Scholes model or a modified version of the same, based on publicly available market data. 
Awards granted under the Group’s Performance Share Plan are equity settled. Part of any award granted under the plan is subject 
to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is calculated using the Stochastic 
model. The other part of any award granted under the plan is subject to an Earnings Per Share performance condition. The fair 
value of this element of the awards is calculated using the Black–Scholes model.

Notes to the Financial Statements
Accounting Policies
s) Employee benefit trust
The Company operates an employee benefit trust and has de facto control of shares held by the trust and bears their benefits and risks. The 
Group considers the trust to be substantially under its control and so consolidates the financial information of the trust as stated in  
note 2f). The Group records the assets and liabilities of the trust as its own and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction 
from Shareholders’ equity. Finance costs and administrative expenses are charged as they accrue.
t) Segmental reporting
Operating segments, which have not been aggregated, are reported in a manner that is consistent with the internal reporting provided to 
the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), regarded as the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The CEO views the Group primarily from a nature of business basis, reflecting the divisional performance of Adult, Children’s & Educational, 
Academic & Professional and Information. Segment results that are reported to the CEO include items directly attributable to a segment as 
well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Performance is evaluated based on operating profit contributions using the same 
accounting policies as adopted for the Group’s financial statements.
u) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as liabilities once they are appropriately authorised.
v) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including reasonable 
expectations of future events. The resultant estimates will, by definition, not necessarily equal the related actual results and may require 
adjustment in subsequent accounting periods. The estimates and assumptions that may cause a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are:
Revenue recognition
Certain contracts entered into by the Group may include: the licensing or outright sale of the Group’s intellectual property; the provision  
of ongoing consultancy services; or a bundled combination of both.   
The Group considers contractual terms and makes judgements in assessing when the triggers for revenue recognition have been met, 
particularly that the Group has sufficiently fulfilled its obligations under the contract to allow revenue to be recognised and the allocation 
of revenue between multiple deliverables.
Book returns
As books are returnable by customers, the Group makes a provision against books sold in the accounting period which is then carried 
forward and offset against trade receivables in the statement of financial position in anticipation of book returns received subsequent to 
the reporting period end. The provision is calculated by reference to historical returns rates and expected future returns.
Author advances
A provision is made by the Group against advances on published titles which may not be covered by royalties on anticipated future title 
sales or subsidiary rights receivable. At the end of each financial year a review is carried out on all published titles advances. If it is unlikely 
that royalties from future title sales or subsidiary rights will fully earn down the advance, a provision is made in the income statement for the 
difference between the carrying value and the anticipated recoverable amount from future earnings.
Inventory
At the end of each reporting period a review is carried out on all published titles where inventory is held. A provision is made by the Group 
against unsold inventory on a title by title basis, with regard to historical net sales and expected future net sales, to value the inventories at 
the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Impairment reviews
IFRS require management to undertake an annual test for impairment of indefinite life assets and, for finite life assets, to test for impairment 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Group currently 
undertakes an annual impairment test covering goodwill and other indefinite life assets and also reviews finite life assets to consider 
whether a full impairment review is required. 
Intangible assets recoverability is an area involving management judgement, requiring assessment as to whether the carrying value of 
assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash flow projections which have been 
discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, certain assumptions are required to be 
made. Note [11] details the assumptions used.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
In 2016 the £1,070,000 current tax adjustment in respect of prior years relates to the carry back of double taxation relief to prior years and 
an adjustment to align the prior year Group tax charge with recently submitted tax returns, particularly for the US entities.
Subsequent to the successful First-Tier Tribunal decision on Bloomsbury Verlag, a prior year adjustment of £543,000 has been recognised 
for the utilisation of previously unrecognised losses. Linked to this successful decision there was a release of a £213,000 tax provision in 
respect of prior years. This went through highlighted items in prior years and thus has been released in the same place.
In 2015 the £795,000 deferred tax adjustment in respect of prior years relates to increased certainty over the recoverability of provision 
temporary differences in the US.
There are no significant unprovided exposures remaining.
c)  Factors affecting tax charge for future years
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were 
substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. Further reductions to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were 
substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was announced in the budget 
on 16 March 2016. This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax asset at 29 February 2016 has 
been calculated based on the substantively enacted rates.

9. Acquisitions
Prior year acquisition
Osprey Publishing Group
On 22 December 2014 the Group acquired the issued share capital of Osprey Publishing Limited (“Osprey”), the Oxford-based military and 
natural history publisher, from private equity ownership, principally The Third Alcuin Fund LP, a fund managed by Alcuin Capital Partners 
LLP. The consideration of £4.6 million was satisfied by the payment of £3.2 million in cash on completion and the issue of 869,054 new 
Bloomsbury Ordinary shares to the value of £1.4 million.
The acquisition of Osprey increases our presence in niche special interest markets. It is complementary to, and will substantially enhance, our 
existing lists; in particular increasing the Audit division’s expertise in natural history and military history publishing, as well as international sales. 
Over 50% of Osprey’s revenue is generated outside the UK, thereby increasing Bloomsbury’s benefit from the global book market. 
The table below summarises the fair values to the Group included in the consolidated financial statements of the major categories of assets 
and liabilities of Osprey at the date of acquisition. As a result of a final review of the acquired balance sheet, goodwill has increased by 
£235,000 and net assets decreased by the corresponding amount.

Identifiable intangible assets of £1,583,000 consist of publishing rights of £719,000, imprint of £782,000, customer relationships of £74,000 
and software of £8,000. The publishing rights and customer relationships have a useful life of 12 years and imprint 20 years. The goodwill 
arising of £1,816,000 is attributable to the expected profitability of the acquired business and the synergies expected to arise after the 
acquisition.
The gross contractual trade receivable at acquisition is £1,644,000, of which £46,000 is the best estimate of the contractual cash flows that 
are not expected to be collected.
Transaction costs of £210,000 have been expensed in the prior year within administrative expenses (highlighted items). 
From 23 December 2014 to 28 February 2015 revenue of £1,195,000 and profit before tax attributable to owners of the Company of £26,000 
has been included in the consolidated income statement in relation to Osprey.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 March 2014 the revenue and profit attributable to Shareholders of the combined entity for the prior 
year would have been £117.0 million and £8.3 million respectively. These pro forma amounts do not include any possible synergies from 
the acquisition. The pro forma information is provided for comparative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the actual results 
that would have occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations of the combined companies.
10. Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share for the year ended 29 February 2016 is calculated using a weighted average number of Ordinary shares in 
issue of 74,807,436 (2015: 73,250,139) after deducting shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust. 
The diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary shares to take account of all dilutive 
potential Ordinary Shares, which are in respect of unexercised share options and the Performance Share Plan.

Notes to the Financial Statements
Goodwill is not amortised, but instead is subject to annual impairment reviews. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately in the 
income statement. 
Acquisitions relate to finalisation of fair values on the Osprey Publishing acquisition; see note 9 for further information. The revision of cost 
relates to the deferred consideration on the Oxford International Publishers Limited acquisition.
Management have aligned the monitoring of goodwill to how it reviews the performance of the business. Goodwill is monitored by 
management at the publishing division level. The following is a summary of goodwill allocation for each publishing division:

Academic & Professional 29,703 30,139

Impairment testing
The recoverable amount of the Group’s goodwill has been considered with regard to value in use calculations. These calculations use the 
pre-tax future cash flow projections of each cash-generating unit (“CGU”) based on the Board’s approved budgets for the year ended  
29 February 2016 and the Board approved five-year plan. The calculations include a terminal value based on the projections for the final 
year of the five-year plan with a long-term growth rate assumption applied.
The key assumptions for calculating value in use are:

Academic & Professional 8.0 7.0 1.6–5.3 4.7–5.8 2.4 2.5
Discount rates
The discount rates applied to the cash flows are calculated using a pre-tax rate based on the weighted average cost of capital for the Group. 
This is adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates. The Group has considered the impact of the current economic 
climate in determining appropriate discount rates. 
Revenue growth rates
Growth rates have been calculated based on those applied to the Board approved budget for the year ended 29 February 2016 and five-
year plan. They incorporate future expectations of growth in backlist revenues and identified new revenue streams. 
Long-term growth rates
The five-year forecasts are extrapolated to perpetuity on the basis that the relevant CGUs are long established business units. The long-term 
growth rates is a blended rate formed from the territory-specific long-term growth rates.
Gross margin
Gross margins have been based on historic performance and expected changes to the sales mix in future periods. 
Sensitivity
The Group has not identified any reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill of any 
CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

14. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
a) Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using the tax rate appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the asset or liability 
arises and the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled.

At 29 February 2016 509 (46) 58 122 (2,480) 2,150 313
Deferred tax assets in respect of losses are only recognised to the extent that it is anticipated they will be utilised in the foreseeable future. 
The significant credit to the income statement in 2015 primarily relates to increased certainty over the recoverability of provision temporary 
differences in the US and recoverability of trading losses in the UK.
b) The analysis for financial reporting purposes is as follows:
29 February
 2016
£’000
28 February
 2015
£’000
Deferred tax assets 2,988 3,607
Deferred tax liabilities (2,675) (3,119)
Total 313 488
c) Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
The Group had deferred tax assets not recognised in the financial statements as follows:
29 February
 2016
£’000
28 February
 2015
£’000
Non-trading losses 271 465
At 29 February 2016 the Group had non-trading losses of approximately £1.5 million (2015: 2.3 million). A deferred tax asset has not been 
recognised in respect of non-trading losses carried forward as it is not clear whether sufficient non-trading income against which the losses 
may be offset will arise in the Group in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the Group controls the timing of remittance and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Royalty advances have been separated out from prepayments and accrued income to enable a user to get a better understanding of the 
business. A provision is held against gross advances payable in respect of published titles advances which may not be fully earned down by 
anticipated future sales. As at 29 February 2016 £5,530,000 (2015: £5,154,000) of royalty advances are expected to be recovered after more 
than 12 months. 
Trade receivables principally comprise amounts receivable from the sale of books due from distributors. The majority of trade debtors are 
secured by credit insurance and in certain territories by third party distributors. A provision for the return of books by customers is made 
with reference to the historic rate of returns.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values. The Group’s exposure to 
credit and currency risks is disclosed in note 24. Trade receivables principally comprise amounts receivable from the sale of books due from 
distributors. The average number of days’ credit taken for sales of books by the Group was 116 days (2015: 104 days). 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made with reference to specific debts, past default experience, trading history and the 
current economic environment. Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows:

The market value of the 5,792 shares of the Company held at 29 February 2016 (2015: 268,293) in the EBT was £9,000 (2015: £397,000). Whilst 
the trustee has power to subscribe for Ordinary shares and to acquire Ordinary shares in the market or from Treasury, it is not permitted to 
hold more than 5% of the issued share capital without prior approval of the Shareholders.
As at the date of signing this Annual Report, the Trust held 500,269 Ordinary shares of 1.25 pence being approximately 0.7% of the issued 
Ordinary share capital. 
Retained earnings
The retained earnings reserve comprises profit for the year attributable to owners of the Company and other items recognised directly 
through equity as presented on the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
22. Share-based payments 
Options over shares of the ultimate parent undertaking, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, have been granted to employees of the Group under 
various schemes. 
The total share-based payment charge to the income statement for the year was as follows:
29 February
 2016
£’000
28 February
 2015
£’000
Equity-settled share-based transactions 442 404
Cash-settled share-based transactions 45 92
Total 487 496
National Insurance contributions are payable by the Company in respect of some of the share-based payment transactions. These 
contributions are payable on the date of exercise based on the intrinsic value of the share-based payments and are therefore treated as 
cash-settled awards. The Group had an accrual for National Insurance at 29 February 2016 of £15,000 (2015: £58,000), of which none related 
to vested options.

Notes to the Financial Statements
a) The Bloomsbury Performance Share Plan 2005 (“the PSP”)
The Group operates the PSP for Directors and senior employees. Awards under the scheme are granted as conditional share awards. The 
number of Ordinary shares comprised in an award is calculated using a share value equal to either the average middle-market price of the 
Ordinary share for the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date or the middle-market price on the dealing day before the 
award date. 
The vesting period is three years and the level of vesting is subject to the achievement of Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) and Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) performance conditions. For details of the performance conditions see the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 
74. Awards are not exercisable after the vesting date and awards that vest on the vesting date are automatically exercised. Except in certain 
circumstances awards lapse if the employee leaves the Group.

Weighted average remaining contracted life (months) 21 21
Expense recognised for the year (£’000) 456 483
The share awards granted in the year to 29 February 2016 have been measured by New Bridge Street Consultants. The TSR element has 
been measured using the Stochastic model and the EPS element has been measured using the Black–Scholes model. The inputs were:
Performance condition Earnings Per Share Total Shareholder Return
Share price 162.0 pence 162.0 pence
Exercise price – –
Expected term 3 years 3 years
Expected volatility n/a 22.1%
Risk-free interest rate n/a 0.8%
Fair value charge per award 162.0 pence 91.27 pence
The expected volatility was based on Bloomsbury’s share price volatility over the period prior to grant equal in length to the expected 
three-year performance period. Half of each award is subject to an EPS performance condition (which is not factored into the valuation). 
Half of each award is subject to a Total Shareholder Return condition whereby performance is compared to the FTSE SmallCap Index 
(excluding Investment Trusts) over a three-year period from the date of grant. A median ranking results in 25% of shares subject to this 
performance condition vesting, rising to 100% for an upper-quartile ranking. The TSR condition is calculated at the date of grant using the 
Stochastic model and discounted back to the present value using the risk-free rate of return.

b) Bloomsbury Sharesave Plan 2005
The Group operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings-related share option scheme under which employees are granted 
options to purchase Ordinary shares in the Company in three years’ time, dependent upon their entering into a contract to make monthly 
contributions to a savings account over the period of the savings term. The Sharesave Plan is open to all UK employees.

c) The Bloomsbury Company Share Option Plan 2014 (“the CSOP”)
The Group operates the CSOP for senior employees. During the year awards under the scheme were granted at an option price per share  
of 159 pence. The option price is based on the closing mid-market price of a share on 12 July 2015.
The vesting period is three years and the level of vesting is subject to the achievement of “Annualised EPS in excess of RPI” performance 
conditions. Options are exercisable by the participant after the vesting date whilst the participant continues in employment with the Group 
up to a period ending ten years after the date of grant.

Notes to the Financial Statements
23. Retirement benefit obligations
Pension costs
The pension costs charged to the income statement of £827,000 (2015: £798,000) relate to the Group’s defined contribution and defined 
benefit pension arrangements. 
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all qualifying employees.
The total cost charged to the income statement of £808,000 (2015: £792,000) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the 
Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes. At 29 February 2016 there were no prepaid contributions (28 February 2015: nil).
Defined benefit plan
A subsidiary company operates a defined benefit scheme for some staff which is accounted for in accordance with IAS 19. Accrual of 
benefits ceased in 1997, with the scheme now operated as a closed fund. There is no obligation in respect of medical costs. The scheme is 
actuarially valued every three years. The last full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 28 February 2015 and updated to 29 February 2016 
by a qualified independent actuary.
Contributions are paid by the employer at the rate of £1,830 per month, plus expenses as and when required. Contributions paid to the 
scheme during the year were £45,000 (2015: £21,000). The Directors’ best estimate of the contributions including administration expenses 
to be paid for in the year ending 28 February 2017 is £63,000. In addition, PPF levies and other administration expenses are payable by the 
Group as and when due.
The Group’s policy is to fund the deficit in the scheme by additional contributions to meet the scheme’s commitment to members.
The financial assumptions used by the actuary for the update were as follows:
29 February 
2016
28 February 
2015
28 February 
2014
Discount rate 3.80% 3.40% 4.40%
Inflation assumption 2.10–3.10% 2.10–3.10% 2.50–3.40%
The scheme is closed and there are no active paying members, therefore no increases in payments have been applied. The assumptions 
used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in 
practice.
The mortality assumptions adopted at 29 February 2016 are 110% of the standard tables PNxA00, year of birth, no age rating for males and 
females, projected using Long Cohort underpinned by 1.00% p.a. These imply the following life expectancies:

Male retiring in 2035 25.7 25.6
Female retiring in 2035 28.0 28.0

24. Financial instruments and risk management
Capital management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
Shareholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may 
adjust the amount of dividends paid to Shareholders and issue new shares. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2015.
The capital structure of the Group comprises equity attributable to owners of the Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and 
retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity and note 21.

on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data).
Financial risk management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The 
Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance from the key risks of market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk  
and liquidity risk.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
The Board has approved the Group Treasury policies and procedures by which the Group Treasury function is to be managed. The Group 
Treasury function is headed by the Group Finance Director and is part of Bloomsbury’s Finance Department. It operates under a delegated 
authority from the Board. 
The Treasury management policies and procedures focus on the investment of surplus operating cash likely to be needed in order to 
support Bloomsbury’s ongoing operations, foreign currency requirements and interest rate risk management. The Group does not use 
derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The policies are reviewed at least on an annual basis by the Group Finance Director and any 
amendments are approved by the Board. The Board is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, who undertakes regular reviews of risk 
management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. 
a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the 
value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures 
within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. 
The Group incurs costs in the same currencies as it earns revenue creating some degree of natural hedging. 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the 
Board of Directors. Group Treasury monitors the distribution of its cash assets so as to control exposure to the relative performance of any 
particular territory, currency or institution.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as funding, foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investment of excess liquidity.
(i) Interest rate risk
The Group has significant interest-bearing assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents and as such cash flows are dependent on 
changes in market interest rates.

are cash at bank. 
Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate financial instruments
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore a change in interest rates at  
29 February 2016 would not affect the income statement. 
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate financial instruments
The Group derived the following sensitivities to assess the impact of changes in interest rates, based on the effect of the market volatility in 
the current climate and the previous 12 months. The analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.

Notes to the Financial Statements
(ii) Currency risk
The Directors believe that in its current circumstances the Group’s risk from foreign currency exposure is limited and no active currency risk 
management by hedging is considered necessary, as a significant proportion of revenues are matched by expenditure in the same local 
currency creating some degree of natural hedging.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The Group derived the following sensitivities based on the outstanding foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities at the 
year end. The sensitivity analysis includes loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the lender or the borrower. 
The use of a 10% sensitivity rate has been determined based on the effect of the market volatility in exchange rates between the current 
and previous year end, and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. A positive 
number below indicates an increase in profit or equity.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
b) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s trade and rights income receivables. 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The amounts presented in the statement of financial 
position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on trading experience and the 
current economic environment. An analysis of the relevant provisions is set out in note 16.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings as assigned by international credit-
rating agencies.
The Group determines its concentration of credit risk based on the individual characteristics of its customers and publicly available 
knowledge of specific circumstances affecting those customers. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they 
are related entities. 
The Group has a significant concentration of credit risk due to its use of third party distributors. Credit limits for the final customers are set 
by the distributors based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular 
basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. The distributors belong to established international groups whose business 
includes a number of publishing interests and clients. The Group’s risk is limited as significant amounts outstanding through the UK 
distributors are secured by credit insurance, and in the US credit risk for significant amounts outstanding through distributors rests with  
the distributor. 
c) Liquidity risk
The Directors do not consider that the Group currently has a significant exposure to liquidity risk, as the Group has limited borrowing and 
has sufficient cash deposits to meet its debts as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Cash flow budgets and forecasts are prepared by the operating entities of the Group, aggregated for the Group and regularly reviewed 
by the Board, and the actual cash position of the Group and each entity is compared monthly against budget. This allows management 
to ensure that each operating entity and the Group have sufficient cash to meet operational needs. Surplus cash held by the operating 
entities over and above the balance required for working capital management is invested in interest-bearing accounts and money market 
deposits. 
The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility with Lloyds Bank plc. At 29 February 2016 the Group had drawn down £1.4 million 
(2015: £2.5 million) of this facility with £14.1 million of undrawn borrowing facilities (2015: £13 million) available. The facilities comprised a 
£13.5 million committed revolving loan facility and £2.0 million overdraft.
In May 2016 Bloomsbury extended the revolving credit facility with Lloyds Bank plc under new terms. The existing facility expires in

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
Notes to the Company Financial Statements
Company Accounting Policies
30. Reporting entity
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the Company’s registered 
office can be found on page 131. The Company is primarily involved in the publication of books and other related services.
31. Significant accounting policies 
a)  Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations adopted by the European Union (“EU”) at the time of preparing 
these financial statements and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial 
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence at least until June 2017, being the period of the detailed going concern 
assessment reviewed by the Board.
The Company accounting policies are consistent with the Group policies set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Key 
additional policies are stated below. 
b)  Parent Company result
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present the Company 
income statement or statement of comprehensive income. The Company’s profit for the year was £4,447,000 (2015: £2,130,000). 
c)  Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Company financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in 
which the estimate is revised and in any future years affected. Critical judgements and areas where the use of estimates is significant are 
disclosed in note 2v) for the Group and are applicable for the Company.
d)  Application of new and amended standards and interpretations
The following amendments and interpretations were introduced to accounting standards relevant to the Company during the year ended  
29 February 2016. The table below summarises the impact of these changes to the Company:
Accounting standard Description of change Impact on financial statements
IAS 19 Employee Benefits The amendment simplifies how to account for contributions that are made 
independently of the number of years of employee service.
The amendment has not had 
any impact on the Company.
Annual Improvements 
to IFRS 2010–2012 cycle
Amendments have been made to update and clarify various standards including 
IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment', IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', IFRS 8 'Operating 
Segments', IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement', IAS 16 'Property, Plant and 
Equipment', IAS 38 'Intangible Assets' and IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures'.
The amendments made 
do not have an impact on 
the financial position or 
performance of the Company.
Annual Improvements 
to IFRS 2011–2013 cycle
Amendments have been made to update and clarify various standards including  
IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards', IFRS 3  
'Business Combinations', IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' and IAS 40 'Investment 
Property'.
The amendments made 
do not have an impact on 
the financial position or 
performance of the Company.
The Directors are currently assessing the potential impact of other new and revised accounting standards, interpretations or amendments 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are currently endorsed but not yet effective. They have not been adopted 
early by the Company and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
e)  Investment in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less accumulated impairment in the statement of financial position. Investments are 
reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there are any indicators of impairment. Any impairment losses are recognised in the 
income statement in the year they occur.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
f)  Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payment instruments to certain employees of the Group. Equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-
based payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the 
shares that will eventually vest. 
Options granted under the Company’s share option schemes and Sharesave scheme are equity settled. The fair values of such options have 
been calculated using the Black–Scholes model or a modified version of the same, based on publicly available market data. 
Awards granted under the Company’s Performance Share Plan are equity settled. Part of any award granted under the plan is subject to a 
Total Shareholder Return performance condition. The fair value of this element of the awards is calculated using the Stochastic model. The 
other part of any award granted under the plan is subject to an Earnings Per Share performance condition. The fair value of this element of 
the awards is calculated using the Black–Scholes model.
Awards granted under the Company’s Share Option Plan are equity settled. The award is subject to an Adjusted Earnings Per Share growth 
performance condition. The fair value of this award is calculated using the Black–Scholes model.
The Company recharges a share of the share-based payment charge to subsidiaries. This recharge is made via intercompany transactions.

COMPANY  INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT
The non-current amount owed by Group undertakings has been moved to current receivables as this loan is technically repayable on 
demand; however, there is no intention to demand repayment of the loan within the next twelve months. 
Royalty advances have been separated out from prepayments and accrued income to enable a user to get a better understanding of the 
business. A provision is held against gross advances payable in respect of published titles advances which may not be fully earned down by 
anticipated future sales. As at 29 February 2016 £2,576,000 (2015: £2,594,000) of royalty advances are expected to be recovered after more 
than 12 months.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values. The Company’s exposure 
to credit and currency risks is disclosed in note 44. Trade receivables principally comprise amounts receivable from the sale of books due 
from distributors. The average number of days’ credit taken for sales of books by the Company was 227 days (2015: 232 days). 
Movements on the Company’s provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The Company derived the following sensitivities based on the outstanding foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities at 
the year end. 
The use of a 10% sensitivity rate has been determined based on the effect of the market volatility in exchange rates between the current 
and previous year end, and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. A positive 
number below indicates an increase in profit or loss and equity.

b)  Credit risk 
The Company has a significant concentration of credit risk due to its use of third party distributors. Credit limits for the final customers are 
set by the distributors based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular 
basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. The distributors belong to established international groups whose business 
includes a number of publishing interests and clients. The Company’s risk is limited as significant amounts outstanding through the UK 
distributors are secured by credit insurance.

Explanation of the Annual General Meeting
To Bloomsbury Shareholders and, for information only, to the holders of share options and awards under the Company’s share 
incentive schemes.
This document is important and requires your immediate attention.
1. If you are in any doubt as to the action you should take, you are recommended to seek your own financial advice immediately from 
your stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant, fund manager or other appropriate independent financial adviser authorised 
under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
2. If you sell or have sold or otherwise transferred all of your shares, you should send this document together with the accompanying 
Form of Proxy as soon as possible to the purchaser or transferee or to the stockbroker, bank or other agent through whom the sale or 
transfer was effected for delivery to the purchaser or the transferee.
Dear Shareholder
The 2016 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (the “Company”) is to be held at 50 Bedford Square, London WC1B 
3DP on Tuesday 19 July 2016 at 12 noon. The formal notice convening the AGM is set out on pages 135 to 138 below.
Information regarding the AGM, including the information required by section 311A of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”), is available 
from www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
The AGM is an important opportunity for the Directors to listen to the Shareholders and respond to their questions. It is also when 
Shareholders are asked to vote in favour of various resolutions related to the running and management of the Company. Therefore below 
are explanatory notes relating to the resolutions that you will be asked to consider and vote on at the AGM. Resolutions 1 to 14 will be 
proposed as ordinary resolutions and resolutions 15 and 16 will be proposed as special resolutions.
As at 12 noon on the date of this notice, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 75,081,177 Ordinary shares of 1.25 pence each 
(subject to any changes that will be notified to you at the beginning of the AGM). Each Ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a 
General Meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company as at 12 noon on the date of this notice 
is 75,081,177.
As a Shareholder, you are entitled to attend and vote but, if you are not able to attend, then you may appoint one or more proxies to 
attend, speak and vote on your behalf.
As your vote is important to us, whether or not you intend to come to the AGM, you are asked to return the Form of Proxy provided to you. 
Completing the Form of Proxy will not prohibit Shareholders from attending, and voting at, the AGM in person.
The Ordinary Business to be proposed at the 2016 Annual General Meeting

Resolutions 4 to 11 (ordinary resolutions) – Re-election of Directors
In accordance with best practice for issuers listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and the Articles of Association of 
the Company (“Articles”), all the Directors will retire at the AGM and, being eligible, offers themselves for reappointment. The Board has 
considered the appraisal of the performance of each Director and recommends that each Director is reappointed. 
Resolution 12 (ordinary resolution) – Reappointment of the Auditor
The Board recommends that the incumbent External Auditor, KPMG LLP, be reappointed for a further year so that they are able to audit the 
Company’s report and accounts for the year ending 28 February 2017.
Resolution 13 (ordinary resolution) – Remuneration of the Auditor
The Board proposes that it be authorised to determine the level of the Auditor’s remuneration.
The Special Business to be proposed at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 14 (ordinary resolution) – Authority to allot Ordinary shares
This is a resolution to replace the general authority, last given at the 2015 AGM, for the Directors to be authorised to allot Ordinary shares 
pursuant to section 551 of the Act. This resolution, if passed, would give the Directors the authority to allot up to 25,024,556 Ordinary shares 
of 1.25 pence with a nominal value of £312,806, representing approximately 33.33% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company at 
the date of this notice.
This authority, if granted, will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM and 15 months from the date of passing 
this resolution. The Board has no present intention of exercising the authority granted by this resolution. The Board intends to seek its 
renewal at subsequent AGMs of the Company.
As at the date of signing the Directors’ Report for the 2016 Annual Report, the Directors had beneficial holdings of Ordinary shares in 
the Company which, in aggregate, amounted to approximately 2.3% of the Ordinary shares in issue. The Directors have been granted 
awards under the Company’s share schemes* that, if they were to fully vest, would entitle the Directors to further Ordinary shares which in 
aggregate would amount to approximately a further 2.4% of the Ordinary shares in issue. 
*  Includes conditional share awards under the Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Performance Share Plan 2005 and Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2014 Performance Share Plan and options 
granted under the Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2014 Sharesave Plan and, in the case of Jonathan Glasspool for options granted prior to his appointment as a Director, under the 
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc 2014 Company Share Option Plan. 
Resolution 15 (special resolution) – Disapplication of statutory pre-emption provisions
This resolution gives limited power to the Directors to allot new Ordinary shares for cash without first offering them, pro rata, to existing 
Shareholders pursuant to section 571 of the Act.
The maximum nominal value of new Ordinary shares which may be so allotted under this authority is £46,926 or 3,754,058 shares of 1.25 
pence, being equivalent to approximately 5% of the entire issued Ordinary share capital of the Company at date of this notice. This 
authority will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM and 15 months from the date of passing this resolution.
Resolution 16 (special resolution) – Authority for the Company to purchase Ordinary shares
With the authority of Shareholders in general meeting, the Company is empowered by the Articles to purchase Ordinary shares subject to 
the provisions of the Act. The Directors believe it is prudent to seek general authority from Shareholders to be able to act if circumstances 
arise in which they consider such purchases to be desirable. The Directors have no current intention to exercise the authority granted by 
this resolution and it will only be exercised if and when, in the light of market conditions prevailing at that time, the Directors believe that 
such purchases would increase earnings per share and would be for the benefit of Shareholders generally.
This resolution authorises the Company to purchase its own Ordinary shares and either, depending on the circumstances at the time and 
subject to the provisions of the Act, to hold these as Treasury shares or to cancel them. This authority would, if granted, expire on the earlier 
of the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM and 15 months from the date of passing this resolution.
The Company would be authorised to make market purchases of up to 7,508,117 Ordinary shares of 1.25 pence with a nominal value 
of £93,851, being equivalent to approximately 10% of the issued Ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) of the Company at 
the date of this notice. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) shall be not more than 5% above the average market value of the 
Company’s equity shares for the five business days prior to the day the purchase is made. The minimum price (exclusive of expenses) that 
may be paid shall be the nominal value of an Ordinary share (1.25 pence).

The Form of Proxy should be completed and returned as soon as possible to Capita Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, 
Kent, BR3 4TU and, in any event, so as to reach such address no later than 48 hours before the appointed commencement time of the AGM 
(for which a prepaid business reply service has been provided). You may also deliver it by hand to Capita Asset Services, PXS,  
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU during usual business hours, by such time.
Recommendations
The Board considers that the passing of Resolutions 1 to 16 is in the best interests of the Company and of the Shareholders as a whole and is 
most likely to promote the success of the Company. The Board unanimously recommends that you vote in favour of all the resolutions, as 
each of the Directors intends to do in respect of his or her own beneficial holdings of shares in the Company.

Ordinary shares of the Company;
b) the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for each Ordinary share is an amount equal to 105 per cent of the

five business days immediately preceding the date on which such share is contracted to be purchased and the minimum price 
(exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for each Ordinary share is 1.25 pence;
c) the authority hereby conferred shall, unless previously varied, revoked or renewed, expire at the conclusion of the next Annual 
General Meeting of the Company to be held after passing this resolution or 15 months from the date of passing of this resolution, 
whichever shall be the earlier; and

GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STRATEGIC REPORT COMPANY  INFORMATION
Notes:
1. Only the holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to attend the meeting and vote. A member entitled to attend and vote may appoint 
one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote on his behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A Form of Proxy is 
enclosed for your use. Further copies of the Form of Proxy may be obtained from the registered office of the Company or from  
www.bloomsbury-ir.co.uk.
2. If a member wishes his proxy to speak on his behalf at the meeting, he or she will need to appoint his/ her own choice of proxy (who is 
not the Chairman) and give instructions directly to the proxy. The completion and return of a Form of Proxy will enable a Shareholder 
to vote at the Annual General Meeting without having to be present at the Annual General Meeting, but will not preclude him/ her 
from attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if he/she should subsequently decide to do so.
3. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. A 
member may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy, please 
sign and date the Form of Proxy and attach a schedule listing the names and addresses (in block letters) of all your proxies, the number 
of shares in respect of which each proxy is appointed (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you) and 
indicating how you wish each proxy to vote or abstain from voting. If you wish to appoint the Chairman as one of your multiple proxies, 
insert “Chairman of the Meeting” in the box which is used to identify the name of the proxy on the relevant proxy card.
4. To be valid, the enclosed Form of Proxy must be lodged with the Company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars, not later than 48 hours 
before the time appointed for the holding of the Annual General Meeting.
5. Shareholders included on the register of members (in relation to Ordinary shares held in CREST, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001) at 6.00 pm on 17 July 2016 will be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting 
in respect of the number of Ordinary shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to the register of members after that time 
will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
6. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information rights (a 
“Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the Shareholder by whom he/she was nominated (“Relevant 
Member”), have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a 
Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she, under any such agreement, may have 
a right to give instructions to the Relevant Member as to the exercise of voting rights. Your main point of contact in terms of your 
investment in the Company remains the Relevant Member (or, perhaps, your custodian or broker) and you should continue to contact 
them (and not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating to your personal details and your interest in the Company 
(including any administrative matters). The only exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a response from you.
7. The statement of the rights of Shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights 
described in this regard can only be exercised by Shareholders of the Company.
8. Shareholders should note that it is possible that, pursuant to requests made by Shareholders of the Company under sections 527 
to 531 of the Act, the Company may be required to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit 
of the Company’s accounts (including the Auditor’s Report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual 
General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an Auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous 
meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. The Company may not require the 
Shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the 
Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s 
Auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the 
Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the Act to publish on  
a website.

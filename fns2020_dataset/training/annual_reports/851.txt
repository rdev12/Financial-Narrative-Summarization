02 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 Recommended offer for Foster Wheeler
On 13 February 2014, AMEC announced that it had entered 
into a definitive agreement with Foster Wheeler AG 
(Foster Wheeler) under which AMEC will make a 
recommended offer to acquire the entire issued and to be 
issued share capital of Foster Wheeler (the acquisition).
The full announcement is available on AMEC’s website, 
amec.com. The acquisition is also referenced in this report, 
particularly to show how it could accelerate achievement 
of AMEC’s growth strategy . 
Under the terms of the acquisition, Foster Wheeler 
shareholders would receive 0.8998 new AMEC securities 
and $16.00 in cash for each Foster Wheeler share. 
The cash portion of the consideration will be financed by 
a combination of AMEC’ s existing cash resources and new 
debt financing. The securities portion of the consideration 
will be satisfied by the issuance of approximately 90 million 
new AMEC securities to Foster Wheeler shareholders, 
which, at the election of Foster Wheeler shareholders, will 
be issued in the form of either ordinary shares or American 
depositary shares (for which AMEC will seek a US listing). 
On completion of the acquisition, Foster Wheeler 
shareholders will hold shares in AMEC representing 
approximately 23 per cent of its enlarged share capital 
and it is expected that two non-executive directors of 
Foster Wheeler will join the AMEC board.
The acquisition is expected to be double-digit earnings 
accretive in the first 12 months following completion, and 
ROIC is expected to exceed the cost of capital in the second 
12-month period following completion. AMEC expects to 
have a pro-forma trailing 12 months ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA of approximately 1.6 times following completion.
Due to its size, the acquisition is a class 1 transaction 
under the UK listing rules and therefore requires the 
approval of AMEC shareholders. Completion of the 
transaction will also be subject to AMEC having received 
valid acceptance to the offer from holders of Foster 
Wheeler shares holding a minimum of 80 per cent of the 
total issued share capital of Foster Wheeler , regulatory and 
anti-trust approvals, a Foster Wheeler shareholder vote, 
and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. 
The acquisition is expected to close in the second half 
of 2014.
Key anticipated benefits of the combination include:
 
Positioning AMEC to serve across the whole oil 
and gas value chain, adding mid and downstream 
capabilities to AMEC’ s existing upstream focus and 
bringing new customer relationships
 
Improved geographic footprint, more than doubling 
AMEC’ s current revenues in the Growth Regions, 
increasing AMEC’s Latin America exposure and 
bringing scale benefits
 
Annual cost synergies, estimated by AMEC to 
be at least $75 million, and additional significant 
tax synergies 
 
Significant revenue synergies, including cross-
selling services to the combined customer base, 
such as expanding the brownfield and environmental 
service offering internationally into the mid and 
downstream markets
 
Retaining AMEC’ s low-risk and cash-generative 
business model. Foster Wheeler has a similar 
business model, with predominantly cost-plus 
contracting and an asset-light engineering and 
project management business
 
Combining two highly skilled workforces with 
industry-leading engineering and project 
management expertise
 
Adding a robust and profitable power equipment 
business with a solid backlog of orders.

Oil & Gas
Growth is driven by the 
long-term rise in energy 
demand. Resources are 
becoming increasingly 
difficult to access which 
plays to AMEC’s expertise 
in complex engineering 
and harsh locations.
T echnology is facilitating 
the development of tight 
oil and shale gas.
Mining
General macro 
uncertainty is affecting 
the near-term outlook for 
the mining industry , 
increasing volatility . 
Long-term fundamentals 
remain robust, supported 
by increasing 
urbanisation in emerging 
markets.
Clean Energy
Clean energy provides an 
increasingly significant 
part of the global energy 
mix, its growth driven by 
increasing demand for 
power and environmental 
concerns. AMEC’ s proven 
expertise, depth of 
technology understanding 
and strong customer 
relationships provide 
further growth 
opportunities.

Chairman’ s statement
As I write, we have just agreed a recommended offer 
for Foster Wheeler AG, the international engineering, 
construction and project management contractor and power 
equipment supplier . Y our board believes the combination 
of AMEC and Foster Wheeler would be compelling for all 
shareholders. I will talk more about this later . 
First let me address the progress we have made in 
other areas. 
The board
Let me start by commenting on our board. 
The ultimate goal of your board is to collectively and 
effectively lead the company in delivering long-term 
sustainable success for the benefit of all of our shareholders. 
The right mix of individuals is needed to achieve this, each 
with the relevant experience, skills and determination to 
take the company forward. Importantly , the board should 
reflect the diversity of the organisation.
Our board objectives for 2013 included discussing our 
policy on diversity and any measurable objectives we 
wish to set to track progress. After a wide-ranging review 
of what diversity means within AMEC and an engaged 
discussion on the conclusions at board level, a group-wide 
commitment to diversity and inclusion has been 
implemented. Diversity includes the range of human 
differences that make us individual and who we are: 
inclusion is about us valuing and using the differences 
between us. The implementation of this commitment 
includes measurement and monitoring of progress 
on diversity and inclusion activities.
2014 will see changes on our board, with Tim Faithfull, 
our Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the 
remuneration committee, standing down at our next AGM. 
Tim has supported AMEC through a period of significant 
and successful change and I have personally valued his 
advice and support. On behalf of us all, I would like to thank 
him for his contribution. 
Simon Thompson will take over from Tim as Senior 
Independent Director and Chairman of the remuneration 
committee, with Linda Adamany becoming Chairman of 
the ethics committee. We have appointed an independent 
search company , The Zygos Partnership, to identify new 
board talent with the appropriate skills and experience to 
contribute to our future success.
Our customers rely on our professionalism and expertise 
in delivering their projects. Y our board saw this first hand in 
2013, in Canada. We gained a greater understanding of the 
scale and complexity of our projects in the oil sands and of 
the sustainable approach AMEC brings. We also saw how 
seriously the company takes its community responsibilities, 
with employees quickly rallying to support those affected 
by the floods sweeping through Calgary . These visits are 
invaluable in ensuring the board is connected to the 
business it serves. 
Board priorities
I have spoken previously about how the board should support 
the successful, sustainable growth of your company .
Firstly , we should debate and agree the strategy the 
company is to follow – and then monitor performance 
against the strategic goals. As we move closer to the end 
point of AMEC’ s Vision 2015 growth strategy , board 
discussions have increasingly turned to how we achieve 
success beyond 2015. Our geographic organisational 
structure was introduced late in 2012, in support of our 
longer-term objectives, and has gained real traction during 
2013. The organisation is collaborating better and creating 
 Y our company has in place 
a strong, highly competent board 
that performs well.”

new opportunities for growth, despite the headwinds 
in some of our markets. Y our board has challenged and 
supported management in their acquisition aspirations, 
confident in the financial discipline they display . 
Secondly , we must ensure the company has the right 
people in place to deliver its targets, now and for the future. 
Remuneration remains a key part of our people plan and 
our remuneration report shows how we link short and 
long-term incentives to hard measures of improvement in 
the company’s performance, in line with the strategy – see 
page 60. Separately , we also maintain regular interaction 
with the senior management of the company , including 
Simon Naylor and John Pearson, Group Presidents of 
Americas and Europe respectively .
Finally , there must be an appropriate level of governance 
in place, a topic I elaborate on later , on page 47. As I flagged 
last year , during 2013 we launched our updated and 
simplified global mandatory policies and procedures. 
These are now easier to understand and so comply with. 
Almost 21,000 of our employees completed our new 
anti-bribery and corruption training, launched in the 
autumn. Good governance needs to inform the decisions 
our employees take every day . I talk to our employees 
on a regular basis and so see how seriously we take 
our commitment to safety , how involved we are with 
our communities and how hard we work to win repeat 
business from our customers. For the tenth year in 
succession we were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Index, which suggests others also recognise the work we 
do and the way in which we do it.
Performance and shareholder returns
Despite downturn in some of our markets, and as 
reported in more detail in the Chief Executive’s review 
and elsewhere, our company saw underlying revenues
1
 
excluding incremental procurement broadly flat and 
achieved growth in earnings per share
2
 of 11 per cent 
in 2013. We expect further growth in 2014.
As a result of our confidence in the outlook, and reflecting 
our strong cash generation, the board is recommending 
a final dividend of 28.5 pence per share. This makes a total 
of 42.0 pence per share for the year , a 15 per cent increase 
over 2012 and a dividend cover of 2.1 times (2012: 2.2 times). 
If approved, it will be paid on 2 July 2014 to those shar eholders 
on the register at 30 May 2014. It is the board’s intention to 
continue with a progressive dividend policy , whether or not 
the Foster Wheeler acquisition goes ahead.
The £400 million share buyback programme which began 
in February 2012 was completed in February 2013.
Recommended offer for Foster Wheeler AG
AMEC has been transformed in recent years and is now 
highly cash generative. Y our board believes the best use 
for this cash is to invest in growth, returning surplus cash 
to shareholders if no suitable opportunities are found. 
On 13 February 2014 we announced the terms of a 
recommended offer for Foster Wheeler . Y ou can find 
the details on page 3. We believe this acquisition would 
accelerate achievement of AMEC’ s growth strategy , by 
expanding our position in mid and downstream oil & gas 
and enhancing our geographic position in our Growth 
Regions. It is also expected to be financially attractive, 
with double digit earnings enhancement expected 
in the first 12 months following completion. 
Under the terms of the offer for Foster Wheeler , two of their 
non-executive directors would be nominated to join our board 
from completion of the transaction. I believe this would 
support a successful integration of our two businesses.
Y our board remains focused on the achievement of 
shareholder value and will remain disciplined in its 
approach to this and any other acquisitions.
In conclusion
I believe the potential combination of Foster Wheeler and 
AMEC makes strategic and financial sense and I expect 
to update you soon on progress. Importantly , I believe we 
have a highly energised and extremely able team at AMEC. 
It is AMEC’ s proven ability to deliver excellence that will 
underpin our future growth, with or without acquisitions. 
On your behalf, I would like to thank Samir Brikho, his 
management team and all of AMEC’ s nearly 29,000 people 
for their hard work and valuable contribution in 2013.

2  Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
before intangible amortisation and exceptional items 08 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013
Before joining AMEC, I talked to those who knew 
the company well. They spoke of many things I now 
recognise myself: high-quality people, expertise, strong 
customer relationships. But back then there was no 
coherent vision. That has now changed and since 2006 
we have been on a journey of improvement, increasing 
margins and improving earnings per share fivefold
1
. 
We have generated substantial amounts of cash and 
have spent over £700 million on acquisitions to support 
growth and returned some £1 billion to shareholders. 
It’s a strong history – but I am never satisfied. 
By implementing our Vision 2015 strategy we have 
strengthened our position in our four core markets, 
improved our geographic footprint and enhanced the 
capabilities we provide to our customers. We need to do 
more of this as we look to 2015 and beyond and I believe 
the acquisition of Foster Wheeler would support this goal.
Let me mention our 2013 results then focus on some 
examples of our progress towards Vision 2015. 
2013 results
As expected, 2013 was a year of contrasts in our markets. 
Our business model and reputation for excellent delivery 
protected us from much of the uncertainty and helped 
ensure that underlying revenues
2
 (excluding incremental 
procurement) were broadly flat. Adjusted earnings per 
share
3
 of 87.2 pence were 11 per cent higher and we 
converted this to cash at an impressive rate, with cash 
conversion of 99 per cent
4
. Ian McHoul, CFO, discusses 
the results in more detail on page 39.
Our customers
Our vision is that by sustainably delivering excellence, 
we inspire trust and loyalty in our customers. We are 
looking to create strong customer relationships, 
becoming and remaining a trusted partner .
We have built an impressive pedigree of US solar projects. 
Sempra US Gas & Power is one example of a new 
customer in 2013 and the solar project they awarded 
us is seven times larger than any we have completed 
to date, at 250MW. 
In contrast, we have been working with KNPC since 
2007 providing project engineering and management 
services (PEMS) at their refineries. In 2013 following 
a competitive tender , we re-won the contract with 
an enhanced scope. We are also providing project 
management consultancy (PMC) services for KNPC 
on a new refinery at Al Zour , Kuwait.
 The combination of AMEC and 
Foster Wheeler would be financially 
and strategically attractive. I believe 
it would be a compelling proposition 
for our shareholders, customers 
and employees.”

Our people
Many people join us to create a lifelong career; others 
work on specific projects. Our business in Europe 
recruited almost 6,000 people in 2013, despite resource-
constrained markets, to work on projects such as the 
hook-up and commissioning of ConocoPhillips’ new 
Jasmine facilities in the North Sea. Elsewhere, we have 
also recruited successfully for project ramp-ups in the 
Middle East. This effort – planning, identifying, recruiting 
and training people – is crucial to our success, ensuring 
we deliver the skills our customers need, at the time they 
need them. 
Our employees tell us there are three main reasons why 
they join and stay with us: opportunity , excellence and 
belonging. These are the core of our employer brand 
‘Why AMEC’, which is also recognised externally . In 2013 
we were ranked one of the top 20 ‘most in demand’ 
employers by LinkedIn UK. Our history is reflected in 
the composition of our employee base. The commitment 
we formalised in 2013, to diversity and inclusion, is an 
important stepping stone on our journey to become 
more global.
Never compromising on safety is one of our four core 
values. In 2013 TRCFR
5
 and AIFR
6
 both reduced again, 
to 0.26 and 1.56 respectively per 200,000 exposure hours. 
It is clear we cannot afford complacency . Our target for 
lost time incidents (L TIs) is zero yet we had 14 L TIs in 
the year. 
We continue to work closely in and for our local 
communities, including donating over £400,000 to 
match the fundraising efforts of our employees. 
Our markets
We said at the start of 2013 that we anticipated ongoing 
economic uncertainty and more challenging conditions 
in certain areas and that is exactly what we found. 
The downturn in global mining markets has been widely 
reported and our oil sands business in Canada has come 
off the peaks seen in 2010 as the Kearl project moves 
into production. In contrast, our conventional oil & gas 
business has seen good growth, led by the UK North Sea 
and boosted by new contract wins in the Middle East. 
Our US renewable business has been strong, particularly 
in solar , and further growth is expected in 2014. There 
have been positive signs around UK nuclear new build, 
though AMEC is unlikely to see significantly more activity 
until the EU completes its review. 
We have deliberately diversified our business across 
energy and power markets and this remains our strategy .
Our global reach
Our simplified geographic organisation has now been 
in place for a little over 12 months. More important than 
the cost savings are the increased collaboration and 
new growth opportunities being created. For example, 
in October we were awarded the front end loading study 
for Vale’ s underground mine at Voisey Bay in Canada. 
This is our first major contract for this customer; 
expands our position in underground mining, an 
objective of our Vision 2015 strategy; and is being 
worked on collaboratively by employees from our 
power and E&I businesses, from Canada and the US.
Vision 2015: a snapshot
We first announced our Vision 2015 growth strategy 
in late 2009:
  By focusing on our customers, our people and 
delivering the AMEC Way , we want to create 
sustainable growth
  Our key measure of success is the improvement 
in earnings per share between 2009 and 2015. 
Earnings per share3
87.2p +11%
This compares with 49.6 pence in 2009 when we started 
this part of our journey
We are now looking beyond 2015 –

Chief Executive’ s review continued
Our global reach continued
We still need to create a sustainable position in our 
Growth Regions. Our business in the Middle East 
performed strongly in 2013 and ended the year with 
a record order book, but conditions elsewhere were 
more difficult. Creating a greater scale is one of our 
objectives from an acquisition such as Foster Wheeler. 
Let me touch on Foster Wheeler here. We believe this 
acquisition could significantly accelerate implementation 
of our growth strategy . Its mid and downstream oil & gas 
business is complementary to our existing upstream 
position and is well positioned to gain from the growth 
anticipated in North America. Its position in Growth 
Regions is also good and would provide us with more 
scale in the region. As is shown in more detail on page 3, 
the financial characteristics of the deal are also expected 
to be very attractive. 
We would expect this deal to close in the second half 
of 2014. 
Our expertise
We continue to work right across the life cycle of our 
clients’ assets and believe our customers increasingly 
value the flexibility this offers. Again, let me pick out 
just a couple of examples.
We have seen recent strength in brownfield operations 
on projects such as the Montrose BLP contract for 
T alisman where work is due to be completed in 2016. 
We are exploring how to export this capability from 
the UK North Sea to other parts of the world. 
We acquired qedi in 2011 for its expertise in specialist 
completions and commissioning services. Since then 
the business has grown threefold and in 2013 contributed 
to projects for BP , TAQA, GDF SUEZ and many others. 
Our way of working
We are continually looking for improvements in how 
we work. 
Our new shared services centre in the Philippines was 
officially opened in December , when, in line with local 
custom, a priest blessed the building. As well as 
consolidating finance and HR administrative activities 
for our Growth Regions business, our global IT support 
will be run from this office. 
Our High Value Delivery Centre (HVDC) in Jakarta has 
been working closely with offices elsewhere in the world, 
including with Aberdeen on an FPSO vessel conversion 
for one of our clients. The client gained from the use of 
multiple time zones and a lower overall cost and has 
subsequently awarded us more work. Elsewhere our 
office in Shanghai has been supporting the delivery of 
work on the Oyu T olgoi mine in Mongolia, working with 
colleagues in Vancouver .
Our sustainable approach is a part of what differentiates 
us in the eyes of our customers. In 2013 we have made 
further improvements in the reporting of our carbon 
emissions (see page 26).
2015 and beyond
I am proud of what we have achieved so far and thank 
all my colleagues for the hard work and contribution 
they have made to AMEC’ s success. 
But as I said previously , we can’t stand still. 
The proposed acquisition of Foster Wheeler is an exciting 
prospect. Irrespective of what happens about acquisitions, 
we are focused on collaboration, continual improvement 
and growth within our markets. That’ s how we will 
achieve sustainable success to 2015 – and beyond.

13 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013
Governance Financials Overview Strategic report
The business section of this strategic report 
has been divided into six segments based on 
our business model. Understand how each helps 
us achieve our strategy on the following pages… 14 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013
Our people
Our people are AMEC’ s principal 
asset as we do not own significant 
machinery or proprietary 
technology . Our continued success 
depends on our people and the way 
in which they deliver for our 
customers, every day , around 
the world.
It is vital that we continue to attract, develop and 
retain skilled employees. We work hard to achieve 
this and are successful. For example, this year we 
have successfully recruited to support our business 
in Europe including working on significant hook-up 
and commissioning work in the UK North Sea. Despite 
this, in some of our geographies our growth has been 
constrained by the availability of skilled people. 
In 2013, we have increased our efforts to improve the 
effectiveness of our people – in particular focusing 
on increasing the collaboration between offices, 
between teams, between different sectors and between 
geographies. We are already seeing the benefits of 
this approach and it will continue to be a priority in 2014.
What this means for 
our strategy
Our success lies in the success of our employees and 
the way in which they deliver to our customers.
Our employees are clever people: their skills are a scarce 
resource. Our highly skilled engineers, project managers, 
consultants and scientists deliver for our customers, 
creating long term customer relationships and a strong 
reputation for excellence.
Our future success relies on us attracting, developing 
and retaining the best people, particularly those with 
experience in successfully delivering complex projects. 
Our people strategy is a core enabler of our 2015 and 
beyond growth aspirations. 
Our internal development activities are discussed in more 
detail in our sustainability report and on our website. 
They include:
 
AMEC Academy: improving the technical and 
managerial skills of our people, with all programmes 
delivered in a consistent and integrated manner across 
the globe 
 
increasing the existing resource pool: graduate and 
trainee recruitment and development programmes 
 
improving the future supply pool: educating 
schoolchildren about careers in engineering 
 
accessing the best skills anywhere: using our global 
mobility programmes.
Our growth will inevitably put further pressure on the 
availability of suitably qualified engineers, consultants 
and project managers. 
Evidence of a skills shortage abounds. In the UK, the Royal 
Academy of Engineering has warned that the current pool 
of science, technology and engineering experts is already 
‘stretched thin’ and ageing rapidly . It estimates that the 
median age of chartered engineers rises by 10 years for 
every 14 that pass.
We select our projects carefully , ensuring we are using, 
and being rewarded for , the skills and experience of our 
employees. We need to think as One AMEC and use our 
people on the projects most likely to create long-term 
advantage for the company overall. We increasingly make 
use of our common tools and systems to share work 
between offices. This not only allows employees access 
to a wider range of challenging projects but also builds 
greater flexibility into our cost base.

We maintain the highest standards of safety and ethics.
Our commitment to human rights is shown in our Code 
of Business Conduct. We support the elimination of forced 
or child labour , respect the human rights of any individual 
or community in which we work and are committed to 
providing a workplace which is safe and secure, founded 
on mutual respect, free from harassment and offering 
equal opportunity for promotion and advancement.
People, safety and integrity , together with environment, 
provide the foundations to our sustainability strategy which 
is explained in more detail in our separate 2013

2013 achievements included: 
 
Recruited successfully in resource-constrained markets. 
For example, our business in Europe recruited almost 
6,000 people in 2013. Many of these appointments were 
short term, in support of the significant hook-up and 
commissioning activity in the UK North Sea. Success 
involved careful planning and targeted recruitment 
campaigns, to ensure the right skills were available, 
in the right place, at the right time
 
Refreshed our graduate recruitment website and 
materials. Over 400 graduates, trainees and interns 
joined AMEC in 2013 
 
Almost 500 people were referred by our employees 
and more than 120 returned to AMEC because of our 
alumni programmes
 
Continue to see about one-third of our people 
participating in share ownership schemes
 
Strong HSSE performance continued: the AIFR reduced 
to 1.56 per 200,000 exposure hours, and our TRCFR was 
better than 2012 at 0.26 per 200,000 exposure hours
 
Won accolades, from best employer awards in Canada 
to the top spot for People Development at Oil and Gas 
UK annual awards. We were also recognised as one 
of the UK’ s top 20 ‘most in-demand’ employers 
by LinkedIn
 
Revamped, simplified and streamlined our global 
policies and mandatory procedures, in support of our 
Code of Business Conduct. Almost 21,000 of AMEC 
employees undertook anti-bribery and corruption 
training in 2013
 
Launched our employer brand, Why AMEC. 
Consultations with employees around the globe 
established that people joined and stayed with AMEC 
for three main reasons: opportunity , excellence and 
belonging. These concepts have now been incorporated 
into internal and external communications and 
feedback has been very positive
 
Developed and refined our approach to diversity and 
inclusion in the workplace, recognising that our goal 
is diversity of thought. Gender is just one part of this. 
Women now make up 26 per cent of our directly 
employed employee base, equivalent to 6,071 people; 
15 per cent of our management/professional grades 
(1,039 people); 13 per cent of our executives (42 people); 
30 per cent of our group management team (three 
people); and 13 per cent of our board (one person).

Our people continued
Managing the challenges
The principal risks and uncertainties related to our people are:
Staff recruitment and retention
An inability to attract and retain sufficient high-calibre 
employees could become a barrier to the continued 
success and growth of AMEC.
This is mitigated with a clear human resources (HR) 
strategy , which is aligned to the business strategy and 
focused on attracting, developing and retaining the best 
people for AMEC. It is underpinned by an employee 
framework which describes how we manage our 
people consistently.
In addition, there is a continual review of compensation 
and benefits to ensure sector and geographic 
competitiveness and there are localised recruitment 
teams capable of recruiting large numbers into AMEC 
using common systems.
AMEC Academy delivers development activities to enhance 
delivery and prepare employees for more advanced roles.
Pensions
AMEC operates a number of defined benefits pension 
schemes, where careful judgement is required in 
determining the assumptions for future salary and pension 
increases, discount rate, inflation and member longevity . 
There is a risk of underestimating this liability .
This risk to AMEC’ s pension schemes is mitigated by:
 
maintaining a relatively strong funding position over time 
 
taking advice from independent qualified actuaries and 
other professional advisers
 
agreeing appropriate investment policies with 
the trustees 
 
close monitoring of changes in the funding position, 
with reparatory action agreed with the trustees in the 
event that a sustained deficit emerges
 
closure of key UK defined benefits pension schemes 
to new entrants.
Health, safety and security
AMEC is involved in activities and environments that 
have the potential to cause serious injury to personnel 
or damage to property or the environment and damage 
to our reputation.
In order to control risk and prevent harm, AMEC is focused 
on achieving the highest standards of health, safety and 
security management. This is achieved through setting 
of an effective policy and putting in place clear standards 
which underpin our health, safety , security and 
environmental management systems.
We put in place processes to assure that our systems work 
effectively throughout the organisation.
Health and safety performance is regularly reviewed 
against agreed targets to facilitate continual improvement. 17 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013
Governance Financials Overview Strategic report
Measuring success
There are a wide range of KPIs we track in this area, 
reflecting the critical importance of our employees 
to our success. 
In addition to the safety and employee growth KPIs plotted 
below , we also regularly monitor how engaged our employees 
are. In 2013 we undertook a series of statistically valid ‘pulse’ 
surveys, each asking around 2,000 employees a few simple 
questions which are indicative of engagement. Response 
levels were high and engagement scores were at or above 
70 per cent throughout the year .
Further detail on these and the other KPIs we use can be 
found in our 2013 sustainability report.
Priorities for 2014
Our people are our most important asset.
The recruitment, development and retention of our people 
remains critical to our success. 
In 2014 we will – once again – be focused on supporting 
our growth with new hires. Many parts of our business 
continue to grow. For instance, we are looking to expand 
our UK-based nuclear engineering team to allow us to 
capitalise on the opportunities in existing reactor 
maintenance and new build. 
We will seek to embed our new commitment to diversity 
and inclusion deep into the organisation. 
We are planning an executive development programme 
to complement the existing junior and senior management 
programmes currently offered through AMEC Academy .
W e are reviewing our succession planning process to ensure 
we develop and retain the right people. We already have a 
high degree of success in filling positions using succession 
plans, but we would like to make this even better . 
The safety and security of our people is essential to 
our business and we will focus on four key areas of 
performance improvement:
 
Leadership roles and responsibilities, benchmarking 
ourselves against others and introducing a peer 
feedback process
 
Establishing a ‘good practice’ guideline for HSSE 
assurance
 
Using the information generated by our incident 
management systems to drive more preventative 
action and share learning globally
 
Fully implementing our Inherently Safe Design process 
across the organisation. 
Further detail on each of these items is contained in our 
sustainability report.
Assuming the acquisition of Foster Wheeler proceeds 
as planned, we will need to plan and implement the 
integration of their employees into AMEC. We see this as 
vital to achieving the full advantage from the combination

Our customers
We have a wide range of customers 
and work for some of the world’ s 
largest corporations and government 
bodies, designing and maintaining 
critical assets. Our customers 
expect us deliver excellence every 
day . We are very proud of our 
reputation – and the high proportion 
of repeat business we generate.
We work very hard to develop long-term and worldwide 
relationships with our customers. 
The strength and longevity of our relationships also 
reflects our shared values – including integrity and 
never compromising on safety .
We start each project with a new customer with 
the expectation that we can develop it into a 
long-term relationship.
We know that if we do good work for a customer , 
we will win more good work.
What this means for 
our strategy
We have a wide range of customers around the world 
– including large IOCs, utilities, industrial companies and 
government bodies. Our diversified customer base limits 
our dependence on any one customer .
We win business because of our reputation and our long 
term relationships. We want our customers to recognise 
our engineering, project management and consultancy 
expertise and to trust us to deliver their projects 
successfully . Such a reputation does not come 
overnight, but is a key cornerstone of future growth.
Our history demonstrates the importance of the long-term 
relationships we have built with many of our customers. 
Only by understanding their business, their objectives and 
their values can we identify how best to use our expertise 
to help them deliver .

Managing the challenges
The principal risks and uncertainties related to our customers are:
Geopolitical and economic conditions
AMEC operates predominately in the UK and North 
America and is therefore particularly affected by political 
and economic conditions in those markets.
Changes in general economic conditions may influence 
customers’ decisions on capital investment and/or asset 
maintenance, which could lead to volatility in the 
development of AMEC’s order intake. These may also lead 
to change in the customer base, competition and in the 
way customers procure the services we provide.
In the mining and oil & gas markets in particular , pressure 
on capital expenditure is leading to a greater focus on 
smaller projects and portfolios, potentially restricting the 
opportunities for growth.
AMEC seeks to maintain a balanced geographic presence 
and, through acquisitions and organic growth, will continue 
to increase its exposure to other attractive regions of 
the world.
The risk associated with economic conditions resulting  
in a downturn and affecting the demand for AMEC’ s 
services has been addressed, as far as practicable, 
by seeking to maintain a balanced business portfolio 
in terms of geographies, markets, clients and service 
offering/business model.
In light of continuing global economic uncertainties, AMEC 
will additionally seek opportunities in new markets and 
territories with a particular focus on mid-stream business 
and broaden the offering to clients to selectively include 
more lump sum work.

project delivery (page 23), health, safety and security (page 16) and staff recruitment and retention (page 16)
Measuring success
Our diversified customer base is a major indicator of 
our success. We also keep track of new customer wins, 
customer satisfaction and ‘win-to-bid’ ratios.
New customers added in 2013 included Vale, Sempra 
US Gas & Power and Horizon Nuclear Power while BP , 
GDF SUEz, KOC and WWU were among those existing 
customers providing new contracts.
Priorities for 2014
In 2014 we will stay focused on our customers and how 
their requirements are changing. We will continue to 
enhance the AMEC Way and to improve the customer 
experience of working with AMEC.
W e will also continue to expand the services we offer existing 
customers and look for new customers in our chosen 
markets. The acquisition of Foster Wheeler would 
accelerate implementation of these priorities.

Our expertise
In each market or sector , the 
range of services provided to 
our customers is similar . We are 
experts in designing, delivering and 
maintaining strategic and complex 
assets, offering total life of asset 
support from feasibility planning 
right through to decommissioning.
In 2013 we have been focused on maximising growth 
opportunities, by ensuring the widest range of AMEC 
services is provided in each of our three geographies, 
and for each of our four markets.
The AMEC Way is a very simple concept. It is 
fundamentally about improving the way we deliver 
projects to customers, using best practices. It is not 
‘one size fits all’ – it is flexible and scalable so can be 
adapted to local markets. Collaboration between our 
people is a key differentiator in a competitive market 
place and we need to provide our customers with the 
best we have to offer .
What this means for 
our strategy
We provide high value services – consulting, 
engineering, project and construction management 
and supply chain management across the life cycle 
of our customers’ assets.
We have a particularly strong reputation for delivering 
engineering solutions for complex projects and operating 
in remote and harsh locations.
Our customers ’ capital expenditure plans can be cyclical. 
Our diversified model protects us from this. We work in 
four end markets, on a variety of energy and commodity 
projects, around the world, and through the asset life cycle, 
including operational support and maintenance. 
Our core services include:
Consulting
Business consulting: provided to the oil, gas and mining 
industries, helping support our customers in achieving 
maximum value from their assets.
Commercial: provided by commercial consulting and cost 
management subsidiaries Rider Hunt International and 
Aquenta Consulting.

systems, procedures and specifications for the management 
and control of engineering, procurement, construction and 
commissioning of process and industrial facilities worldwide. 
The AMEC Way defines a common approach to executing 
projects within AMEC. It combines an assurance framework 
for project delivery with access to a comprehensive 
reference framework of guidance, tools such as Convero 
(our integrated project management system) and best 
practice examples. T ogether these processes provide a 
standard approach to complete, successful delivery of 
projects to our customers.
PMC and PEMS work for KNPC
Following on from the award of the project management 
consulting (PMC) work on the new refinery at Al zour in

Information technology (IT)
AMEC is exposed to the risks that the IT systems on  
which it relies fail and/or that sensitive data held by 
the group is lost.
AMEC has appropriate controls in place in order to mitigate 
the risk of systems failure and data loss, including systems 
back-up procedures and disaster recovery plans and also 
has appropriate malware protection, network security 
controls and encryption of mobile devices.
Following a recent comprehensive review of data 
governance and security , an information governance 
committee has been established to ensure consistent 
policies and practices in relation to the storage, movement, 
retention and destruction of data.
Project delivery
Failing to maintain discipline and meet customer 
expectations on project delivery could result in damage 
to reputation, loss of repeat business and potentially  
lead to litigation and/or claims against AMEC.  
AMEC operates a system of globally applied policies and 
procedures.
These, combined with comprehensive management 
oversight, the risk management process, project reviews, 
internal audit, peer reviews and customer feedback, 
mitigate the risk to successful project delivery .

Managing the challenges
The principal risks and uncertainties related to our expertise are:
Priorities for 2014
We provide a wide range of high value services to our 
customers. Our ability to act as One AMEC and to deliver 
excellence every time are key differentiators in a 
competitive marketplace. 
We will continue to focus on combining the skills of our 
people to offer even better support to our customers.
In 2014 we will also continue to look for opportunities 
to expand our capabilities and to extend our addressable 
market, such as through the proposed acquisition of 
Foster Wheeler.
Measuring success
Our revenue growth and profitability are major indicators 
of our success. We also seek to maintain a mix of ‘capex’ 
(related to our customers’ capital expenditure 
programmes) and ‘opex’ related activities.

  2011 is as reported. 2012 has been restated as shown on page 1 24 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013
How we work
We have a low-risk contracting 
model: we sell our people’ s time 
and expertise, usually on a ‘cost-
plus ’ basis. By using common 
systems we can deliver work 
consistently and share work 
across offices. As a result, our 
business is more sustainable, 
and our financial performance 
less volatile than others.
In 2013 we have again focused on working together as 
‘One AMEC’ – ensuring customers get the best AMEC 
has to offer every time and increasingly collaborating 
between teams, offices and countries. For instance, our 
work for Vale at Voisey Bay involves mining, power and 
E&I services, and our work for Eskom in South Africa 
covers nuclear , renewable, transmission and 
distribution and mining skills. 
What this means for 
our strategy
We have deliberately adopted a low-risk approach to 
the way in which we do business, which improves the 
predictability of our results. 
The majority of our contracts are ‘cost-plus’, where we are 
paid our costs plus an agreed profit margin. Many of our 
contracts also include additional performance payments 
to align our objectives with our customers. We do take on 
lump sum, or fixed price, contracts where we know the 
customer and the project well. 
We may partner with EPC contractors to gain access 
to projects which would otherwise be unavailable to us. 
For example, in 2012 we created a joint venture with 
Samsung Heavy Industries and Samsung Engineering. 
Under the terms of this arrangement, we will carry 
out detailed engineering for fixed and floating offshore 
platforms, FPSOs and subsea pipelines for their offshore 
oil & gas projects. 
By using common systems we can deliver work 
consistently and share work across offices. 
AMEC is a cash generative business. Our priority is 
to create value by investing for growth. If no suitable 
opportunities are available, we will return surplus cash 
to shareholders.
2013 achievements included: 
 
We believe that by collaborating, improving and growing, 
we will ensure we are achieving our goals. This is at 
the core of our 2015 and beyond strategy and these 
concepts have been communicated and promoted 
throughout the year , including in our annual employee 
magazine, On reflection, available on our website
 
We are increasingly collaborating to provide integrated 
services to our customers. For example, 34 per cent 
of the E&I services provided in the Americas in 2013 
were to non-E&I markets – oil & gas, mining and 
clean energy

Following the organisational restructuring in late 2012, 
in 2013 a new shared services centre (SSC) was created 
in Manila, the Philippines. As well as consolidating 
Growth Regions HR and finance activities in one location, 
the SSC will increasingly provide global support activities. 
The SSC will save cost and more importantly , by 
undertaking the routine tasks, will allow client-facing 
offices to focus on delivery
 
Our High Value Delivery Centres (HVDCs) in Shanghai, 
China; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Santiago, Chile are 
increasingly acting as hubs, working collaboratively with 
offices elsewhere in the world to serve our customers. 
They provide the same competencies, the same level 
of delivery and quality , use the same tools and have 
the same culture. In 2013 the Aberdeen office delivered 
an FPSO (floating, production, storage and offloading) 
vessel conversion, executing around 100,000 hours of

 
In 2012 we created joint ventures with Samsung 
(as mentioned previously) and with Aibel to deliver 
projects for the oil & gas industry in the Norwegian 
Continental Shelf. Despite good bidding activity , 
neither has yet resulted in additional work

In April 2013, Global Renewables Lancashire 
Operations Ltd, in which AMEC is a 50 per cent 
shareholder , was fined £150,000 as a result of five 
breaches of environmental permitting regulations which 
resulted in odour pollution
 
In June 2013, Sellafield Limited was fined £700,000 
after incorrectly disposing of low-level radioactive waste. 
Although this was not under AMEC’s management 
control or responsibility , we are a part of the NMP joint 
venture which is the parent body organisation for the 
site at Sellafield.
Our approach to sustainable business
Our growth aspirations will only be achieved by focusing 
on our customers and how we deliver to them safely 
and sustainably . 
We believe sustainable business is the balance of 
economic, environmental and social responsibilities, 
meeting the requirements of our stak eholders, 
consistently , in line with living our values. Our 
sustainability strategy is described using three 
interwoven elements – living our values, excellent 
project delivery and sustainable growth.
Our customers face increasing legislative and other 
pressures to operate in a sustainable way and we at 
AMEC are in an ideal place to support them, working 
with our partners and supply chain. They are looking 
for sustainability solutions: minimising resource use 
(water , materials, energy), considering long-term social 
requirements on our projects (utilising local workforce 
and suppliers, supporting the local communities in 
which we work) and ensuring the delivery of safe 
projects (inherent within the design, on site during 
delivery and onwards during the operation). 
In each of these areas, we utilise our internal 
programmes and tools, along with AMEC’s 
technical and scientific expertise, to ensure 
excellent customer delivery . 
We want to ensure that sustainability is integrated into 
the very core of our business and within our decision 
making processes. Our approach and our recent 
achievements are described throughout this strategic 
report as they form a key element of our business 
model. Further details can be found in the 2013 
sustainability report, to be issued in April 2014.  m See also risks for: IT (page 23), health, safety

 m For further information please refer to AMEC’s 
2013 sustainability report
The 12-month period to 31 October , rather than the calendar year , 
has been used. This ensures actual data can be used, even for 
those regions where energy/fuel usage is more difficult to access. 
By reducing reliance on estimation, a more accurate footprint can 
be provided in a timely manner .
In our figures, we use accepted methods of calculation based on 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition). We first adopted our 
operational control approach in 2001. 
We have previously provided estimated calendar year figures for CO
2
 
emissions, using Defra emission conversion factors. As more than 
70 per cent of our revenue is generated outside of the UK we have 
switched to using national conversion factor guidelines (eg EPA, 
Environment Canada) where appropriate. As a result, carbon data 
previously reported is no longer directly comparable. 
How we work continued
Managing the challenges
The principal risks and uncertainties related to how we work are:
Mergers and acquisitions
A failure to execute, complete and successfully integrate 
targeted, value-enhancing acquisitions represents a risk 
to growth.
Our strategic plan (previously Vision 2015, now 2015 and 
beyond) includes a structured internal review of identified 
target acquisitions, followed by an established and robust 
due diligence and integration planning process.
Legacy risk
Litigation and business claims from divested and non-core 
businesses, such as Global Renewables, remain a risk 
to AMEC.
Managing non-core legacy assets until divestment 
may require skills that are not common to the rest 
of the company.
The established Investment Services team manages these 
claims with internal and external legal advice. The aim is to 
seek cost-effective management of litigation and promote 
commercially sensible settlements where appropriate.
AMEC has made provisions for the legacy issues that 
are believed to be adequate and is not aware of any other 
current issues relating to disposed businesses which are 
likely to have a material impact. Specialist teams with the 
appropriate knowledge are brought in as required.
Ethical breach
A substantive ethical breach and/or non-compliance 
with laws or regulations could potentially lead to 
damage to AMEC’s reputation, fines, litigation and 
claims for compensation.
AMEC has a number of measures in place across the group 
to mitigate this risk, including: embedded policies and 
procedures; Code of Business Conduct; segregation of 
duties; management oversight; financial and operational 
controls; independent third-party reporting system for 
raising concerns; appointment of ethics officers; anti-fraud 
and other internal audits; legal team advice; ethics training 
programme; and oversight by the ethics committee of 
the board. 27 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013

Measuring success
This is a wide-ranging topic and the key performance 
indicators we use to track our progress reflect this.
 
A key financial KPI is our cash conversion, which was 
particularly strong in 2013. We target over 90 per cent 
conversion of operating profit into cash
 
Our reputation depends on us delivering projects 
successfully for our customers. One of the non-financial 
KPIs we use is whether our project and peer reviews are 
being implemented in line with our plans. We met our 
targets for this KPI in 2013
 
We have tracked our carbon emissions since 2008, 
when we set a target of reducing emissions per 
employee by 15 per cent by 2013. Since that time we 
have significantly increased awareness and improved 
reporting. The group itself has also changed. Despite 
substantial progress in many areas, we have not 
achieved our target. See the 2013 sustainability report 
for more detail.
Priorities for 2014
In 2014 we will focus on growing our revenue without 
significantly changing our low-risk business model. We 
will continue to develop long-term customer relationships.
We are also targeting to increase the amount of workshare 
and collaboration between teams and offices. This ensures 
customers get the best AMEC has to offer , every time.
One of the attractions of the proposed combination 
of Foster Wheeler with AMEC is that both companies 
have a similar approach to how they work. Approximately 
69 per cent of Foster Wheeler’ s Quarter 3 2013 order 
book came from cost-plus or similar contracts. They 
have a strong reputation for delivery and they are also 
cash generative.

Our markets
We provide similar services 
in each of our four markets – 
oil & gas, mining, clean energy , 
and environment & infrastructure 
– winning work through strong 
customer relationships and 
our proven ability to deliver 
successfully , even in harsh or 
remote environments. Many of 
the skills we provide our customers 
are transferable across markets.
Each of our end markets is expected to grow in the long 
term. AMEC is carefully positioned across sectors so as 
to benefit whatever the relative weighting in the energy 
mix. Our markets are also all cyclical – their diversity 
means we are not dependent on any one part of the 
energy mix. 
The services we provide (see pages 20 to 23) run 
across the life cycle of our customers’ assets, from 
consulting, engineering and construction management 
to project management, operations and maintenance 
and decommissioning. 
Growth will inevitably put further pressure on the 
availability of suitably qualified engineers, consultants 
and project managers. Our people strategy is a core 
enabler of our growth aspirations. 
What this means for our 
strategy
We have purposefully and deliberately positioned AMEC 
across these four markets and believe this diversified 
approach minimises risk and maximises opportunity 
over the long term. 
We look for strategic opportunities to enhance our position 
in our chosen markets. For example, if our acquisition of 
Foster Wheeler goes ahead, it would complement our 
existing upstream oil and gas position by adding mid and 
downstream activities. It would also increase our exposure 
to gas markets.
Competitive environment
There is no one competitor operating in all the same 
markets, with the same geographic footprint and with 
a similar approach to risk as AMEC.
Further details on the competitive landscape by market 
can be found in our introductory investor presentation 
on amec.com.
Global market trends
ExxonMobil ’s report, ‘2013 The Outlook for Energy: 
A View to 2040’, identifies population growth and increasing 
urbanisation as key factors for increased energy demand. 
It sees a 35 per cent growth from 2010 to 2040, even 
with significant efficiency gains and expects the world’ s 
population to grow by more than 25 per cent between 
2010 and 2040, to nearly nine billion people. BP (Energy 
Outlook 2030) suggests world income in 2030 will be 
double that of 2011 in real terms. 
The International Ener gy Agency (IEA) W orld Ener gy Outlook 
2013 sees the gr owth in primary ener gy demand coming fr om 
non-OECD countries, with China, India and the Middle East 
accounting for 60 per cent of the increase, and emerging 
economies 90 per cent of the growth. OECD countries are 
expected to see a shift away from oil and coal, towards 
natural gas and renewables. The IEA is for ecasting world oil 
demand to gr ow fr om 87 million barr els a day , to 101 million 
barr els in 2035. 
T echnology is facilitating the development of resources 
such as tight oil and shale gas, which are expected to 
allow the US to meet all its energy needs from domestic 
resources by 2035. At the same time, developing new 
sources of energy is becoming more complex, with 
resources often in harsh or remote regions.

Governance Financials Overview Strategic report
IEA believes a global investment in energy supply 
infrastructure of $37 trillion is required between 2012 and 
2035, with a disproportionately high share taken by OECD 
countries because of higher unit costs for capacity additions 
and the need to replace ageing infrastructure. Oil and gas 
collectively account for almost $19 trillion of the total 
investment, with most of the balance being power .
A more detailed analysis is shown in each market section 
on the following pages.
AMEC’ s markets
 
Oil & Gas
Growth is driven by the long-term rise in energy demand. 
Resources are becoming increasingly difficult to access 
with a shift towards more frontier and deepwater 
developments. This plays to AMEC’s expertise in 
complex and harsh locations.
The market
The IEA estimates oil supply in 2012 was 89.2 million 
barrels per day (mb/d). Since 2000 more than two-thirds 
of supply growth has come from unconventional oil, 
such as light-tight oil, oil sands and ultra-deepwater 
and natural gas liquids. During 2013 China has overtaken 
the US as the world’s largest net oil importer .
Oil demand is forecast to increase to 101 mb/d by 2035. 
This is driven by the transport sector in China, India and 
Middle East and occurs despite the dampening effect of 
efficiency measures, environmental policies and relatively 
high prices in OECD countries. Over the period to 2040, 
ExxonMobil expects natural gas to overtake coal as the 
number two global fuel, behind oil. 
Brent crude oil price has averaged $110 for the past three 
years (in real terms). Gas prices have, however , continued 
to exhibit significant regional differences, with US prices 
averaging one-thir d of those in Eur ope, and one-fifth in Japan.
A change from today’s production mix is also expected, 
with crude oil falling and a greater share being taken by 
natural gas liquids and unconventional sources. The rise 
being driven by light-tight oil, Canadian oil sands, natural 
gas liquids and increased deepwater production in Brazil. 
The IEA estimates that meeting the world’ s energy needs 
will require spending approximately $1.6 trillion per year on 
average, with about $700 billion being spent on oil and gas 
development, and the remainder on power generation. 
Morgan Stanley’ s latest global exploration and production 
spending analysis suggests that in the period between 
2012 and 2020, global upstream spending will grow at 
approximately 5.5 per cent per annum, with offshore 
spending growth of 8.2 per cent per annum.
In general, oil and gas resources are increasingly difficult 
to extract. Projects have become larger and more complex 
and environmental pressures have increased. As existing 
infrastructure ages and reserves are being depleted, more 
sophisticated performance and efficiency improvement 
solutions are required, particularly in brownfield operations.
In the UK, an interim report to the Secretary of State 
proposes a new regulator to help maximise economic 
recovery of the substantial remaining UK oil & gas resource.
Oil and gas producers want oil services companies, such 
as AMEC, to provide experts with proven experience in 
delivering projects on time, on budget, without harming 
people or the environment. 
Many international oil companies (IOCs) are renewing 
their focus on overall levels of capital expenditure, though 
national oil companies (NOCs) are largely unaffected. 
This may impact total market growth rates.
Assets are maturing, with declining reservoir production 
and ageing infrastructure, at the same time that the 
number of offshore facilities is increasing, to over 9,000 
globally . These factors are increasing the focus on the 
offshore maintenance, modifications and operations 
(MMO) market, which the Douglas Westwood MMO report 
2014 expects to be worth around $672 billion between 2014 
and 2018. Although the modifications market in particular 
is affected by changes in the oil price, such projects can 
represent a much better economic alternative than 
greenfield projects.

AMEC’ s position
AMEC offers a wide range of services to a broad range 
of customers, including IOCs, NOCs and independent 
operators in Europe, Americas, Middle East and Africa, 
the Caspian, South-east Asia and China. We do not operate 
in early cycle exploration or drilling, but are involved in 
every part of the project delivery phase. The majority of 
our activity is for offshore assets, where we support fixed 
platforms and floating production units, largely ‘above 
the water’. 
We also support onshore oil and gas fields, booster 
stations, gathering centres, tank farms, gas–oil separation 
plants and pipelines. We do more work on oil projects, 
and are relatively under-represented on gas projects. 
The vast majority of our oil & gas revenues comes from 
upstream projects.
AMEC has global experience of delivering large and complex 
greenfield projects, with capabilities in deepwater and 
hostile conditions. We have developed a strong position 
in frontier regions including the Caspian and have a good 
track record in proactively helping customers deal with 
environmental pressures. Recent examples include:
 
BP Clair Ridge: engineering and project management 
services (EPMS) and hook-up and commissioning for 
the main platform
 
MWCC: designing and delivering components of the 
modular equipment for the Marine Well Containment 
System (MWCS)
 
BP Shah Deniz: project and construction management 
services for the stage 2 development of the Shah Deniz 
gas field in the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan
 
GDF SUEz, Cygnus gas field: following FEED work, 
detailed design and hook-up and commissioning.
AMEC is also a leading international provider of asset 
support services. Recent activity includes:
 
Chevron, Wheatstone: Clough AMEC joint venture 
working on the operability , reliability and maintainability 
(ORM) component of this offshore facility
 
Fairfield Energy , Dunlin field: two new ‘life of field’ 
contracts covering general operating services and 
brownfield engineering and construction requirements.
We are a market leader in UK North Sea brownfield 
services and provide more integrated solutions to new 
entrant operators in the region. AMEC is increasingly 
providing more sophisticated solutions, for example, 
adapting existing facilities to cope with both mature 
reservoir conditions and new ‘tie-backs’ developments. 
Recent examples:
 
Unnamed customer: engineering design of topside 
modifications to an existing FPSO, together with 
procurement activities and project management services
 
ConocoPhillips: Jasmine; hook -up and commissioning 
services for the new topside facilities.
AMEC is a market leader in the provision of project 
management and engineering services to the upstream 
surface mining Canadian oil sands sector , with a history 
stretching back to the world’ s first oil sands plant in 1967. 
Historically our focus has been on mineable oil sands, 
though we also have in-situ expertise. This technology is 
increasingly being used and on larger projects. Recent oil 
sands projects include:
 
Imperial Oil: Kearl initial development and expansion 
phase.
We also work on shale gas and coal bed methane projects, 
providing services such as environmental impact 
assessments and water table management. 
AMEC is aware of the environmental concerns raised 
by activities in many of these areas. The full range of our 
environmental and infrastructure services can be used 
to ensure that customers meet and, where possible, 
exceed local legislation, providing them with solutions 
to environmental challenges. For example:
 
Kuwait, Gulf War remediation: PMC contract to 
remediate/dispose of highly contaminated material 
arising from the first Gulf War , with the project managed 
by a long-standing AMEC customer , KOC.

found on our website, amec.com 
Mining 
General macro and commodity pricing uncertainty is 
affecting the near-term outlook for the mining industry , 
increasing volatility . Long-term fundamentals remain 
robust, supported by increasing urbanisation in 
emerging markets. 
The market 
An additional 2 billion people in emerging markets 
are expected to become urbanised in the period to 2035, 
a key underlying driver of long-term growth in this 
industry . Short-term views are more cautious, with lower 
commodity prices and general economic uncertainty 
causing some softening of exploration spending and the 
postponement or cancellation of more marginal projects. 
At the same time, investors in major mining companies 
are looking for greater cash returns.

2013 mining revenue by commodity type
Supply issues are at the forefront as fewer easy-to-produce 
resources are leading to more challenging, complex and 
expensive developments, in more remote and riskier 
locations. Increasingly new mining projects are underground 
rather than surface mines and more logistical 
infrastructure and environmental controls are required.
This has led to a number of major mining companies 
announcing delays to projects and cost reduction 
programmes. Citi Research wrote in September 2013 that 
it expects large miners to make significant cuts to capital 
expenditure compared to current levels of spend. In 2014 it 
expects approximately $40 billion, compared to $46 billion 
in 2013. 
As in oil & gas, mine developers are looking for suppliers, 
such as AMEC, with proven ability in project delivery . 
AMEC’ s position 
AMEC has long sought to mitigate the impact of economic 
volatility by positioning itself to support a diverse range 
of commodities and service markets. As well as potash, 
iron ore, copper and gold, our customers are producing 
commodities such as uranium, lead, zinc, nickel and 
diamonds. We offer mining consultancy (including ore 
resource estimation, mine planning and feasibility studies), 
design, project and construction management services 
and believe the provision of consulting and environmental 
services provides a distinct competitive advantage. 
 
 
 
 
Majors: market capitalisation over US$40 billion; mid-tier: 
US$5–$40 billion
The business is a recognised leader in environments 
where projects have significant logistical challenges 
associated with remote location and difficult access. 
AMEC occupies a top-tier position in international 
consulting and a leading position in the North and South 
American engineering, procurement and construction 
management (EPCM) markets, where we have provided 
services for many of the world’ s leading mining companies. 
In addition to our established position in Australia, we are 
growing our African business.
Recent projects include:

Clean Energy 
Clean energy provides an increasingly significant part 
of the global energy mix, its growth driven by increasing 
demand for power and environmental concerns. AMEC’ s 
proven expertise, depth of technology understanding 
and strong customer relationships provide further 
growth opportunities. 
The market 
The role of nuclear power varies from country to country . 
Some countries, such as Germany , are looking to 
decommission their nuclear capacity , while others, 
such as the UK and China, are committed to new build 
programmes. Overall, the IEA forecasts nuclear will be 
used to generate around 12 per cent of electricity in 2035, 
in line with today .
The UK currently has 16 nuclear reactors generating 
10 GWe, around one-sixth of the UK’s electricity 
requirements. During 2013 the UK government and EDF 
announced they had reached an agreement in principle on 
the key commercial terms for a new 3.2MW nuclear plant 
at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Horizon and NuGen are also 
developing plans to build new nuclear plants in the UK.

Clean Energy continued
The market continued
Many of the world’ s nuclear facilities will be reaching 
the end of their permissioned life over the next 20 years. 
Life extensions and reactor support will be necessary 
to maintain the 15 per cent of Canada’s electricity which 
comes from nuclear power , with 19 reactors mostly 
in Ontario. Likewise, around 75 per cent of France’s 
electricity comes from nuclear power , with 58 reactors 
across the country .
The clean-up and management of the nuclear legacy is 
one of the most demanding challenges facing the industry . 
The World Nuclear Association estimates that more than 
250 reactors will close by 2030 worldwide.
ExxonMobil forecasts renewable energy supplies — 
including traditional biomass, hydro and geothermal as 
well as wind, solar and biofuels – to contribute 14 per cent 
of the energy mix by 2040, up from 3 per cent in 2010. 
Growth in renewables will be driven by climate change 
and environmental policies, energy security concerns 
and by price and cost developments. 
BP forecasts that energy consumption grows less rapidly 
than the global economy , with GDP growth averaging 
3.5 per cent per annum between 2012 and 2035, with the 
decline in energy intensity accelerating post 2020.
Both BP and IEA predict that fossil fuels’ share of the 
energy mix will fall by circa 5 percentage points by 2035 
as renewables continue to replace oil and coal in the mix. 
 
AMEC’ s position 
Our nuclear capability has been developed over 60 years, 
positioning us to support the full life cycle of nuclear 
energy , from new build and reactor support (including 
lifetime extension), to nuclear decommissioning and 
waste management. We have experience of all types 
of nuclear technology . We work with our customers in 
long-term relationships based on partnering and have 
significant experience in effectively managing complex 
stakeholder relationships. 
Our customers include major utilities, governments, 
national regulators, reactor suppliers and other significant 
stakeholders. We have a particularly strong presence in 
the UK and Canada, a growing business in the US and 
a good presence in Central and Eastern Europe and 
South Africa. In 2013 we expanded our position in the 
US with the acquisition of Automated Engineering Services 
(AES), a 175-person professional design engineering 
nuclear services firm based in Naperville, Illinois.
In renewables, our focus is on wind, solar , biomass and 
biofuels projects. Our customers include power utilities, 
financial institutions, government agencies, technology 
developers, original equipment manufacturers and 
specialist consultants. They appreciate the flexibility our 
technology neutrality brings, our focus and our ability 
to provide a full service engineering, procurement and 
construction (EPC) solution.
In power , the majority of services are performed for 
major energy providers, governments, developers and 
independent power producers, primarily in the Americas. 
Our major customers in transmission and distribution 
are system owners with which we have had long-standing 
relationships. We have an existing position in the UK and 
a growing presence in Canada.
Recent clean energy activities include:
 
Sellafield Limited, UK: various projects including a 
multi-discipline site works framework agreement
 

Environment & Infrastructure (E&I) 
The overall environmental consulting and engineering 
market includes services provided to all four of AMEC’s 
markets, with the skills highly transferable across 
customers. Our E&I market alone consists of four sectors: 
water , transportation/infrastructure, government services, 
and industrial/commercial. 
The market 
The global environmental consultancy market is estimated 
at £34 billion (Engineering News Record), with design and 
construction-specific revenue on top of this. The market 
has historically been both large and diverse though there 
has been recent consolidation as large private sector 
clients are increasingly looking for seamless global 
project delivery. 
A compound annual growth rate of 3.5 per cent is expected 
over the next five years, with services related to climate 
change, energy and contaminated land/remediation expected 
to grow particularly strongly (Environmental Analyst).
Many believe that water scarcity and environmental 
concerns provide additional opportunities for growth. 
Growing water constraints are set to impose additional 
costs on the energy sector and in some cases threaten 
the viability of projects. The IEA suggests that the volume 
of water consumed to produce energy will increase by 
85 per cent from 2010 to 2035. This is more than twice 
the rate of growth of energy demand, driven by more 
water-intensive power generation and expanding output 
of water-thirsty biofuels.
AMEC’ s position 
We work predominately in the US, Canada and the UK, 
with an emerging presence in the Middle East, Africa 
and Australasia. 
AMEC provides a multi-disciplinary approach to water 
projects at all stages of planning, study , design and 
construction, seeking to provide sustainable and 
environmentally sound solutions for our public and private 
sector customers. Our primary areas of focus are water 
resource management, water policy , coastal management, 
asset planning and management, and wastewater 
collection and treatment.
Water services are also commonly provided to customers 
in AMEC’s other markets, including mining and oil & gas. 
In transportation/infrastructure, AMEC has provided 
programme management, planning and design, project 
and construction management, asset development and 
long-term asset support to government transportation 
agencies, national and local customers and private 
developers in Canada and the US for over 50 years. 
A broad range of government services is provided, 
including to the US Federal Government, which is the 
largest procurer of environmental services in the world. 
Customers also include the various branches of the 
military and state/provincial agencies. Services range 
from remediation programmes to design and delivery 
of infrastructure facilities, including airfield facilities, 
housing and site improvements at installations globally . 
In industrial/commercial, compliance and due diligence 
services are provided, ranging from geotechnical and 
environmental to materials and water resources consulting.
AMEC’ s knowledge of regulatory environments is used 
to apply a risk-based approach to environmental liability 
assessment and management. 
Recent projects include:
 
Northumbrian Water , UK: framework agreement 
for the provision of technical, commercial and 
environmental services
 
US Army Corps of Engineers, Qatar: design and 
construction of facilities and warehousing, including

 
Kahramaa, Qatar: supporting the local utility to use 
aquifer storage and recovery technology to improve 
water supply security .
What didn’t go to plan in 2013
 
AMEC’ s markets are each cyclical to varying degrees. 
Weakness continued in the mining market in particular , 
with revenues 28 per cent lower . Activity levels also 
dropped in the Canadian oil sands though AMEC 
continues to work on the largest single project in recent 
years, the Kearl project for Imperial Oil 
 

on UK nuclear new build, with significant government 
endorsement, the speed of implementation is yet to pick 
up significantly .  Our markets continued

Managing the challenges
The principal risks and uncertainties related to our markets are:
Measuring success
Our order book and our order intake are significant 
indicators of our continued success across our markets. 
In addition, we also assess our overall exposure to each 
market, including the mix of services we offer – such as 
maintaining a mix of ‘capex’ and ‘opex’, new build and 
decommissioning.

Priorities for 2014
We work across four markets. Each has been chosen 
because of its long-term growth potential and the need 
for high-quality engineering and project management 
services. We believe that this combination provides AMEC 
with attractive opportunities, and protects us from the 
volatility – such as in mining over the past 12 months – 
that each market occasionally displays.
In addition, we are focused on developing a more flexible 
way of working, for instance through workshare between 
offices, so that our employees can use their skills across 
each of our end markets. This will continue to be a focus 
for 2014.
Combining Foster Wheeler and AMEC is expected 
to enhance our capability in the oil & gas market, by 
increasing our exposure to the mid and downstream 
value chain. It will also help us to address our current 
under-representation in gas projects. 
Changes in commodity prices
A sustained and significant reduction in oil and gas or 
commodity prices could have an adverse impact on the 
level of customer spending in AMEC’s markets and 
consequently represents a risk to organic growth.
The outlook for economic growth in China continues to 
have an impact on minerals and metals commodity prices, 
limiting project opportunities.
This risk is mitigated by maintaining a balanced

Governance Financials Overview Strategic report
Our global reach
We manage the business in three 
geographic units: Americas, 
Europe and Growth Regions. This 
structure is designed to promote 
collaboration between AMEC’ s 
people – so that our customers 
benefit from the best we can offer 
every day . We believe this enhances 
our growth opportunities.
Increasing collaboration, breaking silos, integrating 
acquisitions and working as one team will make 
us much stronger than we already are. Improving 
efficiency and productivity will build resilience and 
help us to stay ahead of our competitors and deliver 
excellence to our customers.
Our group presidents of each business unit are 
incentivised to work collaboratively , with a proportion 
of their bonus dependent on this measure.
Our proposed acquisition of Foster Wheeler is expected 
to significantly add to the scale of our Growth Regions 
– more than doubling our revenue in that area.
We manage legacy and non-core activities through 
Investment Services.
What this means for 
our strategy
As well as building our presence in our established 
geographies of the UK and North America, we are looking 
to expand in the Middle East, Australasia and South America. 
We need to not only build on our existing market positions 
but also to enhance our capabilities and expand our 
geographic coverage. We see this expansion as coming 
from a combination of acquisition and organic growth. 
In addition, some of our customers are increasingly looking 
for us to take responsibility for a wider range of services 
and capabilities, for example integrating power and water 
services into a mining project. We need to be organised to 
respond to this effectively .
Our organisation structure is designed to promote 
collaboration between markets and geographies, to 
deliver enhanced growth and incentivise our people 
to collaborate and sell ‘One AMEC’.

Managing the challenges
The principal risks and uncertainties related to our global reach are:
Measuring success
Our Vision 2015 strategy measures success in terms of 
growth in earnings per share, from the base point in 2009. 
Other non-financial measures we track include:
 
Number of our employees who complete ethics 
training in the year . In 2013 almost 21,000 employees 
completed online or face-to-face anti-bribery and 
corruption training
 
The contribution we make to our local communities. 
In 2013 AMEC donated over £400,000, matching the 
fundraising activities of our staff.
Restructure to focus on expansion 
of global footprint
In 2012 AMEC restructured the business to focus on 
delivering growth generally and expanding the global 
footprint specifically into Growth Regions. A failure of 
this strategy could result in failure to meet targeted 
growth levels.
 
Closely defined roles and responsibilities have been 
identified across operations and functions with a formal 
review process initiated to monitor performance and 
ensure appropriate remedial actions are put in place 
without delay . 
AMEC’ s growth strategy (previously Vision 2015, now 2015 
and beyond) identified, by geography , the opportunities and 
risks across the markets in which AMEC operates. The 
strategy is regularly reviewed for continued relevance and 
covers both organic growth and mergers and acquisitions.
 m See also risks for: geopolitical and economic conditions (page 19), ethical breach (page 26) and mergers and acquisitions (page 26)
Priorities for 2014
In 2014 we will be looking to:
 
Continue our growth. We expect the rate of growth 
in underlying revenue, excluding incremental 
procurement, in 2014 to be good
 
Appoint a new group president, Growth Regions, 
with the experience and energy to develop this 
business unit to its maximum potential
 
Continue to promote collaboration across markets 
and geographies
 
Complete the proposed acquisition of Foster Wheeler 
and commence the integration programme.

Financial review
Dear shareholder
We delivered another solid set of results in 2013, with 
EPS
4
 up by 11 per cent despite the downturn in some 
of our markets. The full year cash conversion of nearly 
100 per cent was pleasing, particularly in light of the 
weaker first half performance. Our record order book 
positions us well for 2014.
There are a few areas where our 2012 results have been 
restated: 
 
The segmental analysis now reflects the geographic 
structure
 
The UK conventional power business has been 
reclassified as discontinued 
 
Pension accounting rules have changed, reducing 
financing income. 
As you will see elsewhere in this document, we expect 
the proposed acquisition of Foster Wheeler to be both 
strategically and financially attractive. It is expected to be 
double-digit earnings enhancing in the first 12 months 
after completion, though this will not be fully realised in 
2014. We do not now expect to report adjusted earnings 
per share of greater than 100 pence in the year . Instead 
we are firmly focused on creating sustainable value for 
shareholders for the long term, by combining the two 
companies, and expect ROIC* to exceed the cost of 
capital in the second 12-month period after completion.

Basis of preparation of the accounts
The 2013 annual report and accounts has been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the EU (adopted 
IFRS) as at 31 December 2013. The directors have 
identified the policies for accounting for long-term 
contracts, provisions for litigation matters and liabilities 
related to the sale of businesses and retirement benefits 
as the most critical because they involve high levels of 
judgement and estimation. 
Long-term contracts
A significant amount of the group’s activities is undertaken 
via long-term contracts. These contracts are accounted for 
in accordance with IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ which 
require estimates to be made for contract costs and 
revenues. Management bases its judgements of contract 
costs and revenues on the latest available information, 
which includes detailed contract valuations. In many cases 
the results reflect the expected outcome of long-term 
contractual obligations which span more than one 
reporting period. Contract costs and revenues are affected 
by a variety of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of 
future events and often need to be revised as events unfold 
and uncertainties are resolved. The estimates of contract 
costs and revenues are updated regularly and significant 
changes are highlighted through established internal 
review procedures. In particular , the internal reviews focus 
on the timing and recognition of incentive payments and 
the age and recoverability of any unagreed income from 
variations to the contract scope or claims. The impact of 
the changes in these accounting estimates is then 
reflected in the ongoing results.
Provisions for litigation matters and liabilities 
related to the sale of businesses
When accounting for provisions for litigation and other 
items, the group has taken internal and external advice 
in considering known legal claims and actions made by 
or against the group. It carefully assesses the likelihood 
of success of a claim or action. Appropriate provisions are 
made for legal claims or actions against the group on the 
basis of likely outcome, but no provisions are made for 
those which, in the view of management, are unlikely 
to succeed.
Retirement benefits
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for 
in accordance with the advice of independent qualified 
actuaries but significant judgements are required in 
relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension 
increases, discount rate, inflation, investment returns and 
member life expectancy that underpin their valuations. 
For AMEC, these assumptions are important given the 
relative size of the schemes that remain open.
The following commentary is based on the results for 
continuing operations before intangible amortisation 
and exceptional items but including joint venture EBIT A.
The results are presented to the nearest million. 
Percentage movements and calculated numbers, 
such as EPS and margin rates, are based on the 
underlying numbers to one decimal place precision.
The comparative figures for 2012 have been restated 
as a result of: 
 
the adoption of IAS 19(2011R) ‘Employee Benefits ’. 
The impact on the full year 2012 is a reduction in 
EBITA of £1 million, a reduction in net financing income 
of £12 million and a reduction in the tax charge of 
£5 million, resulting in a reduction of £8 million in profit 
after tax. See note 2 of the accounts for more details

Segmental analysis
Segmental analysis is provided for the group’ s activities 
in three business units (Americas, Europe and Growth 
Regions), as well as for non-core Investment Services. 
2012 figures have been restated on this same basis.
Amounts and percentage movements relating to continuing 
segmental earnings before net financing income, tax and 
intangible amortisation (EBITA) are stated before corporate 
costs of £35 million (2012: £33 million) and pre-tax 
exceptional costs of £25 million (2012: £24 million).

discontinued operations are disclosed separately in

Results
Revenue for the year was down 3 per cent to £3,974 million 
(2012: £4,088 million). Underlying revenue, excluding 
incremental procurement, increased by 2 per cent, driven 
by growth in oil & gas and renewables.
EBITA increased 3 per cent to £343 million 
(2012: £334 million) with margins at 8.6 per cent 
(2012: 8.2 per cent). 
Adjusted profit before tax of £332 million was 2 per cent 
ahead of the previous year (2012: £327 million). After joint 
venture tax of £5 million (2012: £5 million), amortisation 
of £47 million (2012: £44 million) and exceptional costs 
of £25 million (2012: £24 million), profit before tax was 
£255 million (2012: £254 million). The tax charge for 
the year , including tax on amortisation and exceptional 
items, was £69 million (2012: £47 million), resulting in 
a total profit for the year from continuing operations 
of £186 million (2012: £207 million). 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing 
operations were 87.2 pence (2012: 78.6 pence), an increase 
of 11 per cent, supported by the lower average number 
of shares in issue after the completion of the buyback at 
the beginning of 2013. Diluted earnings per share were 
62.5 pence (2012: 64.0 pence) reflecting the impact of the 
exceptional charges and increased amortisation.
Operating cash flow for the period was £341 million 
(2012: £312 million), up £29 million from the previous 
year , reflecting EBITA growth and the continued focus 
on working capital management. Cash conversion was 
strong at 99 per cent (2012: 93 per cent). 
Dividend
The board is recommending a final dividend of 28.5 pence 
per share, which, together with the interim dividend of 
13.5 pence, results in a total dividend of 42.0 pence per 
share (2012: 36.5 pence), an increase of 15 per cent. 
The board expects to maintain a progressive policy with 
dividend cover in the range of 2.0 to 2.5 times. The final 
dividend will be payable on 2 July 2014 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 30 May 2014.
Share buyback programme
The £400 million share buyback programme announced 
in February 2012 was completed on 8 February 2013. 
Within this programme, 4.2 million shares at a total cost 
of £45 million were purchased in 2013. 
Acquisitions 
On 15 November 2013 AMEC completed the acquisition 
of Automated Engineering Services (AES). AES is a 
175-person professional design engineering nuclear 
services firm based in Naperville, Illinois, US, with annual 
revenues in excess of US$30 million. This acquisition builds 
on AMEC’ s nuclear position in the US and is an important 
addition to the existing strong positions in the nuclear 
markets in Canada and Europe. 
AMEC announced a recommended firm offer for Foster 
Wheeler on 13 February 2014.
Outlook
The priority remains to grow the business by continuing 
to deliver for customers while investing in AMEC’ s people 
and, in 2014, completing the acquisition of Foster Wheeler . 
For AMEC’s existing operations in 2014, underlying revenue 
growth, excluding incremental procurement, is expected to 
be good, with ongoing strength in the conventional oil & gas 
and clean energy markets. However , the mix of business 
may result in a slight reduction in group margins. As in 
2013, profits and particularly cash flow generation will be 
more second-half weighted.
As stated previously , the forecast average exchange rates 
for 2014 are less favourable than 2013. Sterling has continued 
to strengthen relative to North American currencies and 
this currently translates into an impact of in excess of 
£10 million of EBITA, year-on-year . 
The acquisition of Foster Wheeler is expected to be 
double-digit earnings enhancing in the first 12 months 
after completion. However , this will not be fully realised 
in 2014. The combination of Foster Wheeler and AMEC 
is expected to create sustainable value for shareholders 
for the long term. ROIC is expected to exceed the cost 
of capital in the second 12-month period after completion.  
Segmental review 
Average number of employees
The average number of employees was up 1 per cent in 
2013, to 28,687. Growth Regions increased by 21 per cent 
in support of new projects in the Middle East. The split by

Revenue in Americas declined 10 per cent to £2.25 billion, 
with good growth across conventional oil & gas and 
renewables offset by the decline in oil sands and mining and 
the £200 million reduction in incremental procurement, 
as expected, to £120 million. Excluding this incremental 
procurement, underlying revenue declined by 2 per cent. 
EBITA was up 3 per cent, to £241 million (2012: £233 million). 
The EBITA margin was 10.7 per cent, up 140 basis points 
from 2012, largely as the result of the reduced procurement 
activities and the benefits of increased efficiency following 
the restructure in 2012 and from increased grants from the 
US government for research and development activities. 
Excluding incremental procurement, margins were 
11.3 per cent, 60 basis points higher than 2012.
Contract wins announced in 2013 are shown on page 36.
Order book was up 14 per cent at £1.5 billion (2012: 
£1.3 billion), reflecting a particularly strong performance 
in renewables.
Outlook
In 2014, the underlying revenue trend is expected 
to improve, on the back of the very strong activity in 
renewables. However , average margins in this market 
are lower , and this is expected to be dilutive to reported 
margins in the Americas.

Revenue in Europe improved 14 per cent to £1,227 million, 
with the oil & gas activity in the North Sea the primary 
driver.
EBIT A was down 2 per cent, to £93 million (2012: £95 million) 
and the EBIT A margin was 7.6 per cent, down 120 basis 
points from 2012. The margin decline arose mostly in the 
first half and is largely the result of a reduced contribution 
from the Sellafield joint venture (2013: £12 million; 2012: 
£15 million) and losses from the T eesside Gas Processing 
Plant contract.
Activity in the UK conventional power business has been 
reducing for a number of years. In 2013 it became a 
discontinued operation. The 2012 results have been 
restated to reflect this.
Contract awards announced in 2013 reflect continued 
investment in the UK North Sea and the clean energy 
market. They are shown in more detail on page 36.
The order book was up 10 per cent at £1.7 billion, reflecting 
the continued strong position in oil & gas. 
Outlook
In 2014, it is expected revenue growth will continue along 
with an improvement in margins, as the losses from the 
T eesside contract do not recur and as further cost 
efficiencies come through.

Revenue in Growth Regions improved 1 per cent to £536 
million primarily driven by growth in oil & gas especially in 
the Middle East, offset by the decline in mining in Australia. 
EBITA was up 3 per cent, to £33 million (2012: £32 million) 
and the EBIT A margin was 6.2 per cent, up 10 basis points 
from 2012. 
Contract awards in 2013 reflect the strength of the oil & 
gas market in the Middle East and Azerbaijan. They are 
shown in more detail on page 37. 
Order book was 18 per cent higher at £0.9 billion in 2013 
(2012: £0.8 billion), benefiting from the strong oil & gas 
performance in the Middle East.
Outlook
In 2014, growth is expected to come from the Middle East 
and Azerbaijan, with a more stable position in Australia.
Financial review continued 43 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013
Governance Financials Overview Strategic report
Investment Services activities
This principally comprises the Incheon Bridge PPP project 
in Korea and the Lancashire Waste PFI project, both now 
operational, the group’ s insurance captive, AMEC’ s residual 
UK wind development activities and a range of other 
non-core activities. Revenue was £6 million (2012: £9 
million) with EBITA £11 million (2012: £7 million). EBITA 
was atypically high, reflecting the successful exit from 
assets in North America.
Financial review
Geographical analysis
The group’s largest country of operation was the UK with 
28 per cent of revenue (2012: 26 per cent), driven by strong 
demand from the North Sea. Canada was the group’s 
largest revenue generating country in 2012.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses increased by £7 million to 
£228 million (2012: £221 million) principally as a result 
of a full year’s impact of acquisitions made in 2012.
Net financing expenses
Net financing expenses of £(2) million were £(1) million 
higher than last year (2012: £(1) million) and included bank 
interest of £(2) million (2012: £2 million receivable) and 
foreign exchange losses of £(1) million (2012: £nil) offset by 
net interest on pensions assets and liabilities of £1 million 
(2012: £(3) million). 
The 2012 interest charge has been restated as a result of 
the changes to the pensions accounting standard (IAS 19) 
which requires the expected return on assets to be in line 
with the discount rate, irrespective of the asset class. This 
resulted in a £12 million reduction in interest income.
In addition, AMEC’ s share of interest payable of equity 
accounted joint ventures was £9 million (2012: £6 million).
T axation
Continuing operations
The group’s effective tax rate in 2013 for the continuing 
businesses (including tax attributable to joint venture 
interests), before exceptional items and excluding 
intangible amortisation, was 21.9 per cent (2012: 22.5 per 
cent). The reduction principally reflects decreases in 
statutory tax rates, a reduction in the tax rate applied to the 
UK pension surplus, changes in the recognition of tax 
losses and the agreement of historical items with various 
tax authorities.
The tax rate in 2014 and beyond is expected to be in the low 
mid-20s.
Deferred tax
At 31 December 2013, the group had net deferred tax 
assets of £15 million (2012: £33 million) arising from 
short-term timing differences relating to provisions and 
property , plant and equipment, offset by liabilities in 
respect of intangible assets and retirement benefits. 
Financial position and net cash
The group remains in a strong financial position, 
with net cash as at 31 December 2013 of £121 million 
(2012: £99 million).
Cash generated from operations in 2013 was £292 million 
(2012: £271 million). After adjusting for exceptional items 
and discontinued operations, legacy settlements, pension 
payments in excess of amounts recognised in the income 
statement, certain foreign exchange movements and 
dividends received from joint ventures, operating cash 
flow was £341 million (2012: £312 million). 
Going concern
The directors are satisfied that the group has adequate 
resources to operate for the foreseeable future. 
Intangible amortisation and goodwill impairment
Intangible amortisation relates to capitalised software and 
intangible assets acquired as part of the group’ s expansion 
programme. The 2013 charge of £47 million was £3 million 
higher than the prior year (2012: £44 million) with the 
increase due to a full-year impact of acquisitions 
completed in 2012 and the acceleration of amortisation 
of the assets from a prior year acquisition.
In line with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets ’, annual 
impairment reviews have been performed on the goodwill 
carried on the balance sheet. There were no impairment 
charges required in either 2013 or 2012.
Exceptional items 
T otal pre-tax exceptional losses of £31 million (2012: 
£18 million) included:
 
a loss on business disposals and closures of £13 million 
arising from adjustments to existing provisions made 
in respect of prior year disposals and closures
 
other exceptional costs of £18 million which included 
transaction costs of £4 million and £14 million 
restructuring costs associated with the management 
reorganisation into geographical business units.
There was an exceptional tax provision of £16 million 
(2012: £nil) for potential withholding tax following a group 
restructuring that resulted in significant amounts of cash 
being repatriated from foreign subsidiaries.
In aggregate, there was a post-tax exceptional charge 
of £47 million (2012: £10 million).  44 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013
Discontinued trading
In accordance with IFRS 5, the post-tax r esults of discontinued 
operations are shown separately in the income statement. 
The UK conventional power business, which met the 
definition of a discontinued operation during the year , 
generated a trading loss before tax of £(10) million during 
the year (2012: £(4) million). There was a tax credit of 
£2 million (2012: £1 million), resulting in a loss after tax 
of £(8) million (2012: £(3) million).
Legacy issues
No new significant contingent liabilities were added in 
2013. Provisions currently held for future costs of litigation 
total £37 million (2012: £40 million).
Balance sheet highlights
Key movements in the balance sheet are discussed below:
Intangible assets
The net book value of intangible assets as at 31 December 
2013 was £907 million (2012: £969 million) comprising 
goodwill £757 million, software £37 million, customer 
relationships £104 million and other acquired intangible 
assets £9 million.
The reduction in goodwill of £34 million was largely the 
result of movements in foreign exchange rates, offset by 
goodwill of £12 million on the acquisition of AES. The 
reduction of £26 million in customer relationships is 
predominantly due to amortisation. Other acquired 
intangible assets included the value of brand names and 
trademarks, non-compete agreements and order backlogs 
of acquired businesses. 
Distributable reserves
As at 31 December 2013, distributable reserves of AMEC 
plc stood at £842 million (2012: £620 million). 
 £ million 
As at 1 January 2013 620
Dividends paid during 2013 (108)
Dividends received from subsidiaries 159
Distributable reserves generated in the year 163
Other movements 8
As at 31 December 2013 842
During 2012, the group holding company , AMEC plc, 
generated a significant profit from an internal restructuring. 
This profit becomes distributable as qualifying consideration 
is passed to AMEC plc to settle the associated loan balance. 
£176 million was remitted to AMEC plc during 2012, and 
£163 million during 2013.
Pensions
The IAS 19 surplus of the principal UK pension schemes 
at the end of 2013 of £102 million increased compared 
with 2012 (£86 million), reflecting reductions in both the 
discount rate and higher than expected asset returns, 
offset by higher price inflation. 
The UK schemes have operated on a career average salary 
basis since January 2008. During 2012, the UK defined 
benefit schemes were closed to new entrants but remain 
open to future accrual for existing members. 
There are a number of smaller schemes which are in a 
deficit position. The combined deficit as at 31 December 
2013 was £62 million (2012: £93 million) with the reduction 
in the year being due to actuarial gains. During 2012, some 
30 per cent of the members of the scheme acquired with 
MACTEC accepted a lump sum settlement of their 
liabilities.
Contributions of £29 million were paid to the company’ s 
defined benefit schemes during the year (2012: £30 million). 
This included special contributions agreed with the 
trustees of £5 million (2012: £5 million). 
Provisions
Provisions held at 31 December 2013 were £163 million 
(31 December 2012: £171 million). During 2013, £19 million 
of the brought forward provisions were utilised. As part of 
the ongoing review of the potential liabilities, £14 million of 
provisions were released as they were no longer required 
but additional provisions of £10 million were created in 
respect of indemnities granted on prior year disposals, which 
have been charged as an adjustment to the profit on disposal 
within discontinued operations and additional litigation 
provisions of £9 million were created in respect of business 
closures which have been charged as an adjustment to the 
loss on closure within continuing operations.
Provisions are analysed as follows:
 As at 31 December 2013 £ million 
Litigation provisions 37
Indemnities granted to buyers and retained 
obligations on disposed businesses 71
Insurance, onerous property contracts and 
provisions to fund joint ventures 55

Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 
Dear shareholder ,
Our board agenda is carefully planned to ensure that we 
focus on those issues that are key to achieving our goals.
AMEC’ s recommended offer for Foster Wheeler is 
explained elsewhere in this document. The board formally 
reviews the company’s strategy each year and this provides 
the context in which corporate transactions such as this 
one can be assessed and approved. Each board member 
brings their own knowledge and experience to the 
discussion as we challenge, achieve a consensus and 
ultimately support executive management. We have a 
clear view of what will create long-term value for our 
shareholders and remain focused on this in our debates. 
I spoke about our approach to diversity and inclusion 
previously . We need to recruit from the widest pool of 
qualified individuals and we need to value and use the 
diversity of thinking that results. Gender diversity is one 
subset of our wider commitment. We have been reporting 
on our gender balance since 2008 and included this in our 
annual report for the first time this year . At board level, 
we support the objectives of the Davies Report on Women 
on Boards. In considering appointments to the board 
we will evaluate candidates in light of the requirements 
of the particular role having appropriate regard to those 
objectives and to our group-wide commitment to 
diversity and inclusion.
Our ethics committee has an important role to play as 
our business grows and becomes increasingly global. 
We have made our mandatory global policies and 
procedures simpler and clearer , conscious that they will 
increasingly be read by those for whom English is a second 
language. They form an important part of our governance 
framework, shown in diagrammatic form on page 50. 
The implementation of both online and face-to-face 
anti-bribery and corruption training has gone well and 
training on competition law issues is planned for 2014.
Y our board continues to place particular emphasis on 
monitoring risk and on the structured approach to the 
management of risk in the company . Our approach to 
risk management is shown on page 85 while our key 
business risks are shown in the relevant section of the 
business model. 
AMEC has an extensive investor relations programme 
for executive management. In addition, Tim Faithfull, our 
Senior Independent Director , and I proactively seek to 
arrange meetings with our major shareholders during the 
year . In 2013 we had a number of one-on-one meetings 
and hosted a more informal investor group lunch in 
London. At the start of the year questions focused on the 
then-recent management changes; later they became 
more general discussions about the company , its strategy , 
use of the balance sheet, management more generally 
and the approach of the board. I will continue to prioritise 
these and other similar interactions.
We work hard to provide, in this report, the information 
you need to understand our business model and strategy 
for growth and to assess our performance towards our 
goals. As a result, your board believes this annual report 
and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair , balanced and 
understandable, as we confirm in the directors ’ 
responsibility statements on page 90. I would also 
encourage you to use the additional information on our 
website amec.com and to attend our annual general 
meeting (AGM) on 3 April 2014.
As a board we support the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(Code) and believe we have complied with the provisions 
of the September 2012 edition throughout the year ended 
31 December 2013.

Leadership
Board role and responsibilities
AMEC’ s board is ultimately responsible for promoting the 
long-term success of the company in accordance with 
the expectations of, and its obligations to, all stakeholders. 
The directors believe that the board leads and controls the 
group effectively and that all directors act in accordance 
with what they consider to be the best interests of the 
company , consistent with their statutory duties under 
the Companies Act 2006 and other legislation.
In order to ensure it retains appropriate overall control 
of the group, the board maintains a schedule of matters 
reserved for its approval. These include:
 
annual strategic and short-range plans
 
financial and treasury policies
 
risk identification, risk appetite, risk management 
and internal control systems
 
major acquisitions and disposals
 
Code of Business Conduct
 
full and half year accounts
 
dividend policy
 
succession planning for directors and senior executives
 
group-wide policy framework
 
ensuring the effectiveness of governance practices.
This schedule is reviewed on an annual basis and was 
last reviewed in August 2013. The board also delegates 
other matters to board committees and management 
as appropriate. 
The Code of Business Conduct (CoBC) forms the 
foundation of AMEC’ s approach to corporate governance. 
It is the responsibility of, and upheld by , the board and 
ensures that those who work for and under AMEC’s 
direction understand the behaviour that is expected of 
them. In early 2013 the board launched a revised global 
policies document, supported by a set of global mandatory 
procedures and designed to strengthen the corporate 
governance framework. These revised global policies and 
procedures provide a more detailed description of expected 
working behaviours and so will aid consistency in the 
direction and management of the businesses throughout 
the group in accordance with AMEC’s vision and values.
On a day to day basis, the board has delegated responsibility 
for the implementation of the global policies and ownership 
of the global mandatory procedures to the Group 
Management T eam. The board is responsible for regularly 
reviewing the effectiveness of the governance framework.

Board committees
The board is supported in its work by four board committees 
(audit, remuneration, nominations and ethics), chaired 
by either the Chairman or another non-executive director , 
and a number of management committees, chaired by 
executive directors, to which specific responsibilities have 
been formally delegated.

board considers that this structure and consistency 
of membership contributes to the effectiveness of 
the committees, as the benefit of each member’ s 
independence and external viewpoint is available.
The board ensures that the committees are provided with 
whatever resources they need to undertake their duties 
and that their membership continues to be appropriate. 
The secretary of the committees produces timely records 
of all meetings, which are circulated to each member . In 
addition, the chairman of each board committee reports 
fully to the board following each meeting.  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 52
The key objectives of the audit 
committee are to provide independent 
scrutiny of the company’ s financial 
and non-financial performance, the 
adequacy of the risk management 
framework and the internal controls 
and the performance of both the 
external and internal audit functions. 
There is a wide diversity of experience 
and knowledge on the committee, 
which ensures the achievement 
of these objectives and provides 
constructive challenge and guidance 
to the executive team.
Dear shareholder ,
Robust governance remains a fundamental characteristic 
of the way AMEC manages its business and risks. Y our 
committee has a vital role to play in this regard by providing 
detailed scrutiny over the integrity and relevance of the 
group’ s financial reporting, the appropriateness of the 
group’ s system of internal control across numerous 
geographies, the suitability of the group’ s system of risk 
management as well as overseeing the internal and 
external audit processes.
Where necessary , the committee has requested and received 
additional detailed information from management; for 
instance, material projects, so that we may discuss the 
key features, risks and opportunities these present. Our 
aim is to provide proactive and constructive challenge over 
the information we receive. As Chairman, I also spend a 
considerable amount of time outside committee meetings 
with the CFO, Head of Internal Audit, General Counsel and 
our external advisers to ensure our process, reports and 
analyses are fully understood and acted upon.
This past year we have again been served extremely well 
with the timeliness and quality of information provided by 
management and from the internal and external auditors. 
Their reports have been clear and relevant, which has 
enabled this committee to discharge its duties effectively .
As reported by our company chairman, Tim Faithfull retires 
this year after serving this committee and board since 
2005. I would like to thank him for his valued contribution 
to this committee and we wish him well for the future.
Consistent with the requirements of the Code, we are 
providing additional information this year and we do hope 
you will find this helpful in better understanding the work 
of your committee.

Members
The audit committee comprises all the independent 
non-executive directors. The committee meets at least 
three times each year and the quorum for the committee 
is two members.
Membership of the audit committee
1  Flight delays caused by severe weather in the US in December 2013 
prevented Simon Thompson from attending the committee meeting 
that day 
Colin Day has relevant and recent experience in auditing 
and accounting. Biographies of all committee members 
can be found on pages 48 to 49.
The company chairman, the executive directors, the 
Group Financial Controller , the Head of Internal Audit 
and representatives of the external auditor also attend 
each meeting by invitation. 
During 2013, the committee chairman also met separately 
with the external auditor , the Head of Internal Audit and the 
CFO, in each case without others being present. No areas 
of concern were raised.
Key responsibilities 
 
Reviewing the annual and half yearly financial 
statements and making recommendations to 
the board for their approval
 
Reviewing and monitoring the internal controls 
and risk management systems
 
Overseeing the relationship with the external auditor 
including the approval of the engagement letter , letter 
of representation and statutory audit fees
 
Promoting an effective internal audit function
 
Overseeing AMEC’ s compliance processes.
Activities of the committee
In preparation for each meeting, the CFO prepares an 
extensive report covering all material financial, tax and 
treasury matters.
During the year , the committee reviewed the terms of 
reference of both the committee itself and those of the 
internal audit department. As a result, the committee’ s 
terms of reference were refreshed to reflect the additional 
reporting requirements under the Code. 
Training provided to the committee in the year included a 
presentation in December 2013 from Ernst & Y oung LLP 
(EY) on corporate governance, narrative reporting and 
audit committee developments.
Financial reporting
In its reviews of the full and half-year results, particular 
emphasis was placed on contractual issues, where the 
reported financial position was fully analysed in the CFO’ s 
report and validated by means of questioning. The rules 
relating to the reporting of exceptional and discontinued 
items were also considered at length, to ensure that they 
were being appropriately applied. In December 2013, the 
committee considered and validated the levels of 
provisions and accruals. 
Other areas of focus in 2013 included:
 
The CFO’ s report highlights legacy contract risks and 
material contracts (those above £10 million in contract 
value to AMEC) showing a deteriorating position over 
time, such as TGPP as discussed on page 22. The 
committee reviewed and discussed management’s 
proposed enhancements to its early warning system 
to augment visibility , at an earlier stage, to the board 
of potentially underperforming material contracts 
for further scrutiny .

 
The treatment of the UK conventional power business as 
discontinued, where the committee sought assurances 
from management that the projects were complete and 
there was no further revenue generating activity . 
 
Revenue recognition, which is by necessity based on 
management estimates and assumptions, particularly 
with regard to timing. In conjunction with the external 
auditor , the judgements of management were challenged, 
especially those relating to end-life forecast estimates. 
AMEC’ s policies and processes that control the estimates 
made in such areas were also examined to ensure that 
they continued to be relevant and robustly and 
consistently applied.
 
The ongoing quality and acceptability of AMEC’s 
accounting policies, taxation matters, the going concern 
statement and more specifically , the impact on the 
reporting process of the structural reorganisation 
undertaken in late 2012. No issues were identified.
  As part of the CFO’s report, the committee now receives 
details of all breaches of treasury policy . It had previously 
only received details of material breaches, of which 
there were none. This has increased the committee’s 
knowledge of how relatively minor issues are identified 
and addressed to ensure they do not become more 
significant matters.
 
Agreeing the appropriate presentation of items such as 
the deferred tax applied to the UK pension asset and 
the treatment of research and development (R&D) 
government credits.
 
Assisting management in resolving issues raised by the 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in relation to the 2011 
report and accounts. None of these issues was material 
to the group. They included use of non-GAAP measures, 
the ability to link provision movements to the income 
statement and disclosure of the inputs used in goodwill 
impairment testing. Additional clarification was requested 
in June 2013 and this was provided to the satisfaction of 
the FRC. 
At the request of the board, the committee has also 
reviewed and provided advice on whether the annual report 
and accounts, when taken as a whole, is fair , balanced and 
understandable, to enable AMEC’s shareholders to assess 
the company’s performance, business model and strategy .
In coming to its view that it is satisfied with the overall 
fairness, balance and clarity of the document, the 
committee took into account:
 
its own knowledge of the group, its strategy and 
performance in the year
 
the comprehensive guidance provided to all contributors 
to the annual report and accounts
 
a thorough internal verification of the factual content 
within the document
 
the comprehensive reviews undertaken at different levels 
in the group to ensure consistency and overall balance
 
a detailed review by senior management.
Internal controls and risk management
The committee reviewed the processes by which AMEC’ s 
control environment is evaluated. A control risk assessment 
is undertaken every year , with comprehensive integrity 
checks, and the exercise in 2013 identified no significant 
areas of concern. Each year , AMEC’ s senior management 
is formally required to confirm compliance with AMEC’ s 
Code of Business Conduct, policies and procedures. Any 
areas of concern have to be fully explained and addressed.
During the year the committee received from the Head of 
Internal Audit a small number of incident reports regarding 
alleged or suspected wrongdoing, some of which were 
concerns raised through the independent third party 
reporting system. All of the incidents were investigated, 
were low level in nature, and did not reveal any significant 
internal control failure or have any noteworthy financial 
impact. The committee also reviewed management 
actions, which included enhancements made to existing 
controls or procedures and, in a few instances, disciplinary 
action taken against employees.
The committee’ s primary responsibilities in relation to risk 
management are in ensuring that robust processes are in 
place for managing risk throughout AMEC. 
AMEC’ s principal business and strategic risks are shown 
by business model element in the Strategic report on 
pages 12 to 38 and the approach to managing risk is 
shown in more detail on page 85.

Internal audit
In 2013, the committee continued to monitor and review 
the operation of the internal audit function, receiving a full 
report at each meeting from the Head of Internal Audit. 
The Head of Internal Audit formally reports to the 
committee chairman.
The findings of each internal audit review are summarised 
and the committee focuses its discussions on unsatisfactory 
findings and on the action plans in place to address them. 
Particular areas of concern during 2013 included IT 
security , including malicious network traffic issues and 
isolated instances where potential issues with security of 
data were identified and addressed. 
External audit
During 2013, the committee continued to oversee the 
relationship with the external auditor , Ernst & Y oung LLP (EY). 
Each year the relevant audit risks are assessed. In 2013, 
the primary risks identified were revenue recognition, 
valuation of work in progress and receivables, the 
adequacy of contract provisions and legacy liabilities and 
issues arising out of the organisational restructuring that 
occurred in late 2012. Other risk areas included the 
valuation of pension assets and liabilities; the adequacy of 
tax provisions; the presentation of discontinued operations; 
the risk of fraud and management override; and the 
recognition and presentation of R&D government grants. 
Throughout the year and in conjunction with EY , the 
committee challenged management and assured itself 
that the risks were being addressed and that reporting 
on the matters was balanced.
The audit differences and quality of earnings schedule for 
the year ended 2013 was presented by EY at the February 
2014 meeting. The value of unadjusted differences and the 
quality of earnings high level review of the impact of items 
that could be considered non-recurring in nature were 
discussed in detail. Neither the audit differences nor the 
quality of earnings impact were considered to be material. 
On behalf of the committee, the Head of Internal Audit 
undertakes an annual assessment of the effectiveness of 
the external auditor , overseen by the Company Secretary . 
The views of senior members of the finance teams 
throughout AMEC are sought, as well as qualitative 
feedback. Responses can be measured and directly 
compared with previous surveys, so that progress can 
be monitored. 
In February 2013, the committee considered the 
effectiveness report which identified a few minor issues 
that have subsequently been addressed. They included 
some duplication of information requests and a requirement 
for better co-ordination in some areas. Overall, however , 
the report concluded that EY’s performance had been of 
good quality and a plan was agreed to deal with the issues 
raised. The committee noted that improvements continued 
to be recorded.
EY were appointed as AMEC’ s external auditor in 2010, 
following a formal tender process. Both EY and the audit 
partner responsible for the group audit have now been in 
place for four years. The committee takes account of and 
endorses the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in this regard, which means that the 
external audit contract will be put out to tender at the 
latest by 2020, subject to further regulatory change.
AMEC has formal procedures relating to its relationship with 
the external auditor including for the provision of non-audit 
services, to ensur e that such work does not impair the external 
auditor’s objectivity and independence. This procedure 
clearly outlines the category of work the external auditor is 
permitted to carry out and the rules governing what is not 
permitted. The procedure follows the guidelines set out by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales 
and has an approval matrix for all non-audit services, 
including the requirement that fees for ‘other services ’ 
that total £100,000 or more require prior approval from 
both the CFO and the Chairman of the audit committee. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 56
Activities of the committee continued
External audit continued
The procedure was amended during the year to reflect 
regulatory changes defining the type of work that needs to 
be disclosed and the committee’s reporting requirements 
in this regard. This process is also continually monitored 
by the Head of Internal Audit and details of all ‘other 
services’ performed are formally presented to the audit 
committee twice a year . It is the responsibility of the audit 
committee to monitor the overall level of non-audit fees 
in relation to audit fees from an independence point of 
view and to confirm that auditor independence has been 
safeguarded. If there are any concerns about this, for the 
avoidance of doubt, the undertaking of such work would 
not be permitted. 
The level of non-audit fee awarded to EY is considerably 
higher in 2013 than would normally be the case, as 
shown in the table opposite. In conjunction with the CFO, 
the audit committee chairman approved the services of 
EY to undertake and support management’s due diligence 
work for the proposed acquisition of Foster Wheeler. 
The substantial due diligence performed by EY primarily 
covered the balance sheet, profit & loss, accounting policies, 
revenues, provisions, liabilities, general accounting, tax, 
corporate finance and differences between US GAAP 
and IFRS. 
The decision to appoint EY to undertake this work was 
considered by the audit committee to be in the best interest 
of shareholders. The firm has a deep understanding of 
AMEC, placing them at a distinct advantage to support the 
board in this regard. In addition, should the proposed 
acquisition be successful, a sizeable portion of the work 
performed by EY will not have to be repeated, thereby 
making the most efficient and economic use of 
shareholders’ funds.

All EY’s fees for non-audit work were approved 
in accordance with AMEC’ s policy covering non-audit 
services. As a result of the application of this policy and 
additional discussions with them, the directors do not 
believe that EY’s independence has been compromised 
because of this additional work on behalf of the company .

During 2013, the committee also considered and 
made recommendations to the board on the adoption 
of a policy on diversity . The board recognises the 
importance of diversity both in the boardroom and 
across the group more generally . In 2013 its diversity 
initiatives have focused on introducing a group-wide 
commitment to diversity and inclusion, including 
encouraging and enabling greater diversity of thinking. 
The implementation of this commitment includes 
measurement and monitoring of progress on diversity 
and inclusion activities.
  As part of the company’s broader diversity initiative, it 
supports the objectives of the Davies Report on Women 
on Boards. Candidates for board appointments are 
evaluated in light of the requirements of the role, having 
appropriate regard to the objectives of the Davies Report 
and to the group-wide commitment to diversity 
and inclusion.

In early 2014, the committee considered the 
reappointment of Neil Carson and Colin Day for 
a second three-year term of office as their first 
three-year terms end at the forthcoming AGM. 
Their significant external experience and their 
full participation in board discussions, providing 
constructive challenge, resulted in a recommendation 
being made to the board to reappoint both directors.
 
In anticipation of Tim Faithfull ’ s forthcoming retirement 
at the conclusion the 2014 AGM, the committee 
considered the positions of Senior Independent 
Director and Chairman of the remuneration 
committee. After careful deliberation, it was 
concluded that Simon Thompson was the best 
candidate for both these roles and a recommendation 
was made to the board accordingly .
  As a result of these changes, Simon Thompson will be 
stepping down as Chairman of the ethics committee. 
The committee considered suitable candidates for 
his replacement and concluded that Linda Adamany’ s 
previous experience made her the best candidate 
for this role and a recommendation was also made 
to the board. Simon will assume the role of Senior 
Independent Director and Chairman of the 
remuneration committee, and Linda will assume 
the role of Chairman of the ethics committee 
immediately following the 2014 AGM.

Ethics committee
The purpose of the ethics committee 
is to assist the board in upholding 
AMEC’s core value of integrity . 
Dear shareholder ,
We have made significant progress in recent years. 
We now have in place a strong framework to support 
AMEC as it grows and becomes more global, ensuring 
that our employees, and those who work with and for us, 
act with integrity wherever they are based. 
Complacency would be foolish when a company has 29,000 
people working in 40 countries. We have a well developed 
independent third party reporting system for employees to 
report their concerns or report issues in complete 
confidence. The committee treats all reports, however 
reported to us, with the respect they deserve. Thankfully 
nothing of significance was reported in 2013 but there were 
a handful of minor infractions which were dealt with swiftly .

Membership of the ethics committee
Simon Thompson will step down as Chairman of the ethics 
committee at the conclusion of the 2014 AGM and will be 
replaced by Linda Adamany .
Key responsibilities
The committee reviews and monitors business ethics 
within AMEC, including compliance with relevant 
legislation, regulation and current best practice. It also 
reviews and approves AMEC’ s Code of Business Conduct 
at least annually .
It considers and reviews the scope and planning of all 
compliance activity within AMEC and reviews the extent 
and effectiveness of AMEC’s internal training and external 
reporting of compliance and ethics matters.
In the event of an actual or suspected material breach 
of AMEC’s Code of Business Conduct or any relevant 
legislation, a member of the committee will take 
responsibility for and manage any investigation into the 
relevant matter with the support of the General Counsel 
and Company Secretary . 
Activities of the committee
 
The committee reviewed AMEC’s Code of Business 
Conduct in August 2013 and endorsed its continuing use
 
There was a focus on the effectiveness of procedures 
to prevent bribery and corruption. As a result, additional 
training on anti-bribery and corruption was rolled out 
throughout the company towards the end of the year , 
as mentioned elsewhere in this report (see pages 15 
and 38)
 
During the year , the committee received from the Chief 
Ethics Officer a relatively small number of investigation 
reports over alleged or suspected ethical breaches  
and/or concerns, some of which were reports made to 
the independent third party reporting system. None of 
the investigations highlighted any significant control 
failure or noteworthy financial impact. The outcome of 
these investigations resulted in disciplinary action being 
tak en against a small number of employees, as well as 
enhancements being made to the existing control 
environment where appropriate
 
The committee also oversaw the appointment of 
additional Ethics Officers to align to AMEC’ s revised 
geographically based structure and took steps to ensure 
that the ethics process within AMEC had not been 
impaired in any way as a result of the structural 
reorganisation that commenced in 2012.

The nominations committee leads 
the process for identifying, and 
makes recommendations to the 
board concerning the appointment or 
termination of, any new director or the 
Company Secretary and, in the case 
of non-executive directors and the 
Chairman, the extension of existing 
appointments. It also considers and 
makes recommendations to the board 
on appointments to board committees 
taking into account areas such as 
diversity and succession planning.
Dear shareholder ,
I have spoken elsewhere in this report about board 
composition, board succession planning and our 
commitment to diversity and inclusion. I will not repeat 
these comments here.
As we look forward into 2014, we expect to see board 
renewal. We will, of course, miss Tim Faithfull’s experience 
and contribution. We expect any replacement to bring 
international experience gained working within our core 
markets and experience of large projects. Foster Wheeler 
will be nominating two of their directors to join our board 
on completion of the proposed acquisition.
As you can see from the charts on page 80, we have a good 
mix of skills, experience and length of service amongst 
your board of directors and I expect this to be maintained.

Key responsibilities
The committee considers the structure, size and 
composition of the board, including the mix of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the directors. 
In considering recommendations to the board, the 
committee considers the appropriate balance of skills

takes account of the benefits of diversity , including but 
not limited to gender . 
The committee also reviews board succession planning, 
in conjunction with reports from the Chief Executive and

planning, so as to ensure that an appropriate balance of 
skills is maintained both within the senior management 
team of AMEC and on the board.

Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee’ s 
principal aims are to attract and retain 
good management and to incentivise 
them to increase the value of AMEC 
for its shareholders
Dear shareholder ,
This is our first report prepared under the new reporting 
regulations and, in line with best practice, it has been 
arranged in two parts.
The first part of our report, on pages 62 to 68, describes 
our remuneration policy . This is now subject to legally 
binding shareholder approval, resolution number 4 at 
our 2014 AGM. The second part of this new format report, 
on pages 69 to 77, is our annual report on remuneration. 
This explains how our policy has been implemented 
during 2013 and is subject to an advisory vote (resolution 3).
We have reviewed our remuneration policy in the light of 
the new disclosure requirements. Minor changes have 
been made, with new directors’ contracts now providing 
explicitly for mitigation and a ’malus’ provision included 
in Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards from 2014 
onwards. The policy is otherwise essentially unchanged 
from that approved by shareholders in an advisory vote 
last year. 
The proposed acquisition of Foster Wheeler has just been 
announced. During 2014, we will consider whether any 
of our remuneration approaches need to be changed 
in the light of this including, as noted on page 69, any 
appropriate adjustments to annual bonus and long-term 
incentive targets. We will also discuss how to take account 
of the revised company strategy , as it moves from Vision 
2015 to ‘2015 and beyond’. 
Shareholder approval for our current long-term incentive 
arrangement, the PSP , expires in May 2015. Over the 
coming year we will be reviewing what we want to put to 
shareholders in terms of renewing that plan. As a result, 
we expect that we will need to seek further shareholder 
approval at the 2015 AGM for modifications to the policy 
that is shown here and being proposed to the 2014 AGM.
Although 2013 showed further year-on-year improvement, 
the pace of growth slowed reflecting the downturn in our 
mining market in particular . This is explained in more 
detail on page 41. The overall results were lower than had 
been targeted for bonus purposes at the start of the year 
and this is reflected in the overall remuneration of the 
executive directors being significantly reduced from 2012. 
Annual bonus payments were reduced and the PSP awards 
made in 2011 are expected to vest at lower levels. We are 
of course aware of the economic environment in which 
the company operates and the need to calibrate incentives 
accordingly . Nonetheless, your committee continues to 
take a robust approach to setting performance measures 
and targets. We want to ensure that high reward is only 
achieved for outstanding performance.
We have reviewed the effectiveness of the application 
of our remuneration policy to date and continue to be 
satisfied that the overall approach also provides good 
alignment of executive behaviour with shareholder 
interests and does not encourage excessive risk. Both 
of our executive directors have high levels of personal 
shareholdings, considerably in excess of our minimum 
guideline (see page 76).
It has been my privilege to serve as Chairman of this 
committee for the last 8 years. During this time we have 
seen significant change within AMEC and I believe our 
approach to remuneration matters has played an 
important role in supporting this.

prevented Simon Thompson from attending a committee meeting 
that day 
The remuneration committee comprises all the 
non-executive directors including the Chairman. 
The quorum for the committee is two members.
The Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources 
Director attend meetings by invitation.
As noted on page 6, Tim Faithfull will be retiring as a 
director at the conclusion of the 2014 AGM. He will be 
succeeded as committee chairman by Simon Thompson. 
In considering the matters within its remit, the committee 
takes account of recommendations from the Chairman in 
respect of the Chief Executive and from the Chief Executive 
in respect of the other executive directors and designated 
executives. It is advised independently by New Bridge 
Street (NBS). NBS was reappointed by the committee in 
2013 and its terms of engagement are available from the 
Company Secretary . NBS does not undertake any material 
additional work for the company . NBS is wholly owned by 
Aon Corporation and while other companies within the 
Aon group do undertake material work for the company , 
this is not in the area of executive remuneration and 
arrangements are in place within the Aon Group to 
ring-fence NBS from other services provided. Accordingly , 
the committee does not believe that the independence

Remuneration policy 
Introduction 
The description that follows sets out the policy that is subject to the new statutory binding vote at the 2014 AGM. It is 
intended that, if approved, it will take effect from that date (save that for the purposes of Section 226D(6) of the Companies 
Act, the effective date is the end of the financial year starting in 2014). It has been our practice in AMEC to seek shareholder 
approval on an annual basis for our remuneration policy and we will be following the policy approved at the 2013 AGM 
up to this new policy coming into effect.

Reviewed annually from 1 January . Interim reviews only in case

Salary increases for executive directors will not normally 
exceed the average increase awarded to other employees 
based in the same country . Increases may be above this 
level if there is an increase in the scale, scope, complexity 
or responsibility of the role or to allow the base salary of 
newly appointed executives to move towards market 
norms as their experience and contribution increase. 
2014 salaries for executive directors are shown on 
page 69.
Pension 
and related 
benefits 
Normally through a fixed allowance, some or all of which can be 
paid in the form of a company contribution to a defined contribution 
pension plan with any balance paid as a cash supplement. Where the 
plan permits, individuals may also sacrifice on a like-for-like basis 
part of base salary in return for an enhanced company contribution. 
Pension plan membership is available on the same basis as for senior 
employees generally in the country in which the individual is based 
and there are no special arrangements for directors.
Life assurance is also provided.
Samir Brikho has a historic arrangement that provides for a pension 
payable from age 60 based on an accrual rate of one-thirtieth and on 
final pensionable salary in respect of service to 31 December 2007 
and career averaged revalued earnings in respect of service 
thereafter . Salary and earnings for pension purposes are subject 
to a cap, currently £153,000 pa for tax year 2013/14. The cap is 
increased annually , broadly in line with UK inflation. He also receives 
the pension allowance on salary above this cap as a cash supplement.
T o allow for the fluctuating value of defined benefit 
pension accrual and cost of life assurance, the 
aggregate value of those arrangements, company 
contribution to a defined contribution arrangement 
and cash supplement will not exceed 50 per cent 
of annual salary .
Other benefits Standard benefits typically include disability and healthcare insurance 
(including cover for eligible dependants), car/travel allowance, working 
lunches and tax return preparation assistance. 
Additional benefits may be paid where an individual is required by the 
company to relocate. This can include temporary housing prior to full 
relocation and a one-off payment to cover specific costs of moving 
home or an allowance of an equivalent amount paid for a fixed number 
of years. 
Where individuals are required to work in another country on a 
temporary basis, housing, travel, tax equalisation and cost of living 
adjustments may also be paid in line with the company’ s normal policy 
for employees generally .
Other benefits may be provided from time to time where the 
committee feels it appropriate and in line with market practice 
to do so in the country in which the director is based.
The company may from time to time operate other arrangements that 
are open to employees in a particular country (for example, relating to 
savings, discounted purchase, salary sacrifice, holiday buy and sell, 
service recognition awards) that executive directors may participate 
in on the same basis as other employees in the country in which they 
are based.
The actual value of these benefits will vary from time 
to time depending, among other things, on the cost 
of insuring them. The intention is that the aggregate  
cost would be in line with market practice and will 
not exceed 100 per cent of annual salary where there 
is a relocation/expatriate element and 20 per cent of 
annual salary otherwise.
Annual bonus Rewards the achievement of annual 
financial and delivery of other 
strategic business targets.
Calculated by reference to a mix of financial and other strategic and 
personal objectives set by the remuneration committee that vary from 
year to year and between individuals to reflect the business priorities 
associated with each role. Profit-based measures will have a weighting 
of not less than 50 per cent. Part of the bonus is subject to an additional 
stretch profit target. Details of the actual measures for the periods under 
review are included in the Annual report on remuneration on page 69.
The target level of bonus on the financial targets element is two-thirds  
of maximum excluding additional stretch and the threshold level is  
25 per cent.
Payment of any bonus earned in relation to the additional stretch 
element is in the form of AMEC shares deferred for three years during 
which it is subject to ‘bad leaver’ forfeiture and claw-back in the event 
that the accounts for the year for which the shares were earned are 
required to be restated for a correction of a prior period error . 
The balance of the bonus is normally paid as a cash allowance 
following the end of the year to which the payment relates. However , 
to facilitate higher levels of executive share ownership, the bonus may , 
at the director’ s option and subject to the committee’ s agreement, be 
in the form of options over company shares of equivalent value instead 
of cash payment. The vesting is deferred for three months during 
which it is forfeit if the individual is a bad leaver . Such options have 
a six-month exercise window.
The committee has discretion to amend performance measures 
and targets or adjust bonus payouts to take account of exceptional 
items, unbudgeted acquisitions or disposals, and other aspects 
of performance which have not been specifically identified in 
the targets.
The maximum opportunity is 150 per cent of annual 
salary for the Chief Executive and 125 per cent for 
other executive directors (including the additional  
stretch element). AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 63

to shareholders.
Annual awards of restricted shares or nil-cost options (with an 
18-month exercise period after vesting). Part of the award (the 
matched award) is conditional on the individual electing to lodge 
AMEC shares they beneficially own (investment shares) which are 
then held for the three years to vesting and is awarded in proportion  
to the number of investment shares on a ratio determined by the 
remuneration committee at the time of each award. These shares 
count towards satisfying the requirements of the shareholding 
guidelines, details of which are set out on page 76.
The basic award is subject to EPS growth and relative TSR measured 
over a three-year period with equal weighting on each measure. The 
matched award is subject to the same EPS measure only . Additionally , 
awards are subject to a provision that allows the committee to reduce 
vesting in the event that the accounts for any year over which the 
shares were earned are required to be restated for a correction of a 
prior period error . There is further provision to reduce leaver awards 
retrospectively on an individual basis as set out on page 67. 
The number of shares vesting from these awards is increased to take 
account of reinvested dividends during the performance period.
The committee will determine the applicable EPS range for each 
set of awards, with 25 per cent of the relevant portion of the awards 
vesting if the bottom of the range is achieved and 100 per cent if the 
top is achieved, with straight line vesting between. EPS is adjusted for 
certain defined items and calculated on a consistent basis between 
base and final years. 
The committee will determine the TSR comparator group for each 
set of awards with 25 per cent of the relevant portion of the awards 
vesting if AMEC’s ranking is at median and 100 per cent if it is at 
upper quartile, with straight line vesting between. The committee 
has discretion not to vest the TSR portion if it is not satisfied that 
there has been sustained financial growth over the period.
The committee may amend the performance conditions if an 
event happens which the committee considers to be of a genuine, 
exceptional nature so that amended performance condition(s) would 
be a fairer measure of performance and would be neither easier nor 
more difficult to satisfy .
In the event of a change of control, awards will normally vest to the 
extent that the performance conditions have been met at that time. 
The committee has discretion to measure performance based solely 
against one of the performance conditions or to agree an exchange 
of awards instead of immediate vesting.
Award of shares with a face value at the time  
of award of up to 250 per cent of annual salary  
(ignoring dividend equivalents).
Sharesave Provides alignment with 
shareholders’ interests.
Sharesave is an employee share plan under which discounted options 
over AMEC shares are granted linked to a savings arrangement. 
The exercise price can be up to a 20 per cent discount to the share 
price at the time of offer and the number of shares is that which can 
be bought at the exercise price with the expected proceeds of the 
savings contract. Executive directors are eligible to participate in this 
plan on the same basis as other employees in the country in which 
they are located. Invitations to participate may be made annually . 
Sharesave is not subject to performance conditions as the terms 
of the plan are subject to tax legislation in the UK and certain 
other countries including the US that preclude this. 
The maximum monthly savings level under any 
concurrent Sharesave plans is in line with the limit 
set by the UK government from time to time for such 
plans (currently £250 per month or the equivalent in 
other currencies).

UK to recognise the additional travelling time in attending meetings.
Increases in the Chairman’s fee will not normally exceed

Selection of performance targets
Financial performance targets under the annual bonus plan are set so that the target level of bonus is paid normally for 
achieving the company’s short-range plan. T o achieve maximum bonus, higher targets have to be met. In determining 
targets, the committee takes account of the general business circumstances including the perceived difficulty inherent in 
the short-range plan and the need to balance stretch against risk. The additional stretch bonus is subject to a profit target 
and only begins to be earned for performance that exceeds the maximum target that applies to other executives. Profit is 
chosen as the most appropriate measure of the company’s short-term performance and the cash measures are chosen 
both to reflect the conversion of profit to cash and the management of cash flow across the year . AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 65

Policy on notice and payment for loss of office
Newly appointed executive directors will be employed on contracts that include the following provisions:
 
The individual will be required to give six months’ notice if they wish to leave and the company will give up to 12 months’ 
notice of termination other than for gross misconduct or other circumstances where employment may be terminated 
without notice 
 
At the company’s discretion, the individual may be placed on garden leave for some or all of the period between the 
giving of notice and termination in which case the company will continue to pay salary and benefits for the garden leave 
period but will not make new share or other incentive awards
 
At any time, at the company’s discretion, employment may be terminated before the end of the required notice period 
by making a payment in lieu of the balance and subject to mitigation as described more fully in the table below.
In the event of long-term incapacity , employment would not normally be terminated so long as the executive was entitled 
to payments under the company’s group income protection insurance arrangements but the executive would be required 
to stand down from their role and as a director . 
Payment for loss of office will be determined according to the following principles set out below and, for the current 
executive directors, having regard to their existing contractual terms as described following the table.
Notice The executive will receive base salary , pension and other benefits for any part of the notice period worked (and any 
period of garden leave). On termination, the executive will be entitled to payment for any accrued but untaken 
holiday pay . 
The company may elect to pay a sum in lieu of notice for all or any part of the notice period, calculated by reference 
to the value of salary , pension and other contractual benefits (excluding bonus). In determining the payments to be 
made and the structure of such payments, the company will have regard to the executive’s ability to mitigate their 
loss. In respect of any defined benefit pension rights, an augmentation of benefits for the relevant part of the notice 
period may be made. The committee has discretion to continue to provide certain benefits to the end of the notice 
period rather than including them in the payment in lieu.
Where the employment is being terminated by the company for gross misconduct (or other circumstances 
entitling the company to treat the contract as at an immediate end) termination will be immediate and no  
payment in lieu of notice will be made.
Annual  
bonus 
No bonus will be paid in the event of termination for gross misconduct.
In all other circumstances, the committee will consider whether it is appropriate to make a bonus payment for the 
year in question taking into account all relevant circumstances, including performance and conduct. Payment will 
usually be determined and paid in cash at the normal time.

prior years
Deferred bonus will be forfeit in the event of termination for gross misconduct.
In the case of death it will be paid in full to the estate as soon as practicable thereafter . 
In other circumstances, it may be paid at the normal time at the committee’ s discretion depending on the 
circumstances of termination.
Performance 
Share Plan
All unvested awards will lapse on leaving in the event of termination for gross misconduct or other ‘bad leaver’ 
circumstances and any investment shares will be released. An example of a ‘bad leaver’ would be an individual 
resigning in order to take up a position with a competitor .
Awards will immediately vest in full in the event of death. 
In other cases, unvested basic awards will be pro-rated for service, which may include any period for which payment 
was made in lieu. Provided the associated investment shares remain lodged, matched awards will normally 
be retained in full unless the committee decide to pro-rate for service. A further reduction may be made at the 
committee’s discretion to take account of relevant circumstances at the time of leaving. The retained awards will 
vest in the normal way , taking account of the relevant performance conditions, and at the normal time subject to 
the committee being satisfied at that time that the individual remains a good leaver . AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 68
Other Redundancy pay in line with statutory provisions or those applying to employees generally in the country in which 
the director is based will be provided in the event of termination due to redundancy .
The cost of legal, tax or other advice incurred by the individual in connection with the termination and/or support 
with seeking alternative employment may be met up to a maximum of £100,000.
Additional payments may be made where required to settle legal disputes or as consideration for new or amended 
post-employment restrictions.
Where an individual is in receipt of relocation or expatriation benefits, the costs of actual expenses incurred in 
relation to any arrangements that are subject to term contracts may continue to be reimbursed for up to six 
months or , at the company’s discretion, a one-off payment made to cover the costs of premature cancellation. 
The cost of repatriation will also be covered where this was part of the original expatriation terms.
Sharesave options lapse unless the director leaves because of specified good leaver reasons in which case 
they can be exercised for a limited period, to the extent of savings made to the date of exercise.
Samir Brikho and Ian McHoul are both employed under contracts (dated April 2007 and September 2008 respectively) with 
notice periods of twelve months from the company and which require them to give six months ’ notice of resignation. The 
contracts permit for payment to be made in lieu of all or part of the required notice period at the company’ s discretion but 
there is no prescribed methodology for calculating such payment in lieu or applying mitigation. Should circumstances 
arise where notice is given and the executive is not required to work all or part of the notice period, the terms of the 
existing contracts would be honoured. The individuals may be placed on garden leave for part of the notice period in which 
case the committee may determine that it is appropriate to pay an element of bonus for that garden leave period.
Existing directors’ service contracts
The notice provisions for Samir Brikho and Ian McHoul are described above. There are no specified  
change-of-control provisions. 
The Chairman’ s engagement may be terminated on six months’ notice on either side. 
The contracts of non-executive directors may be terminated by the individual at any time. There are no specific 
provisions for compensation in the event of early termination by the company . As noted on page 80, our practice is that 
all directors submit themselves for re-election on an annual basis, in line with the recommendations in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in company and shareholder views
Our approach to the annual review of base salaries is to take account of personal performance, company performance, 
and pay levels more broadly within the company . The increases for 2014 are within the range of increases awarded to 
AMEC staff in the UK generally . External benchmarking is also taken into account, particularly for new appointments.
Any proposals to change remuneration policy are considered against the ‘best practice’ guidelines produced by shareholder 
bodies and major shareholders are consulted directly when formulating any proposals for significant changes. The committee 
did consider these guidelines as well as representations made by certain individual shareholders in formulating its policy . 
There was no direct consultation with employees.
The Chairman of the company and the Chairman of the remuneration committee make themselves available at any time 
and also at each annual general meeting to discuss any issues raised. 
Differences in policy for directors compared to other employees
The structure of remuneration for executive directors is in line with other senior management. The primary differences 
compared to other employees are the structure of variable pay , which for senior management is in the form of 
performance-related incentives and for other employees is largely in the form of overtime and allowances reflecting 
the different emphases of the roles, and in the level of accrual under defined benefit arrangements.

Annual bonus measures and targets
The annual bonus plan will operate in much the same way as in 2013 and will be consistent with the policy described 
above. The following bonus measures and their weightings (maximum opportunity as a percentage of base salary) have 
been agreed for 2014. They reflect a range of financial and strategic measures that support the key strategic objectives of 
the company .

2014 targets against these measures are commercially sensitive and may be subject to revision so have not been disclosed. 
They will be disclosed retrospectively in next year’ s report to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at 
that time.
Long‑term incentive awards to be made in 2014
The Performance Share Plan will operate in the manner described in the policy set out above. The measures and their 
associated targets will be as follows:
Measure Threshold (25% vesting) Maximum (100% vesting)
TSR ranking Median Upper Quartile
EPS CAGR 5% 10%
The above EPS targets will be adjusted to reflect the proposed acquisition of Foster Wheeler AG, assuming it proceeds. 
The TSR comparator group will be the same as for the 2013 awards described on page 74. The matching ratio is two 
for one. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 70

Notes
1   Fixed pay is base salary for 2014 plus the value of pension and benefits. The value of pension and benefits in kind is taken from the single total 
figure of remuneration for 2013.
2  On target performance is the level of performance required to deliver 66.67 per cent of the maximum annual bonus excluding the additional 
stretch element and 50 per cent of the full PSP award.
3  Maximum performance would result in the maximum bonus payment including the additional stretch element and 100 per cent vesting of 
PSP award.
4  PSP values ignore any change in share price or dividend equivalents.
 
Changes to Chairman’ s and non‑executive directors’ fees
The fee for the Chairman has been increased from 1 January 2014 in line with the percentage increases awarded 
to executive directors. Non-executive director fees have been increased in line with market.

lunches and tax return preparation assistance. Samir Brikho’s 2013 figure includes an adjustment of circa £24,000 for 
prior years in respect of healthcare cover provided for his dependants.
The Sharesave figure for Ian McHoul is the gain made on exercising an option over 1,512 shares made under the 
Savings-related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave) at an option price of £6.00. The closing share price on the date 
of exercise, 3 May 2013, was £10.25, resulting in a gain on exercise of £6,426.

for exchange rate movements and cost of share based payments: the target and actual figures shown above are before any such adjustments
‘Other strategic objectives’ measures for the Chief Executive included actions to embed the new geographic structure, 
accelerate the development of activity in the Growth Regions, grow through acquisition, achieve appropriate settlements 
and cost savings, and safety leadership. For the CFO they included development and implementation of shared services 
and IT systems, achieving cost savings and delivering performance from the Investment Services activities. The committee 
has discretion to take other factors into account and uses its judgement in determining the amount to be paid under this item.
None of the bonus earned for 2013 is subject to compulsory deferral, as the EBIT A additional stretch minimum target 
was not met. 
The original EBIT A targets were adjusted to remove a provision for contribution from small acquisitions, following a change 
of priorities.
Performance Share Plan
The L TIP amount shown in the 2013 ‘ single total figure of remuneration’ on page 71 is the award made under the 
Performance Share Plan in 2011. Vesting does not take place until April 2014 and is subject to two performance conditions 
each measured over three-year periods: (i) earnings per share (EPS*) growth between 2010 and 2013 and (ii) total 
shareholder return relative to a comparator group based on average share prices in the first quarter of 2014 compared 
to those in the corresponding period in 2011 (also subject to the committee being satisfied that there has been sustained 
financial growth of the company). The two performance conditions operate independently on different parts of the award: 
half of the basic award is dependent on EPS and the other half on TSR; the matched award depends solely on EPS.
*  EPS for this measure means the diluted earnings per share expressed to one decimal place of AMEC plc before goodwill and intangible 
amortisation, the charge or credits associated with executive share awards and exceptional items. ‘Real ’ growth means in excess of the 
change in the UK Retail Prices Index for December 2013 compared to December 2010.
The committee took account of the share buyback that took place during 2012 and 2013 in determining the outcome for 
the EPS element. As the performance period for the TSR element has not yet been completed at the time of writing of this 
report, an estimated outcome has been used based on the average share price in the period 1 January to 31 January 2014. 
The performance achieved against the EPS target and the estimated TSR outcome are as follows:
2011 awards performance measure
Threshold –  
25% vesting
Maximum –

The number of shares vesting based on the performance outcomes will be increased by 11.2 per cent to take account 
of reinvested dividends during the period from award to vesting. As the awards have not yet vested, the average share 
price in the final quarter of 2013 (£11.19) has been applied to the estimated vesting percentage to determine the value 
of the L TIP amount included in the ‘single figure’ as set out below:

The actual vesting outcome and value may be different to this and will be confirmed in next year’ s report. These awards 
were originally made as restricted shares but were amended during 2013 to be awards in the form of nil cost options with 
an 18-month exercise period post-vesting. If the option has not been exercised before the end of that period, it will be 
exercised automatically at that stage.
The L TIP amount shown in the 2012 ‘ single total figure of remuneration’ on page 71 is the award made under the Performance 
Share Plan in 2010 that vested in April 2013. The performance measures for these awards were the same as for those 
made in 2011 but in this case the full award was subject to both EPS and TSR (each applying to half of the award) and 
there was no adjustment for reinvested dividends. The targets set and the outcomes against them were as follows:

The TSR comparator group for the 2010 awards comprised 30 UK companies, including AMEC, listed in relevant FTSE 
sub-sectors with market capitalisations spanning that of AMEC. For 2011, the group was amended to include a number 
of non-UK listed companies who are direct business competitors of AMEC and to exclude UK companies where there is 
little or no overlap in activities and comprised 28 companies including AMEC. Details of the specific companies included

Half of the basic award is subject to a TSR performance condition and the other half and all of the matched award is 
subject to an EPS performance condition. 
The TSR measure is based on AMEC’s ranking against the comparator group set out below based on the average share 
price over the final quarter of 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2012. The threshold for any vesting to occur 
is that AMEC needs to be ranked at median or higher . If upper quartile ranking is achieved, full vesting will occur . Vesting 
is on a straight line basis between these threshold and maximum targets.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 
The EPS measure is based on the compound annual growth in excess of UK RPI (real CAGR) to 2015 from an adjusted 
2012 base of 85.7 pence. EPS for this purpose is defined as the diluted earnings per share expressed to one decimal place 
of AMEC plc before goodwill and intangible amortisation, the charge or credits associated with executive share awards and 
exceptional items (at the committee’s discretion). The adjustment took account of the share buyback and an accounting 
standard change. Threshold (25 per cent) vesting will occur if real CAGR is 5 per cent and maximum (100 per cent) vesting 
will occur if real CAGR is 12 per cent or higher with straight line vesting for a result between these targets.
The number of shares vesting as determined by the performance conditions outcomes will be increased to take account 
of reinvested dividends including the UK tax credit in the period between award and vesting.
Payments to former directors
Apart from the 42,552 shares received by Neil Bruce under the PSP (referred to on page 73) no payments (including 
payments for loss of office) were made to former directors.

Guidelines are in place requiring executive directors and members of the group management team to build up, normally 
over a three-year period, and retain a holding of AMEC shares received from incentive plans or purchased by them. The 
level of targeted shareholding is 250 per cent of salary for executive directors and 125 per cent for other senior executives. 
Based on the average share price and salaries during December 2013, the legally-owned shares shown above represented 
the following percentages of base salary which are both considerably in excess of the shareholding requirement:

Leadership continued
Board composition 
As at 31 December 2013, the board comprised the 
non-executive Chairman; two executive directors (the 
Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer); and five 
non-executive directors. Details of the directors, including 
their biographies, other significant commitments and 
committee memberships can be found on pages 48 and 49. 
Membership of the board
The balance of executive and non-executive directors, 
reinforced by adherence to sound governance procedures, 
ensures no one individual, or group of individuals, 
dominates the board’ s decision-making process. The 
varied backgrounds and commercial experience of the 
non-executive directors, and their independence from 
management, ensures rigorous debate at meetings 
and the constructive challenge and oversight of the 
executive directors in relation to the strategic direction 
and performance of the group. 
Experience of the board
Number of board  
directors with experience  
in each topic
The board receives a presentation on succession planning 
by the Group HR Director each year . In 2013, this took place 
in April. The board is increasingly mindful of the need to 
maintain an appropriately diverse balance of skills and 
experience both at, and directly below, board level to ensure 
the delivery of the group’s strategy and performance. 
The company’s articles of association require all directors 
to seek re-election by shareholders at the AGM following 
their initial appointment and every three years thereafter . 
However , in line with the recommendations of the Code, 
our practice is that all directors submit themselves for 
re-election on an annual basis. All of the directors wishing 
to continue serving, and considered eligible by the board, 
will offer themselves for re-election at the 2014 AGM. 
 m
Details of the directors ’ service contracts, emoluments and share 
interests are set out in the remuneration report on page 62 to 77 
Directors’ tenure as at 31 December 2013
Attendance at meetings
The board holds six regular meetings throughout the year , 
scheduled in accordance with an annual timetable. 
Additional board meetings and telephone conferences are 
held as required to deal with specific issues. 
Directors are expected to attend all scheduled board and 
relevant committee meetings, unless they are prevented 
from doing so by unavoidable prior business commitments 
or other valid reasons. All directors are provided with full 
papers in advance of each meeting. In 2013 these were 
provided electronically for the first time. Where a director is 
unable to attend a meeting, they are encouraged to discuss 
any issues arising with the Chairman or Chief Executive as 
appropriate. All board directors attended all scheduled 
board meetings in 2013, as can be seen below.

In addition there were seven unscheduled board meetings 
called at short notice to consider matters such as the 
proposed Foster Wheeler acquisition. At least one 
scheduled meeting each year takes place away from 
AMEC’ s head office in London. This provides the board 
with an opportunity to understand more about AMEC’s 
business and to meet employees based locally . In June 2013 
the board meeting took place in Calgary , AB, Canada and 
involved a visit to AMEC’ s activities in the oil sands. 
In addition to the matters reserved for the board, certain 
items are considered at every scheduled board meeting.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 
These include financial results, progress against the 
short-range plan, health and safety reports and strategy 
performance reviews. The Chief Executive updates the 
board on market trends, developments and opportunities, 
the competitive positioning of the company and its 
current priorities.
Business unit management is regularly invited to present 
at board meetings. In 2013, the board received presentations 
from the Group Presidents of Europe and the Americas 
and also presentations from the mark et leaders in oil & gas, 
clean energy , environment & infrastructure and mining.
The board holds a separate additional meeting each year 
to perform a full strategic review of the group. In October 
2013, the board spent a day focused on the group’s 
strategic priorities and those of its four markets and the 
growth opportunities in the longer term, beyond 2015.
The Chairman and Chief Executive 
The company does not combine the roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive. There is a clear and well established 
division of accountability and responsibility between the 
roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive and these are 
set out in writing and have been agreed by the board. 
The consequence of this clear division of responsibility 
at the head of the company is such that no individual has 
unfettered powers of decision. Since the change in 
organisational structure announced in 2012, the Chief 
Executive has had more direct involvement in the business. 
The Chairman has continued to ensure that the level of 
challenge at board meetings is appropriately matched to 
this widening in the Chief Executive’s role. The Chairman 
and Chief Executive are committed to ensuring the 
development and maintenance of an effective and trusting 
relationship with the appropriate balance between 
challenge and support.
The Chairman is principally responsible for the leadership 
and effectiveness of the board. At a high level, he is 
accountable for facilitating constructive relations between, 
and the participation of, all board members, so as to 
encourage a culture of openness and debate and enable 
the board to fulfil all aspects of its role. The Chairman has 
undertaken to ensure that the board discharges its duties 
to promote the success of the company , and to guide 
AMEC’ s business and conduct in accordance with the 
highest ethical standards. In setting the agenda for board 
meetings, the Chairman ensures sufficient time is 
available for discussion and meaningful challenge of all 
matters, particularly strategy , performance, value creation 
and accountability . 
The Chief Executive’s principal responsibility is running 
AMEC’ s businesses with the primary objective of creating 
shareholder value. Consistent with this objective, the 
Chief Executive has ultimate responsibility for the proposal, 
development and implementation of the group’ s strategy . 
The building and maintenance of an effective executive 
management team, and the allocation of responsibility 
therein, are key components of, and essential to, the 
performance of the Chief Executive’ s role. 
The Chief Executive takes the lead role in the promotion 
of AMEC, gives personal leadership to the preservation 
of AMEC’ s culture and values and encourages the 
highest standards of safety , security , health and 
environmental performance. 
Senior Independent Director 
Tim Faithfull has acted as the board’ s Senior Independent 
Director since 13 May 2009. He was selected for the role 
on account of his extensive experience of serving as both 
an executive and non-executive director . Following Tim’ s 
retirement after the forthcoming AGM, Simon Thompson 
will take on this role. Simon was considered by the 
nominations committee and the board to be the most 
appropriate candidate on account of his significant 
knowledge of AMEC and its operations and his experience 
as a director of international companies in sectors that are 
relevant to AMEC. In anticipation of taking on the role, 
Simon has confirmed that he is committed to regular 
interaction with shareholders to ensure their views are 
sought and taken into account. The Senior Independent 
Director is responsible for:
 
providing additional support to, and acting as a sounding 
board for , the Chairman
 
acting as an additional channel of communication 
between the Chairman and the other directors
 
being available to shareholders for concerns they may 
have that have not been resolved through the normal 
channels of the Chairman, Chief Executive or other 
executive directors, or which are not appropriate to 
raise through these channels
 
acquiring an objective understanding of the issues and 
concerns of AMEC’s shareholders through attendance 
at a sufficient number of meetings with the company’ s 
major shareholders and financial analysts
 
at least annually establishing the views of the 
non-executive directors as to the performance 
of the Chairman

Leadership continued
Non‑executive directors 
The non-executive directors are crucial in bringing an 
external view and wide range of skills, experience, 
expertise and diversity of views to the board’s deliberations 
and the development of strategy . They constructively 
challenge and scrutinise the performance of management 
against agreed objectives and provide an invaluable 
contribution to the work of the board’s committees. The 
board benefits greatly from the contribution and balance 
they bring. T o ensure this continues, the Chairman holds 
meetings with the non-executive directors, without the 
executive directors present, immediately following most 
scheduled board meetings.
The board’s policy is that non-executive director 
appointments are normally for three consecutive three-
year terms, subject to assessment by the nominations 
committee after the end of each term. The committee 
makes recommendations on reappointment to the board. 
Prior to appointment and on any material changes, the 
external commitments of each non-executive director , 
including those of the Chairman, are reviewed. During the 
year , Linda Adamany was appointed as a non-executive 
director of Coeur Mining, Inc and Tim Faithfull became a 
non-executive director of ICE Futures Europe and LIFFE 
Administration and Management. In accordance with the 
board’s policy to ensure that non-executive directors are 
not conflicted and are able to commit sufficient time 
to meet their duties and responsibilities to AMEC, the 
prospective appointments were disclosed to the board 
for approval. In neither case was it considered that 
the external appointment would have a detrimental 
effect. Each director’s undertaking as to their ongoing 
commitment to the role, together with an assessment 
of their continued independence, is reviewed as part 
of their annual performance evaluation. 
AMEC’ s non-executive directors are not employed by the 
company in any capacity , nor have they been in the past. 
The letters of appointment of the non-executive directors 
are available for inspection at the company’ s registered 
office by request to the Company Secretary and will be 
available for inspection at the company’ s forthcoming AGM. 
Conflicts of interest
The board has procedures in place for the disclosure 
and review of conflicts of interest. Prior to appointment, 
director-elects provide information on any conflicts of 
interest, and thereafter any potential conflicts of interest 
are considered at the start of each board meeting. 
Accordingly , each director is aware of their responsibility 
to avoid a situation where they have an actual or potential 
conflict of interest, the requirement to keep the same 
under review and inform the Chairman and Company 
Secretary of any change in their situation. An effective 
procedure is in place for the board to authorise conflict 
situations, should they arise, in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and the company’ s articles 
of association. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for keeping 
appropriate records, including the scope, of any 
authorisations granted by the board, and ensures 
the board undertakes regular reviews of conflict 
authorisations. 
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external 
appointments without the prior approval of the board. 
In March 2013, Samir Brikho was appointed as an 
independent non-executive director of Skandinaviska 
Enskilda Banken AB. Prior to accepting the appointment, 
the board reviewed the nature of the position and time 
commitment required and concluded that it would not 
adversely impact on his ability to fulfil his role as Chief 
Executive of AMEC. 
No conflicts of interest arose in 2013. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 83

Effectiveness
Professional development 
A comprehensive induction programme is in place for 
all new directors which takes into account their previous 
experience, background and role on the board and is 
designed to further their knowledge and understanding 
of the group and their associated role and responsibilities. 
All new directors are provided with key board, operational 
and financial information; attend meetings with other 
members of the board, senior management and their 
extended teams; receive briefings on their legal and 
regulatory responsibilities as directors and the approach 
to governance within AMEC; and, where possible, meet 
AMEC’ s major shareholders. Where a new director is to 
serve on a board committee, induction material relevant 
to the committee is also provided. The Company Secretary 
assists the Chairman in the co-ordination of induction 
and ongoing training. The Chairman endeavours to review 
the training and development needs of the directors at 
least annually .
No new board directors were appointed in 2013. 
Ongoing training, relevant to each director’s individual 
development needs, continues after appointment. The aim 
is to ensure the further enhancement of their skills and 
knowledge of the business, so they continue to effectively 
fulfil their role on the board and its committees. Internally 
facilitated training is arranged by the Company Secretary 
on topics and issues relevant to the operation of the board 
and responsibilities of the directors. Use is also made of 
external auditor and advisor training programmes. 
Individually the directors also from time to time attend 
seminars and conferences related to their areas of 
expertise and responsibility . 
The board receives presentations from management on 
changes and significant developments in the business. 
At the December 2013 board meeting, the Group HSSE 
Director gave a presentation on HSSE matters and security 
risk management. 
The board also receives regular updates on changes 
in legislation and regular communications from the 
Company Secretary’s office on key developments in 
corporate governance. 
T o further develop the directors’ understanding of the 
group’s operations and culture, the board undertakes 
visits to various places of AMEC business. As previously 
mentioned, the board visited a Canada-based oil sands 
project site in 2013.
Evaluation 
In line with the recommendations of the Code, each year 
a formal performance evaluation review is undertaken of 
the board, its committees and the directors individually . 
In 2012, the evaluation process was undertaken externally 
by the Inzito Partnership, an independent party , which had 
no other connection with the company . In 2013, the 
performance evaluation was conducted internally with the 
assistance of the Company Secretary .
This involved the completion by each director of a 
questionnaire designed to establish their perceptions in 
areas such as the current composition of the board; board 
dynamics and the relationships between board members; 
the effectiveness of the board’ s processes and its interaction 
with its committees; the quality and sources of information 
presented to the board; the board’ s oversight of operational 
matters; and the support available from the Company 
Secretary . Views were also sought on the sufficiency of 
strategic and risk oversight afforded to the board and on 
the level of interaction and engagement with shareholders. 
The responses were analysed by the Company Secretary and 
a report of the issues raised was prepared for discussion 
by the board at its June 2013 meeting. In summary , 
the results were positive and demonstrated sustained 
progress against the outcomes of the 2012 evaluation 
process. Areas for improvement were again relatively 
minor and included the following:
 
Whilst satisfied with the current composition and 
collective performance, the board is aware it would be 
beneficial to appoint additional board members who 
would complement and strengthen the existing skill set 
and experiences, and so further improve board diversity 
and the effective discharge of their duties 
 
One key area of focus remains increased interaction 
on strategy and engagement with the group presidents 
of the three business units, to allow greater oversight 
of the direction and effectiveness of the new 
organisational structure
 
In considering the future shape of the business, 
the greater prioritisation of management development 
and succession planning was also agreed. 
In accordance with the terms of the Code, the next 
externally facilitated board evaluation review will be 
undertaken no later than 2015. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 84
Effectiveness continued Accountability
Evaluation continued
In addition and as required by the Code, during the year the 
Senior Independent Director , having taken the views of the 
non-executive and the executive directors, reviewed the 
performance of the Chairman. The Senior Independent 
Director met with the Chairman in February 2014, to review 
his performance during 2013. The Chief Executive 
conducts annual performance development reviews with 
his direct reports.
Information and support 
The Company Secretary is fundamental in ensuring the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the board and is responsible 
for ensuring that the directors have timely access to full,  
accurate and relevant information. Agendas and supporting 
papers for board and committee meetings are circulated 
approximately one week prior to the meeting date to allow 
sufficient time for review to enable informed debate and 
challenge at meetings. Where the directors, particularly 
non-executive directors, require further insight on an issue, 
the Company Secretary will facilitate this from the business 
or relevant members of the senior management team. 
Members of senior management are regularly invited to 
attend board meetings to present on specific projects and 
issues. The Company Secretary ensures that the correct 
board procedures are followed and that the board is informed 
on legislative, regulatory and governance matters related 
to its operation. In addition to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary , a formal process exists for the directors 
to obtain independent professional advice, at the company’ s 
expense, where appropriate and necessary to discharge 
their responsibilities. The Company Secretary is responsible 
for the organisation and co-ordination of access to such 
advice. The Company Secretary is also accountable for 
ensuring that an accurate record is taken of all meetings 
of the board and its committees. If a director had a concern 
about the running of the company or a proposed action 
that could not be resolved, this would be recorded in the 
minutes. In addition, upon resignation, should a director 
have any such outstanding concerns, they would be invited 
to provide the Chairman with a written statement for 
circulation to the board. There were no director resignations 
during the year . The appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary is one of the matters reserved for 
the board.
Internal control
The board is responsible for reviewing AMEC’ s systems of 
internal control. The reviews cover the effectiveness and 
adequacy of financial, operational, compliance and risk 
management systems and are undertaken regularly . 
These systems can, however , only provide reasonable 
assurance against material misstatement or loss, as they 
are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives.
The board and its committees have an ongoing process 
that is reviewed regularly by the board and accords with the 
Turnbull guidance, for identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant risks faced by AMEC, including strategy , major 
projects to be undertaken, significant acquisitions and 
disposals, as well as entry into and exit from different 
markets. This process has been in place for the year under 
review and up to the date of approval of this report. Where 
appropriate, business decisions are reached following a 
structured and documented review of potential 
opportunities and threats, taking steps designed to 
manage or mitigate any risk exposure. 
The threats and opportunities associated with tender 
submissions are reviewed by commercial review boards 
at various levels in the group, in line with delegated 
authorities. The highest value tenders are, in addition, 
reviewed by the tender review committee. AMEC applies 
a set of contracting principles, under which the level 
of approval required is dependent on the contractual 
provision in question. The most significant issues in terms 
of risk require the approval of the relevant business unit 
lead and the Group Commercial Director . 
The internal control processes are complemented by an 
annual control self-assessment exercise carried out by 
the principal businesses. This covers health, safety and 
environment, legal, commercial and contractual, financial, 
information technology and human resources. The results 
are reviewed by the board, through the audit committee, 
as part of the ongoing internal control monitoring process.
AMEC has interests in a number of joint arrangements 
where controls may not be reviewed as part of AMEC’ s 
formal corporate governance process because of the joint 
management responsibilities. Responsibility for such 
reviews rests with the joint venture and joint operations 
boards and these are reviewed from time to time as part 
of AMEC’ s normal internal audit process.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 
Risk management process
A consistently applied methodology is used at project, 
operating company and group levels to identify the key 
risks that could have a significant impact on the ability 
of AMEC to achieve its objectives. These are recorded 
in risk registers and evaluated to determine the likely 
impact and probability of occurring. 
Control actions are developed to mitigate or eliminate 
risks that are considered unacceptable. Risk owners 
are identified and given responsibility for ensuring 
actions are implemented with appropriate review dates.
The risk registers are reviewed and updated at least 
quarterly with the relevant risk owners.
Reporting and monitoring
Reporting directly to the board, the risk management 
committee is chaired by the Chief Executive and meets 
at least twice each year to:
 
 review risk management policies, procedures 
and processes
 
 review the AMEC plc risk register and make 
recommendations as appropriate
 

Relations with shareholders
The executive directors and senior management undertake 
an extensive programme of meetings with institutional 
shareholders during each year . Events such as results 
presentations and other capital market events are webcast 
and made available on our website for those unable to 
attend in person.
Each year , the Chairman and Senior Independent Director 
write to all major shareholders, reminding them that they 
are available for meetings or telephone calls with them, as 
required. John Connolly wrote such a letter in March 2013 
and as a result, five meetings were arranged.
Major UK-based shareholders were invited to join the 
Chairman for an informal lunch in London in December 
2013. Representatives from four institutions accepted the 
invitation and contributed to interesting and wide-ranging 
discussions. The Chairman and the Senior Independent 
Director attend full-year results presentations.
Ad-hoc requests from shareholders for meetings with 
members of the board are facilitated by the investor 
relations team. 
An in-depth perception study of investors ’ views undertaken 
by Clare Williams Associates, an independent third party , 
was presented to the board in February 2013. The results 
of the study were unsurprising, with investors seeking 
greater clarity on how the company’ s cash was to be used. 
The meeting was also attended by the company’ s brokers. 
The board also receives unedited feedback reports 
following shareholder meetings and all material brokers ’ 
research notes on the company .

The following significant agreements contain provisions 
entitling the counterparties to exercise termination or 
other rights in the event of a change of control of 
the company:
Under a £377,000,000 five year multi-currency revolving 
credit facility agreement dated 18 July 2012 and a 
£100,000,000 one year sterling term loan facility dated 
9 April 2013 between, amongst others, the company 
and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (as facility agent for 
both facilities), the company must promptly notify the 
facility agent if it becomes aware of any change of control. 
Following such notice the lenders will negotiate with the 
company for a period of 30 days with a view to agreeing 
terms and conditions acceptable to the company and all 
the lenders for continuing the facilities.
If agreement is not reached by the end of the 30-day 
period, if a lender so requires, the facility agent must, by 
notice of not less than 30 days to the company , cancel the 
commitments of that lender and declare the participations 
of that lender in all outstanding loans together with accrued 
interest and all other amounts accrued under the facilities 
to be immediately due and payable.

persons acting in concert gains control of the company .

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
in respect of the annual report and 
the accounts
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report and the consolidated and parent company accounts, 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law r equir es the dir ectors to pr epar e consolidated 
and parent company accounts for each financial year . 
Under that law the directors are required to prepare the 
consolidated accounts in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company accounts in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
consolidated and parent company accounts unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the group and parent company and of their 
profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the consolidated and parent 
company accounts, the directors are required to: 
 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently 
 
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
 
for the consolidated accounts, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by 
the EU
 
for the parent company accounts, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the parent company accounts and 
 
prepare the consolidated and parent company 
accounts on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the consolidated and 
the parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the parent company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the parent company and enable them to ensure that its 
accounts comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general r esponsibility for taking such steps as ar e r easonabl y 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 
Opinion on consolidated accounts
In our opinion the consolidated accounts:
 
give a true and fair view of the state of the group’ s 
affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of its profit for the 
year then ended;
 
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and 
 
have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and 
article 4 of the IAS regulation.
Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
We identified the following risks that we believed would 
have the greatest impact on our overall audit strategy; 
the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team: 
 
Revenue recognition on contracts and valuation of 
gross amounts due from customers and receivables;
 
Adequacy of contract and other provisions;
 
Adequacy of legacy liabilities;
 
Valuation of pension assets and liabilities;
 
Risk of fraud and management override;
 
Adequacy of taxation provisions;
 
Presentation of discontinued operations;
 
Recognition and presentation of research and 
development government credits.
Our application of materiality
We determined materiality for the group to be £15 million 
(2012: £15 million), which is approximately 5% (2012: 5%) 
of pre-tax profit for the year adjusted for exceptional 
items. This provided a basis for determining the nature, 
timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, 
identifying and assessing the risk of material 
misstatement and determining the nature, timing and 
extent of further audit procedures.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with 
our assessment of the overall control environment, 
our judgement is that performance materiality was 75% 
(2012: 75%) of our materiality , namely £11.25 million 
(2012: £11.25 million). Our objective in adopting this 
approach was to ensure that uncorrected and undetected 
audit differences in all accounts did not exceed our 
planning materiality level.
We have audited the consolidated accounts of AMEC plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the 
related notes 1 to 28. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, 
as a body , in accordance with Chapter 3 of part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body , for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 90, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the consolidated accounts and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
consolidated accounts in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’ s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the 
consolidated accounts
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the consolidated accounts sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the consolidated accounts 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error . This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the consolidated accounts. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited consolidated accounts and to identify 
any information that is materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us 
in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

Registered number 1675285 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 92
Independent auditors’ report to the members of AMEC plc continued
Registered number 1675285
We consider these to be the key judgemental areas 
driving the recognition of revenue and margins in respect 
of long term contracts. We also assessed whether 
management’ s policies and processes for making these 
estimates continue to be robust and are applied 
consistently to all contracts. 
Adequacy of contract and other provisions 
/Adequacy of legacy liabilities
We challenged and applied professional scepticism 
to judgements and accounting treatments made 
by management arising from contractual disputes 
and other risks. We performed audit procedures on 
supporting calculations and assumptions to challenge 
whether these are appropriate in the circumstances and 
in line with the group’ s accounting policies as well as the 
requirements of IFRS. Where appropriate we have held 
discussions with management’ s legal experts. 
Valuation of pension assets and liabilities
We challenged the key actuarial assumptions used by 
management to determine the defined benefit pension 
accounting position. This included holding discussions 
with the external actuary used to value the schemes. 
We also performed audit procedures on the input data 
used by the actuary in the valuations and the disclosures 
made in the consolidated accounts. 
Risk of fraud and management override 
Procedures included analytical procedures and journal 
entry testing in order to identify and address the risk of 
management override of controls. We designed testing 
procedures and thresholds for all balances in such a way 
as to ensure that the risk of fraud and error is mitigated.
Adequacy of taxation provisions 
We challenged and applied professional scepticism to 
tax exposures estimated by management and the risk 
analysis associated with these exposures along with 
claims or assessments made by tax authorities to date. 
We performed audit procedures on the calculation and 
disclosure of deferred tax to assess compliance with local 
tax rules and the group’ s accounting policies including 
the impact of complex items such as management’ s 
assessment of the likelihood of the recoverability of 
deferred tax assets. These assessments relate to the 
accuracy of management forecasts and the time period 
over which assets are likely to be recovered. 
Our application of materiality continued
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to them corrected and uncorrected audit differences 
in excess of £0.5 million (2012: £0.5 million), as well 
as differences below that threshold that in our view 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit scope focussed on three operating units, 
all of which were subject to a full scope audit for the year 
ended 31 December 2013. An additional seven operating 
units were selected for specific scope audit procedures 
where the extent of audit work was based on our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of 
the materiality of those locations to the group’s business 
operations. T ogether with the group functions which were 
also subject to a full or specific scope audit for the year 
ended 31 December 2013, these locations represent the 
principal business units of the group and account for 91% 
of the group’s revenue, 95% of the group’s profit before tax, 
and 91% of the group’s total assets.
Audits of these locations are performed at a performance 
materiality level calculated with reference to a proportion 
of the group materiality appropriate to the relative scale 
and risk associated with each location. They are also selected 
to provide a basis for undertaking audit work to address 
the risks of material misstatement identified above.
The group audit team follows a programme of planned 
site visits that is designed to ensure that the Senior 
Statutory Auditor or his designate visits each full scope 
location at least once every other year on a rotational basis. 
This year , the group team visited two out of three full scope 
locations, reviewed key working papers, participated in the 
component team’s planning including the discussion of 
fraud and error , and attended the audit closing meetings 
for each full scope component.
The principal ways in which we responded to the risks 
identified above included:
Revenue recognition on contracts and 
valuation of gross amounts due from 
customers and receivables 
We performed audit procedures on the controls in place 
to assess the appropriate determination of the percentage 
completion of each significant contract. We challenged 
management in respect of the reasonableness of 
judgements made regarding the cost to complete 
estimate, the timing of recognition of variation orders, 
the adequacy of contingency provisions to mitigate contract 
specific risks and their assessments around the potential 
for liquidated damages for projects behind schedule.  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 93

and on the information in the Directors ’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited. 
Hywel Ball (Senior statutory auditor)
for and on behalf of Ernst & Y oung LLP 
Statutory auditor , London
13 February 2014
Notes: 
1.  The maintenance and integrity of the AMEC plc web site is the 
responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors 
does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly , 
the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have 
occurred to the financial statements since they were initially 
presented on the web site. 
2.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions
Presentation of discontinued operations
We challenged and applied professional scepticism 
to judgements made by management in concluding 
that all relevant criteria had been met in order to classify 
the UK Conventional Power business as discontinued, 
in accordance with IFRS. We have also performed 
audit procedures on the disclosures made in the 
consolidated accounts.
Recognition and Presentation of research 
and development government credits
We challenged the appropriateness of the group’s 
accounting policy in respect of the classification of 
the US research and development government credits 
within operating profit rather than the tax expense line. 
As this presentation is judgemental owing to lack of 
specific guidance in IFRS and mixed practice amongst 
IFRS reporters in this area, we have agreed that the 
policy applied is appropriate. This policy is required for 
the first time this year .
Opinions on other matter prescribed 
by Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic 
Report and Directors Report for the financial year 
for which the consolidated accounts are prepared 
is consistent with the consolidated accounts. 
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to 
report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is: 
 
materially inconsistent with the information in the 
audited consolidated accounts; or
 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 
is otherwise misleading.
In particular , we are required to consider whether we 
have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider the annual report is fair , 
balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we 
communicated to the audit committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed.

charge of £4 million, resulting in a lower profit after tax 
of £15 million. Within the consolidated statement of other 
comprehensive income, the impact is an increase of 
£19 million to the actuarial gains on defined benefit schemes 
and an increase of £4 million in the tax on actuarial gains 
resulting in an increased total comprehensive income of 
£15 million. There is no impact on either the net retirement 
benefit liability or related deferred tax balance within the 
balance sheet. 
IAS 36 ‘Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-financial 
Assets ’ was amended in May 2013 to clarify certain 
disclosure requirements following the issue of IFRS 13 
‘Fair Value Measurement’. 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements ’ builds on 
existing principles by identifying the concept of control 
as the determining factor in whether an entity should be 
included within the consolidated accounts of the parent 
company . The standard provides additional guidance 
to assist in the determination of control where this is 
difficult to assess.
IFRS 11 ‘ Joint Arrangements ’ replaces IAS 31 ‘Interests 
in Joint Ventures ’. IFRS 11 considers the classification 
of joint arrangements in which two or more parties 
have joint control. Under IFRS 11, joint arrangements 
are classified as joint operations or joint ventures, 
depending on the rights and obligations of the parties 
to the arrangements.
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities ’ 
includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of 
interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, 
associates, special purpose vehicles and other off 
balance sheet vehicles. 
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ aims to improve 
consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise 
definition of fair value and a single source of fair value 
measurement and disclosure requirements for use 
across IFRS. 
Adoption of IAS 36 (revised), IFRS 10, 11, 12 and 13 have no 
impact on the group’ s reported results or financial position.
New standards, amendments and interpretations 
issued but not effective which have not been early 
adopted by the group
There are no IFRS, IAS amendments or IFRIC 
interpretations that are not yet effective that would be 
expected to have a material impact on the group.
1 Significant accounting policies
AMEC plc is a public limited company , which is listed 
on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and 
domiciled in the UK. 
Statement of compliance
The consolidated accounts include the accounts of 
AMEC plc (AMEC) and all of its subsidiaries made up 
to 31 December each year , and the group’s share of the 
profit after interest and tax and net assets of joint ventures 
based on the equity method of accounting.
In accordance with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002), 
the consolidated accounts of the group have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) adopted for use in the EU as at 
31 December 2013 (adopted IFRS), International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 
interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The company has elected to prepare its parent company 
accounts in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (UK GAAP); these are presented 
on pages 141 to 146.
Accounting standards adopted in the year
The following new accounting standards and amendments 
to existing standards have been adopted during the year .
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ was amended in June 2011. 
The impact on the group has been to replace interest cost 
and expected return on plan assets with a net interest 
amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate 
to the net defined benefit asset/liability .
The group’s reported results and financial position 
have been restated as a result of the adoption of IAS 19 
(2011). The impact on the results for the year ended 
31 December 2012 is an increase in cost of sales of 
£1 million, a reduction in net financing income 
of £12 million and a reduction in the income tax charge 
of £5 million, resulting in a lower profit after tax of 
£8 million. Within the consolidated statement of other 
comprehensive income, the impact is an increase of 
£13 million to the actuarial gains on defined benefit 
schemes and an increase of £5 million in the tax 
on actuarial gains resulting in an increased total 
comprehensive income of £8 million. There is no impact 
on either the net retirement benefit liability or related 
deferred tax balance within the balance sheet. 
The impact of IAS 19 (2011) on the results for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 has been a reduction in profit 
before tax of £19 million and a reduction in the income tax  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 101 
Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 
and for defined benefit pension schemes under IAS 19 
(revised) ‘Employee Benefits ’. In addition judgement 
has also been applied in determining the appropriate 
presentation of the UK conventional power business and 
certain research and development government credits.
A significant amount of the group’ s activities is undertaken 
via long-term contracts. These contracts are accounted 
for in accordance with IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts ’ 
which requires estimates to be made for contract costs 
and revenues.
Management bases its judgements of contract costs 
and revenues on the latest available information, which 
includes detailed contract valuations. In many cases 
the results reflect the expected outcome of long-term 
contractual obligations which span more than one 
reporting period. Contract costs and revenues are 
affected by a variety of uncertainties that depend 
on the outcome of future events and often need to be 
revised as events unfold and uncertainties are resolved. 
The estimates of contract costs and revenues are updated 
regularly and significant changes are highlighted through 
established internal review procedures. In particular , the 
internal reviews focus on the timing and recognition of 
incentive payments and the age and recoverability of any 
unagreed income from variations to the contract scope 
or claims. The impact of the changes in accounting 
estimates is then reflected in the ongoing results.
When accounting for provisions for litigation and other 
items the group has taken internal and external advice 
in considering known legal claims and actions made by 
or against the group. It carefully assesses the likelihood 
of success of a claim or action. Appropriate provisions 
are made for legal claims or actions against the group 
on the basis of likely outcome, but no provisions are 
made for those which, in the view of management, 
are unlikely to succeed. 
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for 
in accordance with the advice of independent qualified 
actuaries but significant judgements are required in 
relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension 
increases, discount rate, inflation and member life 
expectancy that underpin their valuations. For AMEC, 
these assumptions are important given the relative size 
of the schemes that remain open.
In accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for 
Sale and Discontinued Operations ’, the post-tax results 
of discontinued operations are disclosed separately in 
the consolidated income statement. 
1 Significant accounting policies continued
Basis of preparation
The accounts are presented in Sterling, rounded to the 
nearest million. All calculated numbers, for example 
earnings per share, are calculated on the underlying 
numbers to one decimal place precision. They are 
prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative 
financial instruments and retirement benefit assets and 
liabilities are stated at fair value.
During 2012, AMEC announced a new organisation 
structure, to be adopted on 1 January 2013, designed 
to more fully support the future needs of its customers. 
The group is now managed geographically and the 
segmental analysis, as presented in note 2, has been 
restated to reflect the new structure of Americas, Europe 
and Growth Regions, together with Investment Services.
For a number of years, AMEC has been taking a more 
selective approach to the bidding of contracts in the former 
Power and Process (P&P) division in the UK, most notably 
in the area of conventional power . During 2013, all 
revenue-generating activity ceased. The UK conventional 
power business was considered to be a major line of 
business and is now reported as a discontinued business 
and the 2012 comparatives have been restated accordingly .
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management 
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the 
results of which form the basis of making the judgements 
about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if 
the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods.
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement, 
and AMEC believes that the most critical accounting 
policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation 
arise from the accounting for long-term contracts under 
IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts ’ , for provisions under IAS 37 
‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’,  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 102
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
The aggregate of the group’ s share of profit or loss of a 
joint venture is shown on the face of the income statement 
and represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling 
interests in the joint venture.
Losses of a joint venture are recognised only to the extent 
of the group’ s interest in the joint venture, unless the 
group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the 
parties that have joint control of the arrangement have 
rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, 
relating to the arrangement.
When a group entity undertakes its activities under joint 
operations, the group as a joint operator recognises in 
relation to its interest in a joint operation:
 
its assets and liabilities, including its share of any 
assets and liabilities held jointly
 
its revenue from the sale of its share of the output 
arising from the joint operation
 
its share of the revenue from the sale of the output 
by joint operation
 
its expenses, including its share of any expenses 
incurred jointly .
Bid costs
Bid costs are expensed as incurred until the group 
is appointed as the preferred bidder . Subsequent to 
appointment as preferred bidder , bid costs are capitalised 
and held on the balance sheet provided the award of the 
contract is virtually certain and it is expected to generate 
sufficient net cash flow to allow recovery of the bid costs. 
Where bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, the 
proceeds are applied first against the balance of costs 
included in the balance sheet, with any additional 
amounts treated as deferred income and released 
to profit over the period of the contract.
Business combinations and goodwill
The purchase method is used to account for all 
business combinations.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the 
purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 January 2004 
is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both 
annually and when there are indications that its carrying 
value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is not amortised.
1 Significant accounting policies continued
Basis of preparation continued
Discontinued operations include the non-core Built 
Environment businesses, which were sold during 2007, 
SPIE, which was sold in 2006, and the UK conventional 
power business that was discontinued in 2013. The cash 
flows of discontinued operations are fully consolidated 
within AMEC up to the date of sale. The results and other 
disclosures in respect of discontinued operations are 
shown in note 9.
Going concern
The directors are satisfied that the group has adequate 
resources to operate for the foreseeable future. As at 
31 December 2013 the group held net cash of £121 million 
and had committed banking facilities of £477 million.
The group will finance operations and growth from 
its existing cash resources and its committed banking 
facilities. The group’s policy aims to ensure the constant 
availability of an appropriate amount of funding to meet 
both current and future forecast requirements consistent 
with the group’s budget and strategic plans.
Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless 
otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these consolidated accounts.
Basis of consolidation
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the 
parties that have joint control of the arrangement have 
rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control 
is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions about 
the relevant activities require unanimous consent of 
the parties sharing control.
The considerations made in determining joint control 
are similar to those necessary to determine control 
over subsidiaries.
The group’ s investments in its joint ventures are accounted 
for using the equity method. Under the equity method, 
the investment in a joint venture is initially recognised at 
cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted 
to recognise changes in the group’s share of net assets 
of the joint venture since the acquisition date. The results 
of the joint ventures are included in the consolidated 
accounts from the date the joint control commences until 
the date that it ceases. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 103 
Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution 
pension plans are recognised in the income statement 
as incurred.
Defined benefit plans
The group’ s net obligation in respect of defined benefit 
pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by 
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and 
prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its 
present value; and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid 
price) is deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at 
the balance sheet date on AA-rated corporate bonds that 
have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the 
group’ s obligations. The calculation is performed by a 
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate 
to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the year in which they arise.
Exceptional items
As permitted by IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial 
Statements ’, certain items are presented separately 
as exceptional on the face of the consolidated income 
statement. In the opinion of the directors, these 
exceptional items require separate disclosure by virtue 
of their nature, size or incidence in order to obtain a clear 
and consistent presentation of the group’ s underlying 
performance and to provide consistency with internal 
management reporting. Exceptional items may include, 
but are not restricted to: profits or losses arising on 
disposal of businesses or on closure of businesses; 
business restructuring charges; and profits or losses 
arising on the disposal of fixed assets. In addition, 
acquisition-related costs including transaction costs, 
changes in deferred consideration and elements of 
deferred compensation (those dependent on continued 
employment) which, in line with IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations ’, are required to be charged to the income 
statement are also classified as exceptional.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. 
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of 
the instrument.
Cash, bank deposits, borrowings and trade receivables 
and payables are held at amortised cost.
1 Significant accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
Cash comprises cash balances and deposits repayable 
on demand and available within one working day 
without penalty.
Cash equivalents are other deposits with a maturity period 
of three months or less from date of acquisition; convertible 
without an undue period of notice and not subject to a 
significant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of AMEC’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
In the consolidated balance sheet, bank overdrafts are 
shown within borrowings in current liabilities. 
Deposits with a maturity period of more than three 
months at inception are classified as bank deposits 
(more than three months).
Development expenditure
Expenditure that is directly attributable to the development 
of wind farm projects is recognised as an intangible asset 
when the group can demonstrate it is probable that the 
wind farm development will generate future economic 
benefits in excess of the amounts capitalised and other 
relevant criteria for capitalising such costs in accordance 
with IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ have been met.
Following initial recognition of the development 
expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when 
the wind farm development is complete and the asset is 
available for use. It is amortised over the period of expected 
future benefit. During the period of development, the asset 
is reviewed for impairment annually .
Discontinued operations and assets 
and liabilities held for sale
A discontinued operation is a separate major line of 
business or geographic area of operations that has 
either been disposed of, abandoned or is part of a plan 
to dispose of a major line of business or geographic area. 
An operation is classified as a discontinued operation 
in the year that the above criteria are met. 
Certain legacy settlements and r elevant pr ovision adjustments 
are allocated to discontinued operations when appropriate.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive 
payment is established. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 104
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
in the income statement except those arising on 
intra-group balances, settlement of which is neither 
planned nor probable to occur , which are recognised 
in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities are measured in terms of historical cost 
and are translated using the exchange rate at the date 
of the transaction.
On consolidation, the results of entities with a functional 
currency other than Sterling are translated into Sterling 
using a monthly average exchange rate. The net assets 
of such entities are translated into Sterling at the closing 
exchange rate.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign 
currency net investments and any foreign currency 
borrowings, or forward contracts used to hedge those 
investments, are taken to a translation reserve. They 
are recycled and recognised as a profit or loss on the 
disposal or closure of a business. The cumulative 
translation difference for all foreign operations was 
deemed to be zero as at 1 January 2004, the date of 
transition to adopted IFRS.
Impairment
The carrying values of all of the group’ s assets other than 
inventories, balances on long-term contracts and deferred 
tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If there are indications of an impairment in the carrying 
value then the recoverable amount is estimated and 
compared to the carrying amount. 
For goodwill and assets not yet available for use, 
the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance 
sheet date. An impairment loss is recognised to the 
extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
Intangible assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired by the group, which include 
software, customer relationships, trademarks and order 
backlogs, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. The cost of an intangible asset 
acquired in a business combination is fair value at date 
of acquisition.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on 
a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of 
intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.
The estimated lives of intangible assets held at 
31 December 2013 are as follows:
Software Three to seven years 
Customer relationships T wo to ten years 
Brand/trademarks Up to five years 
Other Up to six years
1 Significant accounting policies continued
Financial instruments continued
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially 
and subsequently at fair value. The gain or loss on 
re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in 
the income statement. However , where derivatives qualify 
for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain 
or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged. 
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is 
determined by reference to market values for similar 
financial instruments or by discounting the expected 
future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The sale and purchase of derivative financial instruments 
are non-speculative.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated 
as a hedge against the variability in cash flows of a 
recognised asset or liability , or a highly probable forecast 
transaction, any gain or loss on the effective part of the 
derivative financial instrument is recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated within the 
hedging reserve. The gain or loss on any ineffective 
portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging 
instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised. 
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in 
the hedging reserve remains there until the forecast 
transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss in the 
hedging reserve is transferred to the income statement in 
the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Foreign currencies
The group’s consolidated accounts are presented in 
Sterling, which is also the parent company’s functional 
currency . Each entity in the group determines its own 
functional currency and items included in the accounts of 
each entity are measured using that functional currency . 
An entity’s functional currency reflects the underlying 
transactions, events and conditions that are relevant to it.
At an individual entity level, transactions in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the entity are 
translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate 
ruling at the day of the transaction. Entities which have 
multiple foreign currency transactions apply the average 
rate for the month as an approximation of the exchange 
rate on the day of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into the functional currency at the rates 
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and any 
foreign exchange differences arising are recognised  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 105 
Overview Strategic report Governance Financials 
Net financing expense
Net financing expense comprises interest receivable 
on funds invested, interest payable, pension financing 
income, the unwinding of discounted balances and 
foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest income and 
interest payable are recognised in the income statement 
as they accrue, using the effective interest method.
Directly attributable finance costs are capitalised in the 
cost of purchased and constructed property , plant and 
equipment, until the relevant assets are brought into 
operational use.
Property , plant and equipment
Property , plant and equipment is measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses. The cost of property , plant and equipment as at 
1 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, 
was determined by reference to its fair value at that date.
Depreciation is provided on all property , plant and 
equipment, with the exception of freehold land, at rates 
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual 
value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its 
estimated useful life. Reviews are made annually of the 
estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual 
assets.
The estimated lives used are:
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years 
Leasehold land and buildings The shorter of the   
 lease term or 50 years 
Plant and equipment Mainly three to five years
Provisions for liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; 
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation.
The group has taken internal and external advice in 
considering known and reasonably likely legal claims 
and actions made by or against the group. It carefully 
assesses the likelihood of success of a claim or action. 
Appropriate provisions are made for legal claims or 
actions against the group on the basis of likely outcome, 
but no provisions are made for those which, in the view 
of management, are unlikely to succeed. These possible 
but not probable liabilities are disclosed in note 26 as 
contingent liabilities.
1 Significant accounting policies continued
Inventories
Inventories, including land held for and in the course 
of development, are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value.
Development land and work in progress is included at 
cost less any losses foreseen in completing and disposing 
of the development. Cost includes cost of acquisition and 
development to date, including directly attributable fees 
and expenses net of rental and other income attributable 
to the development.
Leases 
Operating lease costs, including incentives received, 
are charged to the income statement on a straight line 
basis over the period of the lease.
Long-term contracts
As soon as the outcome of a long-term contract can 
be estimated reliably , contract revenue and expenses 
are recognised in the income statement in proportion 
to the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of 
completion is assessed by reference to costs incurred to 
date as a percentage of total forecast costs. When the 
outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably , 
revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs 
incurred that it is probable will be recoverable, and contract 
costs are expensed as incurred. An expected loss on a 
contract is recognised immediately in the income 
statement.
Revenue in respect of variations to the contract scope 
and claims is recognised when it is probable that it will 
be received and is capable of being reliably measured. 
Incentive payments are recognised when a contract 
is sufficiently far advanced that it is probable that the 
required conditions will be met and the amount of the 
payment can be reliably measured.
The gross amounts due from customers under long-term 
contracts are stated at cost plus recognised profits, less 
provision for recognised losses and progress billings. 
These amounts are reported in trade and other receivables.
Payments on account in excess of the gross amounts due 
from customers are included in trade and other payables. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 106
Notes to the consolidated accounts continued
1 Significant accounting policies continued
Research and development government credits
The group claims research and development government 
credits in the UK, US and Canada. These are judged to 
have characteristics more akin to grants than income taxes 
and are offset against the relevant expenditure caption. 
Credits are recognised to the extent there is reasonable 
assurance they will be received which, given the necessary 
claims processes, can be some time after the original 
expense is incurred.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration 
received or receivable, excluding value added tax, for goods 
and services supplied to external customers. It includes 
the group’s share of revenue from work carried out under 
jointly controlled operations.
Revenue from services and construction contracts is 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of 
the contract, as set out in the accounting policy for 
long-term contracts.
Share-based payments
There are various share-based payment arrangements 
which allow AMEC employees to acquire AMEC shares; 
these awards are granted by AMEC. The fair value of 
awards granted is recognised as a cost of employment 
with a corresponding increase in equity . The fair value is 
measured at grant date and spread over the period during 
which the employees become unconditionally entitled to 
the award. The fair value of the award is measured using 
a valuation model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the awards were granted. The 
amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of shares that vest except where 
non-vesting is due to total shareholder return not 
achieving the threshold for vesting. 
T axation
Income tax expense comprises the sum of the current tax 
charge and the movement in deferred tax. 
Current tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable 
profit for the year using tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet 
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous years. T ax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in 
other comprehensive income or equity , in which case it 
is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity 
as appropriate.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
with deferred tax assets being recognised where it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. The carrying amount of 
deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date 
and adjustments made to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient profits will be available.
Assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
differences arise from the initial recognition (other than 
in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in 
a transaction that affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
joint ventures, except where the group is able to control 
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted to apply when 
the deferred tax asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
and it is intended that they will be settled on a net basis. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 107

2 Segmental analysis of continuing operations 
AMEC is a focused supplier of consultancy , engineering and project management services to customers in the world’ s 
oil and gas, mining, clean energy , and environment and infrastructure markets. Following a restructure in late 2012, 
the group’s results are now reported on a geographic, rather than divisional basis. This reflects the new structure, 
introduced to strengthen customer focus and so maximise potential growth opportunities. Each of the three 
geographies is considered to be a reportable segment.
AMEC’ s Chief Executive together with the senior management team constitute the chief operating decision maker and 
they regularly review the performance of these three geographies, as well as the Investment Services segment. Details 
of the services offered by each business unit and the end markets in which they operate are given in the strategic report 
in general and specifically by business unit on pages 35 to 38.

and give a pre-tax exceptional loss on disposals of £6 million.
There were additional litigation provisions of £9 million offset by releases of £2 million in respect of businesses closed 
in a prior year and classified as continuing.
Exceptional costs of £18 million in continuing operations includes £14 million restructuring costs associated with the 
management reorganisation into geographic business units and transaction costs of £4 million which, in line with IFRS 3, 
are charged to the income statement.
A tax provision of £16 million has been established for potential withholding tax following a group restructuring that

A loss on disposals of £11 million arose from adjustments to provisions held in respect of a business sold in prior years 
(and classified as discontinued) and foreign exchange movements on provisions established on the disposal of SPIE.
Exceptional costs of £24 million in continuing operations included the £11 million costs of funding a joint venture which was 
part of a recent acquisition, costs of £11 million associated with restructuring following the management reorganisation 
into geographic business units and transaction and deferred compensation costs which, in line with IFRS 3, are charged 
to the income statement. Transaction costs of £2 million were incurred in the year .
The exceptional gain in discontinued operations of £17 million arises from the recognition of an insurance receivable 
following the Supreme Court judgement on mesothelioma liability , a provision against which was established a number 
of years ago.

In his budget speeches on 21 March 2012 and 20 March 2013, the UK chancellor of the exchequer announced reductions 
in the rate of corporation tax to 23 per cent from 1 April 2013, 21 per cent from 1 April 2014 and 20 per cent from 1 April 2015.
As at 31 December 2013, the reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 20 per cent had been substantively enacted.

As at 31 December 2013, the deferred tax liability arising on the UK pension surplus has been measured at the substantively 
enacted UK tax rate of 20 per cent. It was previously measured at 35 per cent being the tax rate that would be applied if the 
surplus was refunded. The change in the year reflects the fact there is no longer any reasonable expectation of a refund of 
the pension surplus in advance of anything that may become due on the eventual winding-up of the scheme. The impact 
of the change is a deferred tax credit in respect of continuing operations of £21 million, a deferred tax credit in respect of 
discontinued operations of £4 million and a deferred tax charge of £12 million recognised in other comprehensive income.

12 Intangible assets continued
The group is required to test its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually , or more frequently 
if indicators of impairment exist. 
The review of goodwill for indications of impairment by management is performed against the three core geographies 
of Americas, Europe and Growth Regions, being the lowest level of cash-generating units (CGU) monitored for goodwill 
purposes. This is consistent with the integration of acquisitions into the three segments in order to generate synergies. 
Goodwill has been allocated between geographic segments on a relative fair value basis.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use cash flow 
projections included in the financial budgets approved by management covering a two-year period and pre-tax discount 
rates as set out in the table below. Given the current market conditions, management believe that the discount rates 
chosen are conservative. For the purposes of the calculation of the recoverable amount, the cash flow projections beyond 
the two-year period include 2 per cent growth per annum (2012: 2 per cent), which is in line with long-term average 
growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate. The value in use has been compared to the carrying value 
for each CGU and no impairment is required nor has been charged in respect of any of the CGUs.
The financial budgets reflect management’s judgement of the future cash flows which includes past experience and 
expectations of future performance. The most significant assumptions relate to EBIT A margin
1
 and the conversion of 
EBITA into cash (cash conversion). Revenue is underpinned by a secure order book for each CGU and the order book 
remains strong at £4.1 billion as at 31 December 2013 (2012: £3.6 billion). The selection of EBITA margin takes into 
account the margins being generated on contracts in progress and management’ s view of the margin on orders received, 
and is consistent with Vision 2015 objectives. The cash conversion reflects past experience and current contract mix.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed, at the individual CGU level, in order to review the impact of changes in key 
assumptions. For example, a 10 per cent decrease in volume, with all other assumptions held constant, or a 1 per cent 
decrease in margin, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any impairments. Similarly , zero growth 
after the initial two-year period, with all other assumptions held constant or a 1 per cent increase in discount rate, did 
not identify any impairments.

14 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities
Defined benefit schemes
The group operates a number of pension schemes for UK and overseas employees. The principal defined benefit schemes 
are in the UK, with the main schemes being the AMEC Staff pension scheme and the AMEC Executive pension scheme. 
These schemes were closed to new members during 2012 but remain open to further accrual. The majority of overseas 
members are in defined contribution schemes. Contributions by the group into defined contribution schemes are disclosed 
in note 6.
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ was amended in June 2011. The impact on the group has been to replace interest cost and 
expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
defined benefit asset/liability . Details of the restatement are included in note 1.
The group’s main defined benefit plans are average salary plans for UK employees (the AMEC Staff pension scheme 
and the AMEC Executive pension scheme), which require contributions to be made to a separately administered fund. 
These schemes are governed by the employment laws of the UK. The level of benefits provided depends on the member’ s 
length of service and salary each year . Once the benefits are in payment, the pension is adjusted each year relative to the 
UK’s Retail Prices Index. The defined benefit plans require contributions to be made to a separately administered fund. 
The fund is established under trust law and is governed by a Board of T rustees, which consists of employers ’ and 
employees’ representatives together with two independent trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the 
administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the investment strategy .
Every three years, the Board of Trustees is required to review the level of funding in the pension plans as required by 
legislation. The Board of Trustees decides the contribution levels in consultation with the employers ’ based on the results 
of this triennial review. In the event that there is a funding deficit, the T rustees and employers ’ will agree a recovery plan to 
eliminate that deficit over as short a period as is reasonably affordable.
Due to the nature of the liabilities, the pension plans are exposed to inflation, interest rate risk and changes in the life 
expectancy for pensioners. As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted equities, the group is also exposed 
to equity market risk.
The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuation of the two major UK schemes as at 31 March 2011 
and updated by the schemes’ actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes 
as at 31 December 2013. The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December 2013.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows:
 31 December 
  2013
 per cent
 31 December 
  2012
 per cent
Rate of discount 4.6 4.5
Rate of inflation 3.3 2.9
Rate of increase in salaries 3.3 2.9
Rate of increase in pensions in payment (service before/after 1 January 2008) 3.2/2.2 2.8/2.0
The main overseas schemes as at 31 December 2013 consist of three funded defined benefit schemes held in Canada and 
The Law Companies Group, Inc Pension Plan that was acquired as part of the acquisition of MACTEC. A discount rate of 
4.9 per cent (2012: 4.3 per cent) and salary inflation rate of 2.75 per cent (2012: 2.75 per cent) have been used for the three 
defined benefit schemes held in Canada. A discount rate of 4.7 per cent (2012: 3.7 per cent) has been used for the Law 
Companies Group, Inc. Pension Plan retirement scheme. No further benefits are being accrued in this scheme. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 121

The sensitivity analysis above is based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the defined benefit obligation 
of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring as at 31 December 2013.
The defined benefit obligations of the overseas schemes are significantly lower than those of the main UK schemes. 
Sensitivity analysis of reasonable changes in the key assumptions as at 31 December did not indicate any significant 
changes to the defined benefit obligations of those schemes.

Factors affecting the tax charge in future years
There are a number of factors that may affect the group’s future tax charge including the resolution of open issues with 
tax authorities, corporate acquisitions and disposals, the use of brought-forward losses and changes in tax legislation 
and tax rates. 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items:
 31 December 
  2013
 £ million
 31 December 
  2012
 £ million
Deductible temporary differences 33 20
T ax losses 20 14
53 34
T ax losses and deductible temporary differences not recognised by the group do not expire under current tax legislation. 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the group can utilise these assets. 
In addition, claims have been made to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) to offset tax losses of up to £79 million against 
the group’s UK taxable profits. These losses were generated in a legacy German business in accounting periods up to 
31 December 2002. If successful, the claims will result in a refund of UK corporation tax. The amount and availability 
of the refund depends on a number of factors which are currently being discussed with HMRC. This potential refund 
is not included as an asset in the accounts.
Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of £355 million (2012: £551 million) of unremitted earnings of 
subsidiaries and joint ventures because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings is estimated to be £16 million 
(2012: £29 million).

19 Capital and financial risk management
Capital management 
The objective of the group’s capital management is to ensure that it has a strong financial position from which to grow the 
business to meet its Vision 2015 targets and is able to maximise shareholder value. The appropriate capital structure for 
the group comprises of a mix of debt and equity . The mix is determined by considering business profile and strategy , 
financial policies and availability and cost of funding.
The group is currently in a net cash position. The long-term net debt is expected to be no more than two times EBITDA. 
The group may exceed this operating parameter should the business profile require it. However , it is expected that any 
increases would be temporary given the net operational cash flows of the group.
The group has committed banking facilities of £477 million (2012: £377 million). This consists of a £377 million multi-currency 
revolving facility that was taken out on 18 July 2012. The facility is committed for five years and is available for general 
corporate purposes. In addition on 9 April 2013 the group entered into a £100 million Sterling term loan for a period of 
12 months. As at 31 December 2013, £120 million (2012: £150 million) of the loans and facilities had been utilised.
In February 2012, the board approved a share buyback programme of £400 million. During the year a total of 4 million 
shares (31 December 2012: 33 million shares) have been purchased under this programme. During 2012 this included 
the use of forward share purchase contracts through close periods. The group completed the buyback programme 
on 8 February 2013.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during 2013 or 2012.
Financial risk management
The principal financial risks to which the group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange risk; funding and liquidity risk; 
counterparty credit risk; and interest rate risk. The board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
The group’ s treasury department manages funding, liquidity , credit risk and risks arising from movements in interest and 
foreign currency rates within a framework of policies and guidelines approved by the board. The treasury department does not 
operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. T reasury operations are conducted 
within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the board, most recently in October 2013. 
Foreign currency exchange risk
The group publishes its consolidated accounts in Sterling. The majority of the group’ s trading income is denominated in the 
local curr ency of the business operations which pr ovides a natural hedge against the curr ency of its cost base. Wher e commer cial 
contracts are undertaken which are denominated in foreign currencies, the group seeks to mitigate the foreign exchange 
risk, when the cash flow giving rise to such exposure becomes certain or highly probable. This is achieved through the use 
of forward currency arrangements, which may include the purchase of currency options. There are currently no material 
transactional exposures which have been identified and remain unhedged. AMEC has no reason to believe that any 
outstanding forward contract will not be able to be settled from the underlying commercial transactions.
A portion of the group’ s earnings is generated in non-Sterling currencies. Such overseas profits are translated into Sterling 
at the average exchange rate prevailing throughout the year . There is currently no hedging in place for profits generated in 
non-Sterling currencies but the impact on group profits is monitored on an ongoing basis. In addition, the group has various 
assets denominated in foreign currencies, principally US Dollars and Canadian Dollars. A proportion of these assets, including 
unamortised goodwill, had been designated in net investment hedges using cross-currency instruments. The policy was 
changed in 2009 to cease translation hedging for core assets of the business and the remaining hedging contracts matured 
during the year . In specific circumstances, for example the planned repatriation of foreign assets, the group may from 
time to time enter into new net investment hedges to manage foreign exchange risks. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 128

Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk – cash flow hedges
The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs in, 
non-local currency . Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are used for this purpose and are 
designated as cash flow hedges. The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of forward contracts and 
swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows:

Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk – net investment hedges
The group previously had forward foreign exchange contracts which had been designated as hedges of the net investments 
in core subsidiaries in Canada and the US. The group revised its policy and the existing hedging contracts were not replaced 
when they matured. All such remaining hedging contracts matured during the year . The notional contract amount,

A net foreign exchange loss for the year of £1 million (2012: gain of £1 million) was recognised in the translation reserve 
in respect of these forward foreign exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps.
Other financial derivative assets and liabilities
The group has other financial derivative assets of £1 million (2012: £1 million) and financial derivative liabilities 
of £1 million (2012: £1 million).
Sensitivity analysis
The group hedges its material transaction-related exposures and hence has no material transactional profit or loss sensitivity . 
Funding and liquidity risk
The group’s policy aims to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of funding to meet both current and 
future forecast requirements consistent with the group’s budget and strategic plans. The group will finance operations 
and growth from its existing cash resources and the £477 million committed banking facilities. The requirement to enter 
into additional external facilities has been kept under review during the year .
Appropriate facilities will be maintained to meet ongoing requirements for bank guarantees and letters of credit.
Counterparty credit risk
The group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its 
financial instruments. The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the group’ s risk 
management activities. 
The credit risk associated with customers is considered as part of each tender review process and is addressed initially 
through contract payment terms. Where appropriate, payment security is sought. Credit control practices are applied 
thereafter during the project execution phase. A right to interest and suspension is normally sought in all contracts.
Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the board 
approved treasury policy . The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the group’ s exposure to credit risk from 
its treasury activities by ensuring that surplus funds are placed with a diversified range of 25 to 30 mainstream banks 
and with each counterparty up to a pre-approved limit. These limits are set at prudent levels by the board and are based 
primarily on credit ratings set by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. Credit ratings are monitored continually by the 
group treasury department. 
The group treasury department monitors counterparty exposure on a global basis to avoid an over-concentration 
of exposure to any one counterparty . AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 130

The above analysis excludes retentions relating to contracts in progress of £34 million (2012: £35 million) expected to be

31 December 2013 include £nil (2012: £nil) in respect of amounts overdue by more than one year .
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows:

 £ million
  2012
 £ million
As at 1 January (15) (20)
Net impairment allowance (charged)/credited (1) 5
As at 31 December (16) (15)
Based on past experience, the group believes that no material impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade 
receivables not past due.
T rade receivable exposures are typically with large companies and government-backed organisations and the credit 
ratings of these organisations are monitored. Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent 
company guarantees, insurance instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The group’s most significant customer in 2013 accounted for around 8 per cent (2012: 15 per cent) of continuing revenues, 
and around 4 per cent (2012: similar percentage) of current trade and other receivables. The revenue was generated in 
the Americas.
Interest rate risk 
The group was in both a net cash and net deficit position during the year . When the group is in a net cash position 
long-term interest rate hedging (for periods beyond three to six months) is not considered appropriate as the surplus 
cash is viewed as temporary .
The £377 million multi-currency revolving credit facility is subject to an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin depending 
on leverage. The £100 million Sterling term loan is subject to an interest rate of LIBOR plus a fixed margin. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 131

All covenants attached to borrowings have been complied with throughout the current and prior years. 
Fair values
Fair values are determined using observable market prices (level 2 as defined by IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’) 
as follows:
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual 
forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate.
20 Other non-current receivables and payables
Other non-current receivables of £24 million (2012: £27 million) represent indemnities received on the acquisition of MACTEC 
and certain insurance receivables, both of which are matched by liabilities included within provisions.
Trade and other payables of £11 million (2012: £11 million) represents lease incentives received which are being amortised

Provision was made during 2006 and prior for the estimated litigation, settlement and future legal costs in connection with

are also included as exceptional items. 
The provision for indemnities relates to the indemnification of the purchasers of SPIE in 2006, purchasers of the Built 
Environment businesses and other peripheral businesses in 2007. These businesses are reported as discontinued 
operations and any adjustments to the provisions are treated as adjustments to the profits on disposal which were 
treated as exceptional items.
The insurance provision relates to the potential liabilities in the group’s captive insurance entity and provisions in relation 
to risks associated with insurance claims. These potential liabilities and risks relate predominantly to industrial disease 
of former employees.
Provision has also been made for AMEC’s potential liability to fund loss-making joint venture entities. 
Future outflows in respect of the onerous property contracts are expected to occur over the next several years. 
Due to the nature of the other liabilities, the timing of any potential future outflows is uncertain.
22 Share capital and reserves
Movements in share capital and reserves are shown in the Consolidated statement of changes in equity on pages 97 and 98.
Share capital
The authorised share capital of the company is £350 million (2012: £350 million). This comprises 700 million (2012: 700 million) 
ordinary shares of 50 pence each. All the ordinary shares rank pari passu in all respects. T o the company’ s knowledge and 
belief , there are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the company or on voting rights between holders of shares.
The movement in issued share capital during the year was as follows:

Share buyback programme
During the year , 4 million ordinary shares (2012: 33 million ordinary shares) were purchased at an average price 
of £10.84 (2012: £10.76) and a total cost of £45 million (2012: £358 million). Of the total shares purchased under this 
buyback programme, 34 million shares (2012: 30 million shares) have subsequently been cancelled.
As at 31 December 2012 the company was party to an irrevocable closed season buyback agreement for the purchase of 
its own ordinary shares for a maximum total cost of £45 million. The purchase of these shares was dependent upon the 
company’s share price not reaching a pre-determined level during the remainder of the contract period. The outstanding 
share purchase mandate liability of £45 million was presented as a current liability in accordance with IAS 32.23. The 
company was not party to any such contracts as at 31 December 2013.
Reserves
As at 1 January 2013, there were 7,291,522 shares held in treasury (2012: 5,735,806). All of the shares purchased during 
2013 have subsequently been cancelled, but 3,250,000 of the shares purchased during 2012 are held in treasury . During 
the year , 1,104,557 shares were transferred to share scheme participants (2012: 1,694,284), leaving a balance held in 
treasury as at 31 December 2013 of 6,186,965 shares (2012: 7,291,522). £62 million (2012: £71 million) has been deducted 
from equity in respect of these shares.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging 
instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign 
operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities and the cumulative net change in the fair value of instruments that 
hedge the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries, that have arisen since 1 January 2004, being the date of 
transition to adopted IFRS.
Share-based payments
Offers are made periodically in certain countries under the UK and International Savings-related Share Option Schemes 
which are open to all employees in those countries who meet minimum service criteria. Grants of share options are made 
to participating employees that entitle them to buy shares in the company normally after three years at up to 20 per cent 
discount to the market price of the shares at the time of offer . In the US, to conform with the relevant tax rules, options are 
granted at a maximum discount of 15 per cent to the share price at the time of grant and are normally exercisable after 
two years.
Under the Performance Share Plan, annual awards are made to directors and selected senior employees of restricted 
shares that are subject to both market and non-market based conditions calculated over a three-year period. Detailed 
terms of this plan are included in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 62 to 77.
Under the Restricted Share Plan, awards are made to selected employees as restricted shares which vest in full after 
three years provided the employee has remained in continuous employment.
The share-based payment arrangements operated by the group are equity settled and, other than in defined good leaver 
circumstances, require participants to be still in employment with the group at the time of vesting. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 134

The expected share price volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company’ s share price.
The performance conditions attaching to the Performance Share Plan involve a comparison of the total shareholder return 
of the company with that of its comparators and achievement of targeted earnings per share growth. The former is a mark et 
based test and as such is incorporated into the grant date fair value of the award. There are no performance conditions 
attached to the Restricted Share Plan.
Dividends
The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2013 of 28.5 pence per share, 
which will absorb an estimated £84 million of equity . Subject to approval, it will be paid on 2 July 2014 to shareholders on the 
register of members on 30 May 2014. This dividend has not been provided for and there are no income tax consequences for 
the company . This final dividend together with the interim dividend of 13.5 pence (2012: 11.7 pence) per share results in 
a total dividend for the year of 42.0 pence per share (2012: 36.5 pence).

24 Acquisitions and disposals
Acquisitions in 2013
The following purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition. The business acquired did not make a material 
contribution to consolidated revenue and profit in the period from its acquisition to 31 December 2013, nor would 
it have done in the year ended 31 December 2013 had it been acquired on 1 January 2013.
Intangible assets recognised at fair value on the acquisition of these businesses included trade names, order backlogs, 
customer relationships and non-compete agreements.
Automated Engineering Services Corp.
On 15 November 2013, the group acquired all of the shares in Automated Engineering Services Corp. (AES) for up to 
US$35 million, with US$29 million paid on completion and up to $6 million deferred for three years dependent of the 
achievement of certain performance targets. 
AES is a 175-person professional design engineering nuclear services firm based in Naperville, Illinois, US. It provides 
plant design/modification engineering, engineering analysis, safety , licensing and regulatory services, and engineering 
programme support to existing nuclear utilities, primarily in the US.
The acquisition is fully aligned with AMEC’s Vision 2015 strategy and builds on AMEC’ s nuclear position in the US, allowing 
AMEC to better serve its clients and providing a strong platform from which to achieve further growth. AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 137

Acquisitions in 2012
Unidel
On 30 May 2012, the group acquired all of the shares in Unidel Group Pty Limited (Unidel).
Unidel is a 260-person company working in Australia’s energy , resources and infrastructure sectors which provides 
a range of environmental and infrastructure services similar to those of AMEC. Its experience includes projects involving 
gas field exploration, development, production and transmission, water pipelines and coal seam methane.
The acquisition is fully aligned with AMEC’s Vision 2015 strategy and built AMEC’ s presence in Australia to some 1,500 
employees. It also expands the group’s capabilities in one of the key growth regions and allows the group to better serve 
customers in the oil & gas, mining, and clean energy markets.

around 600 people providing consultancy and project solutions for customers including the Ministry of Defence, EDF , 
Magnox and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority . The acquisition is fully aligned with AMEC’s Vision 2015 growth 
strategy and further builds AMEC’s footprint and capabilities in the clean energy market. The team of highly skilled 
professionals will complement AMEC’s existing expertise in nuclear support activities and enable AMEC to better 
service its customers.

opportunities for the combined business to grow due to the complementary skills.
Other acquisitions
Other acquisitions were made in the year for a total consideration of £8 million of which £6 million was paid on completion 
with the balance of £2 million dependent on the achievement of set earnings targets. The aggregate fair value of identifiable 
net assets was £4 million, and there was a non-controlling interest of £2 million created. Goodwill arising was £6 million 
and has been recognised as a result of the value of its skilled workforce which did not meet the criteria for recognition as

26 Contingent liabilities
Guarantees and indemnities
The borrowings of joint ventures are generally without recourse to AMEC.
Legal claims and actions
AMEC has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known or reasonably likely legal claims and actions by 
or against the company . Consequently , it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action. AMEC makes 
an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions against the company on the basis of the likely outcome but 
makes no provision for those which are, in its view, unlikely to succeed. Provisions of £37 million (2012: £40 million) are 
shown in note 21 in respect of these claims. 
Known and reasonably likely legal claims or actions for which a provision has not been established are not expected to 
have a material impact on the group. The possibility of other claims being made in the future is considered by AMEC, 
but in general their occurrence or outcome cannot be predicted within any degree of certainty .
27 Related party transactions
During 2013 there were a number of transactions with the senior management group, joint venture entities and subsidiary

In September 2012, the UK government’s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills announced a change to UK 
legislation with respect to the requirement for a UK company to be subject to annual audit. An additional audit exemption 
has been introduced, such that for a subsidiary of a parent established in a European Economic Area state, that subsidiary 
can be exempt from annual audit if certain conditions are met. The principal conditions are the requirement for the 
subsidiary’s shareholders to agree to the exemption and a guarantee to be issued to the subsidiary by the parent 
undertaking, guaranteeing all of the subsidiary’s outstanding liabilities at the year end, until they are satisfied in full.
The group will be exempting the following companies from an audit in 2013 under Section 479A of the Companies Act 2006, 
all of which are fully consolidated in these accounts:

28 Post balance sheet event 
On 13 February 2014, AMEC announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Foster Wheeler AG 
(Foster Wheeler) under which AMEC will make a recommended offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued 
share capital of Foster Wheeler .
Under the terms of the acquisition, Foster Wheeler shareholders would receive 0.8998 new AMEC securities and 
$16.00 in cash for each Foster Wheeler share (representing approximately $3.3 billion, or £2.0 billion* in aggregate).
Due to its size, the acquisition is a class 1 transaction under the UK listing rules and therefore requires the approval 
of AMEC shareholders. Completion of the transaction will also be subject to AMEC having received valid acceptance 
to the offer from holders of Foster Wheeler shares holding a minimum of 80 per cent of the total issued share capital 
of Foster Wheeler , regulatory and anti-trust approvals, a Foster Wheeler shareholder vote, and the satisfaction of other 
customary closing conditions.
The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2014.
*  Calculated using the AMEC share price of 1092 pence and a pound sterling to US$ exchange rate of 1:1.658, both as at the close on 12 February 2014. 
The recommended offer value has been calculated using a Foster Wheeler diluted share count of approximately 99.9 million shares (based on 
treasury share method) that will be settled in new AMEC securities and cash, plus approximately 1.2 million of shares currently in Foster Wheeler 
award schemes that are expected to be rolled into new AMEC awards.  AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013 141

Interest 
Interest is recognised in profit or loss on an accruals 
basis using the effective interest method.
Investments 
Investments are stated at cost less provision for permanent 
diminution in value. Where equity-settled share-based 
payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary 
companies, the fair value of the award is treated as a capital 
contribution by the company and the investment in 
subsidiaries are adjusted to reflect this capital contribution.
Pensions
The company participates in a UK group-wide funded 
defined benefit pension scheme. The assets of the scheme 
ar e held separatel y fr om those of the company . The company 
is unable to identify its shar e of the underl ying assets and 
liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and r easonable basis 
and ther efor e, as r equir ed by FRS 17 ‘R etir ement Benefits ’ , 
accounts for the scheme as if it wer e a defined contribution 
scheme. As a r esult, the amount char ged to the pr ofit and 
loss account r epr esents the contributions payable to the 
scheme in r espect of the accounting period.
Details of the defined benefit scheme can be found 
in note 14 of the consolidated accounts.
Remuneration of auditors
The detailed information concerning auditors ’ remuneration 
is shown in note 4 of the consolidated accounts.
Share-based payments
There are share-based payment arrangements which 
allow AMEC employees to acquire AMEC shares; these 
awards are granted by AMEC. The fair value of awards 
granted is recognised as a cost of employment with 
a corresponding increase in equity . The fair value is 
measured at grant date and spread over the period 
during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the award. The fair value of the award is 
measured using a valuation model, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the awards were 
granted. The amount recognised as a cost is adjusted 
to reflect the actual number of shares that vest except 
where non-vesting is due to share prices not achieving 
the threshold for vesting. 
T axation
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the 
year and takes into account taxation deferred because 
of timing differences between the treatment of certain 
items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect 
of all timing differences between the treatment of certain 
items for taxation and accounting purposes which have 
arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except 
as otherwise required by FRS 19 ‘Deferred T ax’.
1 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards and the Companies Act 2006.
The company has not presented its own profit and loss 
account, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006. 
Cash flow statement
The company is exempt from the requirement of FRS 1 
‘Cash Flow Statements’ to prepare a cash flow statement 
as its cash flows are included within the consolidated 
cash flow of the group.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets, other than 
assets in the course of construction, at rates calculated 
to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual 
value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its 
estimated useful life. The estimated lives of tangible 
assets as at 31 December 2013 are as follows:
Plant and equipment  Three to five years 
Software Three to seven years
Depreciation is provided from the month in which the 
asset is available for use.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive 
payment is established.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. 
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of 
the instruments. Cash, deposits and short-term 
investments are held at amortised cost. Derivative 
financial instruments are accounted for as described 
in note 1 to the consolidated accounts.
The company is e x empt fr om the disclosur e r equir ements of 
FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosur es ’ as the financial 
instruments disclosur es of IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Disclosur es ’ and IFRS 13 ‘F air V alue Measur ement’ ar e 
included in the notes to the consolidated acc ounts.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in a currency other than Sterling are 
translated to Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date and exchange differences are taken to profit and loss 
accounts in the year . Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
are measured in terms of historical cost and are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Notes: 
1.  The maintenance and integrity of the AMEC plc web site is the 
responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors 
does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly , 
the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have 
occurred to the financial statements since they were initially 
presented on the web site. 
2.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions
We have audited the parent company accounts of AMEC plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise 
the company balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 10. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, 
as a body , in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body , for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 90 the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the parent company accounts and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
parent company accounts in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the accounts
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the accounts sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the accounts are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error . 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the accounts. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
accounts. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on accounts
In our opinion the parent company accounts:

give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2013;

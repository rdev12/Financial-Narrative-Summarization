I am pleased to report to you on the Company’s progress 
during the past year.
As incoming Chairman half way through 2007, I have witnessed 
an interesting year in Azerbaijan, where the Company was able 
to consolidate its strategic position in the country and fulfil 
its obligations under the Production sharing Agreement (“PsA”) 
it shares with the Government. Our most important development 
has been the advancement of the Gedabek gold/copper project, 
for which we commenced construction after identifying 
an indicated resource in November 2006. 
During the last twelve months the demand for base and precious 
metals has remained strong, led by the extraordinary growth 
of the Indian and Chinese economies. Gold prices have remained 
buoyant over the period, reaching new highs in early 2008, 
fuelled by soaring oil prices and power outages in south Africa.
Despite record prices for gold, silver and copper, the mining 
industry is struggling to keep pace with the high demand for 
metals. The time from discovery to production has increased 
significantly as companies struggle over land title issues, 
changes to tax laws, environmental constraints, shortages 
of qualified mining individuals and extra long lead times 
on key items of equipment.
Gedabek
At Gedabek, our Company has been fortunate in being able 
to fast‑track this gold and copper mining project, requiring 
small and available machinery, with minimal delays through 
the approval processes. We obtained feasibility study approval 
in June 2007, the environmental approval in september 2007 
and put the financing in place in early 2008. The project is now 
poised to deliver its first gold production before the end of 
2008 with copper production following shortly thereafter.
The Gedabek project consists of an open pit mine producing 
1.5 million tonnes of ore each year, a heap leach pad and 
processing facility for the recovery of gold, copper and silver. 
The stripping ratio is low at around 1.5 to 1.0, enabling the 
flat lying ore deposit to be readily accessed and higher grades 
mined early in the project’s life. The project should return 
its capital investment very quickly due to the high grades 
scheduled to be leached during 2009.
The products from Gedabek, in the form of gold doré and 
copper/silver rich concentrates will be exported for further 
processing and refining. The Company has no restrictions 
on these exports under the terms and conditions of the PsA.
The Gedabek feasibility study was completed in June 2007 and 
the Development and Production Plan was submitted to the 
Government and approved in the third quarter. Environmental 
approvals were also obtained from the Ministry of Ecology and 
Natural Resources during the third quarter. These approvals 
required the completion of a base‑line study and an environmental 
impact study and included a local environmental hearing at which 
the residents of Gedabek were able to express their overwhelming 
support for the project. The Company is determined to maintain 
the highest environmental standards at the mine, recognising 
that it is located close to a populated area.
I am pleased to report that the Group has continued to 
assist the local community at Gedabek. Following severe 
weather damage to schools and public buildings earlier this 
year, we purchased roofing materials which enabled repairs 
to be carried out in a timely manner. We also partnered with a 
local company in Azerbaijan to join the USAID Farmer‑to‑Farmer 
programme to improve the productivity and income of over 
800 families in the Gedabek region.
Exploration
Although the Company focused most of its resources 
on the Gedabek deposit during 2007, exploration efforts 
continued both in Ordubad in the south and at the Gosha 
property, which is located to the north west of Gedabek.
At Gosha, further test sampling and ore grade comparisons 
with Russian data confirmed that potentially economic 
mineralisation exists. The area around Gosha was mapped 
and sampled during the year as part of a reconnaissance 
programme in search of further mineralised areas.
The exploration work in Ordubad was focused around mapping 
and sampling of some of the smaller deposits in the area which 
are considered prospective for copper and molybdenum. 
soils and sediment sampling was also taken out in areas 
between the known mineral occurrences.
The Company has until April 2009 to further evaluate 
the properties it has been granted under the PsA, with the 
possibility of an extension to this time period. We look forward 
to more exploration success, especially if in the future we can 
explore three more prospects located in the Occupied Territories 
of western Azerbaijan.
Sale of CIL plant
Following extensive advertising, the CIL plant purchased 
by the Company in 2005 was sold to a Kazakhstan gold 
producer for a consideration of $7.5 million, before sales costs. 
Although the sale value of the plant was less than expected, 
the cash inflow occurred at a critical time for the Company. 
ChAIRMAN’s sTATEMENT
Our most important development has been the advancement 
of the Gedabek gold/copper project, for which we have commenced 
mine construction.

Anglo Asian Mining PLC
Annual report and accounts 2007
The proceeds greatly assisted with financing the Gedabek 
project and enabled the project team to continue with 
the planning and infrastructure requirements.
Financing
The strategy on the further financing requirement of $25 million 
for the Gedabek project was to first explore local Azeri sources 
of debt. The Azerbaijan economy receives increasingly substantial 
revenues from the oil and gas sector and local banks are well 
placed to assist with the funding of ventures to support growth 
in other sectors of the economy.
Through extensive discussions and a strong relationship with 
the IBA, the Company was able to obtain an unsecured $5 million 
credit line from the bank in January 2008 to add to its own 
internal funding. In April 2008 the IBA also committed to 
a $20 million term loan, which has subsequently been executed 
and enables the Company to build the mine at Gedabek. The IBA 
funding is considered a major breakthrough for the Group.
The current forecasts demonstrate that the existing cash resources 
and available debt provide sufficient funds to complete the 
construction of the mine at Gedabek. The Board is aware of 
the current inflationary pressures in the mining industry, the risk 
of delays to the development, production and revenue falling 
short of expectations and the uncertainty that brings to going 
concern. If there are either cost overruns or delays which result 
in a funding shortfall then the Board will have to take steps to 
ensure there is adequate funding in the period to 30 June 2009. 
The major shareholders on the Board have confirmed that they 
would be willing to provide additional funding in such an event 
and also consider that further working capital facilities could be 
negotiated with the IBA. The Company is seeking the approval 
of the shareholders, at the AGM on 23 July to increase the 
borrowing capacity under the Articles of Association to four 
times the Adjusted Capital and Reserves and also to increase 
the ability to allot for cash up to 10% of the current share 
capital on a non pre‑emptive basis. Approval of these Special 
Resolutions will if necessary facilitate the ability to raise additional 
funds. For these reasons the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements (see note 1 
to the consolidated financial statements). The projected cash flows 
commencing in the first quarter of 2009 will put the Company 
in a strong position to pay back the debt quickly and generate 
funds for future growth.
Financial results
The Group reported a loss of $14,683,306 (2006: $4,428,073). 
The operating loss resulted from the costs of administrative 
expenses of $4,935,566 (2006: $4,824,096), a provision 
for impairment of exploration expenditure and mining rights 
of $6,692,218 (2006: $185,053) and the write‑down of 
the CIL plant held for sale of $3,273,887 (2006: $nil).
Net interest income in the year was $218,365 (2006:$581,126).
Exploration and evaluation expenditure of $2,035,970 
(2006: $6,017,138) was capitalised in the year.
At the year end the Group retained cash balances of $6,810,902 
(2006: $6,354,102): there was no borrowing.
Board and management
In July 2007 I joined the Board as Chairman following the 
departure of Mr Graham Mascall. It was with great pleasure 
that I was able to assist in the challenging process of raising 
the necessary funds to develop the Gedabek project.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Graham Mascall 
for his term as Chairman, during which time the Company’s 
strategic focus was identified and executed.
Following the Company securing its financing, the management 
team in Azerbaijan was enhanced with experienced individuals 
from Kazakhstan to supplement a number of competent Azeri 
staff for the development phase of the project. This combination 
has subsequently been boosted by engaging a Turkish construction 
management group to supervise the construction of the mine.
Tim Eggar has advised the Board that he will not be offering 
himself up for re‑election at the AGM scheduled for 23 July and 
will step down from the Board at that time. Tim has been on 
the Board for the three years following the IPO and on behalf 
of the whole Board I would like to thank him for his significant 
contribution during this period. At the same time Richard Round 
will step down from his executive duties as Finance Director and 
take up a position as a Non‑executive Director also filling the 
vacancy of Chairman of the Audit Committee currently held by 
Tim. This follows the conclusion that we will need a full time 
CFO based in Azerbaijan as we head towards production. We have 
already appointed John Gibson to the non‑board position of 
interim CFO and the search for a full time CFO is underway.
I would like to thank all of our employees for their persistence 
and hard work during 2007. I believe the uncertain phase for 
the Company is behind us and we can look forward to building 
a strong foundation during the coming year.

A mine development is underway at Gedabek following the Company’s 
successful feasibility study of the project and financing for the full 
scale development.
ChIEF ExECUTIvE’S REvIEw
Introduction
The Group has made some exciting progress during 2007. 
A mine development is underway at Gedabek, following the 
Group’s successful feasibility study of the project and financing 
for the full scale development of the mine. In addition, some 
very good exploration targets are being pursued this year, 
two of which are in the vicinity of the Gedabek development.
The Gedabek project will provide the Group with cash flow 
to assist with its future growth in the region. The highly rated 
Tethyan belt running through Iran, Azerbaijan, Georgia and 
Turkey can be expected to produce more development 
opportunities, as this area remains under‑explored compared 
with many other gold/copper districts throughout the world. 
Funds to be generated by Gedabek and good financial relationships 
in Azerbaijan will place Anglo Asian in a strong position to 
take advantage of the exploration, acquisition and development 
opportunities the region has to offer. As the first major gold 
project in Azerbaijan, the Company is expected to receive on‑going 
support for its activities under its PsA with the Government 
of Azerbaijan. We have acquired rights for mining and exploration 
for up to 25 years in the Gedabek Contract Area, under the PsA 
following the successful discovery.
At least one area in Ordubad and the Gosha prospects remain as 
an exploration target. In addition, the Group holds rights for three 
highly rated prospects in the Occupied Territories to the south 
of Gosha and Gedabek. Following recent political changes 
in Armenia, we are advised that negotiations are progressing 
well between the Governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Exploration programmes
During 2007, the Group focused its efforts on field exploration 
in and around the Gedabek and Gosha Contract Areas. soils and 
grab samples were taken over previously un‑explored territory 
and areas were checked between the known anomalies in these 
Contract Areas. sampling continued at the Gosha prospect and 
at nearby streams and outcrops. samples taken from the 
Maskhit deposit near Gedabek showed there is potential 
for economic grades of copper in the area and the Group will 
focus on this prospect and the known Maarif deposit during 
the 2008 exploration programme.
ORduBAd
Activity in the Ordubad region was restricted to mapping 
and sediment sampling during 2007. The camp at Keleky was 
moved to Gedabek and both geological and ancillary staff 
numbers reduced to focus resources on the Gedabek project. 
however, the Group does intend to explore further in the 
Misdag/Agyurt prospect area, where only limited exploration 
work was possible in the past.
The Group remains optimistic that other prospects such as 
Piyazbashi will become increasingly attractive at sustained high 
gold prices. The Piyazbashi prospect consists of a multitude of 
gold bearing quartz sulphide veins, which vary substantially 
in grade and thickness. Grades from re‑sampling of the adits 
show good correlation with previous Russian data. The Group’s 
sample results returned grades in the range 0.2 g/t to 80.7 g/t, 
reflecting the high variability of grades within each of the vein 
structures. Although tonnages would be restricted by underground 
mining at Piyazbashi and grades diluted in some of the narrow 
veins, the prospect will become more viable as the gold price 
continues to rise.
The Diakhchay copper/gold/molybdenum prospect is another 
target for further work in future exploration programmes. 
some good surface sample results provide added incentive 
to explore this prospect further.
GOSHA
Additional sampling and evaluation at Gosha during 2007 
showed the deposit to be erratic in grade and a high risk 
mining proposition, due to the nature of the ore and apparent 
distribution of the grade. Consistent gold grades would seem 
to be limited to the upper level east‑west structure, which 
has seemingly little potential at depth.
It is considered that substantial underground driving and sampling 
is required to evaluate fully this prospect. Because of the focus 
on Gedabek during 2007, exploration efforts at Gosha were 
restricted. At higher gold prices the option of trucking some 
of this ore to Gedabek for processing remains a possibility.

mAARIF
The geological structure at Maarif is represented by tuffs and 
andesite porphyrites, together with rhyolites. The area was initially 
investigated by siemens during the operation of the nearby 
Gedabek mine. Government geologists have since identified 
an area of strongly hydrothermally altered and tectonically 
dislocated material covering a surface area of four kilometres 
by about 300 metres in width.
A short Government drilling programme, prior to the PsA, 
identified a potential low grade copper resource, which is also 
believed to host gold, silver and molybdenum. The Group is 
undertaking further investigations of this prospect during 2008 
to determine its economic potential. Both its prospectivity and 
close proximity to Gedabek rank Maarif as a high priority 
exploration target for the Company.
Gedabek development
The Gedabek project was taken through scoping, feasibility 
and financing stages during 2007. The project is the highlight 
of a successful year for the Group, and higher metal prices have 
enhanced the potential value of this project. The value of the 
by‑product metals, silver and copper, has also assisted in keeping 
cash costs per ounce of gold well within the first quartile of 
gold producer costs. 
A recently revised capital cost estimate of $25 million for the 
project is consistent with earlier estimates, given that the 
purchasing of a new mining fleet has been deferred until after 
production start‑up. Steel and contracting costs have risen, 
but the Group believes that its current loan facilities will provide 
sufficient finance to take Gedabek to production, although the 
Board is aware of the current inflationary pressures in the mining 
industry and the risk of construction delays, which could result 
in a further funding requirement.
During 2007, the Group produced a feasibility study by mid year 
which showed the Gedabek deposit can be successfully 
developed using relatively simple heap leach technology, 
supplemented by a sulphidation, acidification, recycling and 
thickening of the precipitate (sART) process which recovers 
valuable metal credits for copper and silver. The application 
of this process also reduces overall cyanide consumption by 
returning cyanide associated with copper and silver back into 
the leaching circuit. Its application has been restricted in the 
past by low copper prices. The cost of recovering copper by 
this means is estimated to be higher than $1.00 per pound at 
current costs of reagents. however, at sustained high copper 
prices, the process is finding wider application in the mining 
industry, with several companies introducing sART in similar 
circumstances to Gedabek. The Group was fortunate to retain 
first class consultants in SRK, SGS Lakefield and Knight Piesold 
for this study.
ChIEF ExECUTIvE’S REvIEw CONTINUED Anglo Asian Mining PLC
Annual report and accounts 2007 07
The Gedabek project has been developed from a JORC coded 
resource base of 15.6 million tonnes of ore grading 1.4 g/t 
gold, 0.24% copper and 12.2 g/t silver in the indicated and 
inferred categories. Mining reserves at conservative metal prices 
of $600 per ounce for gold, $6 per ounce for silver and $1.80 
per pound for copper were calculated to be 7.7 million tonnes 
of ore grading 1.80 g/t gold, 15.9 g/t silver and 0.29% copper. 
The mining reserve is very sensitive to both metal prices and 
operating costs. This gives the mine a good chance of extending 
the mine life beyond the current six years on the current resource 
base alone. In addition, the ore body remains open in several 
directions and old stockpiles are likely to account for at least 
one extra year of production. A low grade copper halo surrounding 
the gold/copper ore deposit is also of economic interest, 
should copper prices remain at current levels, together with the 
old siemens workings, most of which lie beneath the planned 
open pit mine.
The location, nature and size of the Gedabek deposit make 
it ideally suited to open pit mining and heap technology. 
Mining will take place on a hill slope with a two kilometre 
haul to a leach pad, which is to be formed on existing sloping 
ground at a similar elevation. No clearing of vegetation is required, 
simply removal of the topsoil. The extensive clay beds in the 
area will provide an ideal, impervious base for the leach pad. 
Earthworks requirements are not extensive and water supplies 
are readily available from nearby streams. To ensure reliability 
of power supply, the Group plans to use its own diesel powered 
generators initially.
Suitable mining and earthworks contractors have been identified 
in Azerbaijan. Consideration will be given to purchasing a mining 
fleet once construction work and the pre‑strip mining is underway 
dependent on cash flows and performance of the mining 
contractor during the construction phase.
The current construction schedule shows first mine production 
by the last quarter of 2008. The mining schedule has been 
designed to access high grade ore relatively early in the mine 
life. Gold production is expected to exceed 80,000 ounces 
during 2009.
The Group is fully committed to its environmental and safety 
obligations at Gedabek. An environmental baseline study and 
environmental impact study were completed during the year 
and approved by the Government authorities. Land has been 
assigned to the project for its duration and both the Gedabek 
community and local authorities have strongly supported the 
development. The project is of national importance to the 
Azerbaijan Government in a country dominated by the oil 
sector. Gedabek will be the first significant gold mining 
project in the country.
Infrastructure
The Group has substantially improved its facilities at Gedabek 
during 2007. The rented hotel has been upgraded to accommodate 
additional staff and workers, adding a new dining room and 
improving plumbing and communications systems. In June 2007, 
work commenced on the permanent mine camp. Most of the 
camp buildings have been constructed under Company supervision, 
using local labourers. This approach has been successful and 
good quality work has been achieved. The exploration camp 
from Ordubad was moved to Gedabek as a starting point for 
the camp, which is planned to accommodate 80–100 staff 
during operations.
CIL plant
The CIL plant was sold during the third quarter of 2007 for 
$7.5 million, before costs of disposal, providing cash reserves 
to continue with the Gedabek development and arrange 
project financing.
Staffing
During 2007, the Group retained sufficient staff to keep the 
Gedabek project moving and has since appointed construction 
and operating personnel to commence the early construction 
work. several experienced operations personnel have been recruited 
from Kazakhstan to assist with the mine start‑up. These people 
complement a local Azeri management team, several of whom 
have a mining or oil industry background. It is anticipated 
that additional management resources will be needed during 
construction and these are being sought from neighbouring 
Turkey and Iran, where the mining industries has been 
firmly established.
Attention has been given to the reduction of our cost base and 
we have achieved savings from the closure of the London office 
in February 2007.
Financing
The Group has obtained funding since the year end from 
the IBA which enables us to develop Gedabek. The Bank has 
provided two facilities, firstly, one of $5 million repayable in 
three years and secondly, one of $20 million repayable over four 
years with a two year grace period. Both facilities carry interest 
at 15%. Further details on this and going concern are given 
in the finance review.

The Group reported a loss for 2007 of $14,683,306 
(2006: $4,428,073). The operating loss resulted from administration 
expenses of $4,935,566 (2006: $4,824,096) and a provision for 
impairment of capitalised exploration expenditure and impairment 
of mining rights of $6,692,218 (2006: $185,103) and the 
write‑down of plant held for sale of $3,273,887 offset by net 
interest income of $218,365 (2006: $581,126).
The administrative expenses have been incurred in Azerbaijan 
and London. Our London office was closed in February 2007 
to reduce the cost base.
The Group has prepared its consolidated accounts for 2007 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting standards 
(“IFRS”) adopted by the European Union. On adoption of 
IFRs no changes have been required to the comparative 
results for the previous year.
The Directors have decided that a provision should be made 
against the capitalised exploration expenses relating to Piyazbashi 
of $1,111,286 reducing the carrying value to $1,000,000 and 
Misdag/Agyurt of $580,932 reducing the carrying value to $nil. 
In addition a provision for impairment has been raised against 
mining rights relating to Ordubad of $5,000,000. The decision 
to impair these asset results from the reduction in time available 
in the exploration period of the PsA. This follows the decision 
to concentrate resources on the development of Gedabek.
The net interest income in the period arose from the interest 
received on deposits.
As there was no income generated in the Group, the tax charge for 
the period was nil and an additional deferred tax asset was created 
in the form of losses to carry forward in both the UK and Azerbaijan. 
The deferred tax assets are not recognised in the balance sheet.
Exploration and evaluation expenditures of $2,035,970 
(2006: $6,017,138) were incurred and capitalised in the year.
Following the results of the Gedabek scoping study, a decision 
was made to sell the CIL plant and use the proceeds to develop 
a heap leach facility at Gedabek. The plant was sold in september, 
after the cost of disposal, for $7,004,585. 
The Group retained cash balances of $6,810,902 
(2006: $16,354,102) at the year end. 
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing financial risks.
Commodity price risk
The Group has not yet commenced commercial mining and 
does not hold any financial instruments to hedge the commodity 
price risk on its expected future production. The Board will review 
this exposure prior to any mines becoming operational.
Foreign currency risk
The Group reports in US dollars and a large proportion of its 
business is conducted in US dollars. It also conducts business 
in Australian dollars, Azerbaijan manats and UK sterling.
Liquidity/interest rate risk
shortly after the IPO the only debt in the Group was repaid 
and there is no debt as at 31 December 2007. Board approval 
is required for all new borrowing facilities. The Group has not 
used any interest rate swaps or other instruments to manage 
its interest rate profile during 2007.
At the year end the Group had cash on short‑term deposit. 
Short‑term deposits during the period included overnight, 
one week and monthly up to 12 months.
In January 2008 the Group obtained a credit facility with 
the IBA of $5 million repayable after three years, expiring 
on 14 January 2011, with an interest rate of up to 15%. 
Repayments in equal monthly instalments are due from 
February 2010. In April 2008 the IBA also agreed to additional 
funding to the Group by way of a further credit facility of 
$20 million at an all inclusive annual interest rate of 15%. 
The loan agreement is for four years from 15 February 2008 
with a two year grace period to repay the monies loaned. In 2010 
$8 million is scheduled to be repaid in quarterly instalments and 
in 2011 $5 million and $7 million are repayable in March and 
June respectively. There is no penalty for early repayment.
market risk
Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is minimal as the Group 
currently has no debt. Interest rates on UK sterling and US dollar 
deposits are relatively stable and the impact of a fluctuation 
in the interest rate on interest earned on the Group’s short‑term 
deposits is likely to be minimal. The Group will be exposed to 
fluctuations in commodity prices once production commences.
Operational risk
There is exposure to delay in the construction programme 
and the resulting timing of production and sale of minerals. 
The Group will monitor progress on a regular basis.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements. The Directors are required to prepare 
financial statements for the Group in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
such financial statements in accordance with IFRS, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
IAS 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows. This requires that faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance 
with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the IAS Board’s “Framework for 
the Preparation and presentation of Financial Statements”. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by 
compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors are also required to:
I properly select and apply accounting policies;
I  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and
I  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a directors’ report which complies with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent company financial 
statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
I select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
I  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
I   state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
I   prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent company financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company, for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of the directors’ report which complies 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Directors indemnities
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provision for the benefit of its Directors which were made during the year 
and remain in force at the date of this report.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is 
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
These resources include the anticipated revenues from the projected gold, silver and copper production at Gedabek, existing cash 
balances, existing debt facilities and the Group’s ability to raise further funds through either debt or equity, should production 
from the mine be delayed or if costs of the development increase. Although there is material uncertainty in this respect the Board 
is expecting that Gedabek will be in production before the end of 2008. For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.

COMPANY SECRETARY

Annual report and accounts 2007 13
Introduction
Although the rules of AIM do not require the Company to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
(“the Code”), the Company fully supports the principles set out in the Code and will attempt to comply wherever possible, 
given both the size and resources available to the Company. Details are provided below of how the Company applies the Code. 
The board
The Board of Directors currently comprises three Executive Directors and four non‑executive Directors, one of whom is the Chairman. 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are split in line with recommended policy.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and receives a Board pack comprising individual reports from each of the Executive 
Directors together with any other material deemed necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. The Board also conducts 
telephone Board meetings as issues which require Board attention arise. It is the Board’s responsibility to formulate, review and 
approve the Group’s strategy, budgets and major items of expenditure. The Board sets the Group’s objectives and policies and 
monitors their implementation by the executive team.
The Board considers two of the non‑executive Directors other than the Chairman to be independent and Tim Eggar to be the 
Senior Independent non‑executive Director.
Audit committee
The Audit Committee comprises Tim Eggar and John Sununu and is scheduled to meet at least twice a year. The external auditors 
attend the meetings and the Chief Executive and Finance Director attend by invitation. It is the Audit Committee’s role to provide 
formal and transparent arrangements for considering how to apply the financial reporting and internal control requirements 
of the Code, whilst maintaining an appropriate relationship with the independent auditors of the Group.
Remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises Khosrow Zamani, Tim Eggar and John Sununu and meets as required. It is the 
Remuneration Committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on executive remuneration and to set remuneration 
packages for individual Directors.
Nomination committee
The nomination Committee currently comprises Khosrow Zamani, Tim Eggar, John Sununu and Gordon Lewis. It is the role of the 
nomination Committee to review and consider the Board structure and composition and it meets as required to consider and make 
recommendations on the appointment of Directors to the Board.
Shareholder relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and encourages communication with 
private shareholders via the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). In addition, the Company uses the annual report and accounts, 
interim statement and web site (www.aamining.com) to provide further information to shareholders.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
For each year, on behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of these systems. This is achieved primarily 
by considering the risks potentially affecting the Group and discussions with the external auditors.
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the administrative function.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year and is reviewed by the Board and where appropriate revised 
forecasts are prepared and also reviewed by the Board. The Group’s results, as compared against budget, are reported 
to the Board on a monthly basis and discussed in detail at each meeting of the Board.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against the Directors as well as against material loss 
or claims against the Group and the Board reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly.
CORPORATE GOVERnAnCE Anglo Asian Mining PLC
Annual report and accounts 2007

We have audited the Group financial statements of Anglo Asian Mining PLC for the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise 
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense, the consolidated balance 
sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the related notes 1 to 29. These Group financial statements have been 
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Anglo Asian Mining PLC for the year ended 
31 December 2007. That report is modified by the inclusion of an emphasis of matter.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement 
of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, whether the Group financial 
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion 
the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the Group financial statements. The information given in the 
directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the business review that is cross referred from the Principal Activity 
and business review section of the directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information specified by law regarding director’s remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent 
with the audited Group financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any further 
information outside the annual report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial 
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation 
of the Group financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
I  the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its loss for the year then ended;
I  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation; and
I the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Emphasis of matter – going concern
Without qualifying our opinion we draw attention to the disclosures made in note 1 of the financial statements concerning the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern which would depend upon the Gedabek Development being completed to budget, 
production starting before the end of 2008 and revenues meeting expectations, or alternatively, on obtaining additional financing. 
These considerations, together with the other matters set out in note 1, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which 
may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include 
the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern as it is not practicable to determine 
or quantify them.

1. Going concern
The Directors’ assumption over the capital costs and timing of production from the Gedabek development are crucial to the Group 
meeting its forecast cash flows for the year to 30 June 2009. Should the costs of the development increase, production be delayed 
or the revenues fall short of expectations there may be insufficient cash flow for the Group to manage its day to day operations 
without seeking and relying on further financing, which may or may not be available. Therefore a material uncertainty exists which 
may cast significant doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and that it may be unable to realise its assets and 
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement, which assumes at the time of approving the financial statements, 
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group can access adequate resources to continue in operation and remain in 
existence for the foreseeable future. The current forecasts demonstrate that the existing cash resources and available debt provide 
sufficient funds to complete the construction of the mine at Gedabek. The Board is aware of the current inflationary pressures in 
the mining industry and the risk of delays to the development. If there are either cost overruns or delays which result in a funding 
shortfall then the Board will have to take steps to ensure that there is adequate funding in the period to 30 June 2009. The major 
shareholders on the Board have confirmed that they would be willing to provide additional funding in such an event. The Directors 
also consider that further working capital facilities could be negotiated with the IBA. The Company is seeking the approval of the 
shareholders, at the AGM on 23 July 2008 to increase the borrowing capacity under the Articles of Association to four times the 
Adjusted Capital and Reserves and also to increase the ability to allot for cash up to 10% of the current share capital. Approval of 
these Special Resolutions will be necessary to facilitate the ability to raise additional funds. The Board is expecting that Gedabek 
will be in production before the end of 2008. In addition, the Directors consider that there are various costs in relation to the 
mining activities which could be deferred without an adverse impact on the operations.
For these reasons the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of preparing the financial statements.
2. General information

These financial statements are presented in US dollars. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
3.	 Significant	accounting	policies
BASIS Of PREPARATION
For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2006, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”). These financial statements, for the year ended 
31 December 2007, are the first that the Group has prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (“EU”). 
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee 
(“IFRIC”) interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
As a result of the conversion from UK GAAP to IFRS, no adjustments have been required to be made to the comparatives for the 
year ended 31 December 2006, nor the balance sheet at the transition date of 1 January 2006. Although certain presentational 
changes have been made in order to present the comparatives in accordance with the requirements of IFRS there is no requirement 
to present the detailed disclosures set out in IFRS 1 First‑time adoption of IFRS. The Group has utilised the exemptions that are 
available under IFRS 1 in relation to currency translations where by cumulative translation differences are deemed to be zero 
at the date of transition to IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted 
are set out below.
NEw STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT APPLIED
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 2  Amendment to IFRS 2 – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
IFRIC 11 (IFRS 2) Group and Treasury Share Transactions
IFRS 3  Business Combinations (revised January 2008)
IFRS 8  Operating Segments

3.	 Significant	accounting	policies	continued
BASIS Of CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra‑group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
LEASING
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight‑line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
fOREIGN CuRRENCIES
The individual financial statements of each Group company are maintained in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial 
position of each Group company are expressed in US dollars, the functional currency of the Company and the presentation 
currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. non‑monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included 
in the income statement for the period. 
fOREIGN CuRRENCIES CONTINuED
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations 
are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates 
at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s 
translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation 
is disposed of.
OPERATING LOSS
Operating loss is stated before finance income, finance costs and other gains and losses.
TAxATION
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences and the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are not recognised in respect of timing differences relating to tax losses where there is insufficient evidence 
that the asset will be recovered. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised 
to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Exploration and evaluation assets
The costs of exploration properties and leases, which include the cost of acquiring prospective properties and exploration rights and 
costs incurred in exploration and evaluation activities, are capitalised as intangible assets as part of exploration and evaluation assets.
Exploration and evaluation assets are carried forward during the exploration and evaluation stage and are assessed for impairment 
in accordance with the indicators of impairment as set out in IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources. 
In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off 
in the period. no amortisation is charged prior to the commencement of production. 
When commercial production commences, exploration, evaluation and development costs previously capitalised are amortised 
over the commercial reserves of the mining property on a unit of production basis.
Mining rights
Mining rights are carried at cost to the Group and less any provisions for impairments which result from evaluations 
and assessments of potential mineral recoveries.
PROPERTY , PLANT AND EquIPMENT
Buildings and plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.  Anglo Asian Mining PLC
Annual report and accounts 2007
20
3.	 Significant	accounting	policies	continued
PROPERTY , PLANT AND EquIPMENT CONTINuED
Depreciation is provided on all depreciable property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write‑off the cost of each asset 
over its expected useful life as follows:
Leasehold improvements   Over the life of lease
Plant, equipment and motor vehicles  25% decreasing balance
Office and computer equipment  25% decreasing balance
Temporary buildings   25% decreasing balance
The cost of maintenance, repairs and replacement of minor items of property, plant and equipment are charged to the income 
statement as incurred. Renewals and asset improvements are capitalised. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected 
from its use or disposal. Upon sale or retirement of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation 
are eliminated from the financial statements. Any resulting gains or losses are included in the income statement.
IMPAIRMENT Of TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash‑generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre‑tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash‑generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount 
of the asset (cash‑generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash‑generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash‑generating unit) in prior years. A reversal 
of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. 
ASSETS CLASSIfIED AS hELD fOR SALE
non‑current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell 
and are not depreciated.
non‑current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale and completion should be expected within 
one year from the date of classification.
fINANCIAL INSTRuMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently carried at cost. Appropriate allowances 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks and in hand and short‑term deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents 
as defined above.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
rate method.

EMPLOYEE LEAvE BENEfITS
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non‑monetary benefits and accrued but unused annual leave are recognised in respect 
of employees’ services up to the reporting date. They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities 
are settled. 
RETIREMENT BENEfIT COSTS
The Group does not operate a pension scheme for the benefit of its employees but instead makes contributions to their personal 
pension policies. The contributions due for the period are charged to the income statement.
ShARE‑BASED PAYMENTS
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share‑based Payment. IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments.
The Group issues equity‑settled share‑based payments to certain employees. Equity‑settled share‑based payments are measured at 
fair value (excluding the effect of non market‑based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of the equity‑settled share‑based payments is expensed on a straight‑line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market‑based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black‑Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non‑transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
CRITICAL JuDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ThE GROuP ’S ACCOuNTING POLICIES
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, management has made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those 
involving estimations, which are dealt with below).
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
The assessment of tangible and intangible assets for any indications of impairment involves judgement. If an indication of 
impairment exists, a formal estimate of recoverable amount is performed and an impairment loss recognised to the extent that 
carrying amount exceeds recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is determined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use.
Deferred tax assets
The assessment of availability of future taxable profits involves judgement. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.
KEY SOuRCES Of ESTIMATION uNCERTAINTY
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. 
The nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The key sources of estimation uncertainty 
that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year are discussed below.
Share‑based payments
The estimation of share‑based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the 
inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen. The Group has made estimates as to the volatility of its own shares, the probable 
life of options granted and the time of exercise of those options. The model used by the Group is the Black‑Scholes pricing model. 
4. Segment information
The operations of the Group comprise one reportable segment with the primary and secondary segments identical, being the 
exploration and development of gold and copper projects in Azerbaijan.
Operations in Azerbaijan comprise of exploration and development projects for gold and copper at eight development properties 
in three separate mining areas.

In its 2007 interim results, the Group announced a write‑down of the CIL plant of $3,273,887 as discussions with interested 
parties showed that the full carrying value of the plant was unlikely to be recovered through a sale.
On 15 October 2007 the Group entered into an agreement with Celtic Resources Holdings PLC, a gold producer, to dispose 
of its CIL plant for a gross consideration of $7,500,000 (less expenses) previously being classified under assets held for sale. 
The CIL plant constitutes a processing plant, including crushing equipment, three grinding mills and carbon in leach gold 
treatment equipment.

20. financial instruments
fINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIvES AND POLICIES
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents and other short‑term deposits. The main purpose 
of these financial instruments is to finance the Group operations. The Group has other financial instruments, such as trade and 
other receivables and trade and other payables, which arise directly from its operations. Surplus cash within the Group is put 
on deposit, the objective being to maximise returns on such funds whilst ensuring that the short‑term cash flow requirements 
of the Group are met.
The Group has not used derivative financial instruments during 2007. The Board will review the need for the use of derivative 
financial instruments in the future.
INTEREST RATE RISK AND LIquIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Shortly after the IPO in 2005, the only debt in the Group was repaid and there is no debt as at 31 December 2007. Board approval 
is required for all new borrowing facilities. The Group has not used any interest rate swaps or other instruments to manage 
its interest rate profile during 2007.
At the year end the Group had cash and cash equivalents and other short‑term deposits. Short‑term deposits during the period 
included overnight, one week and monthly up to 12 months.
INTEREST RATE RISK PROfILE Of fINANCIAL ASSETS
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by maturity of the Group’s financial instruments that are exposed to interest 
rate risk:

Floating rate   1 year  1 year  Total
Short‑term deposits

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for financial instruments at the balance 
sheet date. For floating rate cash deposits, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of deposits outstanding at the balance 
sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally 
to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s loss for the year 
ended 31 December 2007 would decrease/increase by $20,825 (2006: decrease/increase by $69,250). This is mainly attributable 
to the Group’s exposure to interest rates on its floating rate cash deposits.
Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial 
assets is represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date.  Anglo Asian Mining PLC

foreign currency management
The presentational currency of the Group is US dollars. The Group is exposed to currency risk due to movements in foreign 
currencies relative to the US dollar affecting foreign currency transactions and balances.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date 
are as follows:
 Liabilities  Assets
  2007  2006  2007  2006 
  uS$  US$  uS$  US$

other 3,867  36,893  —  62
foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of United Kingdom (UK sterling) and the currency of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijan manats).
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US dollar against the relevant foreign 
currencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and 
represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes 
only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change 
in foreign currency rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the US dollar strengthens 
10% against the relevant currency. For a 10% weakening of the US dollar against the relevant currency, there would be an equal 
and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be reversed.
 UK sterling impact  Azerbaijan mantas impact

  uS$  US$  uS$  US$
Profit/(loss) 6,132  70  (5,034)  (5,618)
Market risk
Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is minimal as the Group currently has no debt. Interest rates on UK sterling and US dollar 
deposits are relatively stable and the impact of a fluctuation in the interest rate on interest earned on the Group’s short‑term 
deposits is likely to be minimal.
21. Deferred tax
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of $4,369,449 (2006: $2,683,749) available for offset against future 
profits. no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of such losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. 
Unused tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

The merger reserve was created in accordance with the merger relief provisions under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 
(as amended) relating to accounting for group reconstructions involving the issue of shares at a premium. In preparing Group 
consolidated financial statements, the amount by which the base value of the consideration for the shares allotted exceeded 
the aggregate nominal value of those shares was recorded within a merger reserve on consolidation, rather than in the share

Annual report and accounts 2007
32
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Anglo Asian Mining PLC for the year ended 31 December 2007 
which comprise the balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 17. These parent company financial statements have been prepared 
under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Anglo Asian Mining PLC for the year ended 31 December 2007. 
That report is modified by the inclusion of an emphasis of matter.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set 
out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report 
to you whether in our opinion the directors’ report is consistent with the parent company financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report as described in the contents section and consider whether it is 
consistent with the audited parent company financial statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any further information outside the annual report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company 
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order 
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
I  the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2007;
I the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
I the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Emphasis of matter – going concern and amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings
Without qualifying our opinion we draw attention to the disclosures made in note 1 of the financial statements concerning 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and the recoverability of amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings. 
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependant upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
These conditions along with other matters set out in note 1 indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast 
significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and the recoverability of amounts owed by 
subsidiary undertakings. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Company was unable 
to continue as a going concern as it is not practicable to determine or quantify them.

1.	 Significant	accounting	policies	and	going	concern
1a. Going concern
As detailed in note 1 to the Group accounts on page 18, there is a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the 
Group’s, and therefore the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. As a consequence the Company may be unable to 
realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. In addition, these uncertainties could result in the 
subsidiaries not being able to discharge their liabilities to the Company which at 31 December 2007 amounted to $18,500,516. 
For the reasons set out in note 1 to the Group accounts, the Directors have formed a judgement which assumes at the time of 
approving these financial statements that the amounts owed by the subsidiary undertakings will be recoverable and that it is 
appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis.
1b.	 Significant	accounting	policies
BASIS Of PREPARATION
The parent company financial statements of Anglo Asian Mining PLC (the “Company”) are presented as required 
by the Companies Act 1985 and were approved for issue on 25 June 2008.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Practice.
no profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and the 
Company has taken the exemption under FRS 1 not to present a cash flow statement.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and has 
not disclosed information required by that standard, as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the Company 
is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 36 of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures and has not disclosed 
information required by that standard, as the Group’s consolidated financial statements in which the Company is included, 
provide equivalent disclosures for the Group.
TANGIBLE fIxED ASSETS
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Such cost included costs 
directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Borrowing costs attributable to assets under construction 
are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Depreciation is provided on cost in annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of assets which are reviewed annually. 
The rates of depreciation are as follows:
Office and computer equipment  25% decreasing balance
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
INvESTMENTS
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
LEASED ASSETS
Rentals where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged to the profit and loss 
account on a straight‑line basis over the period of the lease.
DEBTORS
Debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision is made when 
there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover the balances in full.
DEfERRED TAxATION
Deferred tax assets are not recognised in respect of timing differences relating to tax losses where there is insufficient evidence 
that the asset will be recovered.
ShARE‑BASED PAYMENTS
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share‑based Payment from 1 January 2006. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 november 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2006. 
Application of this standard has been applied retrospectively.
The Company issues equity‑settled share‑based payments to certain employees. Equity‑settled share‑based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the date of the equity‑settled share‑based payments is expensed 
on a straight‑line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black‑Scholes pricing model. The expected lives used in the model have been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non‑transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
2. Loss attributable to members of the parent company
The loss dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company is $5,429,807 (2006: $2,133,204).

Cautionary statement
The report and accounts includes ‘forward-looking information’ within the meaning of section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933 (the ‘Securities Act’), as amended, and
section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ‘Exchange Act’), as amended. Certain sections of this annual report including, without limitation, those concerning
(i) the company’s strategies, (ii) the company’s research and product development, and information technology, (iii) the company’s investments, (iv) commencement of
operations of new plants and other facilities, (v) efficiencies, including cost savings, for the company resulting from business reviews and reorganisations, (vi) management’s view
of the general development and competition in the economies and markets in which it does, or plans to do, business, (vii) management’s view of the competitiveness of its
products and services, and (viii) the company’s liquidity, capital resources and capital expenditure, contain certain forward-looking statements concerning the company’s
operation, economic performance and financial condition.Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable,
no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct.Accordingly, results could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking
statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in economic conditions, changes in the level of capital investment by the semiconductor industry, success of business
and operating initiatives and restructuring objectives, changes in the regulatory environment, outcome of litigation, other government actions, natural phenomena such as
floods and earthquakes, customer strategies and stability, and fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.

Financial highlights
1 4.9%
1 5.4% 2004 was a good year for your company.BOC has a
consistent strategy that has been well implemented – 
a testament to all BOC’s management and staff.
Y our board owns and reviews this strategy.We follow a well-defined annual
process that allows all members of the board to examine every aspect of
the Group’s progress and opportunities. Much can be learnt by questioning
and testing in the formal environment of the boardroom, but there is 
no substitute for seeing the strategy at work in the real world, with
customers, business partners and staff. For that reason we hold two board
meetings each year outside our Windlesham headquarters.We went to
China in the autumn of 2003 and saw the impressive work underway in 
the Shanghai and Nanjing areas to develop world-scale petrochemical
complexes; these are areas where BOC has established an important
presence.We also spent a day with the management team of our logistics
business, Gist. For our first meeting of the 2005 financial year we visited
South Africa and saw the progressive economic and social developments 
to which our Afrox subsidiary is making a major contribution. Over the 
next 12 months we will also visit Poland and the US.
An important element of the strategy over recent years has been 
to reshape our portfolio of businesses to enhance future growth and
profitability.We will continue to examine opportunities as and when 
they arise.
Returns to our shareholders
In 2004 BOC paid a first interim dividend of 15.5p per share in February
2004 and a second interim dividend of 24.5p per share in August, making a
total of 40p for the year as a whole, an increase of 2.6 per cent on 2003.
Having held the first interim dividend at 15.5p for several years, while
growing the second interim dividend, we have reached our aim of a 40:60
ratio between the two interim dividends. As a result your board has
decided to raise the first interim dividend by 2.6 per cent to 15.9p to be
paid on 1 February 2005. In 2004 our dividends were covered 1.58 times
by adjusted earnings and we look to build our dividend cover towards two-
times over the medium term.We therefore aim to grow the dividend
progressively, albeit at a lower rate than earnings per share growth.
Again this year, as in the two previous years, I include graphs 
comparing BOC’s total shareholder returns since 2000 with all FTSE100
companies and with its main gases competitors.The message remains 
the same.We have performed well compared with other UK companies
but a gap requires to be bridged with our competitors.

CHAIRMAN’S 
ST A TEMENT Corporate Governance
BOC complies with the existing Combined Code on Corporate
Governance and I reported last year that we already substantially complied
with the revisions to the code announced in 2003, even though we need
not have done so until 2005.This is part of our continuing commitment 
to the highest standards of governance and integrity.Throughout BOC
there is a strong commitment to the principles of ACTS – accountability,
collaboration, transparency and stretch.These principles, supported by a
well established Code of Conduct, provide strong safeguards at all levels 
of the organisation.
Corporate responsibility
Y our company is well aware that it is judged not only by its financial success
but also by how this financial success is achieved. How well we manage
social, environmental and ethical (SEE) risks is important to the long-term
health of our business. For the first time this year BOC participated in the
independent survey of companies’ corporate responsibility performance
conducted by the UK’s Business in the Community. 500 companies 
were invited to participate, 139 did so, including 56 from the FTSE100.
BOC was ranked 25th with an aggregate score of well over 90 per cent.
This was a good result and confirmed our belief that we are performing
well against these measures. More recently, we have surveyed all our
business units to gain a thorough understanding of how they see our 
SEE risks and how we are managing them.This will form the basis of 
our next series of initiatives.
A US subsidiary of The BOC Group, along with other companies in
the welding products industry, has been the subject of injury claims based
on allegations that manganese in welding fumes causes Parkinson’s disease
or symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease.We are not aware of any
credible scientific evidence linking manganese in welding fumes to
neurological damage under typical welding conditions.
Board of directors
We welcomed three new non-executive directors to our board this year.
Guy Dawson joined in March. He was until 2003 chairman of European
investment banking at Merrill Lynch having previously been with Morgan
Grenfell and Deutsche Bank.Anne Quinn and Iain Napier were appointed
in May.Anne is group vice president of BP’s gas, power and renewables
business stream. Iain is chief executive of T aylor Woodrow and brings
previous experience of the brewing industry. Fabiola Arredondo and
Roberto Mendoza resigned from the board during the year, each because
of increasing demands on their time from their other commitments.
Both Fabiola and Roberto have made valuable contributions to BOC 
for which I thank them.
05 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Chairman’s statement
In May I announced that T ony Isaac had accepted the board’s invitation 
to continue as your chief executive until the Annual General Meeting 
in January 2007.We are very pleased that he will continue to provide
leadership in the successful execution of our strategy.
My thanks always go first to BOC’s employees around the world 
as they make your company what it is. It is our talented and dedicated
people that make the difference in a competitive market. I thank our
customers for choosing BOC. I thank all those who partner, supply and
contribute to BOC wherever we do business. Finally, I thank you our
shareholders for your continuing support.
Rob Margetts Chairman BOC performed strongly in 2004 in a generally favourable
economic environment.Each quarter we reported adjusted
operating profit and earnings significantly ahead of the
equivalent period in 2003.Our two gases lines of business,
Process Gas Solutions and Industrial and Special Products,
saw mostly buoyant trading conditions although the
strength of the rand restrained industrial activity in South
Africa.Semiconductor manufacturers increased their
investment this year after an extended period of reduced
activity and this benefited BOC Edwards.As a result 
we reported adjusted operating profit for the year of 
£576.9 million,up 15 per cent,on turnover up nine per cent
at £4,599.3 million.Adjusted profit before tax rose 
20 per cent.
I explained last year that our adjusted figures eliminate exceptional items
that would otherwise create distortions.Also our year-on-year comparisons
are at constant currency, shorn of the effects of converting local profits into
sterling.This way we show clearly how we performed in the competitive
markets of the 50 or so countries where we operate.When I describe 
our business performance below I will do so on this basis. Our statutory
results include exceptional items and reflect currency movements when
comparing performance with last year. On this basis turnover increased 
by six per cent, operating profit by 28 per cent and profit before tax by 
17 per cent.
Successful businesses
Process Gas Solutions delivered a nine per cent increase in turnover and
raised adjusted operating profit by ten per cent.At the start of the year in
China we and our joint venture partners announced that we would invest
over US$100 million in three schemes at T aiyuan, Suzhou and in the Pearl
River region. In June 2004 we announced the setting up of a joint venture
with Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Ltd (SPC).This is the
second joint venture with a subsidiary of Sinopec, China’s leading
petrochemical company, following our agreement in 2002 with Sinopec
Yangzi Petrochemical Corporation.This second joint venture intends to
invest in some 3,000 tonnes a day of industrial gas production assets
currently owned by SPC before embarking on building a new world-scale
air separation unit.This flow of new orders means that we will double our
production capacity in China by the end of 2005, with a corresponding
increase in turnover. Elsewhere we were successful in winning key hydrogen
orders for BP and Sunoco refineries in the US, in acquiring Duke Energy’s
30 per cent ownership interest in Compañía de Nitrógeno de Cantarell,
the joint venture company that owns the world’s largest nitrogen complex
in Mexico, and in winning the order with our joint venture partners for 
the largest air separation unit in Thailand.As well as supplying hydrogen 
for today’s applications we continue to invest for the opportunities
predicted for hydrogen energy in the decades to come.
Industrial and Special Products grew both turnover and adjusted
operating profit by three per cent and ten per cent respectively. 2004 
was the first full year of contributions from two recent acquisitions,
namely Praxair’s Polish gases business and Air Products’ packaged gas
business in Canada.
06 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REVIEW
“SIGNIFICANTL Y
IMPROVED
PERFORMANCE 
OVER 2003” BOC Edwards saw the long-awaited upturn in investment by the
semiconductor industry as well as increased demand from growing
markets, notably flat panel displays in Asia.The result was a 27 per cent 
rise in turnover and a 181 per cent increase in adjusted operating profit.
Gist, our logistics business, did well to maintain turnover following 
the loss last year of Marks & Spencer’s general merchandise business.
Adjusted operating profit fell by 14 per cent, but in 2003 we included a 
£4.1 million gain resulting from the M&S contract termination; without 
this one-off payment adjusted operating profit would have been flat 
year on year.
Afrox hospitals continued to grow and perform well, turnover rising 
by nine per cent and adjusted operating profit by 16 per cent.
In November 2003 we announced that African Oxygen Limited 
had agreed to sell its majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited 
to a consortium led by two major black economic empowerment
investors.We then announced in January 2004 our intention to sell our US
packaged gas business, part of our north American Industrial and Special
Products unit, to Airgas for up to US$200 million.We completed the US
disposal successfully in July this year while the Afrox Healthcare sale remains 
subject to final clearance by the competition authorities in South Africa.
The motives for these two disposals were very different. In Afrox
Healthcare we have a business in which we have invested successfully 
over recent years.The medium to long-term future for private healthcare 
is uncertain in South Africa and we had the opportunity to sell a highly
successful business and let it develop further under new black economic
empowerment ownership. Our US packaged gas business also received
much attention and investment over the years, but it never fulfilled its
promise. Its sale and the successful transfer of over 1,000 of our employees
to the new owner is a good outcome.We retain a large presence in 
the US, with substantial and successful businesses that will benefit from
increased management focus and a reduced overhead cost base.
The two significant joint ventures we have established in the last 
two years – Linde BOC Process Plants and Japan Air Gases – continue 
to perform well.
Cash
Operating cash flow was £758.5 million, up some eight per cent on last
year, due to improved operating profit and better management of working
capital. In addition, proceeds from disposals and lower levels of capital
expenditure resulted in a decline in our net borrowings for the sixth
successive quarter, ending the year down £405.7 million at £962.4 million.
This was after paying a further £64 million into the main UK pensions
scheme, an increase of £28 million over last year.
07 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Managing to the highest standards
We continue to use our global structure to transfer best operating and
commercial practice, to offer the highest standards of service to all our
customers, and to meet the needs of our key customers wherever they 
do business in the world. Our operating procedures are supported by
global programmes such as our Code of Conduct and we work hard to 
tap the full potential of our diverse and talented workforce.
It is important that we manage all our business risks, not just the
financial ones. Operating as we do in a hazardous industry, everyone 
must pay the greatest attention to safety, whether it be the safety of 
fellow employees, of our customers and suppliers or indeed of those 
in the communities where we live and work.We concentrate on 
making safety second nature for all our employees. By managing these 
non-financial risks we protect our business and the reputation of BOC.
There has been one change this year to the executive management
team. Greg Sedgwick returned to his native Australia to take up an
appointment as chief executive of a listed building products company;
I wish him well in his future career. Mark Nichols, who had been based 
in Singapore, has succeeded Greg as Group director for business
development. BOC is fortunate in having good people at all levels of the
organisation and we place great emphasis on recruiting, developing and
retaining the best people wherever we find them in the world.We have 
a diverse workforce and I take a personal interest in ensuring that this
diversity is reflected increasingly at all levels.
I thank all employees of BOC for their hard work and for the
contribution they have made to a successful year. Keeping our customers
satisfied is more important than ever and we strive to deliver the same 
high standard of service wherever our customers choose to do business
with us.We work hard to deliver the financial returns our shareholders
expect.We are also well aware of the wider responsibilities we have to 
the economic and social life of the countries where we operate.All of 
this depends on the people of BOC and they respond by delivering 
high performance day by day.

GROUP PROFILE
Introduction
The BOC Group began its business life over 100 years ago as the Brin’s Oxygen Company. The company was
incorporated in England in 1886 and adopted its present name on 1 March 1982.
A technology to extract oxygen from the air in commercial quantities had just been developed and in 1886
the Brin brothers started production at a factory in Westminster, London. T wo uses had already been found for
oxygen. One was to intensify limelight, which was then used in theatres. The other was to assist patients’ breathing
during and after surgery. New technology was soon developed that allowed air to be separated into all its major
components - nitrogen, oxygen and argon. By 1960, industrial gases were in widespread use and BOC’s business
was firmly established. T onnage plants were supplying steelworks with oxygen and the customer base had been
broadened to extend from metal cutting and welding to food and medicine. The business had also spread
overseas with subsidiaries or associated companies as far away as Australia and South Africa. During the 1980s,
BOC’s South African subsidiary began to invest in private hospitals. This diversification was the basis of the current
Afrox hospitals segment.
BOC acquired the vacuum equipment company Edwards High Vacuum International Limited in 1968 and this
formed the basis of what was to become the BOC Edwards line of business today.
The BOC Distribution Services business (now called Gist) was first established in 1970, initially providing a
chilled food distribution service for Marks & Spencer and relying upon distribution skills and liquid nitrogen chilling
technology, acquired as a result of BOC’s involvement in gases.
In 1978, BOC completed the acquisition of Airco Inc in America, a predominantly gases business that
doubled the Group’s size and brought BOC for the first time into the US gases market. In the period from 1970
to 1990 The BOC Group significantly increased its presence in the Asia/Pacific region through participation in
several joint ventures or associated companies. BOC established strong market positions in Thailand, Indonesia,
T aiwan, the Philippines, China and Korea.
An investment in 1982 gave BOC effective management control of the Japanese gases company Osaka Sanso
Kogyo KK (OSK). Conversion of loan stock and subsequent purchases of shares raised BOC’s holding in OSK to
97 per cent. In September 2002 BOC and Air Liquide announced a conditional agreement to merge their
industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan. The merger became effective in January 2003 and BOC’s
subsidiary in Japan has retained a 45 per cent interest in the joint venture company called Japan Air Gases Ltd.
In the period from 1998 to 2001, BOC increased investments in its gases companies in Thailand, Indonesia and 
the Philippines by acquiring the interests of joint venture partners or minority shareholders.
The BOC Group has an international portfolio of companies operating as three lines of business. These are
Process Gas Solutions (PGS), Industrial and Special Products (ISP) and BOC Edwards. In addition there are two
separately managed specialist businesses, Afrox hospitals and Gist. Operating results are reported separately for
these five segments.
The main exports of the Group in 2004 were special products from the UK, helium from the US and
vacuum equipment and semiconductor manufacturing equipment from the UK, the US and Japan. Trade between
Group undertakings is conducted at fair market prices.
Although BOC Process Plants was combined with Linde Engineering in the US with effect from September
2002, BOC retains an interest in the manufacture of industrial gas equipment though its Cryostar business based in
France. Cryostar makes specialist cryogenic pumps and expansion turbines that are used by most manufacturers of
industrial gas plant. In recent years Cryostar has also developed a strong position in the market for shipboard
compressors and heat exchangers used aboard liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers. Management believes that
Cryostar is the leading manufacturer of its product range worldwide.

The BOC Group contributes to the economies of some 50 countries throughout the world. The UK is the largest
single source of sales revenue for the Group’s products and services, followed by the US. Other major geographic
areas for the Group are Australia, South Africa, Japan and other markets in the Asia/Pacific region. The business
therefore operates from a broad geographical base with local manufacturing in most of the key overseas markets. 15 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004

The UK accounts for the largest part of the Group’s activities in Europe but BOC has significant gases subsidiaries
in Ireland and Poland, vacuum products manufacturing in France and a pharmaceutical packaging machinery
operation in the Netherlands.
Gist, BOC’s supply chain solutions business, operates principally in the UK but also has operations in other
countries.
Subsidiaries in the US are engaged in the Group’s three lines of business. The Group’s other principal
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in the Americas are located in Canada, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile and
Mexico.
The largest Group subsidiary in Africa is African Oxygen Limited (Afrox), a South African public company 
in which the Group owns 56 per cent of the equity. The largest shareholder, other than BOC, holds less than 
15 per cent of the equity. Afrox, primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries, is engaged in the manufacture and
sale of products within the PGS and ISP lines of business. Afrox also has interests in private hospitals, clinics and
other health care services in southern Africa, primarily through its 69 per cent holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited.
There are other Group or Afrox subsidiary companies in Africa located in Botswana, Kenya, Malawi,
Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. These companies are engaged primarily in 
the manufacture and/or sale of products in the ISP line of business.
BOC has businesses in most of the Asia/Pacific markets, including Japan, Korea, Thailand, T aiwan, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, China, the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia and New Zealand. In Australia,
the Group’s business is conducted by BOC Limited. This company, as well as its subsidiaries, joint ventures or
associates, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products in the PGS and ISP lines of business. BOC
participates in the liquefied petroleum gas market in Australia through a 50 per cent shareholding in Elgas Limited.
Elsewhere in the Pacific region, the Group conducts its business through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated
companies.
Management organisation
BOC’s management structure is based on three global lines of business and two specialist businesses. Each line of
business serves a clearly defined type of customer and each pursues its own strategy for growth and performance
at a local level. The organisation is designed to maximise BOC’s global as well as local strengths. The lines of
business have global responsibility to set strategy and prioritise investment. They include operational business units
and these local units are responsible to the Group chief executive for delivering financial, safety and operational
performance. The business units contribute to the development of the strategies of the lines of business and
customise and implement them in local markets. The business unit heads collaborate in order to share best
practice and to maximise growth and profit opportunities wherever they may appear.
Process Gas Solutions (PGS) manages all aspects of BOC’s business with customers requiring bulk supplies 
of industrial gases from on-site plants or by pipeline as well as deliveries of liquefied gases. T ypical customers are
found in the oil and chemicals, food and beverage, metals, and glass sectors all round the world. Marketing,
business development and the execution of investments to provide customer specific solutions for the supply of
industrial gases are handled by Process Systems, which forms part of PGS. Until 2002, Process Plants, another unit
forming part of PGS, was responsible for supplying air separation technology within the Group with plants of its
own design or acquired from alliance partners and others. In March 2002 BOC announced plans to merge its
Process Plants operations with Linde Engineering in the US to form a new company, Linde BOC Process Plants
LLC. The transaction was completed just before the end of 2002. BOC owns 30 per cent of the combined
company and Linde Engineering has become the principal supplier of industrial gases plant to BOC worldwide.
Industrial and Special Products (ISP) covers BOC’s business with customers in the fabrication, medical and
leisure sectors as well as the special products and liquefied petroleum gases businesses.
BOC Edwards embraces all aspects of business with semiconductor industry customers worldwide including
the supply of bulk gases and electronic materials, vacuum and abatement technology, chemical management
systems and semiconductor-related services. BOC Edwards also serves general vacuum markets around the world
and manufactures pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging machinery.

Group profile
The segment reporting as Afrox hospitals operates through Afrox Healthcare Limited, which is quoted on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange. It owns and manages private hospitals and clinics in southern Africa. Additional
services include a direct medicines service for chronic medication, occupational health services, nursing training,
pharmacy management and laboratory services. BOC’s majority-owned subsidiary, African Oxygen Limited
(Afrox), holds 69 per cent of Afrox Healthcare Limited (AHealth). In July 2003 Afrox announced that it was in the
process of considering its strategic options with regard to its shareholding in AHealth. On 17 November 2003,
Afrox announced that it had agreed to sell its entire holding in AHealth to a consortium led by two major 
black economic empowerment investors. The sale remains subject to approval by the South African Competition
Tribunal, at which closing hearings are currently scheduled for March 2005. In addition an application has been
brought in the South African High Court by two shareholders in Afrox Healthcare Limited to have the Scheme of
Arrangement, by which the disposal would be implemented, declared to have lapsed. This application, which is
being opposed, is currently due to be heard in the week commencing 29 November 2004.
During 2001, BOC Distribution Services was re-named Gist to reflect the changing nature of its business.
Gist operates as a separate business unit outside the lines of business structure. It remains focused on developing
business with major customers, including Marks & Spencer, and has developed capability in supply chain
consultancy and end-to-end supply chain solutions.
Corporate development
Over the last three years BOC has continued to invest in its core businesses at the same time as divesting assets
and businesses that were no longer consistent with its strategy.
As a result of a successful tender offer, BOC increased its shareholding in Osaka Sanso Kogyo KK (OSK) in
Japan from approximately 55 per cent to over 93 per cent with effect from 8 May 2001. The holding was further
increased during 2002 to 97 per cent. In September 2002 BOC and Air Liquide announced a conditional
agreement to merge their industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan. The merger became effective in January
2003 and BOC’s subsidiary in Japan has retained a 45 per cent interest in the combined company called Japan Air
Gases Ltd. In June 2001, BOC increased its holding in Thai Industrial Gases Public Company Limited (TIG) from
approximately 60 per cent to over 90 per cent and launched a tender offer for the outstanding shares leading to
99 per cent ownership.
In October 2001 BOC Edwards agreed terms for the acquisition of the vacuum and pressure business of the
Smiths Group. These businesses are located in the UK, north America and continental Europe and typically serve
customers in the metallurgy, water treatment, food, power and chemical industries.
Hydromatix and Semco were also acquired during 2002 with the intention of positioning BOC Edwards in
those market segments expected to deliver the fastest growth. These two companies, based in the US, are
involved principally in semiconductor wet processing technology including chemical blending delivery and collection
systems as well as liquid waste abatement systems.
BOC Edwards sold its glass coating business, based in the US, in April 2002 but retained its T emescal business
that supplies technology for compound semiconductor manufacturing.
The acquisition of the turbomolecular pumps business from Seiko Instruments Inc in Japan was announced in
February 2002 and completed in March 2002 with the principal objective of enhancing the ability of BOC Edwards
to develop vacuum sub-systems to satisfy the growing trend to on-tool pumping in the semiconductor industry.
In April 2002 BOC purchased Matheson Gas Products Canada Inc, thereby adding an important special
products capability to BOC’s Industrial and Special Products range in Canada.
In May 2002 BOC acquired Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited (UGP), in Thailand.
UGP is a leading supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and packaged ammonia in the industrial and special
products markets.
In March 2002 BOC announced plans to merge its Process Plants operations with Linde Engineering in the
US to form a new company, Linde BOC Process Plants LLC. The transaction was completed at the end of
September 2002. BOC owns 30 per cent of the combined company and Linde Engineering has become the
principal supplier of industrial gases plant to BOC worldwide.
BOC’s associated company in Malaysia acquired 35.6 per cent of the gases company Nissan Industrial Oxygen
Inc (NIOI) in March 2002 and increased its holding to 100 per cent in September 2002 following a tender offer.
Each of BOC’s three lines of business has absorbed a part of NIOI.
At the end of August 2002, BOC announced an agreement to purchase Praxair’s Polish gases business.
The transaction was completed at the end of January 2003 following approval by the Polish competition authority.
The business acquired includes a high proportion of industrial and special products sales.
In October 2002, BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation (EMC), a privately owned water
services company based in St Louis, Missouri. EMC manages water and wastewater treatment facilities for both
industrial and local municipal customers around the US. EMC forms part of the PGS line of business, which intends
to expand the range of solutions offered to its industrial customer base.
At the end of January 2003, BOC acquired the partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake, T exas, from
Celanese. Under the agreement BOC fulfils a significant proportion of the industrial gas requirements for the
Celanese chemical facility at Clear Lake.
In March 2003 BOC announced an agreement to purchase the Canadian packaged gas and related welding
equipment business of Air Products. The acquisition was completed in April 2003 following approval from the
Canadian regulatory authority. 17 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
In June 2003, BOC announced an agreement to obtain half the output of a new helium extraction facility to be
constructed in Qatar. Deliveries from the new source are scheduled to commence in July 2005.
Following a strategic review of its investment, African Oxygen Limited (Afrox) announced on 17 November
2003 that it had agreed to sell its majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium led by two
major black economic empowerment investors in South Africa. The sale remains subject to approval by the South
African Competition Tribunal, at which closing hearings are currently scheduled for March 2005. In addition an
application has been brought in the South African High Court by two shareholders in Afrox Healthcare Limited to
have the Scheme of Arrangement, by which the disposal would be implemented, declared to have lapsed. This
application, which is being opposed, is currently due to be heard in the week commencing 29 November 2004.
On 27 January 2004, BOC announced that it intended to dispose of part of its US Industrial and Special
Products business to Airgas Inc. The transaction was completed on 30 July 2004. The initial consideration was
US$175 million in cash with up to a further US$25 million to be paid on or about 15 November 2005 subject to
certain conditions.
In May 2004 BOC agreed to buy Duke Energy’s 30 per cent ownership interest in the Cantarell joint venture
company for US$59.7 million in cash. This increased BOC’s overall stake to 65 per cent on completion in
September 2004. This company supplies Pemex with nitrogen for the pressurisation of its oilfields in the Gulf

The BOC Group is one of the major producers of industrial gases in the world. Its products include the
atmospheric gases (nitrogen, oxygen and argon) produced by air separation plants as well as hydrogen, carbon
monoxide and syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) made by technologies including steam-
reforming or partial oxidation of hydrocarbons. The Group also markets carbon dioxide, helium and liquefied
petroleum gas. These are generally derived as by-products from chemical processes or from natural sources and
are also purchased from other producers. In addition, the Group markets dissolved acetylene and a wide range of
special gases, medical gases, gas mixtures and gaseous chemicals.
Industry structure and consolidation The industrial gases business is capital-intensive, with increasing demand,
together with economies of scale, leading to the need for large production units and distribution networks.
The need for fixed asset investments, the trend towards global customers and the benefits from the transfer of
applications technology worldwide have resulted in the business being handled by a relatively small number of
companies internationally.
One or more other major international producers compete in each of the industrial gases markets served by
the Group, and in many of the markets there are smaller local producers as well. International competitors include
Air Liquide, Praxair, Air Products and Chemicals, Linde, Airgas and Nippon Sanso. The world market for gases and
related products is estimated to be over £20 billion a year.
On 13 July 1999 the board of The BOC Group agreed the terms of a pre-conditional cash offer at £14.60 per
share to be made jointly by Air Liquide and Air Products. Making the offer was conditional upon those companies
obtaining satisfactory regulatory clearances in Europe, Canada and the US by 13 March 2000. Following an
extension to the pre-conditional offer period to conclude discussions with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
in the US, the bidders allowed the offer to lapse on 10 May 2000.
Principal industrial gas products Nitrogen possesses two key characteristics that make it the world’s most widely
used and versatile industrial gas. Nitrogen is almost inert and when liquefied it is intensely cold. This makes liquid
nitrogen a highly effective, versatile and non-polluting agent for freezing and chilling.
Under normal conditions nitrogen is chemically inactive. This makes it an important purging and blanketing gas
in the chemical and refining industry as well as in the electronics industry.
Oxygen, in contrast to nitrogen, is useful for its reactivity. It supports combustion and it supports life.
Oxygen has been used in welding and medicine for over 100 years and in steel production since the 1950s.
Iron and steel producers use oxygen to accelerate melting and to improve metal quality during the refining
process. It is also used by the oil and chemicals industries and many others for a variety of oxidation processes.
Mixed with fuel gases, oxygen provides a heat source for many welding, cutting and metal fabrication processes.
Argon makes up less than one per cent of the atmosphere but it is the most abundant truly inert gas. It is
used to provide a shielding atmosphere in welding, metal fabrication, aluminium processing, microelectronics, glass
coating, advanced ceramics and other industrial processes. It is also used in the steel industry, principally in the
production of stainless steel.
Hydrogen is typically produced by steam reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas, petroleum gas, or liquid
or solid hydrocarbon feedstocks. Hydrogen may also be recovered from by-products purchased by BOC from
external suppliers. Hydrogen is used primarily in the oil and chemicals industries for applications aimed at
upgrading crude oil through hydrocracking to form lighter fractions and to remove sulphur in the production of
cleaner fuels. The chemicals industry also uses hydrogen where it is required as an active ingredient in many large-
scale processes.
Helium is extracted from natural gas deposits. Only a few sources in the world contain a sufficient proportion
of helium to justify its separation. The Group’s supplies now come from the US, Poland and Russia and are secured
by long-term contracts. In June 2003, BOC announced an agreement to obtain half the output from a new helium
extraction facility to be constructed in Qatar. Deliveries from this new source are expected to begin in July 2005.
Because of its high value, helium is the only major industrial gas to be extensively traded internationally. Helium is
used in welding, leak detection, hospital MRI scanners and in the production of optical fibres. Helium gas mixtures
are used in balloons.

Group profile
Carbon dioxide supplied by BOC is obtained as a by-product from other companies’ manufacturing processes,
from natural sources or recovered in the generation process for hydrogen or syngas and put to constructive use.
Solid carbon dioxide is, like liquid nitrogen, used for chilling and freezing in the food industry. As a gas it is used to
carbonate and dispense beverages of all kinds.
Acetylene is normally supplied in cylinders and used together with oxygen in metal cutting and welding
applications. BOC is a major manufacturer of dissolved acetylene.
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a fuel gas with a wide variety of domestic, industrial and transport
applications. BOC is a major distributor of LPG in South Africa and Thailand, and its joint venture company Elgas
Limited is a major distributor in Australia. BOC has smaller market positions in several other countries.
Production of industrial gases Oxygen was first extracted from the atmosphere by a chemical process. This was
superseded over 80 years ago by the cryogenic (low temperature) process involving the liquefaction and distillation
of air. The cryogenic process is still by far the most widely used, but non-cryogenic techniques (pressure swing
adsorption and membrane diffusion), which were first developed during the 1970s, are becoming increasingly
significant for smaller or less demanding on-site applications.
Cryogenic air separation is a mature and stable technology, although incremental technical advances are still
yielding improvements in capital cost, operating cost, ease of operation and reliability. The only significant ‘raw
material’, apart from the air itself, is electricity, which is used in large quantities to drive compressors, pumps and
other equipment. The production process in modern air separation plants is highly automated, and remote
operation of BOC’s plants from control centres is becoming increasingly common.
The production of hydrogen and syngas uses steam reforming or partial oxidation of hydrocarbon feedstocks
such as natural gas, petroleum or coal to separate the hydrogen and carbon compounds. The choice of feedstock
is related to their prices in local markets.
Distribution of industrial gases Industrial gases may be supplied to customers in a variety of ways; through
pipelines from on-site or nearby cryogenic or non-cryogenic plants, by deliveries of liquefied gases in road or rail
tankers, in portable cryogenic containers or in cylinders (also called compressed or packaged gases).
Distribution is an important competitive factor in the industrial gases business and the methods of distribution
vary according to the nature of the products themselves and the customer’s volume requirements. Most gases
have to be stored and distributed either under great pressure, which requires them to be carried in heavy and
bulky cylinders, or at extremely low temperatures in specially insulated tankers, which limits how far they can be
transported before carriage costs become unacceptable. Pipeline delivery involves high capital costs and the
routing is inflexible. As a result, there is little international trade in industrial gases. Production has to occur in or
near the market being served and there is a trend towards production at customers’ own sites.
Business segments
The BOC Group reports financial results for the three lines of business and for Afrox hospitals and Gist separately.
Process Gas Solutions (PGS)
This line of business covers BOC’s business with larger-scale industrial customers worldwide, typically in the oil and
chemicals, food and beverage, metals, and glass sectors. Gases and services are supplied as part of customer-
specific solutions that create the most value for customers at the lowest cost to BOC. These range from supply by
pipeline or from dedicated on-site plants to the largest users, to supply by road tanker in liquefied form to others.
T onnage (pipeline) customers are usually supplied on the basis of long-term contracts, typically containing a
fixed facility charge together with a variable charge for product supplied in excess of a set minimum quantity.
Revenues from these contracts thus have a measure of stability with respect to changes in demand for product.
T onnage plants are often built to produce merchant gases in addition to those required by the tonnage customer
and these gases can be sold to other customers. The BOC Group has substantial positions in the tonnage markets
of the UK, the US, Australia, South Africa and Asia as well as in some smaller markets. The products supplied to
tonnage customers have traditionally been the atmospheric gases oxygen, nitrogen and argon. More recently,
hydrogen and syngas are becoming significant tonnage products as are associated utilities including steam 
and power.
The delivery of liquefied gases by road or rail to the customer’s site is normally limited by transport costs to a
radius of about 200 miles. Product for this market is supplied either from merchant plants or from tonnage plants
incorporating liquefiers. Larger users are typically supplied with product in liquid form delivered in cryogenic
tankers into special storage vessels installed at customer premises. T ankers and vessels are often BOC Group
owned. Liquefied gases are usually supplied on the basis of contracts with terms of one to five years. Revenues are
generally based upon the actual quantity of gas consumed, with an additional fixed charge for the use of storage
equipment.
The growth of sales and profit in this line of business is driven by investment in new production facilities.
Such investment is predominantly the result of opportunities to satisfy long-term supply contracts with one or
more heavy industrial customers for each plant.
Marketing, business development and the execution of investments to provide customer-specific solutions for
the supply of industrial gases are handled by Process Systems, which forms part of PGS. 19 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Business development A plant to supply OneSteel at Whyalla in South Australia was commissioned in November
2001 also replacing and increasing capacity over previous and less efficient merchant plants in Adelaide. Shortly
afterwards in January 2002 a new plant began supplying Huntsman on T eesside in the UK with hydrogen to be
used for the production of aniline.
In April 2002, BOC established a joint venture in Nanjing with Yangtze Petrochemical Corporation (YPC),
which is a subsidiary of Sinopec, China’s leading petrochemical company. BOC purchased existing air separation
assets with effect from May 2002 and construction of new air separation capacity is almost complete. BOC’s joint
venture will be a supplier to a new BASF and YPC joint venture plant also under construction and scheduled to
begin production in 2005. Additional liquefaction capacity was added to the existing air separation facility during
2003. These investments give BOC a strategic position as a key supplier in the Nanjing area, which is being
developed through foreign investment as a leading centre for chemical production in China.
In the US a new plant began to supply WCI Steel in Ohio in May 2002 and a plant at Midland, North
Carolina, began production in June 2002.
The merger of BOC Process Plants operations with Linde Engineering in the US to form a new company,
Linde BOC Process Plants LLC was completed at the end of September 2002. BOC owns 30 per cent of the
combined company and Linde Engineering has become the principal supplier of industrial gases plant to BOC
worldwide.
In October 2002, BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation (EMC), a privately owned water
services company based in St Louis, Missouri. EMC manages water and wastewater treatment facilities for both
industrial and local municipal customers around the US. EMC’s management services extend to steam systems,
cold and chilled water systems and wastewater treatment. Customers include small to medium sized municipalities
and industrial customers, many of which are in the food sector. EMC forms part of the PGS line of business and
BOC’s strategy is to expand the range of solutions offered to its industrial customer base.
At the end of January 2003, BOC acquired the partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake, T exas, from
Celanese. Under the agreement BOC fulfils a significant proportion of the industrial gas requirements for the
Celanese chemical facility at Clear Lake. The Celanese facility is located on the Houston ship canal, and includes a
world scale vinyl acetate monomer plant and the world’s largest acetic acid plant. These require large quantities of
oxygen and nitrogen as well as carbon monoxide.
A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide (HyCO) plant supplying the Thai Polycarbonate Company for the
manufacture of plastic resins began production in 2003.
In October 2003, BOC commissioned a new hydrogen plant supplying Citgo’s oil refinery at Lemont, Illinois.
The hydrogen is used in the removal of sulphur to produce clean fuels.
In the same month BOC, and its joint venture partners, announced plans to invest over US$100 million in
developing three schemes in China, at T aiyuan, Suzhou and in the Pearl River region.
BOC-TISCO, the joint venture between BOC Gases and T aiyuan Iron and Steel Corporation (TISCO), will
build two new air separation units (ASUs) with each to supply 1,400 tonnes a day of oxygen to TISCO’s plant in
Shanxi province in north-central China. The new ASUs represent an investment of US$82 million and they are
scheduled to begin coming on stream after the end of 2005. This investment is in response to strong demand for
stainless steel in China and will support TISCO’s vigorous expansion plans.
Through Hong Kong Oxygen, its joint venture company in southern China, BOC has reached an agreement
with Guangzhou Iron & Steel (GIS) for their joint venture company Pearl River Gases (PRG) to build a further two
ASUs, adding around 400 tonnes of production to its current operations. This new investment is scheduled to
come on stream early in 2005, supporting the expansion of steel manufacturing in southern China.
BOC’s wholly owned subsidiaries in Suzhou have begun construction of new on-site supply scheme pipelines
to meet increasing demand for industrial gases from key customers in Suzhou Industrial Park and the Suzhou New
District Industrial Park.
A new hydrogen plant to supply both a Sunoco refinery, and a nearby BP refinery is to be built at T oledo,
Ohio. The hydrogen will be used by both BP and Sunoco in the production of ultra-low sulphur gasoline and diesel
fuels. The complex will be capable of supplying over 120 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen. BOC’s
partner for engineering and construction is Linde BOC Process Plants of T ulsa, Oklahoma. BOC is investing more
than US$100 million in the facility, which is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2005.
In May 2004 BOC agreed to buy Duke Energy’s 30 per cent ownership interest in the Cantarell joint venture
company for US$59.7 million in cash. This increased BOC’s overall stake to 65 per cent on completion in
September 2004. This company supplies Pemex with nitrogen for the pressurisation of its oilfields in the Gulf 
of Mexico.
In China, significant new business was won in the chemical sector with the Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical
Company. BOC will form a joint venture to invest in existing assets and then add further air separation capacity.
BOC’s subsidiary in Thailand is to invest in a venture establishing a 1,300 tonnes-a-day plant to supply TOC
Glycol Co. Ltd. (TOCGC) in Map T a Phut and to increase merchant capacity in the area. When completed early in
2006, this will be the largest air separation unit in Thailand. It will be owned and operated by a joint venture
between BOC’s Thai subsidiary (TIG) and Bangkok Industrial Gas Company.
Group profile 20 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Group profile
Industrial and Special Products (ISP) 
Gases for cutting and welding, hospitality, laboratory applications and a variety of medical purposes are mainly
distributed under pressure in cylinders. The ISP line of business covers products and services provided to this
section of the market together with sales of packaged chemicals and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Customers are
typically in the fabrication, engineering, automotive, refrigeration, hospitality or medical sectors. The customer base
is therefore broad and varied. The number of separate customers served by ISP is much greater than the other
two lines of business and the quality of service is often the key factor in securing existing or obtaining new
customers. In order to raise service standards at the same time as reducing costs, national customer service
centres have been successfully established in all the major markets.
In addition to supplying gases, BOC also supplies a range of associated equipment in many of its major
markets. This includes cutting and welding products and, in some markets, associated safety equipment.
BOC has devoted considerable attention over the last three years to understand the requirements of
different types of customer in its major markets and to provide the required service at an appropriate price.
Such customer segmentation programmes have been implemented in the UK, South Africa, Australia, Asia, Latin
America and are in progress elsewhere.
The cutting and welding applications are a relatively mature part of the industrial gases business and growth
opportunities are principally in other segments of the market such as medical applications, packaged chemicals,
hospitality and services. BOC is pursuing these opportunities by the development of new products, packages and
services as well as by marketing initiatives to take advantage of BOC’s global capabilities by introducing existing
products to new regions. Electronic commerce has also become an important tool for sustaining and growing sales
by making it easier for customers to manage their business with BOC as a supplier.
BOC is a leading supplier of helium and has liquid helium distribution centres, or transfills, in many markets
around the world. With 48 helium transfills in its global network, management believes that this is the largest of its
kind. Helium has a broad range of applications, including welding and the refrigeration of medical scanner magnets,
and is vital to the production of optical fibres, semiconductors and special alloys. It is also used for leak detection,
underwater breathing mixtures and lifting.
Business development In April 2002, BOC acquired Matheson Gas Products Canada Inc, one of Canada’s leading
providers of special gases and equipment. Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public Company Limited (UGP), a
leading distributor of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and ammonia in Thailand, was acquired in May 2002. BOC’s
associated company in Malaysia acquired 35.6 per cent of the gases company Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc (NIOI)
in March 2002 and, following a tender offer, increased its holding to 100 per cent in September 2002. At the end
of August 2002, BOC announced an agreement to purchase Praxair’s Polish gases business. The transaction was
completed in January 2003 following approval by the Polish competition authority. The business acquired includes a
high proportion of ISP sales.
Since 2002, BOC has continued its global roll-out of a light-weight medical cylinder with an integrated valve
and regulator for homecare patients and emergency services. Heliox, a helium and oxygen mixture formulated to
ease the respiratory effort associated with airway obstruction, was launched in the UK.
Capacity at BOC’s Otis, Kansas, helium plant was expanded in 2002 to match market demands. In addition,
BOC has access to helium produced by other US plants, as well as to product from Poland and Russia. In 2003
BOC and KRIO, a division of the Polish Oil and Gas Company, entered into a new helium supply agreement. BOC
will purchase for export all of KRIO’s helium that is not sold to its domestic customers in Poland. BOC has been
KRIO’s sole customer for bulk liquid helium since the original agreement was signed in 1972. In June 2003, BOC
announced an agreement to obtain half the output from a new helium extraction facility to be constructed in
Qatar. Deliveries from this new source are expected to begin in July 2005.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems use liquid helium to cool superconducting magnets. BOC
provides helium as well as a liquid nitrogen filling service to meet MRI operators’ total requirements. In 2002,
ISP signed a major helium supply scheme with Oxford Magnet T echnology in the UK.
BOC continued to invest in refrigerant filling facilities during 2002 and in 2003 new filling facilities were
installed in Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines. Each of these was built to a standardised global design. BOC
now supplies refrigerants in 19 countries compared with six countries in 1999. In June 2003, BOC announced a
global alliance with Hudson T echnologies to promote technology for cleaning and recycling used refrigerants.
Significant progress in developing web-based customer portals was made in 2002. Amongst others, ISP
launched customer portals in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Thousands of customers are now able to access
detailed material on BOC’s product service offers, manage and settle their accounts and place orders on-line.
BOC acquired the Canadian packaged gas and related welding equipment business of Air Products in 
April 2003.
BOC completed the disposal of the packaged gas part of its US ISP business to Airgas Inc on 30 July 2004.
The initial consideration was US$175 million in cash with up to a further US$25 million to be paid on or about 
15 November 2005 subject to certain conditions. All packaged gases and associated hardgoods were included in
the sale. This comprised compressed industrial, speciality (excluding electronic) and medical gases in the US, sold
through BOC retail and distributor channels. The sale did not include BOC’s bulk liquid helium, bulk medical gases
and distributor businesses. 21 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
BOC Edwards
This line of business specialises in gases, services and equipment for the semiconductor industry as well as vacuum
products for a range of other industries. It is organised into four customer-facing divisions for sales and marketing
and into four manufacturing divisions. The customer-facing divisions are Asia/Pacific, Japan, the US and Europe and
the manufacturing divisions are Vacuum and Exhaust Management, Chemical Management, Bulk Gases and
Electronic Materials. Kachina (semiconductor process tool component management service), Coating T echnology
and Pharmaceutical Systems are managed separately. The major markets for BOC Edwards’ products are in Asia,
north America and Europe.
Management believes that BOC Edwards has a unique position as a fully integrated supplier of gases, vacuum,
chemical, slurry and exhaust management products, as well as services to the global semiconductor industry and is
a leader in the design and manufacture of vacuum pumps, instrumentation and systems for both general vacuum
and semiconductor applications.
The vacuum and exhaust product ranges are manufactured or assembled primarily in the UK, with additional
manufacturing and assembly in the US, Japan and Korea. They include vacuum pumps, coating systems, exhaust
management systems, temperature control systems and heat exchangers, instrumentation and controls, vacuum
accessories and leak-detection equipment. The range also includes specially designed systems for specific
applications, depending on customer requirements.
In addition to the semiconductor industry, the leading customers are in the chemicals, scientific instruments
and other industries, as well as in educational and research establishments. General vacuum products are sold to
such customers by a separate sales force.
Chemical Management Division specialises in the design, manufacture and installation of the systems used to
deliver liquid process chemicals, including planarisation slurries to the point of use within semiconductor fabrication
facilities. BOC Edwards’ chemical management products are manufactured mainly in the US.
BOC Edwards’ service facilities, including plants for cleaning semiconductor process tool parts, are located
near concentrations of semiconductor fabrication facilities around the world.
T echnology is important to maintain a competitive edge in this business, and considerable resources are
committed to enable the business to address new applications and markets. The major research centres are in the
UK, north America and Japan.
The Group’s vacuum products are sold directly by Group companies to end-users and also through
distributors and agents. Management believes that the Group is a leading manufacturer of the types of vacuum
products that it makes and provides. The business is highly competitive, with product design and quality, leading to
the lowest cost of ownership, being very significant factors.
Sales opportunities for much of BOC Edwards’ semiconductor equipment business are dependent upon
capital investment by the semiconductor industry. Management believes that semiconductor production remains
on a long-term growth trend but capital investment by semiconductor manufacturers has been subject to sharp
variations for a number of reasons, some of which arise from advances in technology.
The products of BOC Edwards Pharmaceutical Systems are tailored specifically to individual customer
requirements in the pharmaceutical industry and are used mainly for injectable products. Freeze-drying systems are
made in T onawanda, New Y ork, US. Filling, sterilising and packaging lines for the pharmaceutical industry are made
at Dongen in the Netherlands.
Business development Throughout the period 2002 to 2004, new ranges of dry pumps for the semiconductor
industry were introduced as well as a comprehensive new range of exhaust management products. These new
products meet the needs of 300mm wafer and flat panel manufacturing facilities.
In 2004 a new range of high-speed iGX pumps were introduced, offering attractive features for
semiconductor applications such as small size, reduced power consumption and lower lifetime costs.
The range of exhaust management products was also expanded with new burners, wet scrubbers and an
advanced plasma-based system for the destruction of reaction products without the use of methane fuel.
In July 2000, BOC Edwards acquired Kachina Semiconductor Services, a US company specialising in the
cleaning of process tool chamber parts. In the same year a new facility and divisional headquarters was established
in Phoenix, Arizona, followed by a new facility in Portland, Oregon. Additional facilities were opened in France
and China during 2002.
Production of nitrogen trifluoride (NF
3
) gas for the semiconductor industry was started at a plant in South
Africa during 2000 and production capacity was further increased during 2003. This product is an important
etchant that is also used for in-position cleaning of semiconductor process equipment.
In September 2001, BOC acquired Fluorogas Limited, a UK based company with expertise in the
development and operation of low pressure on-site fluorine generators. The acquisition was made to assist in
BOC Edwards’ development of alternative cleaning systems for semiconductor process tool chambers. On-site
fluorine generators were installed at a number of semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing facilities
during 2004.
During 2001, a decision was taken to concentrate electronic materials production into fewer locations and to
close some existing facilities in the UK and the US to increase efficiency and reduce costs. These closures were
completed in 2002.
Group profile 22 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
BOC Edwards’ range of electronic materials in Asia was expanded in 2004 with the addition of ultra-pure wet
chemicals through a partnership with Asia Union Electronic Chemical Corporation (AUECC) and through that
company with Huayi, a chemical manufacturer in China.
In 2002 BOC Edwards acquired the vacuum and pressure business of the Smiths Group. The operations are
located in the UK, north America and continental Europe and typically serve customers in the metallurgy, water
treatment, food, power and chemicals industries rather than semiconductor manufacturing.
The acquisition of the turbomolecular pumps business from Seiko Instruments Inc in Japan was completed in
March 2002 with the principal objective of enhancing the ability of BOC Edwards to develop vacuum sub-systems
to satisfy the growing trend to on-tool pumping in the semiconductor industry.
Hydromatix and Semco were also acquired during 2002 with the intention of positioning BOC Edwards in
those market segments expected to deliver the fastest growth. These two companies, based in the US, are
involved principally in semiconductor wet processing technology including chemical blending delivery and collection
systems as well as liquid waste abatement systems.
BOC Edwards sold its glass coating business, based in the US, in April 2002 but retained its T emescal business
that supplies technology for compound semiconductor manufacturing.
Afrox hospitals
Afrox Healthcare Limited owns 60 hospitals and clinics and has a minority interest in a further seven hospitals
managed by others. It also manages the Lifecare group of chronic-care hospitals. In addition to hospitals and clinics,
which are the core business, Afrox Healthcare Limited also includes Afrox Healthcare Services, which facilitates a
direct medicines service for chronic medication, and provides occupational health services, nursing training and
laboratory services. Management believes that Afrox Healthcare Limited is the leading provider of private health
care in southern Africa.
During 2000, African Oxygen Limited (Afrox) increased its holding of Afrox Healthcare Limited to 
82 per cent. During 2001, the 55 per cent interest in Lifecare Special Health previously held by Afrox was bought
by Afrox Healthcare Limited.
In January and July 2002, Afrox sold parts of its holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited but retains a 69 per cent
interest. This disposal was in accordance with the terms of the transaction between Afrox and PresMed that took
place in 1999.
In July 2003 Afrox announced that it was in the process of considering its strategic options with regard to its
shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited. On 17 November 2003, Afrox announced that it had agreed to sell its
entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium led by two major black economic empowerment
investors. In April 2004 the South African Competition Commission advised that the transaction should be
approved subject to certain conditions, which were acceptable to both the buyers and the seller. The sale remains
subject to approval by the South African Competition Tribunal, at which closing hearings are currently scheduled
for March 2005. In addition an application has been brought in the South African High Court by two shareholders
in Afrox Healthcare Limited to have the Scheme of Arrangement, by which the disposal would be implemented,
declared to have lapsed. This application, which is being opposed, is currently due to be heard in the week
commencing 29 November 2004.
Gist
Gist is a provider of specialist supply chain solutions. The name Gist was adopted during 2001 to reflect both the
continuing focus on supply chain operations and an increased emphasis on supply chain consulting, end-to-end
supply chain solutions and logistics support to e-fulfilment opportunities. This realignment of the business followed
a planned withdrawal from most non-Marks & Spencer primary temperature controlled operations in the period
1999 to 2000.
High quality supply chain operations remain at the core of the business. Gist manages a range of supply chains
on behalf of retailers, mainly in the UK, as well as some overseas. For over 30 years Gist has been the largest
supply chain provider for Marks & Spencer. Gist currently handles all of its UK food distribution and the
consolidation and dispatch of all overseas shipments to subsidiaries and franchised operations.
During 2003, Gist ceased to operate general merchandise logistics and garment stockholding operations on
behalf of Marks & Spencer.
Gist has provided supply chain consultancy services to major supermarket and catalogue retailers in the UK
and demonstrated its capabilities in managing international supply chains. In addition an on-line wholesaling
operation has extended the range of Gist’s skills offered externally.
Group profile 23 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
At 30 September 2004 the Group had 43,383 employees (2003: 44,507 employees, 2002: 46,280 employees).
During the year the disposal of the US packaged gas business resulted in the successful transfer of over 1,000
employees to the new owner. Employees of the company and its subsidiaries were located as follows:
Europe 12,712
Americas 6,283
Africa 16,790
Asia/Pacific 7,598
Unplanned employee turnover remains low and as a result the employee base remains stable. BOC invests time
and energy in developing the potential of its people. Opportunities are reviewed and discussed with identified
individuals to provide cross-line of business experience or to set up a range of functional and geographical
assignments. This contributes to BOC’s success in retaining and developing the core skills and capabilities it needs
to meet its business, customer service and health and safety targets. BOC regularly reviews its succession planning
processes and the availability of essential capabilities. Results show it has solid capability in most areas and adequate
succession depth to meet both its technical and leadership requirements.
Employee satisfaction and commitment
Employee satisfaction is measured and managed both centrally and in the business units.
Levels of employee satisfaction and commitment are generally high. A culture of accountability, collaboration,
transparency and stretch, known as ACTS, has been developed throughout BOC. The ACTS principles provide a
framework that employees can use in their dealings with each other and with customers, suppliers and other
stakeholders. The GROW programme introduced this year helps employees maximise their performance and
unlock their potential. It provides on-line facilities for employees to develop their individual development plans and
to have access to all their career development information in one place.
Employment policies and Code of Conduct
The BOC Group takes its responsibilities as a global organisation seriously. It is committed to fostering a workplace
that is safe and environmentally sound. It will always act in line with all applicable laws, regulations and industry
standards. It expects people to respect confidential information and company time and assets. It believes in open
and honest communication, fair treatment and equal opportunities. It opposes public corruption, anti-competitive
behaviour and insider trading, and it supports the fundamental principles of good governance and human rights.
BOC is a signatory of the UN Global Compact. It subscribed to its nine original principles and supported the
addition of a tenth principle this year on bribery and corruption. These principles represent minimum standards for
BOC and in many areas existing standards exceed those set out in the Global Compact.
BOC launched a global Code of Conduct in 2003. An extensive programme of communications has seen
over 99 per cent of the target population of BOC trained in the substance of the code, which is a framework of
legal and ethical standards for all BOC people to work and live by. The code is supported by a number of
processes. BOC has a confidential helpline to deal with questions that is available in every country where it
operates. It has translated the standards into key languages.
In addition to the Code of Conduct, BOC provides guidance and human resources policies to support BOC
people in their day-to-day activities and long-term career planning. These are aligned to the corporate values and
principles. At the heart of this approach is the recognition that the energy and application of individuals and teams
throughout the organisation will determine which companies have competitive advantage in today’s complex 
global market.
BOC’s employment policies are designed to underpin the Group’s operating requirements and growth
strategies. The human resources units implementing these policies are aligned to the business units in each
geography and, as far as practicable, Group policies are adapted to meet local requirements.
Communication and involvement
BOC places a high priority on two-way communications with its people. The primary communication channels are within
the business units, where local managers work with their people and two-way communication is most achievable.
The Group also uses a number of formal and informal communication channels to share information and to
shape behaviour. In addition to traditional media such as videos, magazines, newsletters and briefing packs, BOC
has continued to invest in e-mail and web-based communications technologies to ensure that consistent and
coherent messages are conveyed speedily to its people around the world.
The Group surveyed nearly 4,000 of its employees this year to understand the issues that employees saw as
being important and their satisfaction with how these issues were communicated to them. It confirmed that the most
important as viewed by employees was safety , followed by the performance and goals of their own business unit and
information about customers. This survey will be used to improve communications further over the coming year .
The Group actively searches for ways to involve employees in shaping the future. T eams meet to review or
jointly create processes, systems or strategies. A variety of employee structures exist for these purposes, including
peer groups, special interest groups, teams of excellence and quality teams. Multi-disciplinary and cross-geographic
groups of employees regularly meet, either face-to-face, or by using tele-, video- and web-based meeting
technologies which have been installed for these purposes.
Resourcing,training and development
Resourcing, training and development programmes are designed to ensure that the Group has a pool of well-
qualified, gifted individuals able to meet day-to-day operational needs and plans for the future. BOC conducts a
robust annual process to assess the strengths and weaknesses of its units.
It is committed to providing its people with opportunities to develop and grow, but also to bring new blood
into the organisation through targeted external recruitment. A global, web-based recruiting platform is in place to
supplement other recruitment channels.
EMPLOYEES 24 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
BOC continued to place great emphasis on personal and career development over the past year. Employees are
encouraged to be proactive about their future careers and development opportunities. The aim is for all
employees to have regular discussions with their managers regarding their aspirations, prospects and development
needs. These result in the formulation of an individual development plan, which is an agreed course of action to
meet employees’ needs as well as the needs of the organisation. The GROW process not only aids the
development of individual development plans but also performance management. Action plans can be developed
and monitored incorporating input from 360 degree appraisals. BOC offers many opportunities for career and
personal development. Employee development takes the form of on-the-job coaching and training, development
projects, secondments, e-learning, as well as more traditional classroom-based training.
In addition to the development that takes place to achieve current job effectiveness of all employees,
high potential employees are identified and developed with future roles in mind. Lead is an ambitious executive
development programme for high potential senior managers, facilitated by world class external providers as well as
senior BOC executives. It is customised for BOC and is comprehensive in its scope. The programme offers a
tailored curriculum and is designed to equip the participants with the broad range of skills and experiences they will
need to be successful leaders within the Group. T o date, over 130 senior managers have had the opportunity to
participate in Lead programmes.
A parallel leadership development programme, iLead, has been developed for high potential middle managers
and is run regionally around the world. Lead and iLead augment many other management development initiatives,
which are provided to all BOC’s supervisors and managers.
International assignments are used to develop high potential executives and to create opportunities within
local management teams. The success of such programmes are reviewed regularly with business unit heads as part
of their performance contracts.
BOC believes that how its employees work is as important as what they produce, which is why it has
concentrated on the behaviours associated with accountability, collaboration, transparency and stretch – the ACTS
cultural principles. Accountability comes through people knowing what they are accountable for and being
empowered to deliver. Collaboration is about drawing on the rich diversity of styles, talents and skills across the
Group to maximise achievements. BOC values transparency because of the belief that visible problems can be
solved and that informed people make better decisions. Finally, stretch advocates continually pushing the
boundaries of performance. BOC has created a set of leadership competency models, which are aligned to ACTS.
All recruitment, development, recognition and enhancement processes are being aligned to this comprehensive
and unified BOC view of leadership and management.
Reward and recognition
An organisation that aspires to excellence must recognise and reward the achievement of excellence. The Group
continues to refine the key value drivers of its business units and to ensure it can reward and recognise outstanding
individual and team performance in the fulfilment of business goals. Programmes to achieve this are cascaded
throughout the organisation to heighten focus on effective performance at all levels.
The Group continues to move towards a total reward system that allows people to structure their
remuneration and benefits to suit their individual needs. Senior executives’ remuneration is linked to a Group-wide
variable compensation plan, which is described in the report on remuneration on page 64.
Retirement benefit plans
BOC considers it important that its people provide for their retirement and fully supports their efforts in this
regard. Around the world, the Group provides opportunities for people to participate in retirement programmes
tailored to suit local conditions. Just as importantly, the board’s pensions committee takes prudent steps to monitor
and control Group-wide retirement benefit plans with local managers being responsible for safeguarding the
security of each retirement plan that they sponsor.
BOC closed its UK defined benefit pension schemes to new members in 2003 and replaced them with a
defined contribution plan.
The financial position of the Group’s main pension funds is detailed in note 8 to the financial statements.
Diversity
BOC believes that diversity is a key driver of future organisational and operating effectiveness. As one of the UK’s
few truly global companies, BOC highly values the rich diversity of its people. While the Group consistently
champions a set of unifying values and principles, they are not imposed regardless of local sensibilities. Rather, the
Group strives to build on the qualities inherent in its global environment by encouraging people with different
views, styles and approaches. Wherever in the world it operates, BOC is committed to maintaining a workplace
free from discrimination for reasons of race, creed, culture, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age or
marital status. The success of its diversity programme is monitored and reported regularly.
Disability is not considered a barrier to employment and, as far as local conditions allow, employees are
selected on the basis of their ability to perform the job. Further necessary training is arranged, taking account 
of their particular needs and the resources required to meet them.
Employee share schemes
Many BOC employees in the UK and some other countries have built up an equity interest in the Group’s business
through employee share schemes. Options may be granted at a discount to the market price at the date of grant.
The term of options granted could be from three to seven years and any option is conditional on a commitment
by the individual to make regular savings from pay that are then held by an independent organisation to purchase
shares at the end of the option period. The exercise of options under these schemes can be satisfied by the issue 
of new shares or the transfer of existing shares.
Employees  25 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Exercising sound corporate responsibility is fundamental to the way BOC operates. The Group aims always to
behave ethically and to manage risk strategically. It has a process for identifying, evaluating and managing all risks in
accordance with best practice.
This section outlines the Group’s systems for managing its social, environmental and ethical (SEE) risks and
opportunities – in line with guidelines set out by the Global Reporting Initiative, the Association of British Insurers,
the UK’s Combined Code on Corporate Governance and the provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 as it
applies to foreign private issuers. More details about BOC’s risks and corporate responsibility performance can be
found in the sections on risk factors on pages 32 and 33 and corporate governance on pages 56 to 63 and on the
company’s website, boc.com.
The Group works actively with its stakeholders – shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, local
communities and governments. Underlining the Group’s adherence to best practice, BOC engages with a wide
variety of employee, safety, environmental and community bodies.
BOC is a signatory to the UN Global Compact. This year BOC participated in the Global Compact’s review
and implementation of a tenth principle against corruption. All Global Compact principles are integrated into
BOC’s Code of Conduct. BOC continues to review and adapt its business practices to achieve the Group’s SEE
objectives and activities.
Executive responsibility
BOC has an integrated approach to SEE risks, managing them in the same way as all other business considerations
through business unit and Group risk management programmes. These processes are applied to major business
decisions such as acquisitions, disposals, new ventures and major supplier contracts. BOC business dealings are
guided by a global Code of Conduct. The code sets out the safety, environmental, social, legal and ethical
parameters that Group businesses and employees are expected to follow. The code is the responsibility of the
executive management board (EMB), whilst BOC’s businesses are responsible for day-to-day implementation.
EMB members are responsible for each of the code’s standards, supported by the appropriate business and
functional structures. The Group chief executive has ultimate responsibility for the code programme. He delegates
oversight to an EMB sponsor board and day-to-day management to a code advisory group. The code advisory
group is chaired by the general counsel, global compliance.
Safety, health and environmental management systems are the responsibility of the Group chief executive and
implemented by the Group director for safety, health, environment and quality (SHEQ). Workplace issues,
including labour relations, diversity, equal opportunities and human rights, are managed by the Group director,
human resources (HR). Marketplace issues, including customer relations and ethical trading practices, are managed
by the line of business chief executives. The director of supply management oversees BOC’s supply chain and
ethical purchasing policy and reports to the Group chief executive. The Group director, corporate relations,
manages community relations, including sponsorships and charitable support.
The EMB regularly reviews Group systems for managing risks and opportunities, including business assurance
audits, legal, SHEQ and HR reviews, appropriate training and communications, and performance management and
remuneration incentives through the Group’s performance contract process. Directors are provided with
appropriate SEE training and communications. For example, they are given regular safety briefings and Code of
Conduct progress reviews. Training on defensive driving and other SHEQ priorities is provided. The EMB sets a
strategic direction with regards to all business issues including SEE matters. Business units implement and develop
the EMB’s strategy through their own management teams.
The Code of Conduct
BOC has spent two years developing and rolling out a global Code of Conduct. It covers SEE risks and
expectations. This year the code programme consisted of:
• setting minimum and consistent standards around the world;
• communicating Group priorities, principles and standards to all employees;
• stakeholder engagement to identify, prioritise and respond to key issues;
•training for employees;
• setting standards for agents, consultants, distributors and suppliers through the Group’s ethical purchasing policy;
•managing Group performance in line with the code;
• assurance, using the Group’s business assurance audit/risk management, SHEQ and HR functions as well as
external auditors where appropriate.
This year the Group moved from the code’s implementation phase into its sustainability phase. This is aimed at
further embedding the code and so far as possible measuring the Group’s performance against standards laid down
by the code.
A global network of implementation managers drove the code’s roll out in workshops across more than one
thousand locations worldwide and has been superseded by a network of implementation managers. A code
sustainability strategy ensures the programme remains visible, accessible and relevant to all BOC employees.
The code is available on boc.com and available to employees via intranet, CD or paper copy. The code is linked
to a number of other BOC systems, notably the Group’s integrated management systems and standards (IMSS).
BOC operates a confidential 24 hours a day/seven days a week helpline to receive and answer questions and
concerns about legal compliance, ethical conduct and adherence to the Code of Conduct. It is managed by the
global compliance department. Investigations are overseen by global compliance and managed by appropriate
functions, notably HR, SHEQ and business assurance audit/risk management. Code sustainability issues are
reported to the EMB and appropriate managers on a monthly basis. In its inaugural year, the helpline received 
103 allegation cases from around the world. Of these 21 per cent resulted in disciplinary action, and 50 per cent
were found to be unsubstantiated or non-violations. The remaining cases are still being investigated.
SOCIAL,ENVIRONMENT AL AND ETHICAL PERFORMANCE 26 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Social,environmental and ethical performance
BOC’s global management system (IMSS)
IMSS (integrated management systems and standards) is a system developed by BOC. It has three distinct parts:
the IMSS Library, Traccess and Audit Manager. The IMSS Library houses electronic copies of BOC’s reference
material, instructions, procedures and standards. Traccess is BOC’s online training and testing system storing
individual learning profiles and employee training histories. Audit Manager reviews all stages of the audit cycle and
tests site performance and compliance against best practice and minimum standards defined in the IMSS Library.
IMSS documents Group knowledge from high level policies to detailed work instructions, enabling employees to
be trained and assessed in the skills required by their roles. IMSS outlines the correct protocols and minimum
standards and tracks the performance of actions needed to ensure the safe, environmentally sound and efficient
management of BOC businesses worldwide. IMSS and the Code of Conduct are mutually supportive.
Stakeholders
BOC’s code is segmented into key stakeholder groups, each of which is addressed by specific code standards and
management structures and procedures. Details are posted under the corporate responsibility section of boc.com.
For example, BOC works with its suppliers through its ethical purchasing policy, which is managed by the Group
supply management function, underpinned by the Code of Conduct and supported by IMSS and a number of
other web-based platforms. A supplier evaluation, selection and performance appraisal (SESPA) system assures
minimum standards of supplier performance, quality assurance and legal, ethical, social and environmental
compliance.
Identifying and prioritising SEE risks 
BOC introduced a formal process to identify and manage its SEE risks and to identify potential opportunities.
EMB directors, business unit heads and other key managers around the world submitted potential SEE risks which
were consolidated by the Group risk management function and rated using predetermined scoring criteria. Each
risk was rated according to its potential impact, the adequacy of plans to mitigate the risk, and its urgency.
The broad areas identified by the SEE risk and mitigation process are: managing the safety of people associated
with BOC; managing major operational hazards; minimisation of greenhouse gases emissions; energy efficiency;
water conservation; global adherence to and the effective working of the Code of Conduct; managing an ethical
supply chain; and continuing enhancement of product stewardship procedures.
The Group’s SEE review found that management systems and mitigations already exist for identified risks,
but in some minor instances enhanced measures may be required.
Managing corporate responsibility performance
This year the Group participated in the UK’s Business in the Community (BiTC) corporate responsibility index for
the first time. The index assesses companies’ performance against a wide range of environmental, social and ethical
measures. BOC has participated in the index’s sister survey, the Business in the Environment (BiE) index since
1995. BOC scored 91.69 per cent in BiTC’s index, ranking it 25th out of 139 participating companies, including 56
from the FTSE100. Completing the index demonstrates the Group’s commitment to managing, measuring and
reporting its corporate responsibility performance in an open and transparent way. BOC’s completed survey and
BiTC’s independent assessment of the Group’s performance is published on boc.com. The BiTC index is the
Group’s common measure and standard response to corporate responsibility and SEE enquiries.
Safety,health and the environment 
There are no greater priorities for BOC than the health and safety of colleagues, contractors, suppliers, customers
and local communities, and the protection of the environment. BOC is committed to excellence in managing these
areas through normal business practice assisted by its safety, health, environment and quality (SHEQ) function.
SHEQ policies and procedures are the responsibility of the Group chief executive and implemented by BOC’s
businesses with the support of the SHEQ function. The SHEQ department works within the businesses to ensure
that the Group has a deliverable policy, is active in its risk assessment and professional in its mitigation.
BOC has well-established programmes to drive improvement in SHEQ performance. Employees are required
to comply with all external regulations and the Group’s policy and Code of Conduct. Suppliers are expected to
meet minimum standards set by BOC’s ethical purchasing policy.
Standards, procedures and tools are embedded in Group practice by the organisation’s integrated
management systems and standards (see IMSS section above). IMSS outlines the minimum standards and actions
needed to align with or conform to management systems such as ISO 9000 (quality assurance), ISO 14001
(environment) and ISO 18001 (health and safety).
BOC met its objectives in 2004 when the Group:
• updated its safety, health and environment policy;
• launched Safety in BOC focusing on key safety behaviours across the organisation;
• continued to conduct its audit programme of safety standards and assessment of the organisation’s safety
culture. Annual safety action plans are derived from these processes, and integrated into individual and
business performance contracts;
• continued to conduct its annual environment survey. Annual environmental action plans are derived from the
survey’s results, which are integrated into individual and business performance contracts;
• commenced the sustainability phase of its Code of Conduct programme, ensuring that SHEQ considerations
continue to be reinforced and integrated into the organisation’s legal and ethical framework.
Along with the Code of Conduct and the Group’s ACTS operating principles, Safety in BOC ensures that SHEQ
issues are managed consistently across all countries and businesses. 27 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Safety 
Safety is BOC’s highest priority. Safety is the first agenda item at every EMB and business executive meeting.
Great emphasis is put on providing employees with all the necessary training, equipment and safeguards. Business
managers around the world, with SHEQ support, continually strive to improve safety performance concentrating
on individuals’ behaviour and the effect safe behaviour has on the organisation.
Each business unit has a safety function, reporting to the business unit’s executive and the Group SHEQ
function through a global peer group. This ensures that global best practice and the functional requirements of the
business and Group are always at the forefront of management thinking.
BOC manufactures and distributes products that are potentially hazardous, some being stored at very low
temperature or under pressure, and some having toxic or flammable properties. BOC is committed to operating
safely and communicating safe working practices as an integral part of its safety and product stewardship processes.
It is important for the Group to disseminate these safe working practices to customers and suppliers and to have
clear and measurable performance standards practised by all BOC plants, depots and distributors.
Controlling process-related risks is of the utmost importance. Any incidents that do occur are thoroughly
investigated and the lessons learned are applied throughout the organisation to minimise the likelihood of
recurrence. Safety lessons are shared throughout the gases industry and BOC continues to participate fully in the
development and application of industry-wide codes.
This year the Group implemented Safety in BOC. It complements and strengthens the organisation’s existing
safety systems and standards. An independent safety audit in 2002 showed that safety performance could be
improved by emphasising the behaviour of all employees. Business unit leadership teams have conducted
education, leadership and planning workshops around Safety in BOC. These are being followed up with a focus on
leadership skills to influence people’s behaviours. A new technique, LeadSafe, is being introduced to help drive
change. These elements will continue to be important features of BOC’s overall safety strategy.
Safety in BOC aims to prevent people getting hurt by guiding managers to effect lasting behavioural change.
Independent studies suggest that more than 90 per cent of all incidents in the workplace are the result of unsafe
acts, so changing behaviour has a significant impact.
Safety in BOC draws together and strengthens the Group’s safety policies, principles, standards, procedures
and tools. It underpins the principle that safety is ’100 per cent of our behaviour, 100 per cent of the time’. A safety
roadmap charts how the businesses and sites will continue to develop globally consistent strategies to move the
Group towards world class safety performance.
This year BOC further developed its approach to tracking key performance indicators for safety. The Group
traditionally tracks reactive or lagging indicators, for example: lost workday cases, medical treatment cases,
passenger car and truck incidents. Lagging indicators measure past events and measure business unit safety
performance. The organisation has also introduced a set of proactive or leading indicators, for example: safety
meetings held, the close out of corrective actions from audits, investigation reports completed on time, and
training. Leading indicators have been integrated into individual and business performance contracts and business
unit reviews. Site managers compile leading indicator statistics and report these to their business unit heads.
Over half of BOC’s major incidents involved vehicles and the Group is focusing attention here. Safety-related
driving initiatives and programmes are in place around the world for both commercial and passenger car drivers.
These include defensive driving training, observation and feedback, vehicle design, use of on-board monitoring
technology, and anti-rollover and jack-knife training. Other areas being addressed include the embedding of safety
criteria as part of employee recruitment, induction and ongoing training.
Developing and sharing best practice across the world helps reduce risk and the number of driving-related
incidents. The Group strengthened its major vehicle incident investigation procedures to improve consistency of
approach, understanding and analysis of contributing causes, assessing the trends and implementing remedial
strategies to prevent recurrence. This process has been successfully piloted and is being further integrated into
Group reporting systems and standards.
Every year, BOC takes steps to prevent and address the underlying causes of incidents as well as to ensure
employee security in the workplace. It is a matter of great regret that four Group employees died in work-related
activities in 2004. T wo employees died in road incidents, one in the Czech Republic and one in South Africa. One
employee in South Africa was electrocuted at a BOC site and a driver in the US died whilst delivering product to a
customer. The Group chief executive, SHEQ director and business unit managers review every fatality and major
incident personally. Investigations are only closed when the chief executive is fully satisfied that the root causes of
the incident are understood and action has been taken to prevent future occurrences.
The Group has four principal reactive indicators to provide a consistent measure of its workplace and vehicle
safety performance. These are:
• lost workday case rate (LWCR) per 200,000 hours. This includes all accidents resulting in the loss of one
complete day of work, according to best international practice. Many companies only report cases resulting in
three or more lost workdays as deemed reportable under RIDDOR regulations;
• total recordable case rate (TRCR) per 200,000 hours. This includes all LWCRs and medical treatment cases;
• passenger car avoidable accident rate (PCAAR) per million miles;
•truck avoidable accident rate (TAAR) per million miles.
Occupational health and hygiene
BOC requires its businesses to manage employee health activities in accordance with local laws and regulations and
according to BOC’s codes of practice, standards and procedures. The Group’s occupational health and hygiene
(OH) function provides a global service, striving to eradicate work-related health hazards.

Truck avoidable accident rate Employees have access to guidance on OH from qualified SHEQ managers. This is supported by a range of
training programmes, manuals, videos and safety data sheets, which are available through local and global SHEQ
functions and on dedicated SHEQ intranet sites.
The OH function carries out reviews in all business units to provide information and guidance on the main
health issues that exist in BOC operations globally and how best these potential hazards may be minimised or
eliminated. This is achieved by providing best practice standards and guidance to local SHEQ personnel who then
implement these standards and policies as necessary. Adverse employee health effects are monitored through local
occupational health checks around the world. These vary according to risk and requirement. Some are internal
and others are out-sourced to professional OH providers. Voluntary and routine ’Well-person’ medical checks for
employees engaged in hazardous activities or facing other risk factors are conducted throughout the year.
The main potential health issues that exist in BOC operations differ across business units. When dealing with
gases, the main potential health issues are:
• exposure to noise from gas compression activities and from cylinder handling;
• potential exposure to some gases filled into cylinders;
• potential exposure to chemicals used in metal cleaning;
• painting operations;
•ergonomic and manual handling risks.
OH programmes have been developed to deal with these issues and are applied across the Group. BOC
programmes include: a new OH service with a global provider to enhance the emergency care given to BOC
business travellers taken ill away from home; an AIDS/HIV prevention, treatment and care programme for
employees in southern Africa; an education programme to raise awareness of the effects of noise; a manual
handling training video; a legionella control programme for water systems such as cooling towers present on sites; a
programme for the assessment of manual handling and display screen equipment to minimise ergonomic health
risks; a chemical assessment and management programme; and specific work to reduce the use of solvents. The last
includes a new training video addressing the specific hazards of using chemicals to clean plant and equipment for
use with oxygen.
OH programmes strive to reduce employee exposure to present and potential hazards, drive best practice
across the businesses and are part of the Group’s commitment to continuous improvement. OH programmes are
being piloted in response to occupational stress, drugs testing, and to provide fast-track physiotherapy to aid
employees’recovery from injury.
One of the most visible OH programmes is the Afrox AIDS/HIV programme in southern Africa.
The objectives of the programme are: to encourage prevention of HIV and AIDS infection through education 
and awareness training; to provide treatment to prolong life expectancy to employees living with HIV through 
the provision of anti-retroviral therapy and a disease management programme; and to provide pastoral care,
which includes counselling and other types of support for HIV -positive employees.
The environment
BOC is committed to sound environmental practices, implemented through a worldwide environmental
management system which includes operating instructions, training, performance tracking and auditing, and the
sharing of best practice through the Group’s integrated management systems and standards (IMSS) together with
an annual global environment survey managed by the SHEQ department. The results of the environment survey
are reviewed by the EMB, business unit management teams and the Group SHEQ director. Annual environment
action plans are integrated into business unit management processes together with business and individual
performance contracts.
BOC is classified as part of the chemicals sector, but does not have the same direct or significant
environmental issues to deal with as traditional chemicals manufacturers. The nature of BOC’s activities and the
type of chemicals handled are quite different. However, in line with other industries, BOC is committed to the
conscientious stewardship of its products and services.
Management of environmental issues that are relevant to the Group’s businesses is overseen by the SHEQ
department. Many BOC business units have programmes to achieve ISO 14001 environmental certification.
The Indura business in Chile obtained ISO 14001 in August 2004 at its Solcon plant that manufactures MIG wire.
The St Helen’s site in the UK renewed its ISO 14001 certificate this year. In 1995 St Helen’s was one of the first
sites in the UK to receive ISO 14001. In addition, BOC’s hydrogen plant on T eesside in the UK obtained its
certificate this year. All BOC sites operate in accordance with ISO standards even if not specifically accredited,
because IMSS, containing the Group’s global operating systems and standards, is aligned to ISO 14001.
This year BOC’s global environment working group teamed up with occupational hygiene professionals to
develop best practice strategies. The Group’s web-based environmental survey, which covers approximately 550
industrial sites around the world continues to be used to develop action plans and report performance on-line.
This system reveals opportunities for the development and sharing of best environmental practice across sites and
businesses. For example, Afrox hospitals at Kingsbury and Claremont installed a water recycling system for their
autoclave sterilisers in response to survey findings. The water saving at one hospital on average equates to 
3.5 million litres a year.
BOC has operated a comprehensive environmental survey programme of its sites for more than ten years.
The annual survey highlights issues relevant to the businesses and assesses how well they are being managed.
Objectives for improved performance remain an integral part of business performance contracts.
Disappointingly ozone depleting potential (ODP) substance releases have increased this year. 60 per cent 
of the total released was from two plants. Plans are in place to improve performance by modifying both plants
and developing action plans to improve other plants.

0 00 01 02 03 04 Climate change is now recognised as a significant environmental issue. This presents BOC with challenges and
opportunities. The most significant challenge is the fact that BOC is a major energy user and a partner and supplier
of products to energy intensive industries such as iron and steel. Opportunities lie in the development of products
and services that help customers manage their own climate change issues, for example, energy efficiency
improvements or cleaner production that reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
BOC’s electricity consumption was approximately 11.8T erawatts and emissions for this financial year are
estimated to be 7.5 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalents of which the two gases businesses, Process Gas
Solutions and Industrial and Special Products, account for 98 per cent. They produce approximately 2,420 tonnes
of carbon dioxide equivalents for each £1 million of turnover. These emissions are from major combustion sources
and emissions associated with electricity used by all BOC’s major facilities
1
. Whilst emissions associated with 
Group processes are significant they should be viewed in the context of the nature and scope of BOC’s businesses.
As a matter of business and environmental necessity, the Group will continue to manage climate change issues
effectively and responsibly.
BOC’s methodology for emission estimation and addressing emission factors has been independently
assessed and confirmed to be appropriate. The Group uses energy data to help improve its energy efficiency with
resultant improvements in carbon dioxide emissions. Over the last four years, for example, Process Gas Solutions
operations have continued to focus on plant and distribution efficiency improvements, resulting in more than one
thousand projects that will deliver significant annual savings. One project was successful in winning an application
for New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Certificates as a result of the installation of a Linear Model
Predictive Control (LMPC) system at the Port Kembla site in Australia. This project is one of the largest to qualify
under the scheme rules and demonstrates BOC’s commitment to improving the energy efficiency of its production
processes. LMPC has helped the business to reduce gaseous oxygen losses at the site, which in turn means that
the business consumes less electricity.
BOC’s commitment to environmental stewardship and partnership is shown in its approach to new plants,
facilities and services. BOC and the Australian CSIRO entered into an agreement to commercialise fumigation
technology to replace methyl bromide, a widely used fumigant that is being phased out under the International
Montreal Protocol. The fumigant ethanedinitrile (EDN) is considered better environmentally and more effective
than methyl bromide to sterilise soils from insect pests, weeds and diseases before planting high value crops such
as strawberries and carrots. Also in 2004, BOC formed a major alliance with leading refrigerants reclaim firm
Hudson T echnologies. A seven-year agreement covering 20 countries provides BOC with exclusive access to
Hudson’s recovery, reclaim, diagnostic, analytical and gas cleaning equipment and software technology.
The technology will improve plant efficiency, leading to energy savings and environmental benefits from reduced
carbon dioxide emissions.
Selecting the right supplier for BOC is fundamental to conducting business effectively and ethically.
Throughout its businesses, BOC has adopted the SESPA process for supplier evaluation, selection and
performance appraisal, together with an ethical purchasing policy implemented by the supply management
function.
BOC aims to comply fully with all material environmental laws and regulations. Four prosecutions for
breaches of environmental regulations were incurred in 2004 resulting in fines totalling £3,670. BOC has
responded with measures to abate and prevent future occurrences as part of the Group’s programme of
continuous improvement.
The US Environmental Protection Agency has named The BOC Group Inc as a potentially responsible party
for clean-up costs at a number of hazardous waste sites. Although liability for the remediation of such sites may 
be legally imposed without regard to the quantity of waste contributed, based on the information available
management believes that it is unlikely that any costs incurred will have a material impact on the financial position
of the Group.
BOC continues to assist customers to improve their own environmental performance. Environmental
legislation also presents BOC with a number of potential business opportunities. BOC and the Cardiff Harbour
Authority in the UK won the ABB-sponsored IChemE Environment Award 2004 for the ’Harbour Four’
oxygenation vessel that replenishes oxygen into Cardiff Bay. This is a good example of BOC technology benefiting
the general public as well as industry. BOC has also patented systems to recover carbon dioxide from other
companies’ productive processes and put it to constructive use. For example, reclaimed carbon dioxide is infused
in drip-irrigation water or used to enrich atmospheres to enhance crop growth. The glass and metals industries use
BOC’s oxy-fuel burners to increase the efficiency of combustion, using less fuel and reducing polluting emissions.
The Group continues to develop technology that is more energy efficient, which helps customers and
partners meet their carbon dioxide reduction commitments under the Kyoto protocol on climate change.
As part of this commitment, BOC’s T orrance and City of Industry air separation plants in the US received
substantial funding from the energy efficiency programmes run by Southern California Edison.
The Group continues to work actively with its stakeholders to ensure environmental issues are approached
responsibly and supported actively. BOC is a signatory to the UN’s Global Compact and in the US and Australia
supports the chemical industry’s Responsible Care programme. BOC continues to participate in the UK’s Business
in the Environment (BiE) survey. This year the Group improved its overall survey score achieving 88.59 per cent,
placing BOC in the top 25 per cent of FTSE and other companies participating in the survey.

Social,environmental and ethical performance
29 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
1. BOC’s methodology is consistent with all major point sources of carbon dioxide emissions within Scope 1 of the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute (March 2004) and all major sources of carbon dioxide emissions under Scope 2 of
the protocol. The figure does not include non-carbon dioxide global warming gases (N2O, SF6, CH4, PFCs and HFCs), freight and logistics and
minor sources such as business travel, office electricity at small sites and decomposition of wastes and carbon dioxide emissions associated with
heat and steam imported to BOC plants. 30 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Research and development (R&D)
Process Gas Solutions undertakes internal development at sites around the world with the primary location being
the Group T echnical Center in New Jersey. It enters alliances and partnerships with universities and customers,
licenses or acquires technologies from third parties, and participates in technology-based ventures. Funding from
governments has also been used to progress key developments.
Working with its partners Sumitomo Electric Corporation and IGC Superpower, BOC is installing high
temperature superconducting (HTS) cables to provide electricity in Albany, New Y ork. These transmit electricity
with significantly lower losses than conventional cables and provide five-times the current carrying capacity when
cooled to -196°C.
Work continues with European Union funding on novel ceramic materials that have the potential substantially
to improve oxygen generation and the sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO
2
). Funding from the US Department
of Energy to generate hydrogen at high pressure through a combination of membrane reactor and a hydride
compression system is aimed at the future needs of the hydrogen economy. Novel LPG-based fuel cell technology
research is also being undertaken with St Andrews University in the UK.
While world-class hydrogen/synthesis gas technology is available through Linde BOC Process Plants, the
development and commercialisation of ceramic-based technologies for the production of H
2
and syngas continues.
T echnology developments for the pulp and paper and food industries using BOC expertise in heat and mass
transfer are focused on reducing operational costs while improving environmental performance. BOC’s
impingement freezer, for example, uses highly directed jets to provide rapid heat transfer. BOC has also
successfully developed a crusting tunnel that can achieve a uniform crust freeze on meat logs for slicing in high
speed slicing machines.
Industrial and Special Products has introduced several new manufacturing techniques, three of which are
specific to filling hydrocarbon mixtures: the continuous sequential filling of components that increases plant
throughput; the costing and accurate filling of components at low concentrations; and improved data acquisition
techniques to meet the requirements of ISO 6142. An automated system has also been introduced for
manufacturing scientific gas mixtures using a thermodynamics data package to determine precise target pressures
during filling.
In the medical field new clinical applications are being explored for oxygen and helium mixtures and the use
of gases to deliver drugs effectively.
Industrial developments include the use of cryogenic coolants to minimise distortion during welding and the
use of cold gas dynamic spraying in a number of industrial processes.
Research and development for BOC Edwards is conducted around the world, with key sites located in the
UK, north America and Japan.
BOC Edwards introduced the new iGX range of compact, high-speed pumps with reduced power
consumption and lower cost of ownership. These new pumps have remote monitoring and diagnostics.
Developments in split-flow turbomolecular pumps combined with dry backing pumps have opened new
opportunities in the scientific instruments sector. The combination of high-speed turbomolecular pumps and
control technology to provide chamber pressure control enhances the performance of critical etch process tools
for semiconductor manufacturing.
Wet scrubbers, burners and other exhaust management units have been developed to help manufacturers 
in key market sectors abate liquid and gaseous by-products and thus meet strict environmental regulations.
An advanced plasma-based system destroys reaction by-products for customers unable to use methane fuel.
A new range of fluorine generators was introduced that reduces the cost of cleaning process tools, without
using high global-warming impact gases. On-site fluorine generators have been installed with a number of LCD and
semiconductor manufacturers. R&D in low   materials has resulted in an investment in trimethyl silane production,
an important chemical precursor for microprocessor production. The newly introduced liquid flow control
product LiquiSys provides more precise delivery of chemicals for semiconductor fabs. A non-contact weighing
system using technology derived from magnetic resonance imaging speeds up vial filling and has been supplied to
pharmaceutical customers.
Nitrogen trifluoride production increased in South Africa and ultra-pure chemicals were added to the
electronic materials range in Asia through a partnership with AUECC, and through AUECC with Huayi in China.
The Spectra range of gas generators is being enhanced to deliver larger gas flows, meeting all demands up to the
requirements of the largest flat panel factories.
RESEARCH,DEVELOPMENT AND INFORMA TION TECHNOLOGY BOC Edwards, assisted by Gist technology, has developed supply chain management for gases and chemicals and
won a major contract from a leading microprocessor manufacturer. T otal materials management and total gas and
chemical management capability are part of an innovative and broad service offering. The use of enhanced metal
and dielectric coatings on process tool parts has helped reduce customer cost of ownership.
Subsystem developments continue, combining many of our technologies for advanced customer processes.
In collaboration with a lithography customer, BOC Edwards has created a subsystem which conditions the 
ultra-pure water used in immersion lithography tools. Development is already underway on systems for the 
next generation extreme ultraviolet vacuum-based lithography tools. A supercritical CO
2
tool has been released,
and is being used to develop critical cleaning processes for future generations of chip making at a key industry
development facility.
T otal R&D expenditure in 2004 was £41.6 million compared to £39.9 million in 2003 and £47.0 million 
in 2002.
Information technology
Standardisation on a common SAP computing system continued with successful deployments in Korea, Malaysia,
Colombia and Venezuela. Our newly acquired businesses in Canada and Poland were fully integrated and,
following a successful initial implementation in Europe, SAP was subsequently extended to BOC Edwards’
operations in the US. Improved devices for electronically capturing data at the point of delivery have been
deployed in the Australian and UK Industrial and Special Products businesses. Partnernet, an e-commerce system
for BOC agents, was implemented in a number of countries.
The south Pacific data centre was closed and data processing from Australia is now done in the global data
centre in the UK. In South Africa a new centre has been set up to develop applications and provide support for
systems that are specific to BOC. For other systems, development and support capabilities have been established
with third party suppliers in India.

31 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 32 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
This document contains certain forward-looking statements which involve risk and uncertainty as they relate to
future events and circumstances. The following risk factors, as well as those discussed on page 50 of the financial
review could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements:
BOC is affected by the semiconductor business cycle
Manufacturers of semiconductors represent BOC Edwards’ major customer base, and BOC Edwards’ profitability
is directly linked to the demand of these manufacturers for vacuum equipment, services and industrial gases.
The semiconductor industry has experienced significant growth over the long term, but is cyclical in nature.
Recent improvements in the level of demand for BOC Edwards’ services may not be sustained due to reduced
demand from end users of technology products and/or excess supply of semiconductors. The competitive nature
of the semiconductor industry can reduce profit margins for suppliers of products and services to semiconductor
manufacturers. Either of these factors or a combination could adversely impact BOC’s financial results.
Acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits and synergies
BOC has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years as part of its growth strategy and may make
acquisitions in the future. While BOC identifies expected synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities prior to
completing any acquisition, these benefits may not be achieved owing to, among other things:
• delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;
• higher than expected costs or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;
• diversion of the attention and resources of BOC’s management;
• inability to retain key employees in acquired companies;
• inability to retain key customers;
• assumption of liabilities unrecognised in due diligence.
The growth of BOC’s gases business will depend on the ability to win and execute large 
projects profitably
BOC, through its Process Gas Solutions (PGS) line of business, has a strategy for growth that requires significant
investment each year to serve key customers in different geographies. Failure to execute projects successfully for
these customers will impact PGS’s ability to win new projects from these customers, and therefore may impact
BOC’s future financial results. The specific risks associated with major projects include:
• failure to complete the project on time owing to unforeseen construction problems (which may require BOC
to pay penalties under the terms of the customer contract);
• failure of the plant to deliver the contracted volumes and quantities of product required by the customer
because of design errors or errors in manufacturing or construction (which may require BOC to pay penalties
under the terms of the customer contract);
• inability to operate the plant at costs assumed in BOC’s financial evaluation of the project.
The safety of BOC’s operations is critical to success
Industrial gases are hazardous substances and BOC recognises that managing safety in operations, transportation
and products is critical to achieve growth and financial results. Failure to maintain high levels of safety can result in a
number of negative outcomes, including:
•fines and penalties for breaches of safety laws;
• liability payments and costs to employees or third parties arising from injury or damage;
• exclusion from certain market sectors deemed important for future development of the business (such as
medical gases);
• damage to reputation.
BOC operates in over 50 different countries and is therefore exposed to economic,
political and business risks associated with international operations
BOC’s overall success as a business with global operations depends, in part, upon its ability to succeed in differing
economic, political and business conditions. BOC encounters different legal and regulatory requirements in
numerous jurisdictions. These include taxation laws, environmental regulations, regulations concerning operational
standards and competition laws. BOC is also confronted by political risks such as the expropriation of assets and
the inability to export currency. The business risks and challenges faced in each geography include the need to
manage credit risks of local customers, appointing and retaining key staff, general economic conditions locally and
currency fluctuation. Recognition of changing market conditions in local geographies is critical to BOC’s long-term
success. In addition, BOC’s operations are exposed to varying degrees of natural catastrophe risk, such as
earthquake and flood, as well as security risk, in the different countries in which BOC operates.
BOC relies on development of,or access to,technology to support business growth 
BOC’s success is dependent in part on its continued investment in technology to develop new products and
services across all businesses, new applications for existing products or to design effective means for producing
industrial gases. Failure to access or develop technology or anticipate, manage or adopt technological changes in
operations or product applications on a timely basis will have a material impact on BOC’s future results. For
example, the rapid development of technology in the semiconductor sector requires BOC Edwards to be aware
of changes in customer technology requirements and to introduce new products to meet those requirements in a
timely manner. Failure to do so could result in reduced market share and profitability.
RISK FACTORS 33 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
BOC operates in a highly competitive environment
The industrial gases market is very competitive, with several large competitors and a significant number of smaller
local competitors in different territories. Although the current trend in the industry is to seek price increases for
industrial gases, the industry has experienced falling prices in previous years. There is no guarantee that the current 
trend will continue and there is a risk that competitors will seek to maintain or increase market shares by reducing
prices. These price reductions would result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows.
Recognising and anticipating changes in the manufacturing economy is key to BOC’s success
BOC’s industrial gas businesses serve a wide range of manufacturing customers in major geographies such as the
US, UK, Japan and Australia. This is particularly true of the Industrial and Special Products (ISP) line of business
which provides products and services to customers involved in the welding and cutting of metal, a major source of
revenue for this division. As customers in these traditional manufacturing-based economies seek to move their
manufacturing operations to lower cost territories in, for example, Asia and Latin America, the risk arises that
BOC’s operations in the major geographies will have lower growth opportunities. Failure to recognise these trends
and manage the consequences, through the development of alternative markets and/or meeting demand in higher
growth territories, could have a negative impact on future Group results.
BOC’s success depends to a significant extent on its key personnel and employees
BOC’s performance depends on the skills and efforts of its employees and management team across all of its
businesses. BOC recognises that failure to attract new talent and retain existing expertise, knowledge and skills in
operations, products and infrastructure areas such as information technology could have a negative impact on
revenues and profits. In addition, the success of BOC’s acquisitions may depend, in part, on BOC’s ability to retain
management personnel of acquired companies.
Litigation may have an adverse impact on financial results
The global nature of BOC’s business exposes it to the potential for litigation from third parties. From time to time
BOC is involved in lawsuits resulting from current and past operations or products. The outcome of these lawsuits
may result in damages and awards which could have a material impact on BOC’s profitability, its business
operations or financial condition. Examples of litigation in the US for past products include allegations of injury
arising from the use of welding electrodes previously manufactured by a BOC subsidiary in the US.
Increased energy costs could reduce profitability
The production of industrial gases requires significant amounts of electrical energy. Energy costs are a key
component of the cost of manufacturing industrial gases, and increases in these costs can impact profitability if 
they cannot be passed on to customers. Accurately predicting trends in energy costs is difficult to achieve as
energy costs are to a large extent subject to factors beyond the company’s control – for example, political
conditions in oil producing regions. BOC also operates large fleets of commercial vehicles in certain major
geographies. An increase in energy costs associated with the use of these commercial vehicles may negatively
impact profit levels.
Implementation of computer software systems is a key success factor for BOC 
The introduction of software to improve efficiency and effectiveness of various business processes is an important
contributor to BOC’s growth strategy. Failure to design, select appropriate suppliers or implement such systems
effectively could result in reduced levels of customer satisfaction or profitability.
Further consolidation between major competitors may impact BOC’s competitive position
A merger between any of the major competitors to BOC within the principal geographies subject to competition
authority consent, could result in a longer-term deterioration of BOC’s competitive position and reduced levels of
growth. Possible consequences could include:
• an uncompetitive cost base for large projects;
• an inability to participate in further consolidation due to competition concerns;
• retention and/or recruitment of key personnel;
•weakened geographical positions.
Managing joint venture relationships is a key success factor for BOC
BOC needs to ensure that the selection of joint venture partners in new ventures and the relationships with
partners in existing relationships is managed effectively to ensure the full potential for the joint venture is achieved.
Failure to achieve alignment of objectives and manage relationships effectively may negatively impact future growth
and profit levels.

OPERA TING REVIEW 
Introduction
The Group’s results are prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and comply with 
UK Companies Act requirements. While the UK GAAP reporting basis provides the core information for users of
this report and accounts to understand the financial performance of the Group, management believes that users
will be assisted in understanding the performance relative to previous periods by presenting the results in an
alternative manner. This presentation isolates the impact of currency movements from year to year and eliminates
the impact of exceptional or non-recurring items. This is consistent with the basis used by management to measure
performance of the business and is a component of variable compensation plans. The elements of this alternative
presentation are described in more detail below.
Impact of currency movements
The Group has operations in some 50 countries around the world and the majority of its profit is generated
outside the UK. Results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange against sterling for
the year. Changes in such rates from year to year can significantly affect the Group’s results when these are
presented in pounds sterling. In some cases, such changes may make it difficult to understand underlying business
performance trends without providing additional information. For example, the average value of the South African
rand to pounds sterling changed by ten per cent in 2004 compared with 2003. When looking at the financial
performance of the Afrox hospitals business segment in 2004, it is therefore important to highlight this currency
impact to users of the information.
Consequently, management has for many years monitored business performance on a ‘constant currency’ basis.
This basis eliminates the impact of changes in the rates of exchange used to translate the results of overseas
businesses into sterling by retranslating the results of the comparative year at the rates of exchange used in the
current year. This is the basis for all internal management reporting throughout the year.
In this operating review, the comparison of financial performance between years may in places be referred to
as on this ‘constant currency’ basis. Comments on all segmental performance are on a constant currency basis.
The impact of changes in the rates of exchange used to translate the results of overseas businesses into
sterling is shown in the table below.

Exceptional or non-recurring items
Management believes that to present the results of the Group in the most meaningful way , items of an exceptional
nature should be separately identified and disclosed. This enables users of the information to have a better
understanding of underlying business performance. Examples of such items in 2004 include the loss on disposal of the
packaged gas business in the US, costs relating to the subsequent restructuring of the remaining US business and
charges relating to the integration process in Japan that began in 2003 following the merger of the industrial and
medical gases businesses there of BOC and Air Liquide to form Japan Air Gases. Included in 2003 was a litigation
settlement expense, the costs of the business initiative programme announced in August 2001 , other restructuring
programmes and charges relating to the integration in Japan. 35 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Exceptional items include those items classified as both operating and non-operating under UK GAAP .
The review of results excluding exceptional items is part of the normal internal management reporting
process. The growth in operating profit excluding exceptional items is also one of the measures used in the variable
element of the senior management compensation scheme.
Further information regarding the exceptional items is given in the financial review on page 49. An analysis of
all operating and non-operating exceptional items is given in note 2 b) to the financial statements on page 89.
In this review, the adjustments to eliminate exceptional items have been made to operating profit (both Group
and by segment), profit before tax and earnings per share. Exceptional items are commented on in the Group
results section as well as in the individual business segments to which they relate. A reconciliation of these adjusted
items to the equivalent UK GAAP measure is shown in the profit and loss account on page 78. When any results or
measures used in this review have been adjusted to exclude exceptional items, they are referred to as ‘adjusted’.
Within the individual business segments of the operating review, operating exceptional items are commented 
on separately. Comments on other aspects of financial trends and performance are based on adjusted operating
profit. This provides more meaningful comment on underlying business performance.
A reconciliation of adjusted operating profit to operating profit is given in the table below.

Other non GAAP measures
This review also presents return on capital employed (ROCE) and adjusted return on capital employed. Adjusted
return on capital employed removes exceptional items from the measure of operating profit used in the calculation.
Adjusted return on capital employed is used by management for reasons similar to those described above.
A reconciliation of these two measures is shown below.

2. Average capital employed and ROCE for 2003 and 2002 have been restated following the application of UK GAAP UITF37 and UITF38 in 2004
(see note 31 to the financial statements).
The Group commentary in this review also comments on free cash flow. Free cash flow is a measure often
referred to by BOC management and other users of financial information to highlight the cash flow available from
underlying ongoing business operations before acquisition and disposal activity. Whether or not this remains
positive over time is an indicator that dividends to shareholders are being paid out of cash generated by existing
Group businesses. As such it is a useful additional measure of financial performance.
A reconciliation of this measure to the nearest equivalent UK GAAP measure, net cash flow, is shown below.

OPERA TING REVIEW (COMP ARING 2004 WITH 2003)
Group
Turnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was £4,599.3 million in 2004, up six per cent
compared with £4,323.2 million in 2003. Operating profit was £559.5 million, up 28 per cent compared with
£438.6 million in 2003. After charging operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling £92.0 million and
net interest and other financing items of £72.6 million, profit before tax was £412.3 million, up 17 per cent
compared with £351.9 million in 2003. Earnings per share were 53.5p, up 20 per cent compared with 44.5p in
2003. Excluding the exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was £576.9 million, adjusted profit
before tax was £504.3 million and adjusted earnings per share were 63.2p.
Comparisons with 2003 are affected by exchange rate movements. For the currencies that principally affect
the Group's results, movements in the Australian dollar and the South African rand were favourable and
movements in the US dollar and Japanese yen were adverse. If the results of a year ago had been translated at the
rates applied to this year, turnover would have been reduced by £88.8 million. There would have been an increase
in operating profit of £3.3 million and a decrease in adjusted operating profit of £2.2 million. Adjusted profit before
tax would have been £2.9 million higher and adjusted earnings per share would have been 0.2p lower.

Exceptional items in 2004 amounted to a charge of £92.0 million. This comprised a loss of £79.5 million on
disposal of the US packaged gas business, a charge of £14.8 million for restructuring the remaining business in the
US following the disposal, a charge of £2.6 million relating to the integration of the industrial and medical gases
businesses of BOC and Air Liquide in Japan, and a profit of £4.9 million on the disposal of fixed assets.
Exceptional items in 2003 comprised £43.2 million for a litigation settlement, costs of £15.5 million for
completion of restructuring programmes and £8.3 million relating to the integration of the BOC and Air Liquide
businesses in Japan.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2004 was 15.4 per cent. Return on capital
employed for the year to 30 September 2004 was 14.9 per cent. Free cash flow (as defined on page 35) was
£257.9 million in 2004. Net cash flow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and including
exceptional cash items, was £339.2 million in 2004. A reconciliation of these measures is shown on page 35.
A first interim dividend for 2004 of 15.5p per share was paid in February 2004 and a second interim dividend
of 24.5p per share was paid in August 2004. In aggregate this was a 2.6 per cent increase over the annual dividend
of the previous year. A first interim dividend for 2005 of 15.9p per share has been declared for payment in
February 2005.
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries (including interest capitalised) was £256.1 million in 2004, compared with
£281.2 million in 2003. This was covered by cash inflow from operating activities. Capital expenditure by joint
ventures and associates was £109.0 million in 2004, of which the BOC share was £49.2 million. Equivalent
expenditure in 2003 was £81.4 million, of which the BOC share was £36.1 million. The Group also made
acquisitions of businesses of £50.9 million in 2004 and proceeds from disposals were £98.3 million. Equivalent
items in 2003 were £135.5 million and £3.9 million respectively.

Increased turnover reflected strong demand worldwide for both steel and non-ferrous metals. In addition, sales
from new production facilities accounted for approximately £14 million of the increase in turnover between 
2003 and 2004. The principal facilities coming into production in 2003 and 2004 were hydrogen and carbon
monoxide plants supplying TPCC at Map T a Phut, Thailand, and Citgo’s refinery at Lemont, Illinois.
Metal production increased in 2004 and world metal prices firmed as a result of strong demand from China.
This benefited BOC’s steel and non-ferrous metal customers in all the key markets throughout the year.
For 2004 as a whole, the food sector was buoyant outside the US despite the temporary consequences of
avian flu in Asia and the imposition of US import tariffs on prawns. In October 2004, a new plant to produce
beverage grade carbon dioxide was commissioned in Pakistan to satisfy growing demand for carbonated drinks.

The recovery in the electronics packaging industry created exceptionally strong demand for industrial gases in the
electronics packaging sector. BOC was a leading beneficiary of this because of its strong position in Asian markets.
The EcoSnow business that was acquired in 2003 performed strongly in 2004 and contributed to the growth of
the PGS business in the electronics packaging sector.
Several significant new supply scheme contracts were won in 2004. BOC’s hydrogen business with refiners
will be substantially increased with a new plant to supply both a Sunoco refinery at T oledo, Ohio, and a nearby BP
refinery. The hydrogen will be used by both BP and Sunoco in the production of ultra-low sulphur gasoline and
diesel fuels. The complex will be capable of supplying over 120 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen.
BOC’s partner for engineering and construction is Linde BOC Process Plants of T ulsa, Oklahoma. BOC is 
investing more than US$100 million in the facility, which is currently scheduled to be completed early in 2006.
Outside the US, significant new business in the chemical sector was won with the Sinopec Shanghai
Petrochemical Company. BOC will form a joint venture to invest in existing assets and then add further air
separation capacity. BOC’s subsidiary in Thailand is to invest in a venture establishing a 1,300 tonnes-a-day plant 
to supply TOC Glycol Co. Ltd. (TOCGC) in Map T a Phut and to increase merchant capacity in the area.
When completed early in 2006, this will be the largest air separation unit in Thailand. It will be owned and
operated by a joint venture between BOC’s Thai subsidiary (TIG) and Bangkok Industrial Gas Company.
New business with steel customers was mainly concentrated in Asia. In January 2004, BOC announced that
its joint venture with the T aiyuan Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) would expand its existing 1,500 tonnes-a-day
capacity with the construction of two new 1,400 tonnes-a-day air separation units. TISCO is already the largest
stainless steel producer in China and its expansion to a capacity of 900,000 tonnes a year will make it one of the
biggest in the world. In China’s Pearl River delta, BOC’s associated company is to expand capacity to supply the
Guangzhou Iron and Steel Company and is also adding new air separation capacity to supply the Zhujiang Iron &
Steel Corporation.
In the UK, BOC supplies Corus at its Port T albot, Scunthorpe, Rotherham and Redcar plants. BOC is to
increase its industrial gases supply to the Port T albot strip products plant by 30 per cent to increase steel
production locally.
Selling prices were generally firm during 2004 and sufficient to offset input cost inflation except in parts of
north Asia. Increases in fuel and power costs taking effect at the end of 2004 will require further selling price
increases to maintain margins. The expiry of a fixed term contract in the UK will cause a particularly sharp increase
in UK power costs in 2005.
Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of
BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003.
Europe Turnover increased in all parts of Europe except for Ireland. Adjusted operating profit increased
significantly, mainly as a result of more efficient plant operation and careful control of costs.
In the UK, manufacturing activity remained generally weak but customer closures and relocations that had
affected business in 2003 were less evident in 2004. Rising steel production led to increased demands for oxygen.
The reorganisation of steel processing at Corus will lead to a 30 per cent increase in gases supply for steel
production at Port T albot from the end of 2005.
A new operations centre was established in Poland during 2004 and adjusted operating profit increased
through efficiency savings derived from better operational control. Cost savings following the outsourcing of
carbon dioxide distribution also led to increased adjusted operating profit in Ireland.
Price increases were generally sufficient to cover higher input costs in 2004. Further increases are being
implemented in 2005 to cover sharply higher electricity prices in the UK following the expiry of a fixed price 
supply contract.
Cryostar manufactures cryogenic pumps, expansion turbines and compressors for a variety of industrial gas
applications and for marine liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers. As in 2003, turnover and adjusted operating profit
increased in 2004 principally as a result of demand for shipboard compression units on LNG tankers and following
continued investments for gases plants in Asia.
North America Turnover increased as a result of including a full year of syngas production for Celanese at 
Clear Lake, T exas and the start-up of a new plant supplying hydrogen to Citgo’s refinery at Lemont, Illinois, in
October 2003.
Adjusted operating profit was lower as a result of reduced carbon dioxide volumes to our food and dry ice
customers, and reduced argon demand from the stainless steel and wholesale sectors.
In general, demand for industrial gases from steel customers was strong in 2004. Liquid nitrogen volumes for
food freezing applications strengthened during the year, mitigating the reduced carbon dioxide volumes into this
sector. BOC’s carbon dioxide business with beverage customers continued to make good progress in 2004 and
new business was won.
Selling prices remained generally firm and significant increases in fuel and energy costs were largely recovered
with surcharges or general price rises.
Latin America Revenues increased across the region during 2004, although business in Venezuela continued to 
be affected by political uncertainty. In Brazil, BOC’s new 400 tonnes-a-day plant entered production serving CST ,
the world’s biggest producer of slab steel.
The benefits of re-pressurising the Pemex Cantarell oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico with nitrogen from BOC’s
joint venture company continued to be realised during the year. Pemex attributes an increase of some 600
thousand barrels a day in oil production to the nitrogen injection. Plant reliability was further improved during
2004 leading to some increase in supply. In May 2004 BOC agreed to buy Duke Energy’s 30 per cent ownership
interest in the joint venture company for US$59.7 million in cash. This increased BOC’s overall stake to 65 per cent
on completion in September 2004.
Operating review (comparing 2004 with 2003) 38 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Operating review (comparing 2004 with 2003)
Africa Turnover increased and adjusted operating profit was further improved by cost savings and firm pricing
trends leading to better margins. Although the stronger rand adversely affected platinum and gold mining in 2004,
strong demand and firmer prices led to increased activity in the steel industry. New business was obtained for
carbon dioxide in the beverage sector and for the use of oxygen in the de-lignification of wood pulp.
Japan The combination of BOC’s and Air Liquide’s industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan took effect from
January 2003. This distorts the comparison of turnover and profit for BOC’s three lines of business between 2004
and 2003 and with earlier years. The results of Japan Air Gases were consolidated on an equity basis throughout
2004 and for the last three quarters of 2003. In 2004 turnover increased mainly as a result of equipment sales and
adjusted operating profit increased faster as a result of achieving integration cost savings as planned.
North Asia Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2004 but at a more modest pace than in 2003.
Production plants across the region were almost fully utilized and little new capacity came on stream in 2004.
However a number of new plants will add significantly to production within the next 12 months.
In China, turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in line with economic trends but further growth
was constrained by available production capacity and by some unplanned shutdowns, mainly at customers’ plants.
Management expects that new production capacity to be added over the next 12 months will more than double
BOC’s capacity in China. Four large air separation plants are under construction to supply petrochemical and 
steel customers and a further five nitrogen generators will supply a variety of customers in the electronics and
metals markets.
In addition to the expansions at T aiyuan and Nanjing covered in the operating review last year, BOC has 
more recently announced a new joint venture with Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited (SPC),
a subsidiary of Sinopec Corporation, to meet the industrial gases needs of SPC in the Jinshan District of Shanghai.
The joint venture expects to invest in the production of nearly 3,000 tonnes a day of air separation capacity initially
through the acquisition of SPC’s existing industrial gases assets followed by the construction of a new world-scale
air separation unit (ASU). This will support SPC’s fast growing petrochemical business and those of additional
customers in the area. The Jinshan District is one of the major areas of petrochemical investment in China and,
aside from the SPC complex, includes the nearby Shanghai Industrial Chemical Park, where a number of global and
local chemical companies are located.
Economic conditions were stable in Korea but increased turnover and adjusted operating profit came from
some additional argon and hydrogen capacity to supply customers near Pohang.
The relocation of labour-intensive manufacturing from T aiwan to mainland China that had provided a difficult
economic background in 2003 slowed in 2004. T urnover increased as a result of full capacity utilization but adjusted
operating profit increased significantly as a result of improved efficiency in plant operations.
Hong Kong also enjoyed a better economic climate in 2004 for the same reasons and adjusted operating
profit was sharply better.
South and South East Asia These regions came under the same business unit management during 2004.
The economies continued to be buoyant across both regions during the year, helped by generally strong steel
demand and a more active electronics industry in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. The major market
sectors for PGS across the region are steel, petrochemicals and the food industry.
The SARS infection that had adversely affected 2003 was no longer an issue in 2004 but in Thailand and
Malaysia the food sector was hit by an outbreak of avian flu. The Thai shrimp industry was further affected by the
imposition of US tariffs on imports but some recent relaxation of these should lead to better conditions in 2005.
During 2004, BOC began to manufacture food-freezing equipment in Thailand.
Turnover increased in 2004 and adjusted operating profit was significantly better with improved margins
arising from business efficiency and productivity gains. Additional carbon dioxide capacity was added to serve
beverage industry customers in Pakistan in October 2004.
Although there were few new petrochemical projects started in 2004, demand for industrial gases increased
as a result of de-bottlenecking existing facilities. In September 2004, BOC’s subsidiary in Thailand announced a
major investment in new joint venture air separation capacity to supply oxygen for ethylene glycol production and
to increase the availability of products for sale in the expanding merchant market around Map T a Phut. During
2005 additional air separation capacity will be added at Hyderabad by BOC’s Indian subsidiary to support growing
demand for merchant products in the area.
South Pacific Turnover and adjusted operating profit were higher than a year ago. The Australian and New
Zealand economies remained generally strong in 2004. The strength of local currencies led to some further
customer plant closures but firm commodity prices for minerals and particularly for steel enabled leading
customers to prosper. There was some increase in tonnage volumes but volumes overall were similar to a 
year ago.
Electricity prices increased in eastern Australia and more so in New Zealand. Increased costs were passed
through to tonnage customers and progressively recovered in the merchant markets. At the same time, BOC’s
major plants in Australia achieved significant cost savings as a result of implementing a global plant optimisation
programme.
During 2004 BOC outsourced the transport of its bulk products to Australia’s leading transport company,
while retaining control of distribution and scheduling. This change was made only after ensuring that there would
be no diminution of safety standards or the quality of service to customers.
A hydrogen purification plant and bus re-fuelling facility to support BP in the Government of Western
Australia’s environmentally friendly fuel cell bus trial came into operation during September 2004. Three hydrogen-
fuelled buses will be operating in the city of Perth. The trial is to continue for at least the next two years. 39 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Water services BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation (EMC), a US water services company in
October 2002. T urnover increased modestly in 2004 but the business remained close to break-even after the
amortisation of goodwill as a result of planned costs to increase business development resources.
BOC’s strategy for water services is to focus on its industrial customers. Significant new business was won
during 2004, including a multi-year contract for process and waste water services to a major US beef producer.
Tightening regulations for proteins in effluent seem likely to create fresh demands for water treatment in the 
food industry.

Nearly all regions delivered better results in 2004 with increased turnover in most countries and an overall
improvement in operating margin. Robust economic conditions supported a further improvement in the south
Pacific region and Africa delivered better results despite the handicap of the stronger currency on manufacturing
and mining. There was also some improvement in the US manufacturing economy.
At the same time further progress was made in successfully integrating the businesses recently acquired in
Canada and Poland.
Sales to the medical sector grew further in 2004 as a result of both gases and liquid helium sales. Heliox, a
new low-density breathing mixture was introduced in the UK and in Australia. This product enables patients with
obstructed airways to breathe more easily and thereby provides time to treat the underlying problems. Helium is
also used to cool the coils of superconducting magnets in MRI scanners. BOC not only sells the liquid nitrogen and
helium cryogens but offers a related CryoFill service, taking responsibility for filling customers’ magnets. Helium
sales also increased in T aiwan, Thailand and China, where significant growth potential has been identified and where
an important distributor agreement was signed with Meike. The cost of producing and purchasing helium
continued to increase rapidly during 2004 but BOC was largely successful in recovering higher costs in selling prices
to customers. BOC installed helium recovery systems at the University of Liverpool in the UK and at Trane in the
US during 2004.
Consistent progress was made in growing refrigerant sales. The alliance with Hudson T echnologies for the
reclaim of contaminated refrigerants began operation in the UK during 2004 and will be applied in South Africa 
in 2005.
BOC’s major liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) businesses in Australia and South Africa were notably successful
in managing volatile input costs and sustaining margins during 2004 as LPG prices increased sharply.
Sales of industrial products increased in aggregate although some developed markets continued to reflect
weak manufacturing activity. Business development was helped by upgrading the retail environment of outlets in
some major markets and by the continued introduction of safety products to the markets in the UK, Australia and
South Africa.
Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of
BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003, as well as for the restructuring of the ISP business in the US
following the disposal of the packaged gas business.
Europe Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased further in 2004. Manufacturing activity continued to
decline in the UK but BOC maintained a strong position in the market. Improved service levels enabled selling
price increases to be implemented. At the same time costs were reduced through improved productivity.
Modest increases in industrial product sales were helped by rejuvenation of retail outlets in the UK. Medical
product sales increased as a result of gaining additional National Health Service business and continued demand for
lightweight oxygen cylinders. The range of lightweight cylinders will be expanded by introducing additional sizes
during 2005.
Changes in the provision of domiciliary oxygen in England and Wales are to be implemented by the National
Health Service during 2005. A single contractor will be chosen in each one of 11 regions to supply all forms of
domiciliary oxygen to patients. BOC currently has a leading share of the cylinder oxygen business but is a minor
supplier of oxygen concentrators.
The new business supplying helium to Oxford Magnet T echnology for medical imaging devices began in 2003
and performed well throughout 2004. It was also the first full year of the refrigerant reclaim service in the UK,
based on an exclusive global licence with Hudson T echnologies. A range of gases for scientific applications was
introduced during the year and some additional sales were generated following the launch of a mail order
catalogue for gases and related products. BOC’s Sureflow beverage dispense gas operation was expanded by new
business for Heineken outlets in Ireland during 2004.
BOC’s business in Poland was enlarged from February 2003 with the acquisition of Praxair’s Polish business.
2004 was therefore the first full year of the expanded business and there were further integration benefits.
North America The BOC Group announced on 27 January 2004 that it had signed a letter of intent to sell its US
packaged gas business to Airgas. This business had turnover of approximately US$240 million in 2003. The disposal
was completed on 30 July 2004 upon receipt of initial cash proceeds of US$175 million.
Operating review (comparing 2004 with 2003) 40 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Operating review (comparing 2004 with 2003)
Following this transaction, the ISP business in north America consists of bulk medical gases, bulk supplies to
distributors, tube trailer and liquefied helium in the US as well as the Canadian packaged gas business. In total these
elements currently generate turnover of some US$450 million a year.
The impending disposal of the US packaged gas business created a challenging business environment for a
significant part of the year. US sales volumes and adjusted operating profit were lower in the period prior to 
the disposal.
Turnover increased in Canada principally as a result of the acquisition of Air Products Canadian gases and
related products business with effect from April 2003. Cost synergies arising from the integration further boosted
adjusted operating profit in 2004.
Latin America Turnover increased significantly and margins improved. Growth across the region was driven
principally by sales of medical products supplemented by sales of BOC-branded cutting and welding equipment.
Sales of packaged chemicals increased in Colombia and Venezuela.
Results improved strongly in Venezuela, despite a continuation of political unrest. BOC’s associated company
achieved better results in Chile but there was a sharper improvement in Argentina.
Selling price increases offset inflation in Venezuela and Chile but the trends were less favourable in Colombia
during 2004. A new customer service centre was opened in Venezuela and new business systems were
successfully implemented in Venezuela and Colombia during the year.
Africa Important sections of South African industry were depressed during 2004 because of the stronger currency.
Rand exchange rates reduced the profitability of gold mining and manufacturing for export in particular. At the
same time the cost of imported goods was lowered making them more competitive with those manufactured
locally. However lower interest rates began to stimulate domestic consumption towards the end of the year.
Despite the more difficult market conditions, adjusted operating profit improved significantly on the basis of a
modest improvement in turnover. Margins improved as a result of better productivity and operating efficiency,
partly offset by increased transport costs arising from the temporary shutdown of some key supplier facilities.
Sales of cutting and welding products increased in South Africa and so did both the sales volume and the turnover
of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). T urnover of special products, including refrigerants, grew particularly rapidly.
Export sales of welding products manufactured by Afrox, BOC’s South African subsidiary, also increased
significantly. There was a modest improvement in adjusted operating profit despite the currency disadvantage.
Sales of the AfroxPac emergency oxygen kit for underground miners were substantially lower in 2004 as order
intake reflected weak activity in the gold mining sector.
During 2005 the Afrox refrigerants business is projected to expand by offering a service to recover and
reclaim the contents of customers’ refrigeration plant. This service will be provided on-site if required and will be
based on technology that is the subject of BOC’s global alliance with Hudson T echnologies.
A programme to renovate the Afrox retail network in South Africa with the development of a number of
‘Gas & Gear’ outlets and a range of safety products is under way. In addition a range of diving gases and a fire
suppression product have been launched in South Africa.
Good progress was made in growing both turnover and adjusted operating profit in the other southern
African countries during 2004. A new carbon dioxide plant supported growth in Nigeria.
Japan The basis of accounting for BOC’s business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger. Full details
can be seen in the PGS section on page 38. In 2004 ISP’s turnover in Japan was slightly less than the previous year
but adjusted operating profit was higher through cost savings following the merger and from some asset disposals.
South and South East Asia These regions came under the same business unit management during 2004. In
aggregate there were modest improvements in both turnover and adjusted operating profit. In T aiwan, buoyant
activity in manufacturing and infrastructure development was reflected in higher turnover and adjusted operating
profit. There were also sharply better results from the industrial products business in Thailand but ammonia
margins were under strong competitive pressure and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) selling prices remained subject
to restrictive regulation. Hong Kong continued to be affected by the migration of manufacturing to mainland China
and in Singapore shipbuilding and construction activity failed to improve in 2004. Competition intensified in the
Malaysian market for industrial gases. Demand for helium was strong throughout Asia.
In south Asia, turnover increased and adjusted operating profit was further boosted by an asset disposal.
Trading conditions in Bangladesh were adversely affected by a combination of political uncertainty, strikes 
and floods.
South Pacific Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2004 and margins were improved by holding
down costs. The economic environment remained favourable across the region. Manufacturing activity was
buoyant in Australia despite a challenging environment for export-oriented manufacturers created by the stronger
currency. New projects in the oil and gas sector and in mining generated increased demand for welding and safety
products. During 2004 BOC secured major contracts with Western Mining to meet its requirements for safety
products across Australia.
The economy also continued to grow in New Zealand but somewhat less rapidly than in Australia. There was
also an improvement in the Pacific Islands, while gold mining activity and oil refining investment led to increased
business in Papua New Guinea.
Major initiatives in 2004 included an agreement with the Australian CSIRO to commercialise ethanedinitrile,
a gas that can be used to sterilize soil and timber, and which management believes has significant potential.
The acquisition of OccCorp, an injury management provider, gives BOC entry to a largely untapped market 
by combining BOC’s safety services and products. A dedicated refrigerant reclaim fleet was established to help customers comply with new refrigeration regulations
that make it mandatory to recover, return and safely dispose of hydrofluorocarbons. BOC’s new Heliox gas
mixture, which helps the treatment of patients with airway obstructions, and Inhalo, the new lightweight cylinder,
were both successfully launched into the medical market.
BOC commenced an extensive redevelopment program of its Gas & Gear stores, supporting traditional
industrial customers and new customers alike, giving a stronger retail position, providing better visibility, higher
traffic flow, attractive merchandising and design.
The price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was particularly volatile during 2004. BOC’s associated company
in Australia, Elgas, was notably successful in preserving sales margins in these difficult circumstances and adjusted
operating profit was increased. Elgas expanded through the acquisition of a leisure gas business during the year.
The potential impact of Government plans to remove an excise tax exemption for automobile gas in the period
from 2008 to 2012 was softened by a subsequent decision to delay the introduction by three years and by an
agreement to provide capital allowances to encourage car owners to convert their vehicles to use LPG fuel.
Automobile gas is a minor part of Elgas turnover.

Operating exceptional items in 2004 were for the integration of the industrial and medical gases businesses of
BOC and Air Liquide in Japan that began in 2003.
Conditions improved in most of BOC Edwards’ key markets during 2004. Orders for semiconductor
equipment began to pick up in the first quarter leading to increased sales in subsequent quarters. At the same
time a major expansion of liquid crystal display (flat panel) manufacturing facilities got under way. This provided
fresh business opportunities for both gases and equipment. Sales of chemical management equipment for new
semiconductor fabrication plants improved only slightly and profitability continued to be affected by competitive
market conditions. Demand for scientific equipment vacuum systems and for pharmaceutical packaging machines
was better in 2004 but sales of vacuum systems for aerospace metallurgy applications remained at a low level.
At the beginning of 2004, high levels of capacity utilization encouraged a number of semiconductor
manufacturers to add fresh capacity or upgrade existing facilities. This led to increased orders, which were
reflected in higher turnover and adjusted operating profit from the second quarter onwards.
BOC Edwards was successful in winning new equipment business with the majority of semiconductor
fabrication facilities for which construction began in 2004. These included several investments in T aiwan, Korea,
Japan, China, Europe and the US.
New pumping and exhaust systems were introduced for semiconductor, flat panel display and other vacuum
applications. A new range of iGX pumps for the semiconductor industry provides better control and monitoring
capabilities and use less power than before. BOC Edwards also launched high capacity pumps of its own design
and manufacture for flat panel applications. New turbomolecular and scroll pumps were designed for scientific
instrumentation. Wet chemical abatement systems were introduced to expand and complement the capabilities of
BOC Edwards’ exhaust abatement systems.
Increased production of semiconductors was reflected in better demand for electronic materials.
Production of nitrogen trifluoride was expanded further in 2004 to over 100 tonnes a year. New investments in
semiconductor facilities also provided opportunities for nitrogen supply contracts. BOC Edwards has become one
of the leading suppliers of bulk gas to the growing semiconductor industry in China and continued to benefit from
the expansion of semiconductor manufacturing in T aiwan, Japan and Singapore. New nitrogen generators were
installed at several customer sites and further capacity was added to satisfy growing demand from customers
within the Hsinchu science park in T aiwan.
Accelerated investment in new flat panel display production facilities led to significant orders for large capacity
pumping systems in both T aiwan and Korea. Gas supply contracts were also signed with a number of display
manufacturers in T aiwan and Japan. Liquid crystal display production leads to substantial demand for chamber
cleaning chemicals. On-site fluorine generation equipment is now installed at a number of semiconductor and 
flat panel manufacturers. A full commercial-scale generator is functioning at LG Philips’ new sixth generation plant
in Korea.
Demand for pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging equipment picked up in 2004 leading to better sales
and adjusted operating profit. A new non-contact check-weighing machine was introduced. Nuclear magnetic
resonance technology allows every package to be checked, enables packing lines to operate at higher speeds and
facilitates immediate correction of any deviation from specification.
The basis of accounting for BOC’s gases business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger.
Full details can be seen in the PGS section on page 38. Electronic gases turnover increased significantly in 2004 as a
result of the pick up in the semiconductor industry. The benefit of increased turnover on gases adjusted operating
profit was amplified by synergy benefits arising from the merger.

Contracts were won in Asia and Europe furthering a strategy to expand the range of value-added services to
electronic manufacturers. These include gases management, chemicals supply, support services and materials
logistics. Other developments included an improved offering of gases and vacuum systems for lithography and
supercritical carbon dioxide cleaning technology.

Adjusted operating profit increased faster than turnover as a result of careful control of overhead costs and positive
pricing trends. Hospital occupancy rates remained similar to a year ago. Acquisitions were a minor factor in the
turnover increase but 2004 was the first full year of ownership for Joint Medical Holdings and the Little Company
of Mary hospitals. During the year Afrox Healthcare increased its holding in the Wilgeheuwel hospital from 
28 per cent to 80 per cent and closed down the Cape Anaesthetic and Brackenfield surgery centres in Cape
Town. It also sold its interest in the 123 bed Jan Marais hospital in Cape T own. The Lifecare chronic care facilities
and Afrox occupational health services both delivered a good performance in 2004.
The change to a new reimbursement system that began during 2003 was completed in 2004. The previous
system of paying health care providers a fee for their services changed to a fixed payment for each kind of
procedure as well as a per-day tariff structure.
Legislative changes in South Africa may have a limited and as yet uncertain impact on the Afrox hospitals
segment. A certificate of need will be required to licence health care facilities in the future to prevent oversupply in
particular areas but Afrox hospitals have been exempted for at least 20 years on the basis of current utilisation.
Corporate ownership of hospital and retail pharmacies is now allowed and the vast majority of Afrox facilities have
now been registered accordingly. On the other hand, corporate control of pathology services may be prohibited in
the future. Afrox Healthcare has minority interests in a number of pathology facilities.
In July 2003 African Oxygen Limited (Afrox) announced that it was in the process of considering its strategic
options with regard to its shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited. On 17 November 2003, Afrox announced
that it had agreed to sell its entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited to a consortium led by two major black
economic empowerment investors. In April 2004, the South African Competition Commission advised that the
transaction should be approved subject to certain conditions, which were acceptable to both the buyers and the
seller. The sale remains subject to approval by the South African Competition Tribunal, at which closing hearings
are currently scheduled for March 2005. In addition an application has been brought in the South African High
Court by two shareholders in Afrox Healthcare Limited to have the Scheme of Arrangement, by which the
disposal would be implemented, declared to have lapsed. This application, which is being opposed, is currently due
to be heard in the week commencing 29 November 2004.

The comparison of turnover and adjusted operating profit between 2003 and 2004 is distorted by a non-recurrent
item during 2003. In 2003 a gain of some £4.1 million arising principally from the termination of operations for the
Marks & Spencer General Merchandise business was credited to adjusted operating profit. The termination of this
business also eliminated some £26 million of turnover in 2004 compared with 2003. After adjusting for this item,
underlying turnover grew principally as a result of increased food business for Marks & Spencer , as well as new
contracts and the expansion of activity with Ocado and Carlsberg UK. On the same basis, adjusted operating profit in
2004 was at a similar level to 2003. A slowdown in the previous trend towards outsourcing logistics operations was a
factor in pricing pressures in UK distribution and so were dislocations arising from recent consolidation in the industry .
During 2004 Gist became the logistics partner for Intergreen, the Dutch flower producer, transporting
horticultural products between the Netherlands and the UK. This, and new business with regional produce
suppliers, led to a doubling of activity at Gist’s Lincolnshire depot.
Primary food distribution operations were also expanded in 2004 when Gist took on the transport
operations of John Rannoch foods, one of the leading suppliers of poultry products to Marks & Spencer.
Gist manages the complex supply chain for all of Marks & Spencer’s chilled and ambient foods. During 2004,
a major investment was made to expand a chilled food facility in Kent to meet the demands of the growing
network of M&S Simply Food stores.
Operating review (comparing 2004 with 2003) 43 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
OPERA TING REVIEW (COMP ARING 2003 WITH 2002)
Group
Turnover including the Group share of joint ventures and associates was £4,323.2 million in 2003, up eight per cent
compared with £4,017.9 million in 2002. Operating profit was £438.6 million, up three per cent compared with
£425.6 million in 2002. After charging operating and non-operating exceptional items totalling £67.0 million and net
interest and other financing items of £86.7 million, profit before tax was £351.9 million, up five per cent compared
with £335.3 million in 2002. Earnings per share were 44.5p, up seven per cent compared with 41.4p in 2002.
Excluding the exceptional items, adjusted operating profit for the year was £505.6 million, adjusted profit before tax
was £418.9 million and adjusted earnings per share were 52.9p.
Comparisons with 2002 were affected by exchange rate movements. For the currencies that principally affect
the Group’s results, movements in the Australian dollar and the South African rand were favourable and
movements in the US dollar and Japanese yen were adverse. If the results of 2002 had been translated at the rates
applied to 2003, turnover would have been reduced by £39.0 million. There would have been an increase in
operating profit of £0.8 million and adjusted operating profit would have been unchanged. Adjusted profit before
tax would have been £5.3 million higher and adjusted earnings per share would have been 0.3p higher.
The table set out below summarises results reported both under UK GAAP and as adjusted. Results for
2002 are shown both as reported in that year and on a constant currency basis.

Exceptional items in 2003 amounted to a charge of £67.0 million. This comprised £43.2 million for a litigation
settlement, costs of £15.5 million for completion of restructuring programmes and £8.3 million relating to the
integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan.
Exceptional items in 2002 included restructuring charges of £47.2 million and a £21.3 million charge relating
to the closure of facilities in connection with the combination of BOC Process Plants with Linde Engineering in the
US. An exceptional charge of £21.2 million was made to write down the value of OSK, BOC’s gases business in
Japan, in advance of the then proposed merger of OSK with part of Air Liquide Japan.
Adjusted return on capital employed for the year to 30 September 2003 was 12.6 per cent. Return on capital
employed for the year to 30 September 2003 was 10.9 per cent. Free cash flow (as defined on page 35) was
£141.8 million in 2003. Net cash flow, after acquisitions, disposals and other investing activities, and including
exceptional cash items, was £12.6 million in 2003. A reconciliation of these measures is shown on page 35.
A first interim dividend for 2003 of 15.5p per share was paid in February 2003 and a second interim dividend
of 23.5p per share was paid in August 2003. In aggregate this was a 2.6 per cent increase over the annual dividend
of the previous year.
Capital expenditure by subsidiaries (including interest capitalised) was £281.2 million in 2003, compared with 
£354.3 million in 2002. Capital expenditure by joint ventures and associates was £81.4 million in 2003, of which
the BOC share was £36.1 million. Equivalent expenditure in 2002 was £74.2 million, of which the BOC share was
£34.5 million. The Group also made acquisitions of businesses of £135.5 million in 2003 and proceeds from
disposals were £3.9 million. Equivalent items in 2002 were £207.3 million and £10.6 million respectively.

Increased turnover in 2003 resulted from generally firm price trends as well as revenues from acquisitions and new
plants serving chemical industry customers. The additional revenues came principally from BOC’s joint venture
with Yangtze Petrochemical Corporation (YPC) at Nanjing, China, from a new hydrogen and carbon monoxide
(HyCO) plant at Map T a Phut, Thailand and from the acquisitions of a partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake,
T exas, and the US water services company, Environmental Management Corporation. 44 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Improved adjusted operating profit was also a result of operational efficiency gains. The closure of facilities in
connection with the combination of BOC’s Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US led to lower
costs towards the end of 2002 and there was a full year of savings in 2003. There were also further cost
reductions arising from continued progress in delivery scheduling and remote plant operation.
As in 2002, economic uncertainties constrained the authorisation of investment projects by customers during
2003. A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide (HyCO) plant serving Citgo’s oil refinery at Lemont in Illinois came
into production in October 2003 and a new air separation plant was then under construction in Nanjing. This will
supply industrial gases to nearby chemical facilities being completed by a joint venture company established between
BASF of Germany and the Chinese chemical company YPC.
Operating exceptional items in 2003 were for the completion of restructuring programmes, including those
that were part of the programme announced in August 2001. Additionally, there were charges relating to the
integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
Europe Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in the UK and in Poland in 2003 but declined slightly in
Ireland. A full year of revenues from the plant commissioned in January 2002 to supply hydrogen to Huntsman on
T eesside and from the T eesside pipeline system acquired in July 2002 were contributors to increased turnover in
the UK. Despite continued weakness in UK manufacturing, sales volumes increased in the merchant market for
liquefied gases and prices were also slightly firmer. The key factors behind the increase in adjusted operating profit
were lower costs in 2003 as a result of restructuring and a charge of £3.6 million in 2002 for an asset write down
and debt provision after a steel customer went into receivership.
The relocation of some customers and a general decline in manufacturing activity led to lower sales volumes
and adjusted operating profit in Ireland during 2003. As in the UK, the trend of selling prices remained positive and
marginally ahead of inflation.
Business in Poland benefited from stable economic conditions in anticipation of joining the European Union in
2004. The acquisition of the business of Praxair Polska took effect in February 2003 and added additional air
separation capacity as well as BOC’s first source of carbon dioxide in the region.
Cryostar is BOC’s engineering company based in France, manufacturing cryogenic pumps, expansion turbines
and compressors for a variety of industrial gas applications and for marine liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers.
Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003 as a result of strong demand for industrial gas applications
in China and for shipboard expansion units on LNG tankers.
North America Despite a small increase in turnover, adjusted operating profit in 2003 was at a similar level to
2002. Selling price trends were favourable – particularly in the second half of the year – and were sufficient to
offset cost inflation. Sales volumes were lower as a result of general weakness in manufacturing industries and
some business was lost early in 2003 as customers changed to alternative supplies. At the same time, a significant
volume of new liquefied gas business was obtained, mainly in the closing months of the year.
Steel industry customers that had benefited from US tariff protection in the previous year faced renewed
competitive pressure in 2003. Some customers were operating under chapter 11 creditor protection.
Carbon dioxide for beverage applications continued to be in strong demand. During 2003 BOC improved
analytical capabilities to upgrade product quality assurance for its Premier Beverage carbon dioxide service to the
soft drinks industry.
At the end of January 2003, BOC acquired the partial oxidation syngas plant at Clear Lake, T exas, from
Celanese. Under the agreement BOC fulfils a significant proportion of the industrial gas requirements for the
Celanese chemical facility at Clear Lake. The Celanese facility is located on the Houston ship canal, and includes a
world scale vinyl acetate monomer plant and the world’s largest acetic acid plant. These require large quantities of
oxygen and nitrogen as well as carbon monoxide.
A new HyCO plant serving Citgo’s oil refinery at Lemont in Illinois began production in October 2003,
further expanding BOC’s hydrogen business with a variety of petroleum and chemical industry customers around
the world.
Latin America Turnover increased significantly, although growth was held back by a general strike in Venezuela in
the period December 2002 to February 2003. This inevitably affected customers’ requirements for industrial gases.
Adjusted operating profit also increased because of better sales volumes especially in Chile and Brazil and because
of selling price increases that generally exceeded local rates of inflation.
BOC’s joint venture company in Mexico supplying high-pressure pure nitrogen to Pemex for pressurising its
Cantarell oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico performed steadily throughout the year.
In September 2003, a new 200 tonnes-a-day air separation unit was commissioned in Santiago to supply
oxygen for leaching copper ores. Another plant was under construction in Brazil to supply oxygen for CST ,
a steel producer.
Africa Both turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003. Sales volumes were broadly similar but
selling prices were higher and cost controls also contributed to better margins. The focus of business development
was on the use of gases in mineral processes in the extraction of precious metals.
Japan The combination of BOC’s and Air Liquide’s industrial and medical gases businesses in Japan took effect from
January 2003. Until then the results of OSK, BOC’s gases business in Japan, were consolidated as a subsidiary.
Subsequently BOC accounted for its share of turnover and profit of the merged company, Japan Air Gases, on an
equity basis. This distorts the comparison of turnover and profit between 2003 and earlier years for BOC’s three
lines of business. On the respective bases used in each year, there was an increase in both turnover and adjusted
operating profit for PGS in Japan for 2003.

Operating review (comparing 2003 with 2002)
The integration process that began in 2003 made good progress. The two organisations were successfully
integrated in the key areas and the number of branch offices was reduced. Cryogenic equipment manufacturing
was integrated into a single location.
North Asia Turnover and adjusted operating profit were up significantly in 2003. Margins improved as a result of
better operational efficiency coupled with some price increases.
Turnover gains were largely as a result of growth in north China but there was also growth in mainland south
China, Korea and T aiwan. T urnover was down in Hong Kong as some customers relocated production to mainland
China. Underlying growth of adjusted operating profit in south China was further boosted by additional profit arising
from the renegotiation of a power supply contract. Results in north China benefited from the addition for a full year
of the joint venture begun in May 2002 serving the petrochemical industry in Nanjing. Further liquefaction capacity
was added to its existing air separation plant during 2003 to serve the local merchant market. Results also benefited
from strong growth in the steel industry as a result of increasing local demand.
In 2003 construction of a new air separation plant for BOC’s joint venture in Nanjing began. When
completed this plant will supply gases to the BASF and Yangtze Petrochemical Company (YPC) joint venture
chemical facility under construction nearby.
South East Asia Economic growth was generally buoyant across the region but Singapore continued to be affected
by the migration of electronics and other industries to lower cost countries in Asia. The outbreak of the SARS
infection also curtailed travel and affected business activity. Economic trends in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia were
favourable.
In aggregate, both turnover and adjusted operating profit increased across the region. Margins improved as a
result of operational efficiency gains. Prices were held down by competitive pressures in Malaysia and Thailand but
improved in Indonesia and the Philippines. T onnage volumes increased in Malaysia as a result of sales to the steel
industry and growing demand from the electronics assembly and food-freezing industries. T urnover was also
boosted by a full year contribution from Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc (NIOI) which became fully owned by BOC’s
associated company in Malaysia during September 2002.
Increased turnover in Thailand was based on better underlying demand as well as increased production.
A new hydrogen and carbon monoxide (HyCO) plant began production at Map T a Phut during 2003 and carbon
dioxide capacity was doubled with the addition of a new 300 tonnes-a-day plant at Rayong to serve food and
beverage customers.
Underlying trends were favourable in both Indonesia and the Philippines but results in the Philippines were
adversely affected by the closure of a customer’s plant.
South Asia Economic growth in India led to better sales of liquefied gases in the merchant market and sustained
demand from the steel industry. A new 225 tonnes-a-day oxygen plant was commissioned in the last quarter of
2003 for the T ata Iron and Steel Company, BOC’s principal tonnage customer in the region.
South Pacific Turnover and adjusted operating profit were slightly higher in 2003 than in 2002 despite adverse
business trends in some Australian industries. The strengthening of the Australian dollar in 2003 had a negative
impact on the important minerals sector, which responded by restructuring. There was also an adverse effect on
the food industry. Volumes of liquefied gas sales in the merchant market were therefore lower.
The Australian steel industry was somewhat less affected and a low cost base enabled it to remain globally
competitive. T onnage volumes increased in 2003. New business was obtained with BHP in New South Wales.
In January 2003 BOC commenced supplying additional oxygen and nitrogen, following a process upgrade to
BOC’s Port Kembla facility.
Improved operational efficiencies helped to improve margins in the merchant market. Centralised plant
operation was further extended during 2003 to the control of plants in New Zealand from an operations centre
in Australia. Prices were raised in the merchant market.
Process systems During 2003 BOC continued to benefit from lower costs arising from the combination of its
Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US to form the new company, Linde BOC Process Plants
LLC, based in T ulsa, Oklahoma. This transaction was completed at the end of September 2002, making Linde
Engineering the principal supplier of BOC’s industrial gas plants worldwide with access to Linde’s global technical
capabilities in air separation, hydrogen production and other gas technologies.
2003 was another year of low demand for new industrial gas facilities. This was particularly so in the
developed western economies and business opportunities were principally in the developing economies of 
the Far East.
Water services In October 2002, BOC acquired Environmental Management Corporation (EMC), a US water
services company with the intention of using a similar business model to that of PGS in developing additional
business with industrial customers.
EMC is a management company providing services for steam systems, cold and chilled water systems and
wastewater treatment. Customers include small to medium sized municipalities and industrial customers, many of
which are in the food manufacturing sector.
Turnover was on an increasing trend in 2003. Integration of the business was achieved smoothly but initial
integration costs made the business unprofitable in 2003. 46 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004

Good business performances in most markets were offset by a disappointing result in the US. Market conditions
remained depressed in the US and in the UK but there was an overall improvement elsewhere. Trends were
particularly favourable in South Africa and in the south Pacific region during the first half of 2003 but the pace of
growth slowed later in the year as a result of exchange rate movements, which affected exporting industries.
BOC’s helium business continued to grow globally and so did the packaged chemicals business and the sales 
of medical gases. Margins improved in the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) markets as a result of more rapid selling
price adjustments to reflect changing input costs. In June 2003, BOC announced an agreement to obtain half the
output from a new helium extraction facility to be constructed in Qatar. Deliveries from this new source are
expected to begin in July 2005 and the location will assist in satisfying fast-growing demand in Asian markets.
Operating exceptional items in 2003 were for the completion of restructuring programmes, including those
that were part of the programme announced in August 2001. Additionally, there were charges relating to the
integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
Europe Turnover and adjusted operating profit increased in 2003 despite weak manufacturing activity in the 
key markets.
BOC achieved turnover growth in the mature UK manufacturing sector by extending the range of products
and services offered to its customers. Growth of adjusted operating profit was also assisted by productivity
improvements, control of costs and favourable price trends. Sales to the medical sector increased because of
service improvements and the introduction of new products – notably lightweight portable cylinders for
emergency applications. Sales of special gases including helium also increased and a new contract to supply the
needs of Oxford Magnet T echnology for medical imaging devices was announced during 2003. Sales of Sureflow
hospitality gases and equipment improved, as did sales of refrigerant gases.
Economic growth in Ireland slowed during 2003. Despite improved hospitality product sales, turnover was
almost unchanged and adjusted operating profit was marginally lower.
Increased turnover and adjusted operating profit in Poland were principally because of the addition of the
business of Praxair Polska that took effect from February 2003. The integration with BOC’s existing business in
Poland and the introduction of common business systems has proceeded smoothly. Price increases in Poland were
adequate to recover cost inflation during 2003.
North America In total, sales of gases in 2003 were similar to those of 2002 but sales of welding products were
depressed. Weak conditions in the manufacturing economy across north America coupled with costs related to
the implementation of a new business system in the US led to a sharp decline in adjusted operating profit.
Increased volumes of LPG and of special gases, including helium, together with modest price increases for
most products were sufficient to offset lower volumes of industrial gases leading to a marginal improvement in
gases turnover in the US.
Market conditions were also difficult in Canada but the acquisition of business from Air Products in Canada
led to a higher turnover and adjusted operating profit.
Latin America There was an improvement in both turnover and adjusted operating profit across the region.
This was generally based on trends that were favourable in terms of both volumes and selling prices.
Despite extended unrest and political uncertainty, there was a particularly strong performance in Venezuela.
BOC’s associated company based in Chile also achieved good growth. Business in Colombia was expanded during
2003 with the acquisition of an LPG business. T urnover from respiratory homecare products grew in Colombia,
where a local homecare company was acquired during the year, as well as in Chile, where an acquisition was made
in the previous year.
Africa Turnover and adjusted operating profit again increased significantly in 2003, as manufacturing activity was
strong in South Africa. Although economic growth moderated later in the year as the rand strengthened, the
increased international investment in manufacturing in South Africa continued to provide a firm base for sales of
gases and welding products.
The mining industry also provided good business opportunities. There was a significant expansion of platinum
mining and ferro-chrome was also in strong demand. Production of the AfroxPac was further increased in 2003 as
demand for the product continued to accelerate. Several of the major mining companies were issuing this device
to their workforce to provide an emergency oxygen supply for those working underground.
Exports of Afrox welding products started the year well but growth was later curtailed by the strengthening 
of the rand, which began to reduce the competitive advantage. LPG sales increased and margins improved as a
result of lower input costs.
Results from other countries in Africa were somewhat mixed with good performances in Namibia and Kenya
offset by weakness in the Zambian copper industry. Overall, results were not significantly different in 2003.
Operating review (comparing 2003 with 2002) 47 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Japan The basis of accounting for BOC’s business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger. Full details
can be seen in the PGS section on page 44. On the respective bases used in each year, turnover and adjusted
operating profit for ISP in Japan were lower in 2003.
East Asia Turnover increased but adjusted operating profit was marginally lower in 2003, with the full year benefit
of acquisitions being reduced by the effect of industrial decline in the key market of Hong Kong and also by the
increase in business overheads to support the future development of business in the region.
Two acquisitions affected business performance comparisons in 2003. Unique Gas and Petrochemicals Public
Company Limited (UGP) was acquired by BOC’s subsidiary in Thailand in May 2002 and BOC’s associated
company in Malaysia took full control of Nissan Industrial Oxygen Inc (NIOI) in September 2002. The integration
of NIOI proceeded smoothly during 2003 and the business performed well. Although better than those of 2002,
results from UGP were adversely affected by sharply competitive conditions in the ammonia business but LPG,
which is the other main product line for UGP , improved due to partial deregulation of end consumer prices.
While competition remained strong in industrial products, especially in Thailand and Malaysia, investments in
special products facilities enabled this more profitable business to be expanded. Facilities for breaking bulk and
repackaging refrigerant gases had already been installed in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Malaysia and a further
facility was scheduled to be built in Thailand during 2004.
South Pacific Although economic growth was less rapid in 2003 than it was in 2002, both turnover and adjusted
operating profit improved. Increased turnover was largely a result of better prices rather than increased sales
volume and firm prices were coupled with effective cost controls.
Good progress was made in developing the safety products business in 2003 with significant new business
from major customers. The medical gas business also benefited from the introduction of new products. A web-
based customer portal was launched enabling customers to carry out transactions as well as to track and pay their
accounts over the Internet.
BOC’s joint venture company , Elgas, a leading supplier of LPG in the eastern part of Australia, enjoyed a record
year . Sharp increases in costs before the Iraq war were successfully recovered by rapid adjustments to selling prices.
After difficult conditions in 2002, better results were obtained from Papua New Guinea and the other Pacific
islands during 2003.

Operating exceptional items in 2003 were for the completion of restructuring programmes, including those that
were part of the programme announced in August 2001. Additionally, there were charges relating to the
integration of the BOC and Air Liquide businesses in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
The semiconductor equipment downturn that affected most of 2002 continued throughout 2003.
The second half of 2002 had benefited from some improvement in activity but this proved transient and no such
upturn was repeated in 2003. Business was concentrated with those manufacturers with a specific investment
strategy. This was predominantly for upgrades and expansions of existing facilities rather than new plants. Demand
for general vacuum products from key customers in the chemicals, aerospace and automotive industries was also
weaker in 2003. T urnover and adjusted operating profit were therefore lower.
The impact of these adverse business conditions was lessened by rationalising manufacturing facilities and by
careful control of costs. Industrial vacuum and pressure products manufacturing in Philadelphia, Bolton and the
Czech Republic was rationalised. Also in 2003, the size of a facility in Massachusetts was reduced to suit the lower
volume of business available.
The pharmaceutical freeze-drying and packaging business suffered from delayed investment by
pharmaceutical manufacturers during 2003.
Semiconductor gases turnover was essentially unchanged in 2003 as a whole, despite an improving trend in the
second half. Additional volumes from new business were offset by pressure on prices as competition became more
severe during the second year of the downturn. The focus was therefore on retaining market share, winning new
business in Asia and on product development. Production of nitrogen trifluoride was increased and fluorine
generators were under evaluation by leading semiconductor manufacturers.
The basis of accounting for BOC’s business in Japan changed during 2003 as a result of a merger. Full details
can be seen in the PGS section on page 44. On the respective bases used in each year, turnover and adjusted
operating profit for BOC Edwards in Japan increased in 2003.
Operating review (comparing 2003 with 2002)  48 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Vacuum equipment volumes worldwide were slightly better in 2003 and much of the increase was derived from
pumping products for flat panel display manufacture. However, these pumps currently earn lower margins than
semiconductor pumping systems. Although semiconductor equipment demand was weak in 2003, improved
products were developed to strengthen BOC Edwards’ position in vacuum technology. These included single axis
on-tool semiconductor pumps and a range of small dry pumps for the growing scientific equipment market.
The Kachina process tool component cleaning service grew in 2003 but the chemical management business
suffered from the small number of new semiconductor plants being built. Cost levels were reduced to improve
financial performance.
Contracts were won in Asia and Europe furthering a strategy to expand the range of value-added services to
electronic manufacturers. These include gases management, chemicals supply, support services and materials
logistics. Other developments included an improved offering of gases and vacuum systems for lithography and
supercritical carbon dioxide cleaning technology.

Although hospital occupancy rates increased only marginally in 2003, turnover and adjusted operating profit 
both increased significantly. This resulted from some minor acquisitions, positive price trends and a reduction 
in overhead costs. New facilities continued to be added to existing hospitals in order to widen the range of
available services.
There was a significant change in the reimbursement system during 2003. Insurance companies had previously
paid private health care providers such as Afrox hospitals a fee for their services but this was then changing to a
risk reimbursement system. This involves a fixed payment to be made for each kind of procedure thus transferring
some financial risk to the provider if complications arise.
Although acute care hospitals continued to make up the great majority of both turnover and adjusted operating
profit, there were better results from the Lifecare chronic care business, from occupational health services and from
the Direct Medicines pharmacy services business following restructuring to address more competitive market
conditions.

Improved turnover reflected both new contracts and increased volumes with existing customers. The increase in
adjusted operating profit was not only as a result of higher turnover but also because of a gain of some £4.1 million
arising principally from the termination of operations for the Marks & Spencer General Merchandise business.
Gist continued to operate all of Marks & Spencer’s chilled and ambient food distribution and services and
remained its largest supply chain provider.
In 2003, a contract with Carlsberg-T etley, a leading brewer, was expanded to manage the entire primary
transport distribution business. A contract to manage the international inbound supply chain was also secured with
New Look, the UK high street fashion retailer.

Corporate transactions and restructuring
The sale of BOC’s packaged gas business in the US to Airgas Inc was completed on 30 July 2004. This resulted in 
a loss of £79.5 million on disposal of the business. In addition, £14.8 million has been charged for the cost of
restructuring the footprint of the remaining business in the US. The consideration received in 2004 was 
£97.8 million (US$175 million). Cash outflows related to the disposal and restructuring are expected to be
approximately £38 million, of which £16.5 million was paid in 2004. Net cash proceeds are therefore expected 
to be approximately £60 million. In addition, Airgas Inc is to pay further consideration of up to £14 million 
(US$25 million) on or about 15 November 2005 subject to certain conditions.
On 17 November 2003 the Group's South African subsidiary company African Oxygen Limited announced
that it had agreed to sell its entire holding in Afrox Healthcare Limited. The sale remains subject to approval by the
South African Competition Tribunal, at which closing hearings are currently scheduled for March 2005. In addition
an application has been brought in the South African High Court by two shareholders in Afrox Healthcare Limited
to have the Scheme of Arrangement, by which the disposal would be implemented, declared to have lapsed. This
application, which is being opposed, is currently due to be heard in the week commencing 29 November 2004.
Group expenditure on acquisitions of businesses was £50.9 million (2003: £135.5 million). The main
acquisition during 2004 was to increase BOC's holding in the Cantarell joint venture in Mexico. During 2003 
the main acquisitions were Environmental Management Corporation, a privately held US water services 
company, Praxair’s Polish gases business and the Canadian packaged gas and related welding equipment business 
of Air Products.
In 2003 there was an exceptional charge of £67.0 million. This included £23.8 million for various restructuring
programmes which have been completed. It also included £43.2 million for the settlement of litigation in the US
against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan (the Plan). The settlement is being paid out of Plan assets.

Financing 
The Group has access to a range of funding. Debt finance is raised by issuing bonds, commercial paper, other
obligations to investors and through borrowings from banks.
As well as medium and long-term borrowings, the Group maintains short-term borrowings, principally in 
the form of commercial paper and bank borrowings. The Group maintains US$450 million (£249 million) of
committed multi-currency facilities with a group of relationship banks. These facilities mature in 2008 and provide
back-up for the issue of commercial paper as well as general liquidity for the Group. Additional committed facilities
are maintained by the principal operating units in the Group.
Overall, net debt decreased by £405.7 million as a result of a net cash inflow of £339.2 million, a £12.4 million 
inflow from the issue of shares, an outflow of £4.7 million for the impact of business acquisitions and disposals and
£58.8 million for the effect of exchange rate and other movements. In 2003, net debt increased by £42.5 million as
a result of a net cash inflow of £12.6 million, a net £2.6 million outflow from the issue and purchase of shares, an
outflow of £31.8 million for the impact of business acquisitions and disposals and £20.7 million for the effect of
exchange rate movements. The increase in net cash flow in 2004 was driven predominantly by lower acquisition
activity, higher distributions from joint ventures and associates, and an improvement in general business cash flows.

51.2 per cent, compared with 73.4 per cent in 2003 and 75.3 per cent in 2002.
The Group has access to a diverse range of debt finance including commercial paper, public bonds and bank
borrowings which, it believes, will be available to meet long-term financing needs. The Group has sufficient facilities
to cover likely borrowing needs. Management anticipates that capital expenditure in 2005 will be at a higher level
than in 2004 and will be covered by cash inflow from operating activities.
Management of financial risks 
The board of directors sets the treasury policies and objectives of the Group which include controls over the
procedures used to manage currency, interest rate and credit risk. The approach to managing risk is set out below.
This approach is expected to continue during the next financial year. On a day-to-day basis, Group treasury carries
out these policies, with regular review meetings with the Group finance director. Specific and significant activities
need approval from the finance committee, which includes any two directors of the company.
The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments nor does it enter into any
leveraged derivative transactions.
Currency risk The Group faces currency risk principally on its net assets, most of which are in currencies other
than sterling. Currency movements can therefore have a significant effect on the Group’s balance sheet when
translating these foreign currency assets into sterling. In order to reduce this effect the Group manages its
borrowings, where practicable and cost effective, to hedge its foreign currency assets.
Where possible, hedging is done using direct borrowings in the same currency as the assets being hedged or
through the use of other hedging methods such as currency swaps. Group borrowings are currently held in a wide
range of currencies and, after swaps, 82 per cent of net debt (2003: 81 per cent) is denominated in the principal
currencies affecting the Group: US dollars, Australian dollars, Japanese yen, South African rand and sterling.
The aggregate of the notional principal values of currency swaps was £593.1 million (2003: £474.7 million) spread
over a range of currencies. The fair value of such swaps is included in note 21 b) i) to the financial statements.
The balance sheets of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange for the
year and any exchange difference is dealt with as a movement in reserves. This is explained more fully in the
accounting policy note on page 83. The profit and loss accounts of overseas businesses are translated at average
rates of exchange and this translation impact directly affects the profit and loss account of the Group.
The Group manages its currency flows to minimise currency transaction exchange risk and forward contracts
are used as appropriate to hedge net currency flows and selected individual transactions. The Group’s foreign
exchange cover is mainly managed in the UK, Australia, Japan and South Africa. The UK manages the cover for
exposures on net trade flows of the Group’s companies in the US and certain other countries. The aggregate
principal amount of forward cover outstanding at 30 September 2004 amounted to £224.4 million (2003:
£173.8 million).
Interest rate risk At 30 September 2004, the Group’s net debt position after interest rate hedging activity 
included a net exposure of £74.6 million (2003: £436.3 million) to floating interest rates. Based on the Group’s
2004 year end level and composition of net debt, an increase in average interest rates of one per cent per annum
would result in a decrease in future earnings, before tax, of £0.7 million per annum (2003: £4.4 million).
In order to manage interest rate risk the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt.
At 30 September 2004, there was a 8:92 ratio (2003: 32:68) between floating and fixed rate net debt.
Underlying borrowings are arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where appropriate,
the Group uses interest rate swaps to vary this mix and to manage the Group’s interest rate exposure.
At 30 September 2004, the aggregate of the notional principal values of swap agreements which affect the
floating rate/fixed rate mix was £285.3 million (2003: £417.6 million). The fair value of such swaps is included in
note 21 b) i) to the financial statements.
Foreign exchange risk At 30 September 2004, the Group had outstanding forward exchange contracts totalling 
£224.4 million (2003: £173.8 million) in respect of its actual and forecast transaction exposures. The fair value 
of these contracts at 30 September 2004 amounted to a gain of £7.5 million (2003: a gain of £5.8 million).
A ten per cent appreciation of sterling would increase the fair value of these contracts by £11.0 million 
(2003: £13.7 million).
In addition to these forward contracts, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange movements on its net debt
position. At 30 September 2004 net debt, after currency swaps, comprised net sterling liabilities of £104.6 million
(2003: £285.3 million) and net currency liabilities of £857.8 million (2003: £1,082.8 million). Based on the Group’s
2004 year end level and composition of net debt, a ten per cent appreciation of sterling would result in a reduction
in the value of net currency liabilities of £78.0 million (2003: £90.5 million).
Counterparty risk Cash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from
counterparties. Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one
counterparty depending upon its credit rating and by regular reviews of these ratings. The possibility of material
loss arising in the event of non-performance by a counterparty is considered unlikely by management.
The currency and interest rate hedging profile of the Group’s borrowings at 30 September 2004 is shown in
note 21 to the financial statements. Further information on financial risk management is also given in note 21 to
the financial statements.

Interest on net debt
The net charge before the Group’s share of interest of joint ventures and associates was £70.5 million in 2004
(2003: £75.8 million, 2002: £78.6 million), which, after excluding interest income from loans to joint ventures and
associates, represented 6.2 per cent of average net borrowings during the year. After taking into account interest
capitalised and the Group’s share of the net interest of joint ventures and associates, the net charge was
£88.4 million. Adjusted interest cover (the number of times that the interest charge on net debt is covered by
adjusted operating profit) increased to 6.5 times (2003: 5.3 times, 2002: 4.9 times).
Net interest on pension financing items
The interest on pension scheme liabilities was £117.4 million in 2004 (2003: £110.2 million, 2002: £106.1 million).
The expected return on pension scheme assets was £133.2 million in 2004 (2003: £119.6 million, 2002:
£139.1 million). The increase in the expected return on pension scheme assets reflects the recovery in the value 
of world equity markets and the impact of the additional cash contributions made by the Group to the UK 
pension scheme.

Off-balance sheet arrangements
The Group has provided guarantees of £41 .8 million to third parties at 30 September 2004 as shown in note 26 a).
The guarantees include an operational performance bond in the Cantarell joint venture, a guarantee of the borrowings
of a joint venture in China and other guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business. Other than disclosed,
there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect
on the Group’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity ,
capital expenditures or capital resources.
T axation
The tax charge for 2004 of £101.7 million is calculated in accordance with UK accounting standards, including
FRS19 (deferred tax), under which full provision is made for deferred taxes.
The effective tax rate on adjusted profit in 2004 was 29 per cent (2003: 29 per cent, 2002: 30 per cent).
The total tax rate in 2004 was 24.7 per cent (2003: 27.4 per cent, 2002: 31.7 per cent). The Group pays corporation
tax in the UK at a rate of 30 per cent. Additional information on tax rates is shown in note 4 to the financial
statements.
The Group is currently liable to pay federal tax at the rate of 35 per cent in the US. This is reduced by the
existence of tax credits. In the other principal subsidiaries, the tax rate is typically between 30 per cent and 
42 per cent.

The Group monitors all contingent liabilities including matters relating to litigation and the environment via a process
of consultation and evaluation which includes senior management, internal and external legal advisers and internal
and external technical advisers. This process results in conclusions with respect to potential exposure and provisions
are made or adjusted accordingly. Management believes that the Group has adequately provided for contingencies
which are likely to become payable in the future.
Legal proceedings
Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings, including some in which claims for damages in large
amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors
believe that such litigation should be disposed of without material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition
or profitability.
Welding fumes litigation A US subsidiary of the Group, The BOC Group, Inc., has been named in US lawsuits
alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes. Certain of these cases have been either filed in, or transferred for
pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where a multi-district litigation
(MDL) proceeding has been commenced. The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating pre-trial proceedings
in cases pending in different federal district courts in the US. It is currently contemplated that the MDL court will
try three cases during the MDL proceeding. The first such case is currently scheduled for mid 2005. In addition 
to the cases in federal court, The BOC Group, Inc. is a defendant in a number of similar cases pending in state
courts. These cases are in different stages of procedural development, and certain cases are scheduled for trial
from time to time.
From the time Airco was purchased in 1978 until 2003 The BOC Group, Inc. had never had an adverse jury
verdict returned against it in a case alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes. On 28 October 2003, a jury in
Madison County, Illinois, rendered a verdict against The BOC Group, Inc. and two co-defendants. The jury
awarded US$1 million to Mr Elam, a former labourer who asserted that his idiopathic Parkinson’s disease was
attributable to his exposure to welding fumes over a period of years. BOC believes that the verdict is inconsistent
with the decisions rendered by juries in previous cases, is not supported by the existing scientific evidence and is
pursuing an appeal in the Illinois court system. On 12 May 2004 a jury in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania,
returned a verdict against The BOC Group, Inc. and one co-defendant. The jury awarded Mr Y encho, who alleged
that his injury was caused by exposure to asbestos in welding rods, US$525,000, to be divided between the
defendants. BOC believes that the jury verdict is inconsistent with the evidence introduced at trial and believes that
there are strong grounds for a successful post-trial motion and, if necessary, an appeal.
The BOC Group, Inc. believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in these various proceedings
related to alleged injury from exposure to welding fumes and intends to defend vigorously such claims. Based on
its experience to date, together with its current assessment of the merits of the claims being asserted and
applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of these proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition or profitability and no provision has been made.
The welding electrodes business was sold in 1986 and the sale of the US packaged gas business, including the
operations involved in distributing packaged gases and welding equipment, was completed in July 2004.
Fluorogas litigation In February 2003, the company was notified that a jury verdict in the US District Court for 
the Western District of T exas (the District Court) was obtained for US$132 million against Fluorogas Limited,
The BOC Group, Inc. and The BOC Group plc. The verdict arose primarily out of an alleged breach of a
memorandum of understanding by Fluorogas Limited before it was acquired by The BOC Group plc in September
2001. In March 2003, the court also awarded interest and costs against the defendants, making them jointly and
severally liable for a total of US$174 million. A bond for the full amount was posted with the District Court as
part of the normal appeals process.
In August 2004, the appellate court reversed the entire judgement against the BOC entities and all but
US$170,000 in reliance damages against Fluorogas Limited. In addition, the appellate court remanded for
reconsideration by the District Court an award of attorney’s fees on the US$170,000 recovery.
Fluorogas Limited was placed in administration under the Insolvency Act of 1986 pursuant to an order of an
English Court. It is expected to remain in administration until the conclusion of the remand proceedings in the
District Court.
ERISA litigation An action was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois (the District
Court) against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan (the Plan). The plaintiffs brought this action on
behalf of themselves and all others similarly affected, alleging that the Plan improperly calculated lump sum
distributions from the Plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
In November 2003, the parties reached an agreement to settle at US$69 million (£43.2 million).
The settlement was approved by the District Court at a fairness hearing on 12 March 2004.
Insurance
Operational management is responsible for managing business risks. Several Group departments advise
management on different aspects of risk and monitor results. Insurance cover is held against major catastrophes.
For any such event, the Group will bear an initial cost before external cover begins.
Inflation
Over the last three years, inflation has not had a material impact on the revenue or profit of the Group.

Critical accounting policies
The principal accounting policies affecting the results of operations and financial condition are set out on pages 83
and 84 of the financial statements. The application of certain of these policies requires assumptions or subjective
judgements by management. Management bases these on a combination of past experience and any other
evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstances.
The application of these assumptions and judgements affects the reported amounts of profit during the year
and the assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using
these assumptions and judgements. Management believes that the following are the critical policies where the
assumptions and judgements made could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
T angible fixed assets A significant part of the capital employed of the Group, particularly in the Process Gas
Solutions and Industrial and Special Products lines of business, is invested in tangible fixed assets. The nature of the
business demands significant capital investment to renew or increase production capacity or to enable the business
to achieve greater productivity and efficiency.
It is the Group’s policy to depreciate tangible fixed assets, except land, on a straight line basis over the
effective lives of the assets. This ensures that there is an appropriate matching of the revenue earned with the
capital costs of production and delivery of goods and services. A key element of this policy is the estimate of the
effective life applied to each category of fixed assets which, in turn, determines the annual depreciation charge.
In deciding the appropriate lives to be applied, management takes into account various factors including, among
other things, the accumulated experience of the effective asset lives from historic business operations and an
assessment of the likely impact of any changes in technology.
While Group earnings in any period would fluctuate if different asset lives were applied, in some cases the
original estimated life of an asset is closely related to contractual arrangements with large customers. Some of the
earnings impact of choosing a different asset life would be mitigated, as the different life may reflect different
contractual arrangements with such customers. Nevertheless, variations in the effective lives could impact the
earnings of the business through an increase or decrease in the depreciation charge. It is estimated that a change 
of one year in the effective life of all plant, machinery, vehicles and cylinders would have an impact of between 
£15 million and £20 million on annual Group operating profit. A change in the effective life of buildings would have
only a negligible impact.
Intangible fixed assets In a similar manner to tangible fixed assets, management uses its judgement to determine
the extent to which goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business has a value that will benefit the performance
of the Group over future periods. It is the Group’s policy to amortise goodwill on a straight line basis over its useful
economic life. This takes into account, among other things, the maturity of the business acquired and its product
and customer base. Any change in these assumptions would have an impact on the earnings of the Group.
It is estimated that a change of one year in the useful economic life of all goodwill would have an impact of
approximately £1 million on annual Group operating profit.
Retirement benefits Results of the Group include costs relating to the provision of retirement benefits for
employees. It is the directors’ responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the
costs of meeting such future obligations. The assumptions are based on actual historical experience and are set
after consultation with the Group’s actuaries. They include the assumptions used for regular service costs and for
the financing elements related to the pension schemes’ assets and liabilities. Whilst management believes that the
assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect both the operating profit and
net interest cost of the Group.
There are a number of elements used in the assumptions. These vary for the different countries in which the
Group operates, and there may also be an inter-dependency between some of the assumptions. As a result, it
would be impractical and potentially misleading to give any approximate impact on annual Group operating profit
of a change in any one assumption in isolation.
Environmental provisions In certain parts of the business, mainly in the US, the Group has obligations to carry out
environmental clean-ups at former and current production sites. Many of these obligations will not arise for a
number of years, and the costs are difficult to predict accurately. Management uses its judgement and experience
to provide an appropriate amount for the likely cost of such clean-ups, and the amounts, if material, are
discounted to present values. Both the amount of anticipated costs, and the interest rates used to discount such
costs, are subjective. The use of different assumptions would impact the earnings of the Group.
It is estimated that a change of one per cent in the interest rate used to discount such costs would have an
impact of approximately £1 million on annual Group profit before tax.
Current asset provisions In the course of normal trading activities, management uses its judgement in establishing
the net realisable value of various elements of working capital – principally stocks, work-in-progress and accounts
receivable. Provisions are established for obsolete or slow moving stocks, bad or doubtful debts and product
warranties. Actual costs in future periods may be different from the provisions established and any such differences
would affect future earnings of the Group.
The provisions are established at levels appropriate to the circumstances within individual Group business
units, and not on a Group-wide systematic basis. It is therefore considered that any estimate of the impact on
annual Group operating profit of any change in such provisions may not be meaningful. Nevertheless, a change of
ten per cent in the level of provision for bad and doubtful debts at 30 September 2004 would have an impact of
approximately £3 million on annual Group operating profit.
The areas covered by critical accounting policies under UK GAAP do not materially differ from those 
under US GAAP . Further details of the differences between UK and US GAAP are given in note 30 to the 
financial statements.
Financial review  54 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Accounting
The Group’s accounting policies are based on accounting policies generally accepted in the UK (UK GAAP).
Two new accounting standards were issued during the year – FRS20: Share-based payment, and FRS21:
Events after the balance sheet date. Both of these standards are effective for financial periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2005 and therefore have not been adopted by the Group for the financial year ended 
30 September 2004.
In 2004, the Group applied UITF 37: Purchases and sales of own shares, and UITF 38: Accounting for ESOP
trusts. These deal mainly with the balance sheet accounting treatment for own shares and do not have any impact
on Group earnings. Comparative figures have been restated accordingly (see note 31 to the financial statements).
The codification on revenue recognition, issued as an application note to FRS5: Reporting the substance of
transactions, had no impact on the Group’s turnover.
International Financial Reporting Standards
Under European Union legislation, all listed companies will be required to report under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005. The first annual report
and accounts for The BOC Group prepared under IFRS will be for the year ended 30 September 2006. At that
time comparative information will be restated on the same basis. Interim results for the year to 30 September
2006 will also be prepared on an IFRS basis.
In early 2004 the International Accounting Standards Board completed its work on developing and improving
those standards which would be mandatory for the first year of adoption of IFRS by listed companies.
For The BOC Group, the size and scope of this project is significant and work on it began in 2003. It is
overseen by a formal steering committee containing, amongst other members, the Group finance director, senior
members of the finance function and representatives from all relevant parts of the Group's finance community.
The restatement of the opening balance sheet will be completed in 2005. While the exact financial impact 
of the changes in Group accounting policies as a result of IFRS is still being assessed and has not yet been finalised,
the following key areas of difference have been identified:
a) accounting for options and other share-based payments. This will require a charge against profit;
b) the treatment of goodwill. Existing goodwill, and goodwill on future acquisitions, will no longer be amortised.
However, amortisation will continue to be charged on other intangibles, more of which are expected to be
identified in future business acquisitions. Also, future annual impairment reviews of goodwill could result in
periodic charges against profit;
c) financial instruments. Accounting for derivative financial instruments may cause some volatility of earnings,
although this is not expected to be significant as the Group has few financial instruments and they are
restricted to managing currency and interest rate risk.
Other areas impacted to a lesser extent include the treatment of deferred tax and intangible assets. The presentation
and layout of the financial statements will also be affected. As the Group already reports its obligations for post
retirement benefits under UK GAAP FRS17, there is not expected to be any significant impact as a result of
adopting the equivalent international standard, IAS19 (subject to ratification of the proposed revision to IAS19).
As the impact of IFRS is finalised, issues may arise in other areas. However, from the initial assessment of IFRS
as it currently stands, management believes that Group earnings and shareholders’ funds are unlikely to be
materially different from those reported under existing UK GAAP .
The steering committee is also managing the other change aspects of this project - for example, business
systems changes, training programmes for all personnel concerned and other communication issues. Work on
these aspects is proceeding according to plan. The Group’s auditors have been kept informed of, and consulted on,
the development of the IFRS project and the preparation of the new Group accounting policies.
US GAAP
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP , which differs in certain
respects from US GAAP .
The US accounting information in note 30 to the financial statements gives a summary of the principal
differences between the amounts determined in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies (based on UK
GAAP) and amounts determined in accordance with US GAAP together with the reconciliation of net profit 
and shareholders’ funds from a UK GAAP basis to a US GAAP basis and a movement in shareholders’ funds 
on a US GAAP basis.
The net income for the year ended 30 September 2004 under US GAAP was £297.7 million (2003:
£264.3 million, 2002: £255.4 million), compared with the net profit of £264.0 million in 2004 (2003: £219.1 million,
2002: £202.9 million) under UK GAAP . Shareholders’ funds at 30 September 2004 under US GAAP were 
£1,920.1 million (2003: £1,872.5 million), compared with £1,675.3 million (2003: £1,686.7 million) under UK GAAP .
The difference primarily results from the differing accounting treatment of pensions, goodwill, financial instruments,
investments, fixed asset revaluations and variable interest entities.
Related party transactions
During the year, interest income of £7.3 million (2003: £7.6 million, 2002: £8.3 million) was received from the
Cantarell joint venture in Mexico. The Group had no other material related party transactions.
Financial review  Exchange rates 
The majority of the Group’s operations are located outside the UK and operate in currencies other than sterling.
The effects of fluctuations in the relationship between the various currencies are extremely complex and
variations in any particular direction may not have a consistent impact on the reported results. In 2004, sterling
strengthened against two of the four principal currencies affecting the Group: by 12 per cent against the US dollar
and by two per cent against the Japanese yen. Sterling weakened by six per cent against the Australian dollar and
by ten per cent against the South African rand.
In 2003, sterling strengthened against the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Sterling weakened against the
Australian dollar and South African rand.
In 2002, sterling strengthened against the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the South African rand. It was
almost unchanged against the Australian dollar.
The rates of exchange to sterling for the currencies which have principally affected the Group’s results over
the last five years were:

Principal operating companies
The following operating companies principally affect the amount of profit or assets of the Group:
• The BOC Group Inc, a wholly-owned Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of The BOC Group Inc,
a wholly-owned Nevada corporation;
• BOC Limited, a wholly-owned English company;
• BOC Limited, a wholly-owned Australian company;
• Gist Limited, a wholly-owned English company;
• Japan Air Gases Ltd, a Japanese company, in which the Group’s Japanese 98 per cent owned subsidiary holds
45 per cent;
• African Oxygen Limited, a South African company, in which the Group’s shareholding is 56 per cent.
Supplier payment policy
The Group applies a policy of agreeing and clearly communicating the terms of payment as part of the commercial
arrangements negotiated with suppliers and then paying according to those terms. In addition the UK-based
businesses have committed to the ‘Better Payment Practice Code’. A copy of the code can be obtained from the
Department of Trade and Industry, DTI Publications Orderline, Admail 528, London SW1W 8YT .
For UK businesses, of amounts owing to suppliers, trade creditors represents 55 days at 30 September 2004.
Going concern
The directors are confident, after having made appropriate enquiries, that both the company and the Group have
adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. Management believes that its current credit facilities provide
sufficient working capital to meet the present requirements of its existing businesses and that the gearing ratio is
appropriate given the nature of the Group’s activities.
Substantial holdings
Details of substantial holdings of Ordinary shares at 18 November 2004 are shown on page 133.

The BOC Group is committed to business integrity, high ethical values and professionalism in all its activities.
As an essential part of this commitment, the board supports the highest standards of corporate governance.
Combined Code on Corporate Governance
BOC has applied the principles contained in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance
appended to the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules and has complied throughout the year with the provisions set
out therein as they applied to the company.
In 2003 the Combined Code on Corporate Governance was revised with the new code taking effect for
reporting years beginning on or after 1 November 2003. Although BOC is not required to report on how it has
applied the principles of the revised code until 2005, the company has a strict policy of reviewing its corporate
governance procedures and has implemented changes as considered appropriate such that at this time BOC is
substantially in compliance with the provisions of the new code. The report below incorporates narrative covering
those areas of the new code on which the company can report at this time.
US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002
BOC has securities registered in the US and, as a result, is required to comply with those provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) that apply to foreign private issuers. Whilst the company already had
a robust corporate governance framework in line with best practice under UK standards, the requirements of
Sarbanes-Oxley were considered and adjustments made to enhance further compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley as
far as it applies to BOC. The board continues to monitor the implementation of the rules to ensure continued
compliance.
As recommended by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), BOC has established a disclosure
committee. The committee comprises the Group finance director, Group legal director and representatives from
the finance, company secretarial, treasury, investor relations, risk management and human resources functions.
The committee meets regularly. It is responsible for overseeing and advising on the disclosure process for the
quarterly results announcements and on the content and form of the annual report and Form 20-F. T o permit the
signing of the certifications required by Sarbanes-Oxley the committee makes recommendations to the chief
executive, Group finance director and executive management board on the adequacy of Group disclosure
controls and procedures.
New Y ork Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Listing Standards
In November 2003, the SEC approved changes to the listing standards of the New Y ork Stock Exchange (NYSE)
related to the corporate governance practices of listed companies. BOC, as a foreign private issuer with American
Depositary Shares listed on the NYSE, is required to comply with certain of these rules and must disclose any
significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US domestic companies
under the NYSE listing standards. At this time, BOC does not believe that there are any significant differences in
the corporate governance practices followed by the company, as compared to those followed by US domestic
companies except that the membership of the nomination committee is not composed entirely of independent
non-executive directors. The membership of the nomination committee is however in line with the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance, which permits membership of this committee to be composed of a majority 
of independent non-executive directors.
The board
There are 13 members of the board namely the chairman, five executive directors and seven non-executive
directors who collectively have responsibility for leadership of the company. The directors holding office at the date
of this report and their biographical details are given on pages 8 and 9. The executive directors are the chief
executive, Group finance director and the three chief executives of the lines of business.
The roles of chairman and chief executive have been separate since 1994. Rob Margetts as chairman leads
the board, ensuring that each director, particularly the non-executive directors, are able to make an effective
contribution. He monitors, with assistance from the company secretary, the information distributed to the board
to ensure that it is sufficient, accurate, timely and clear. He meets twice a year with the non-executive directors
without the executive management present. T ony Isaac as chief executive maintains day-to-day executive
management responsibility for the company’s operations, implementing Group strategies and policies agreed by
the board. The division of responsibilities between the chairman and chief executive has been agreed with the
board as a whole.
During the year Rob Margetts has ceased to be governor of Imperial College, London and has also ceased 
to be chairman of the Government Industry Forum for the Non-Food Uses of Crops. He has recently become 
a member of the International Advisory Board of T eijin Ltd, a time commitment of approximately six days a year.
He remains chairman of Legal & General Group plc and is also a non-executive director of Anglo American plc.
During 2004, as part of a comprehensive board evaluation, the non-executive directors undertook a thorough
review of the chairman’s performance and considered this against the background of his other commitments.
In their view the chairman has performed extremely well against all the measured criteria. He has consistently
demonstrated full commitment to his responsibilities at BOC and he has always made himself available when
circumstances require additional time commitment. Rob Margetts’ appointment as chairman anticipates
approximately one and a half days a week activities at BOC and the board is satisfied that he has both the personal
commitment and available time to fulfil his responsibilities as chairman of the company. Furthermore, the board is
of the view that Rob Margetts’ expertise and the continuity that he brings to the post of chairman is of great
benefit to BOC.
CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE 57 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
The senior independent director is Sir Christopher O’Donnell. He has responsibility for chairing meetings of the
non-executive directors at which the chairman’s performance is appraised. He is also available to shareholders
should they have any concerns which contact through other channels has failed to resolve or for which such
contact may be inappropriate.
During the year Fabiola Arredondo and Roberto Mendoza resigned as non-executive directors on 
28 February 2004 and 12 May 2004 respectively. Guy Dawson was appointed as a non-executive director on 
1 March 2004, with both Anne Quinn and Iain Napier appointed non-executive directors on 1 May 2004.
Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term after which, whilst not automatic, their
appointment may be extended for a second term subject to mutual agreement and shareholder approval.
The Group has long recognised the vital role that non-executive directors play in ensuring high governance
standards. BOC has for many years had a significant presence of high calibre non-executive directors bringing a
wide range of experience and expertise to the BOC board. The board has determined that all the non-executive
directors are independent in accordance with the definition of that term pursuant to the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance and the New Y ork Stock Exchange listing standards, including Matthew Miau who is also a
non-executive director of BOC Lienhwa Industrial Gases Company Limited, a BOC joint venture in T aiwan. He is a
representative of BOC’s joint venture partner, Lien Hwa Industrial Corporation. Matthew Miau is the chairman of
MiTAC-Synnex Group, a major electronics organisation with a turnover greater than that of BOC, and he brings
considerable expertise in the electronics and semiconductor markets and an Asian business perspective to the
board of BOC. The turnover of the joint venture attributable to BOC represents approximately one per cent 
of the Group’s total turnover. The board do not consider this association or the time period with which he has
been connected with the company to be of sufficient significance to BOC or Matthew Miau to compromise 
his independence.
The board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it. In particular the board’s main focus is on strategic
and policy issues and reviewing objectives and performance. The board also has responsibility for the review and
monitoring of key company policies in such areas as risk management, treasury matters and corporate social
responsibility including safety, environment and the Code of Conduct. On an annual basis the board reviews the
senior managers and their succession and development plans. The board has to approve all Group commitments
in excess of £25 million. Presentations are made to the board on major projects and periodic reviews are given by
management from each of the lines of business. The board delegates certain functions to committees. There are
six board committees, details of which are given below.
The board meets six times a year, with two meetings held at major operating subsidiaries. One of the
meetings is a combined board and strategy meeting lasting over a period of two days. The meetings held at
operating sites provide the opportunity for the board to meet with the local management teams and
presentations about the local business operations are made to the board. During 2004 the board visited the
company’s operations in Shanghai and also the UK headquarters of Gist.
The attendance of directors at board and principal board committee meetings during the year are detailed

Throughout 2004 the company has continued to maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
There is a well established procedure enabling any director, in the furtherance of his or her duties as a BOC
director, to seek independent professional advice at the company’s expense.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary. The company secretary has
responsibility for ensuring that the correct board procedures are followed and advises the board on all corporate
governance matters. In addition the company secretary ensures that information and documentation required by
the board, in particular meeting papers, are provided to the board promptly with sufficient time to enable them to
prepare fully for any meeting.
Corporate governance  Induction and professional development
Upon joining the board, new directors are required to undertake a full induction comprising site visits, meetings
with the lines of business chief executives, each member of the executive management board and also key
external advisers. This is supplemented by a reference binder, which is regularly updated, including information
about the board, the committees, directors’ duties, procedures for dealing in the company’s shares and other
regulatory and governance matters.
Appropriate training and briefings are available to all directors on appointment and subsequently, as necessary,
taking into account their individual qualifications and experience and any training requirements that may be
identified during the annual performance review process. The company secretary monitors the availability and
suitability of external courses, details of which are circulated to the board. During the year certain of the non-
executive directors have attended seminars relating to their areas of responsibility. The board receives regular
briefings on governance and regulatory matters affecting the Group and its market sector activity and also on
litigation relating to the Group.
The non-executive directors have full access to management and both internal and external auditors, and are
encouraged to stay fully abreast of the Group’s business aided by site visits and meetings with senior management.
Performance evaluation
BOC commenced formal review of the board, the principal board committees and the individual directors in 2002
using an internal process conducted by the chairman. In 2003 a more comprehensive review was undertaken using
an external facilitator. When the results of the 2003 review were considered by the board it was decided that the
process would alternate each year between internal and external reviews.
Therefore, during 2004 the chairman conducted an internal review comprising a questionnaire covering, inter
alia, the role and organisation of the board, meeting arrangements, information provision and committee
effectiveness. Following completion of the questionnaires the chairman met with each director to discuss their
views and to give feedback on individual performance. The results of the evaluation were reported to the board
and where areas for improvement have been identified, actions have been agreed.
Sir Christopher O’Donnell, as the senior independent director, led a meeting of the non-executive directors
to appraise the performance of the chairman.
Board committees
There are six board committees to which the board delegates specific areas of responsibility as described below.
The terms of reference of each of the audit, nomination and remuneration committees are available on the
company’s website (www.boc.com) or upon request to the company secretary.
Audit committee
Members: Julie Baddeley, Andrew Bonfield, Guy Dawson, Matthew Miau, Iain Napier, Sir Christopher O’Donnell
(chairman) and Anne Quinn. Secretary: Nick Deeming.
The audit committee meets four times a year, the agendas being organised around the company’s financial
reporting cycle. Members attendance at meetings is detailed on page 57 and their qualifications are on pages 8 and
9. Time is set aside at one of these meetings for the committee to meet with the internal and the external auditors
separately without the executive management present. The committee reviews the effectiveness of internal
controls, matters raised by the internal and external auditors in their regular reports to the committee and the
quarterly financial statements prior to their release, as well as the arrangements by which staff of the Group may,
in confidence, raise concerns. The committee also ensures that an appropriate relationship between BOC and the
external auditors is maintained and reviews the policies and procedures in place to ensure the independence and
objectivity of the audit. The work undertaken by the committee during 2004 is described in more detail in its
report below.
Andrew Bonfield is considered by the board to be the audit committee financial expert. He is a non-
executive director and is considered to be independent in accordance with the definition of that term pursuant to
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and the New Y ork Stock Exchange listing standards. All other
members of the committee are financially literate.
Audit committee report
In 2004 the audit committee discharged its responsibilities as set out in the terms of reference and the specific
matters reviewed by the committee included:
a) interim and full year financial results and announcement statements;
b) interim and full year report from the internal audit function of progress against the 2004 audit plan and
effectiveness of internal controls;
c) the Group's project to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This
review included the project plan, progress against the plan and matters arising in the implementation of the
plan;
d) details of the Group's project to transition to International Financial Reporting Standards from 2006;
e) the external audit plan for 2004 performed by the Group's auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC).
This review included the audit objectives, auditor independence and objectivity policies managed by PwC,
partner rotation, audit scope, team, timetable deliverables and fee proposal;
58 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Corporate governance  f) the annual report disclosure items relevant to the audit committee. Included in this review were the Group's
critical accounting policies, the going concern statement, the report on risk and internal controls and the risk
factors statement. The audit committee also reviewed the disclosure control review procedures employed by
the Group which enabled the chief executive and Group finance director to sign the Section 302 and 906
certificates pursuant to the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
g) the external auditor report for 2004;
h) the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, including a review of non-audit fees. The audit
committee has reviewed and approved a policy for the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor.
This policy has been in place since 2002 and defines services which can be provided by the auditor. The policy
also specifies which services cannot be provided. The policy requires all non-audit services to be approved in
advance by the audit committee, which has delegated this task to the chairman of the audit committee. The
approval process requires full disclosure of the objectives and scope of the services to be performed and fee
structure. The audit committee reviews all approved services at subsequent meetings. The auditor is
permitted to perform non-audit services only if the scope of work is within the terms of the policy and there
is a business benefit to the Group in these services being performed by the external auditors rather than an
alternative supplier. The level of the fee spend is closely monitored to ensure independence and objectivity 
of the audit is maintained. Further details of actual fees paid to external auditors are given in note 2c) on 
page 90;
i) the procedures by which staff can report, in confidence, any matters of a financial or non-financial nature
alleging breaches of the Group’s Code of Conduct. The audit committee also reviewed the procedures by
which allegations are reported to senior management and the audit committee.
During this period the audit committee met with the Group’s external auditors without the presence of
management. The audit committee also met with the Group’s head of internal audit without the presence of
management. The head of internal audit has access to the chairman of the audit committee, if necessary, outside 
of meetings.
Regular attendees to audit committee meetings, at the invitation of the chairman of the committee, include:
the chairman, chief executive, Group finance director, director of risk management, head of business assurance
audit, director financial planning and control, and the external auditors.
The audit committee concludes that, based on the foregoing, it has discharged its responsibilities as set out in
the terms of reference and is satisfied that auditor independence and objectivity have been maintained.
Nomination committee
Members: Julie Baddeley, Andrew Bonfield, Guy Dawson, T ony Isaac, Rob Margetts (chairman), Matthew Miau,
Iain Napier, Sir Christopher O’Donnell and Anne Quinn. Secretary: Nick Deeming.
The nomination committee meets periodically as required but at least annually. During 2004 the committee
met six times. Members attendance at meetings is detailed on page 57. The committee primarily monitors the
composition and balance of the board and its committees, and identifies and recommends to the board the
appointment of new directors. The committee also keeps under review the board committee structure and
composition and makes recommendations to the board of any changes considered necessary. Whilst the chairman
of the board chairs this committee he is not permitted to chair meetings when the appointment of his successor is
being considered or during discussion regarding his performance.
On an annual basis the committee carries out a review of the succession plans for the executive directors 
and the executive management board, the reappointment of non-executive directors upon expiry of their term 
of office and the proposals for re-election of directors retiring by rotation at the Annual General Meeting.
Directors submit themselves for re-election at regular intervals and at least every three years in accordance 
with the company’s Articles of Association and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. During these
deliberations consideration is given to the results of the annual board evaluation. The evaluation process is
explained in more detail above.
During the year three new non-executive directors were appointed to the board. When considering the
appointment of new directors the committee reviews the current balance of skills and experience on the board.
A detailed specification is drawn up to include any specific knowledge or expertise that is considered of future
benefit to the board and having regard to the business throughout the Group and the overall business strategy.
External search agents are then used to identify suitable candidates who are short listed and then evaluated by the
committee before it submits its recommendation to the board as a whole.
Remuneration committee
Members: Julie Baddeley (chairman), Andrew Bonfield, Guy Dawson, Matthew Miau, Iain Napier, Sir Christopher
O’Donnell and Anne Quinn. Secretary: Rob Lourey.
The remuneration committee meets six times a year. Members attendance at meetings is detailed on page
57. The committee recommends to the board the policy on executive directors’ remuneration and the specific
remuneration, benefits and terms of employment of each executive director. The committee’s full report on
directors’ remuneration is set out on pages 64 to 75.
Pensions committee
Members: Julie Baddeley (chairman), Guy Dawson, Rob Margetts, T ony Isaac and René Médori 
Secretary: Stephen Pegg, Corporate pensions director.
The pensions committee meets twice a year and oversees the review of governance and control procedures
applying to all employee retirement benefit plans, and reviews and makes recommendations on the investment
policies and strategies applied to the Group’s retirement benefit plans.

Executive management board
The members of the executive management board are detailed on pages 10 and 11 and are considered as the
officers of the company. The executive management board is chaired by T ony Isaac. All members held office
throughout the year ended 30 September 2004 except that Greg Sedgwick resigned on 31 December 2003 and

Accountability and audit
Statements of the respective responsibilities of the directors and auditors for these accounts are set out on pages
76 and 77.
Risk management and internal controls
This statement of compliance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance in respect of risk management
and internal controls is in line with the arrangements set out by the UK Listing Authority.
The board has overall responsibility for the Group's system of risk management and internal controls.
The schedule of matters reserved to the board ensures that the directors maintain full and effective control
over all significant strategic, financial, organisational and compliance issues.
Risk management in BOC The BOC risk management programme assists management throughout the Group to
identify, assess and mitigate business risk.
The objective of risk management within BOC is to improve performance and decision making through
identification, assessment and mitigation of key risks.
A dedicated central team of risk management specialists is responsible for delivering the risk management
programme. During 2004 approximately100 risk workshops or reviews have been conducted covering a broad
range of matters. These include risks in strategy, risks in meeting business unit targets, risks in acquisitions or
ventures and risks in major projects.
The risk management process operates on a global basis and covers the Group’s key risks, lines of business,
business units and corporate functions.
The output from each risk assessment is a set of prioritised risks with associated action plans. Line
management retains responsibility for completion of action plans. Progress of action plans is monitored and
reported.
A report on the risk management process is provided to the board twice a year. These reports include
reviews of key strategic risks to the Group as well as the individual lines of business and identifies the status of
action plans against key risks.
Internal controls in BOC The directors have delegated to executive management the establishment and
implementation of a system of internal controls appropriate to the various business environments in which it
operates. The Group operates under a system of controls that has been developed and refined over time to meet
its current and future needs and the risks and opportunities to which it is exposed. These controls, which are
communicated through various operating and procedural manuals and processes, include but are not limited to:
• the definition of the organisational structure and the appropriate delegation of authorities to operational
management;
• procedures for the review and authorisation of capital investments through the investment committee
including post-acquisition reviews and appraisals;
• strategic planning and the related annual planning process including the ongoing review by the board of the
Group’s strategies;
• the establishment of individual business unit annual performance targets and the quarterly business review of
actual performance;
• the monthly financial reporting and review of financial results and other operating statistics such as the health
and safety reports as well as the Group’s published quarterly financial statements, which are based on a
standardised reporting process;
• accounting and financial reporting policies to ensure the consistency, integrity and accuracy of the Group’s
accounting records;
•specific treasury policies and objectives and the ongoing reporting and review of all significant transactions and
financing operations.
Corporate governance  The internal control system is monitored and supported by an internal audit function that operates on a global
basis and reports its results on the Group’s operations to management and the audit committee. The work of the
internal auditors is focused on the areas of greatest risk to the Group determined on the basis of a risk
management approach to audit.
There have been regular reviews by the audit committee of the board of the effectiveness of the Group’s
overall internal control processes throughout the year.
During 2004 the Group has developed and progressed its plan to meet the requirements of Section 404 of
the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is a requirement for BOC with effect from 2005. The internal audit function has
played an important role in developing and implementing the plan to identify, document and test key controls over
financial reporting.
The directors therefore believe that the Group’s system of risk management and internal controls provides
reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets are safeguarded, transactions are authorised and recorded
properly and that material errors and irregularities are either prevented or would be detected within a 
timely period.
Having reviewed its effectiveness, the directors are not aware of anything in the Group’s system of internal
controls during the period covered by this report and accounts which could render them ineffective.
There were no changes in the Group’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred in the year
ended 30 September 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, the Group’s internal
control over financial reporting.
Disclosure controls and procedures
The chief executive officer and Group finance director, based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Group’s
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report and accounts, have
concluded that, as of such date, the Group’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Going concern
The directors’ report on going concern is included in the financial review on page 55.
Communications with shareholders
The board considers communications with shareholders, whether institutional investors, private or employee
shareholders, to be extremely important. A variety of communication mechanisms are used by the company.
Financial results are published quarterly, and half year and annual reviews are sent to all shareholders. Copies of the
full annual report are available by election or on request. The company’s website (www.boc.com) provides financial
and other business information about The BOC Group. It contains an archive of past announcements and annual
reports, share price information and a calendar of events as well as BOC’s social responsibility polices, including the
company’s Code of Conduct. There are also facilities in place to enable shareholders to receive communications
from the company in electronic form rather than by mail and for shareholders to provide their proxy votes for the
Annual General Meeting by electronic means.
The Annual General Meeting provides an opportunity for shareholders to question directors about the
company’s activities and prospects. The chairmen of each of the principal board committees are normally present.
During the year responses are given to letters received from shareholders on a variety of subjects.
There is a programme of regular dialogue with major institutional shareholders and fund managers and
summaries of these discussions and meetings are provided to the board. Periodically the board receives
presentations from external advisers on investor perceptions. In addition the board receives copies of most
analysts’ and brokers’ reports issued on the company. These summaries and reports enable the directors to gain an
understanding of the views and opinions of those with an interest in the company.

Corporate social investment
BOC is committed to being a positive contributor to the communities in which it operates. This includes: operating
safely and environmentally; enhancing the wellbeing of local economies by providing employment on the bases of
equal opportunities and merit; and playing a part in supporting community activities.
BOC’s social investment programme has five key themes:
a) to focus on projects to improve environmental stewardship;
b) to support educational programmes in selected areas;
c) to devolve the choices of charitable donations to the businesses and employees through matched giving and
local volunteering and donations schemes;
d) to encourage the organisation’s involvement in selected social programmes in local communities around the
world; and
e) to develop further BOC’s global diversity programmes.
Investing in education
BOC’s Inspiring Gases education programme made significant progress with the development of a series of
educational aids and implementation of a UK-wide network of BOC employee science ambassadors, who offer
schools and colleges presentations on the uses of industrial gases. There is also an Inspiring Gases website at
www.boc.com/education.
Several BOC businesses initiated or strengthened their educational contributions. In southern Africa, BOC
companies supported education and training with external and employee bursaries, grants, in-house vocational
courses and incidental donations as well as continued support for a welding school and the Afrox Healthcare
College of Learning. In Thailand, the business supported several educational establishments with equipment and
bursaries for employee dependants.
Where appropriate, BOC continues to play an active part in local communities by harnessing its educational
capabilities through school tours, lessons in the properties of gases, technical support and academic research.
It also funds programmes and events such as the BOC Gases Challenge, which encourages UK secondary school
students to develop chemical engineering ideas, sponsorship of the UK’s Council for Industry and Higher
Education, the annual Institute of Chemical Engineers’ environment award, and the Salters’ Festivals of Chemistry
for the propagation of science amongst the young. The Salters’ festivals involved 500 schools and took place at
universities across the UK and Ireland.
Supporting the environment
The Group’s environmental flagship remains the UK-based BOC Foundation for the Environment, which was
established with an initial injection of £1 million in 1990. The Foundation has supported over 130 projects.
This year, the Group contributed £310,000 to the Foundation and saw eight new initiatives come on stream.
Since the Foundation’s inception BOC has donated £3.9 million. Combined funding from BOC and its 
co-sponsoring partners now exceeds £12 million. The Foundation concentrates on projects that improve air 
and water quality.
BOC made a number of other positive contributions to other environmental projects including the BOC
New Zealand community environmental grants programme and a scheme, ‘Where There’s Water’, which provides
funding to help communities maintain, protect and improve their water resources.
Corporate governance  Charitable donations and community involvement
BOC operates a wide-ranging programme of sponsorships and charitable donations, directing resources at areas
where the organisation feels it can make a difference or where employees have a direct involvement. In 2004,
BOC made charitable donations totalling £840,000 including £288,000 to UK-registered charities through direct
donations from the Group and matched giving. As in previous years, no political donations were made in the
European Union.
BOC employees have continued to involve themselves in charitable fundraising and voluntary support.
Matched giving schemes have been operating in the UK, the Americas and the south Pacific for some time.
For example, BOC has funded a matched giving scheme in the UK since 1987, doubling the money donated 
by employees to registered charities. T o make it easier to give to charity a new internal website enables UK 
employees to access the necessary matched giving information and forms. The schemes again proved their worth
as a way of aligning corporate funding with the personal generosity of BOC employees. In the course of 2004,
BOC in the UK donated £160,000 (included in the UK total above) through the Charities Aid Foundation to
match employee beneficence.
In addition to the numerous causes supported through matched giving, BOC also supported a number of
Group causes, including the Multiple Sclerosis Society, Royal British Legion, St John’s Ambulance and Macmillan
Cancer Relief.
BOC ran the third year of its BOC Emerging Artist Award to encourage and support a committed UK-based
artist for a year. The 2004 award, worth £20,000, was won by Mauro Bonacina, a graduate of Goldsmiths College,
University of London. Six other artists were also awarded £1,000 each as runners-up.
Outside the UK, local BOC businesses develop their own community programmes, each business being
responsible for its own project selection and funding within broad guidelines set by the organisation. This devolved
approach has resulted in the funding of a rich variety of programmes that are truly relevant to the communities in
which BOC companies operate.
In the US, through a combination of financial support and many hours of volunteer involvement, BOC and its
employees continued to assist the United Way charitable appeal, helping to make a difference in many deprived
sectors of the community. BOC in the US also pursued a number of other projects including support for local arts
and educational causes.
In the south Pacific, the business matches employee fundraising for charities selected by staff. In New Zealand,
for example, employees selected a range of charitable causes to support. In Australia, employees chose to
fundraise for cancer research, education and patient support. BOC in Australia continues a long-established
relationship with the Malcolm Sargent Cancer Fund for Children. BOC employees support this cause with financial
contributions and employee volunteering and fundraising activities.
In South Africa, BOC’s subsidiary Afrox and its staff continued to support the company’s community
involvement process (CIP), which included the management of 122 projects to improve the lives of disadvantaged
young people. Once more, the highlight of the year was Bumbanani (meaning ‘let’s build together’) Day when
15,600 children attended events hosted by BOC staff.
In addition, Afrox hospitals engage in a wide range of health care and safety initiatives, including selected
sponsorship, supporting people in their recuperation and rehabilitation after surgery and treatment. Some Afrox
hospitals have a special outreach service in the form of rape crisis centres and AIDS/HIV clinics. Medical
examinations are conducted in a non-threatening environment with the emphasis placed on maintaining the dignity
of the victim. Preventive medication and antiretroviral drugs are given against sexually transmitted diseases.
BOC and its employees have been active in many other markets. BOC in Pakistan continued to provide
support to community organisations dealing with poverty alleviation, education and health care. Support
continued for: the Layton Rehmatulla Benevolent Trust, an organisation dedicated to providing free eye care; the
Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre; the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, the first institution in Pakistan
dedicated to cancer treatment; and the Aga Khan Medical Hospital and Foundation. BOC was one of the founding
contributors to the Aga Khan Foundation which runs a world class university hospital affiliated to the Harvard
Medical School. BOC in China continued a support programme to facilitate screened blood donations to local
hospitals. In Thailand, BOC sponsored a sports programme helping to discourage drug use. In Malaysia, BOC
supported the National Cancer Society, culminating in a sponsored balloon race to raise awareness in the country.
The event in Kuala Lumpur was officiated by Her Royal Highness the Queen of Malaysia.
In Chile, BOC supported the Catholic University of Chile with sponsorship of its engineering school and
departments of mining investigations, environmental management and teaching through the Internet. In Venezuela,
BOC donated funds and helium balloons to schools and orphanages and breathing oxygen to local fire stations.
In Curaçao, the organisation channels support through the local Rotary Club and contributed to various youth
education and care for the elderly projects. In India, BOC made a number of contributions across a range of
poverty alleviation and community welfare initiatives.

Corporate governance 
63 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 The remuneration committee 
The remuneration committee comprises all the independent non-executive directors namely Julie Baddeley
(chairman), Andrew Bonfield, Guy Dawson (appointed 1 March 2004), Matthew Miau, Iain Napier (appointed 
1 May 2004), Sir Christopher O’Donnell and Anne Quinn (appointed 1 May 2004). Whilst neither the Group
chairman nor the chief executive are members of the remuneration committee they both attend the meetings by
invitation but are not present when their personal remuneration is discussed and reviewed. The human resources
director acts as secretary to the committee and provides it with information and data from national and
international surveys. He is assisted by the Group compensation and benefits director. In addition the
remuneration committee has appointed T owers Perrin to advise on the remuneration arrangements for senior
executives. T owers Perrin also provided advice on the design of the proposed share matching plan.
The remuneration committee sets the overall remuneration policy of the Group and makes
recommendations to the board on the framework of executive remuneration. It meets six times a year.
Individual member attendance at the meetings is shown on page 57. The terms of reference are reviewed annually
to ensure that they conform with best practice. Specifically, the remuneration committee determines, on behalf 
of the board, the detailed terms of service of the executive directors and other members of the executive
management team including basic salary, performance related bonus arrangements, benefits in kind, long-term
incentives and pension benefits. The remuneration committee also reviews the remuneration of the chairman,
following a recommendation from the chief executive and the senior independent director. The board as a whole
determines the non-executive directors’ fees.
Remuneration policy 
BOC’s remuneration policy for executive directors and other executive management is designed to attract and
retain executives of the highest calibre so that the Group is managed successfully to the benefit of its stakeholders.
In setting remuneration levels the remuneration committee takes into account the remuneration practices found in
other UK listed companies of similar size, internationality and complexity. The policy is to pay salaries and total
remuneration around mid-market levels for on target performance and to provide the opportunity, via annual and
long-term incentives, for executives to be rewarded at the 75th percentile if this is justified by the achievement of
top of the range performance goals. It is the view of the remuneration committee that performance-related
remuneration should form a substantial element of total remuneration. Based on assumptions about expected
values for awards from the Long-T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS), the
proportion of performance-related remuneration to fixed remuneration (excluding pensions and benefits in kind)
for current arrangements is approximately 60 per cent (see chart 1).
Remuneration components 
Basic salary Salaries for executive directors and executive management board members are based on median
market rates drawn from market data provided by T owers Perrin and take account of an executive’s experience,
responsibilities and performance. Performance is assessed both from an individual and business perspective.
Executive salaries are reviewed annually by the remuneration committee. Remuneration for those executives of
businesses outside the UK is denominated in the local currency.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind comprise company car benefits and membership of BOC’s healthcare insurance
scheme. Where appropriate directors on international assignment receive overseas allowances such as housing
and children’s education fees. These allowances are on similar terms to those applying to other employees on the
international programme. Such benefits are in line with those offered by peer group companies. Benefits in kind do
not form part of pensionable earnings.
Variable compensation plan (VCP) The executive directors and senior management participate in the variable
compensation bonus plan. The plan focuses on annual objectives and links individual performance with business
plans. The financial targets for the executive directors and other executive management board members are set
on an annual basis by the remuneration committee and performance against these targets is reviewed by the
remuneration committee on a six monthly basis. The remuneration committee considers that a six monthly review
acts as a significant incentive and is conducive to sustaining performance throughout the year. The financial targets
are based equally on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) at Group
level. Adjusted means excluding exceptional items. Bonuses are assessed two-thirds on these financial targets with
the remaining third based on personal objectives. These are based on BOC’s strategic priorities and include safety,
growth, people and change management and productivity. Performance is measured against key performance
indicators determined during formal appraisals. There is a threshold performance level below which no bonus is
paid. For 2004 the financial targets set by the remuneration committee were EPS 56.2p and ROCE 13.3 per cent
and the achievement against these targets was EPS 63.2p and ROCE 15.4 per cent. The remuneration committee
agreed that the maximum bonus payable would be 100 per cent of salary.
The bonuses for the executive directors and other members of the executive management board are paid
half yearly following the remuneration committee review. Details of the payments to directors are included in the
directors’ remuneration for the year on page 70.

Current expected value (chart 1)

Long-T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) Executive directors, members of the executive management board and a
number of other key executives selected from the company’s global operations participate in the LTIP . The
remuneration committee has the discretion to grant awards up to a maximum of two times salary. The award
made in February 2004 to the chief executive was based on 1.9 times salary and for other board directors 
1.5 times salary. There are three performance conditions: total shareholder return (TSR), adjusted earnings per
share (EPS) and adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE). Up to one third of the award could vest in 
respect of each performance condition.
The TSR performance condition compares BOC’s TSR performance with two separate comparator groups,
a UK comparator group comprising 31 industrial and manufacturing companies and a global industrial gases group
of six leading companies as follows:
UK group
Aggregate Industries BPB Invensys Scottish & Southern Energy 
AMEC Centrica Johnson Matthey Scottish Power
Anglo American Corus Group Kelda Group Severn Trent
AWG FKI National Grid T ransco Shell T ransport & T rading
BAE Systems Hanson Pilkington Smiths Group
BG Group IMI Rio Tinto T omkins
BHP Billiton ICI RMC Group United Utilities
BP International Power Rolls-Royce
Global gases group
Airgas (US – S&P 500 Index)
Air Liquide (France – CAC 40 Index)
Air Products & Chemicals (US – S&P 500 Index)
Linde (Germany – DAX 30 Index)
Nippon Sanso (Japan – NIKKEI 225 Index)
Praxair (US – S&P 500 Index)
The BOC Group (UK – FTSE100 Index)
When determining BOC’s performance relative to the global gases group, the TSR for BOC and the comparator
companies will be adjusted (adjusted TSR) so that it reflects the excess (or shortfall) in returns relative to the local
stockmarket index where each company has its primary listing. The nationality and the local stockmarket index that
will be used to calculate the adjusted TSR for each company is shown in the parentheses.
For the awards made in February 2004 which will vest in February 2007 the target set by the remuneration
committee is such that if the company’s TSR position measured over a three year period is median in respect of
both comparator groups, then 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the
company’s TSR position is upper quartile all of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the
TSR performance is between the median and upper quartile a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the
shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the company’s TSR position is below the median for both
comparator groups the TSR part of the award will lapse. The same TSR performance criteria was used for the
awards made in February 2003.
The adjusted EPS performance condition is based on the company’s EPS relative to three year targets on a
sliding performance scale. For the award made in February 2004 which will vest in February 2007 the target set by
the remuneration committee is 60.3p at the end of the three year performance period for minimum vesting. If this
is achieved 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest. All of the shares in respect
of the EPS part of the award will vest if the company achieves 69.3p at the end of the three year performance
period. If the EPS performance is between 60.3p and 69.3p a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the
shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest. If EPS is less than 60.3p over the three year period the EPS
part of the award will lapse. The EPS targets for the award made in February 2003 were 64.75p for minimum
vesting and 74.45p for full vesting.
The adjusted ROCE performance condition is based on the company’s ROCE relative to three year targets
on a sliding performance scale. The minimum target set by the remuneration committee for the award made in
February 2004 which will vest in February 2007 is 13.5 per cent at the end of the three year performance period.
If this is achieved 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest. All of the shares in
respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest if the company achieves a ROCE of 15 per cent. If the ROCE
performance is between 13.5 per cent and 15 per cent a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares
in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest. If the ROCE is less than 13.5 per cent the ROCE part of the
award will lapse. The ROCE targets for the award made in February 2003 were 13.0 per cent for minimum vesting
and 14.5 per cent for full vesting.
In setting three performance conditions for the LTIP award, the remuneration committee took the view that
these were the most important measures that drive or measure sustainable improvements in shareholder value:
the TSR performance condition measures comparative performance while EPS and ROCE reflect a core part of
the company’s business strategy, which is to improve both earnings growth and capital efficiency.
Report on remuneration

Report on remuneration
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 (ESOS 2003) Executive directors, members of the executive management
board and other selected middle and senior management throughout the company’s global operations currently
participate in the ESOS 2003. The remuneration committee has the discretion to grant awards up to a maximum
of two times salary. The awards made in November 2003 to the chief executive and other members of the board
were based on one times salary. The performance condition set for the ESOS 2003 by the remuneration
committee is that the growth in the adjusted EPS over a three year performance period must be equal to or
greater than the growth in the UK retail prices index (RPI) plus three per cent per annum over the three year
performance period. The performance is assessed on the company’s published results. If the performance
condition is satisfied at the end of the performance period then the awards would be exercisable in full. In line with
current corporate governance best practice there is no rolling re-testing of performance. In the event that the
performance condition is not satisfied over the original three year period then the remuneration committee has
the discretion to re-test performance after five years, but only where the remuneration committee believes the
extension to be a fair and reasonable basis for assessing the sustained underlying performance of the company.
The remuneration committee considers this performance condition to be a challenging performance hurdle when
compared to the company’s adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate before exceptional items over the last
ten years of around four per cent.
Awards under the LTIP and ESOS 2003 may be satisfied in cash or other assets, for example, where it is
necessary for legal or tax reasons. The amount to be paid will, in the case of share options, be equal to the
participant’s gain on the exercise of the share option. Also, the remuneration committee may decide, prior to
grant, that an award shall be expressed to be a right to acquire a cash sum rather than shares. This type of award,
known as a phantom award, will normally only be granted to participants in jurisdictions where, because of local
security laws or exchange control provisions, it is difficult to issue or transfer shares to employees. The LTIP and
ESOS 2003 awards may be satisfied by using existing shares purchased in the market through The BOC Group plc
Employee Share Trust or by issuing new shares.
Awards under the LTIP and ESOS 2003 are not pensionable.
The current performance measures as a percentage of salary for on target performance are shown in chart 2.
Savings Related Share Option Schemes These are operated in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland and
are open to all employees including executive directors with one year’s service or more. The UK scheme is
approved by the Inland Revenue. The current schemes are due to expire in 2005 and a proposal to adopt new
schemes is to be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in January 2005.
TSR performance 
The graph to the left has been included to meet the requirement set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. It shows BOC’s TSR performance, assuming dividends are reinvested, compared with all
FTSE100 companies. This has been chosen because it provides a basis for comparison against companies in a
relevant, broad based equity index of which BOC is a constituent member. The remuneration committee 
decided that other comparator groups were more appropriate as performance measurement for the LTIP .
A graph showing BOC’s TSR performance compared with the six major gases companies relative to respective
local indices, which is one of the comparator groups chosen for the LTIP , is shown in the chairman’s statement 
on page 4. The October 1999 position reflects the premium arising from the pre-conditional cash offer of 
£14.60 per share made jointly by Air Liquide and Air Products.
Former long-term incentive arrangements
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 The last grant of options to the executive directors and members of the
executive management board took place in February 2002 and the last award to other Group employees took
place in December 2002. No further awards will be made under this scheme. The options vest when the
company’s adjusted EPS growth is equal to, or exceeds, the growth in the retail prices index (RPI) by three per
cent per annum over any three year performance period.
Senior Executive Share Option Scheme The last grant under this scheme took place in November 1994. In line
with market practice at the time when this scheme was introduced the vesting of these awards was not subject to
performance conditions.

Pension arrangements for executive directors are in line with those of comparable executives in the countries in
which the directors are located.
In the UK, the BOC senior executive pension scheme is a funded, tax-approved, defined benefit pension
arrangement. Where necessary, the director’s pensionable pay is limited by the ’earnings cap’ provisions of the
Finance Act 1989. In such cases, the company pays the director a salary supplement on earnings above the
earnings cap to reflect the loss of pension coverage. This supplement is recorded in the director’s emoluments and
is not taken into account in calculating bonuses or any other form of remuneration.
BOC closed its UK defined benefit pension arrangements to all new employees on 30 June 2003.
Pension arrangements for new employees are provided under a defined contribution Retirement Savings Plan.
The company makes contributions to the plan equal to two times the employee’s core contributions which can 
be three, four or five per cent of salary.
In the US, the Cash Balance Retirement Plan is a funded, tax-qualified, defined benefit arrangement.
In the US, the BOC T op-Hat Pension Plan is an un-funded, non-tax-qualified, defined benefit arrangement
which tops up the benefits provided under the Cash Balance Retirement Plan.
In Australia, the BOC Gases Superannuation Fund is a funded, defined contribution arrangement
underpinned by a defined benefit guarantee for long-serving employees who were members under a prior 
benefit structure.
Details of directors’ individual remuneration, share options, LTIP awards and share holdings are given on 
pages 70 to 75.
Outside appointments 
The remuneration committee’s view is that non-executive directorships are a significant benefit in broadening
executives’ experience. Any such appointments are subject to review by the nominations committee and the
approval of the board.
Remuneration proposals 
During the year the remuneration committee reviewed the performance-related elements of the executive
remuneration package and decided that it was necessary to make a number of changes. In considering the current
package and possible changes, the remuneration committee was concerned more with the effectiveness of some
of the arrangements rather than their level. As stated the policy is to pay salaries and total remuneration around
mid-market levels for on target performance and to provide the opportunity, via annual and long-term incentives,
to reward executives at the 75th percentile if this is justified by the achievement of stretching performance goals.
There is no intention to change this policy. The proposed changes are intended to make the reward package 
more effective. It will increase the expected value of the total package for the achievement of stretching
performance goals. The proposed changes also enhance the retention value of our remuneration arrangements.
The remuneration committee believes that the annual bonus plan (VCP) and the LTIP are effective and do focus
attention on the main drivers of BOC’s performance, particularly ROCE and earnings growth. There is also
alignment with shareholder interests via the TSR element of the LTIP and the fact that awards under the LTIP are
delivered in shares. However, the remuneration committee has become concerned about the efficiency and
effectiveness of the Executive Share Option Scheme. Being totally dependent upon stockmarket movements,
share options can generate a range of rewards from large to zero with variable motivational or retention value.
The remuneration committee is also concerned that the dilution impact of options is inefficient from a 
shareholder standpoint.
For the reasons outlined above the remuneration committee proposes:
•to cease making option awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) to the executive directors
and other executives covered by the VCP . However, the ESOS will be kept in place for the time being for
employees below this level until an alternative scheme can be developed in the near future. The facility will
also be kept to make option awards to executives who are covered by VCP on an exceptional basis, for
example as part of a hiring package. There is however no intention to make any further awards to existing
executive directors;
• to increase the target and maximum value of the VCP to 110 per cent and 160 per cent respectively of salary
and at the same time introduce a deferred, share-matching plan, compulsorily deferring one-third of the 
VCP bonus (see details below). The current target value of the VCP is 73.4 per cent and the plan is capped 
at 100 per cent;
• to seek approval to increase the maximum award levels to be made under the LTIP from 200 per cent to 
250 per cent of salary. The remuneration committee’s purpose in seeking approval for a higher maximum is
simply to give flexibility to remain fully competitive in the event that a higher level of award is required for an
appointment to an executive role. In the immediate term, however, this change would have little practical
impact as the intention next year is simply to increase the chief executive’s conditional share award from 
1.9 times salary to 2.0 times and to make no increase to the 1.5 times salary award received by other
directors last year.

67 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Share Matching Plan 
The main features of the proposed Share Matching Plan are as follows:
• at the same time that the VCP opportunity is increased, one-third of any VCP award (an amount equivalent
to the increase) will be compulsorily applied to the acquisition of BOC shares;
• the executives will become entitled to these shares only if they are still in service with BOC three 
years after the award is made;
•executives will then receive an additional number of shares equal to the value of dividends paid during the
deferral period on these shares;
•executives may also receive a matching share award of up to 100 per cent of the number of shares originally
allotted. The percentage award will depend on BOC’s performance over the deferral period. Adjusted EPS
will account for 75 per cent of the performance weighting with TSR accounting for the remaining 25 per cent;
• the adjusted EPS performance condition is based upon the company’s EPS relative to three year targets.
These targets will be on a sliding scale, where a five per cent per annum growth rate over three years is
required for the minimum award of 25 per cent of that portion. The maximum award will be achieved if EPS
growth is 12 per cent per annum over the three year period;
• the TSR performance condition compares BOC’s TSR performance against the same UK comparator group
as used for the LTIP . Awards will vest for this portion where BOC’s TSR position is at median, measured over
three years. At this point 25 per cent of this portion of the award will vest. A maximum award of 25 per cent
overall will vest if the company is ranked at or above the upper quartile.
As previously stated, it is the view of the remuneration committee that performance-related remuneration should
form a substantial element of total remuneration. The effect of these proposals would lead to a shift in the balance
of variable performance-related remuneration to fixed remuneration (see charts 3 and 4).
The weightings for the performance measures as a percentage of salary for on target performance would also
change (see charts 5 and 6).
Non-executive directors 
Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term after which, whilst not automatic, their
appointment may be extended for a second term subject to mutual agreement and shareholder approval.
The fees are set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a
significant contribution to The BOC Group’s affairs and are benchmarked with those fees paid by other UK listed
companies. The basic fees for the non-executive directors are £40,000 per annum, £10,000 of which, less tax,
is invested in BOC shares. In addition, the fees for chairing a committee are £10,000 per annum, £5,000 of which,
less tax, is invested in BOC shares. The fees were last reviewed in November 2003. The next review will be in
November 2005. The fee for Rob Margetts, company chairman, which was set at £225,000 in 2001 will be
increased to £260,000.
The non-executive directors do not have contracts of service nor do they participate in the Group’s variable
compensation arrangements, its long-term incentive arrangements or its pension arrangements, nor do they
receive any benefits in kind.

The company’s policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of employment that terminate on the
attainment of retirement age. In order to mitigate its liability on early termination, the company’s policy is that it
should be able to terminate such contracts on no more than 12 months’ notice, and that payments on termination
are restricted to the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the average of
actual payments over the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period. Pension provisions
on termination are detailed in the individual service contracts below.
Individual service contracts Mr Bevan has a contract dated 5 December 2002 that can be terminated by the
company on 12 months’ notice. In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the payment of
compensation based on the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the
average of actual payments over the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Mr Bevan would also be entitled to his deferred pension, with the unexpired portion of the notice period being
added to his pensionable service in the calculation of his pension entitlement.
Mr Isaac has a contract dated 19 November 2002, varied by letter dated 1 June 2004, which expires 
upon the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2007 subject to possible extension by mutual agreement.
The contract can be terminated by the company on 12 months’ notice. In the event of early termination,
the contract provides for the payment of compensation based on the value of salary, car benefit and bonus
entitlement (calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over the preceding two years) for the
unexpired portion of the notice period. Mr Isaac would also be entitled to a contribution to his funded
unapproved retirement benefit scheme amounting to the sum of 40 per cent of his pay above the ’pension cap’
imposed by the Finance Act 1989 and 58.33 per cent (50 per cent prior to 6 April 2003) of his pay up to the 
cap for the unexpired portion of his notice period.
Mr Médori has a contract dated 19 November 2002 that can be terminated by the company on 12 months’
notice. In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the payment of compensation based on the
value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over
the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period. Mr Médori would also be entitled (a) to
have his deferred pension from the UK senior executive pension scheme paid without actuarial reduction from age
55; and (b) to an immediate payment representing the discounted value of the difference in the capital values of a
pension calculated as in (a) and a pension calculated as in (a) but with the addition of the unexpired portion of his
notice period in the calculation of pensionable service.
Dr Rajagopal has a contract dated 1 May 1999, amended 22 November 2002, that can be terminated by 
the company on 12 months’ notice. In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the payment of
compensation based on the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the
average of actual payments over the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Dr Rajagopal would also be entitled to have his deferred pension from the UK senior executive pension scheme
(a) calculated with the inclusion of the unexpired portion of his notice period in the calculation of pensionable
service; and (b) paid without actuarial reduction from age 55.
Mr Walsh has a contract dated 21 November 2002 that can be terminated by the company on 12 months’
notice. In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the payment of compensation based on the
value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement (calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over
the preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period. Additionally, the unexpired portion of
Mr Walsh’s notice period would be added to his pensionable service in the calculation of his pension entitlement
from the US T op-Hat Pension Plan.
All the above contracts can be terminated by the individual director on six months’ notice.
Shareholding guidelines 
The remuneration committee encourages the executive management group to grow personal shareholding in 
the business over time. It is anticipated that each executive would build towards a shareholding of one times salary.
The remuneration committee believes that the vehicle of the long-term incentive arrangements will facilitate the
building of such a shareholding over a period of time.

Pensions
The pension arrangements for each individual director are as follows:
Mr Bevan’s pension is provided under the Australian superannuation fund. On retirement at age 60 he will be
entitled to the accumulated value of his defined contribution fund subject to that not being less than the
guaranteed lump sum of approximately six times his final 12 months’ salary.
Mr Isaac’s pension is being funded in the UK through a combination of a tax-approved personal pension plan
and a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme.
Mr Médori’s pension benefits are funded under the UK senior executive pension scheme on earnings up to
the ’earnings cap’ imposed by the Finance Act 1989. On retirement at age 60, he will be entitled to a pension of
57.5 per cent of capped earnings. In addition, he has a vested deferred benefit, under the US Cash Balance

a salary supplement on earnings above the earnings cap to reflect the loss of pension coverage.
Dr Rajagopal’s pension benefits are funded under the UK senior executive pension scheme. On retirement at
age 60, he will be entitled to a pension of two-thirds of his final 12 months’ salary.
Mr Walsh’s pension is provided under the US Cash Balance Retirement Plan and the US T op-Hat Pension
Plan, which, in combination, entitle Mr Walsh to a lump sum benefit on retirement at age 62 equivalent to a
pension of approximately 66 per cent of final base salary. In accordance with local competitive practices existing in
his country of operation prior to his appointment as a director, Mr Walsh’s bonus is pensionable.

Report on remuneration 
75 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the Group at the end of the year and of the profit or loss for
the year. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company and the Group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the financial position of the company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. The directors also have general responsibility for taking
reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.
A copy of the financial statements of the company is placed on the website of The BOC Group plc.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of statutory and audited information on the
company’s website. Information published on the Internet is accessible in many countries with different legal
requirements. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DIRECTORS
For preparation of the financial statements
76 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Independent auditors’ report to the members of The BOC Group plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Group profit and loss account, the Group balance
sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the total recognised gains and losses, the movement in shareholders’
funds, the balance sheet of The BOC Group plc, Group undertakings, accounting policies and the related notes.
We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained 
in the report on remuneration (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the report on remuneration.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the report on remuneration in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s
members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person 
to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent
in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether
the financial statements and the auditable part of the report on remuneration have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the report of the directors  is
not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider the implications for our 
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. The other information comprises only the financial highlights, chairman’s statement, chief executive’s
review, board of directors, executive management board, Group five year record, Group profile, employees,
social, environmental and ethical performance, research and development and information technology, risk factors,
operating review, financial review, the unaudited part of the report on remuneration, responsibility of the
directors, dividends, nature of trading market, analysis of shareholdings, taxation, financial calendar, key contacts
information, cross reference to Form 20-F and glossary of terms.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company’s compliance with the seven
provisions of the Combined Code issued in June 1998 specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s or
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the auditable part of the report on remuneration. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the auditable part of the report on remuneration are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the
Group at 30 September 2004 and of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended; the financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and those parts of the
report on remuneration required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

BALANCE SHEET OF THE BOC GROUP plc
At 30 September
82 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 General
• Basis of preparation These financial statements are based on the historical cost accounting convention in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and comply with all applicable UK accounting standards.
UK accounting standards differ in certain respects from those generally accepted in the US and the major effects of these differences in the
determination of net income and shareholders’ funds are shown in note 30 to the financial statements. Disclosure requirements of both the 
UK and US are incorporated throughout the notes to these financial statements.
• Basis of consolidation The Group accounts include the accounts of the parent undertaking and of all subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
The results of businesses acquired during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition. The results of businesses disposed of
during the year are included up to the date of relinquishing control. Material, separately identifiable business segments disposed of are analysed as
discontinued operations and prior years’ analyses are restated to reflect those businesses as discontinued.
• Accounting policies These accounts have been prepared on an accounting basis consistent with that applied in the financial year ended 
30 September 2003, except for changes arising from the application of UITF37: Purchases and sales of own shares, and UITF38: Accounting for
ESOP trusts. These deal mainly with the balance sheet accounting treatment for own shares and do not have an impact on Group earnings.
Comparative figures have been restated accordingly. The impact is explained further in note 31 to the financial statements.
• Exchange Profit and loss and other period statements of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at average rates of exchange for the financial
year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the financial year end. Assets or liabilities
swapped into other currencies are accounted for in those currencies. Exchange differences are dealt with as a movement in reserves where they
arise from:
i) the translation of the opening net assets of overseas operations;
ii) the retranslation of retained earnings of overseas operations from average to closing rates of exchange; and 
iii) the translation or conversion of foreign currency borrowings taken to hedge overseas assets.
All other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account. The principal exchange rates affecting the Group are shown in the financial
review on page 55.
Revenue recognition
Turnover is based on the invoiced value of the sale of goods and services, and includes the sales value of long-term contracts appropriate to the state 
of completion. It excludes sales between Group undertakings, VAT and similar sales-based taxes. T urnover for goods and services is recognised when the
significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. This is determined to be when delivery has occurred, title of the goods has
passed to the purchaser, and where the price is fixed or determinable and reflects the commercial substance of the transaction. Sales returns are not a
significant business issue in the industries in which the Group operates.
Profit on long-term contracts is recognised on a percentage of completion basis. Provision is made for all losses incurred together with any
foreseeable future losses.
Retirement benefits
Retirement benefits are accounted for under FRS17.
For defined benefit schemes the regular service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to operating profit in
the year. The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service is also charged to operating profit in the year.
A credit representing the expected return on the assets of the retirement benefit schemes during the year is included within other net financing
income. This is based on the market value of the assets of the schemes at the start of the financial year.
A charge representing the expected increase in the liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes during the year is included within other net financing
income. This arises from the liabilities of the schemes being one year closer to payment.
Differences between actual and expected returns on assets during the year are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in the
year, together with differences arising from changes in assumptions.
For defined contribution schemes the cost of providing benefits is charged to operating profit as incurred.
Research and development
Revenue expenditure on research and development is written off when incurred.
Operating leases
The cost of operating leases is written off on the straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Intangible fixed assets
• Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
assets acquired, is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, generally up to a maximum period of 20 years.
An impairment review is carried out at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition. Any impairment in the value of goodwill, calculated
by discounting estimated future cash flows, is dealt with in the profit and loss account in the period in which it arises. Negative goodwill, being the
excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired over the fair value of the purchase price, is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis,
generally over a period equivalent to the realisation of the non-monetary assets acquired.
Goodwill, both positive and negative, arising on acquisitions before 30 September 1998 was taken to reserves and has not been reinstated on
the balance sheet. This is in line with the relevant accounting standard on goodwill, FRS10. This goodwill will remain in reserves until such time as it
becomes impaired or the business or businesses to which it relates are disposed of, at which time it will be taken to the profit and loss account or
statement of total recognised gains and losses where appropriate.
• Intangibles Other material intangible assets acquired, such as patents and trademarks, are capitalised and written off on the straight line basis over
their effective economic lives.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
83 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 T angible fixed assets
T angible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. No depreciation is charged on freehold land or construction in progress.
Depreciation is charged on all other fixed assets on the straight line basis over the effective lives. Straight line depreciation rates vary according to 
the class of asset, but are typically:
Per annum
Freehold property 2%–4%
Leasehold property (or at higher rates based on the life of the lease) 2%–4%
Plant and machinery 3%–10%
Cylinders 4%–10%
Motor vehicles 7%–20%
Computer hardware and major software 15%–25%
• Until 30 September 1999, land and buildings were revalued periodically. Following the adoption of FRS15, land and buildings are no longer revalued.
At 1 October 1999, the net book value of assets previously revalued is regarded as the historical cost.
• Interest costs on major fixed asset additions are capitalised during the construction period and written off as part of the total cost.
• Where finance leases have been entered into, the capital element of the obligations to the lessor are shown as part of borrowings and the rights in
the corresponding assets are treated in the same way as owned fixed assets.
• Any impairment in the value of fixed assets, calculated by comparing the carrying value against the higher of the net realisable value or value in use,
is dealt with in the profit and loss account in the period in which it arises.
Investments
Investments which are held for the long term and in which the Group has a participating interest and exercises joint control with one or more other
parties are treated as joint ventures and accounted for on the gross equity method. Investments which are held for the long term and in which the Group
has a participating interest and exercises significant influence are treated as associates and accounted for on the equity method. In both cases, the Group’s
share of the results of the investment is included in the profit and loss account, and the Group’s share of the net assets is included in investments in the
balance sheet. Other investments are shown on the balance sheet at cost less any provision for impairment.
Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost where appropriate includes a proportion of overhead expenses.
Work in progress is stated at cost less progress payments received or receivable. Cost is arrived at principally on the average and ‘first-in, first-out’ (FIFO)
basis. The amount of long-term contracts, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales and after deducting foreseeable losses and payments on account, is
included in stocks as long-term contract amounts.
Deferred tax
The Group provides for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial
statements and their recognition for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are only recognised where it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Provisions
Provisions are made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably
estimated. Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and well
advanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
The Group uses financial instruments, including interest rate and currency swaps, to raise finance for its operations and to manage the risks arising from
those operations. All transactions are undertaken only to manage interest and currency risk associated with the Group’s underlying business activities and
the financing of those activities. The Group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
• Foreign exchange transaction exposures The Group generally hedges actual and forecast foreign exchange exposures up to two years ahead.
Forward contracts are used to hedge the forecast exposure and any gains or losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on contracts designated 
as hedges of forecast foreign exchange are deferred until the financial period in which they are realised. If the contract ceases to be a hedge, any
gains and losses are recognised through the profit and loss account.
• Balance sheet translation exposures A large proportion of the Group’s net assets are denominated in currencies other than sterling. Where
practicable and cost effective the Group hedges these balance sheet translation exposures by borrowing in relevant currencies and markets and by 
the use of currency swaps. Currency swaps are used only as balance sheet hedging instruments, and the Group does not hedge the currency
translation of its profit and loss account. Exchange gains and losses arising on the notional principal of these currency swaps during their life and at
termination or maturity are dealt with as a movement in reserves. If the swap ceases to be a hedge of the underlying transaction,any gains or losses
are recognised in the profit and loss account.
• Interest rate risk exposures The Group hedges its exposure to movements in interest rates associated with its borrowings primarily by means 
of interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements. Interest payments and receipts on these agreements are included with net interest payable.
They are not revalued to fair value and shown on the Group balance sheet at the balance sheet date.

4. The increase in joint ventures in 2003 is principally due to the formation of the Japan Air Gases business in January 2003. Prior to that all of BOC’s turnover in Japan was reported by 
subsidiary companies.

3. The decrease in capital employed of joint ventures in 2004 is principally due to the acquisition of an additional 30 per cent ownership interest in the Cantarell joint venture (see note 28a)).
4. The increase in joint ventures in 2003 is principally due to the formation of the Japan Air Gases business in January 2003. Prior to that all of BOC’s turnover in Japan was reported by 
subsidiary companies.

i) Restructuring costs
Following the sale of the packaged gas business in the US, costs of £14.8 million have been incurred to restructure the footprint of the remaining business
in the US. This covers the severance and other costs of restructuring those functions which are shared by BOC’s businesses in the US. Restructuring costs
also include a charge of £2.6 million (2003: £8.3 million, 2002: £nil) relating to the integration of BOC’s gases business and part of the Air Liquide business
in Japan to form Japan Air Gases.
The restructuring costs in 2003 and 2002 related to various programmes including programmes under the business initiative announced in August
2001. The major programmes covered investments in information management systems, the restructuring of BOC Edwards’ manufacturing capacity and
restructuring to deliver operational efficiencies in Process Gas Solutions and Industrial and Special Products. These programmes have been completed.
Cash flow from operating activities includes an outflow of £11.9 million in 2004 (2003: £28.3 million, 2002: £48.0 million) in respect of the various
restructuring programmes.
ii) Litigation settlement
An action was filed in the US against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan (the Plan). It was alleged that the Plan improperly calculated lump
sum distributions from the Plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. In November 2003, the parties reached an agreement 
to settle at US$69 million (£43.2 million). The settlement was approved by the court in March 2004. The full amount was provided in 2003 as an
exceptional item. The settlement is being paid out of Plan assets.
iii) Write-down of assets
The write-down in 2002 related to the merger of BOC’s gases business and part of the Air Liquide business in Japan to form Japan Air Gases. The net
assets of OSK (the existing BOC gases business in Japan) were reduced to an appropriate amount based on valuations performed ahead of the merger.
iv) Costs of proposed takeover
No costs were incurred in 2004 or 2003. The final costs associated with the pre-conditional offer for the Group were incurred in 2002 in respect of share
options and other costs related to the retention of key employees.

v) Disposal of businesses
The sale of the packaged gas business in the US was completed on 30 July 2004. The loss on disposal of £79.5 million includes the write-off of the assets
associated with the business, severance and other disposal costs. It also includes a goodwill write-off of £19.9 million, of which £15.3 million had been
written off to reserves in the years up to, and including, 1998 in accordance with prevailing UK GAAP at that time.
In 2002 BOC Edwards sold its US glass coating business, resulting in a profit on disposal of £1.1 million.
vi) Profit on disposal of fixed assets
The sale of property in the UK in 2004 resulted in a profit of £4.9 million, which has been accounted for as an exceptional item.
vii) Closure of business
In 2002 BOC merged its Process Plants business with Linde Engineering in the US to form a new company, Linde BOC Process Plants LLC. T otal costs
were £21.3 million, which covered severance, the write-down of assets and other costs of winding down the business.

implementation of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 Section 404 which is treated as a non-audit service in 2004. The expatriate administration contract
was signed in June 2001 for a five year period following a competitive tender process. Further details of BOC’s policy on the use of external auditors for
non-audit services is given in the audit committee report on page 59.

d) Factors that may affect future tax charges
The total charge in future periods will be affected by any changes to the corporation tax rates in force in the countries in which the Group operates.
The current tax charges will also be affected by changes in the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation and the use of tax credits.
e) Unused tax credits
On a consolidated basis, the Group has net operating loss carryforwards of £57.0 million. If not offset against taxable income, these losses will expire as
follows:
Net
operating loss
Y ear £ million
2005 0.9
2006 –
2007 –
2008 –
2009 –
Thereafter, or no expiry date 56.1
For US Federal tax purposes, the Group has investment tax credits and general business tax credits to carry forward of approximately £10.3 million,
which are available to reduce income taxes otherwise payable. These do not expire until 2006 or thereafter.
In addition, the Group has alternative minimum tax credits for US Federal income tax purposes of approximately £22.7 million which can be carried
forward to reduce regular tax liabilities of future years. There is no expiration date on these credits.
Investment tax credits are accounted for by the flow-through method whereby they reduce income taxes currently payable and the provision for
income taxes in the period in which the assets giving rise to such credits are placed in service. Deferred tax assets, subject to the need for a valuation
allowance, are recognised to the extent that the investment tax credits are not currently utilised.

Notes to the financial statements
93 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 7.Options and incentive schemes
a) Policy
Executive options that are granted at the market price of the company’s shares at the time of the grant do not attract a compensation expense under UK
GAAP . For those executive options, including the Long-T erm Incentive Plan, that are granted at a discount to the market price of the company’s shares at the
time of the grant, the compensation expense is charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the option. The Group takes advantage of the
exemption granted under UITF17 (revised 2003), Employee Share Schemes, whereby no compensation expense need be recorded for employee schemes
that are granted at a discount.
b) Summary of movements
BOC operates share option schemes for both executives and employees. The features of these are given in the report on remuneration on pages 65 
and 66 and the employees report on page 24.

Notes to the financial statements
94 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 8.Pensions and other retirement benefits
a) UK GAAP Group
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. The larger schemes are self-administered and the schemes’ assets are held
independently of the Group’s finances. Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
Contributions to funded defined benefit schemes are based on advice from independent actuaries using actuarial methods, the objective of which is
to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due. For the two largest schemes, in the UK and US, the dates of the latest actuarial
reviews are 31 March 2002 and 1 January 2003 respectively.
In South Africa, under the Pension Funds Second Amendment Act 2001, surpluses in pension funds have to be used in a manner specified in
Regulations to the Act to improve current and former members’ benefits before the employer can obtain any benefit from the surpluses. Consequently,
it is considered unlikely that the company will obtain any benefit from the surpluses in the South African schemes. Therefore, in accordance with FRS17,
the surpluses at 30 September 2004 have been written off in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
In Europe, company contributions to the main scheme in respect of current service are currently payable at a rate of 13.8 per cent of payroll. In the
year ended 30 September 2004 the company made additional contributions of £30 million to this scheme in order to reduce the funding valuation deficit.
For the year to 30 September 2005, it is expected that additional contributions of £31 million will be made to this scheme, subject to review following the
next triennial funding valuation at 31 March 2005.
In the Americas, company contributions to the main pension plan remain suspended as the plan continues to be in surplus.
In Africa, company contributions were payable at rates ranging from 14 per cent to 21 per cent and are expected to remain at that level for the year
to 30 September 2005.
In Asia/Pacific, company contributions to the main scheme were payable at rates ranging from 11 per cent to 17 per cent and are expected to
remain at that level for the year to 30 September 2005.
Some of the defined benefit schemes, including the UK scheme, are closed to new members. It is therefore expected that under the projected unit
method prescribed by FRS17 the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The most recent actuarial funding valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries, in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 
30 September 2004 for the purposes of FRS17. Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 30 September 2004.

b) UK GAAP parent company
The company accounts for pension costs in accordance with FRS17 on retirement benefits. In accordance with the standard, the company treats
contributions to defined benefit schemes as if they were contributions to a defined contribution plan. This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of 
the defined benefit schemes cover a number of the Group’s UK undertakings and cannot readily be split between each undertaking on a consistent and
reliable basis.
The pension cost recognised in the company’s accounts is the total of company contributions payable to Group UK pension schemes in the year.
The assets of all Group UK pension schemes are held independently of the Group’s finances. The largest schemes are self-administered.
c) US GAAP
For the purposes of US GAAP , the pension costs of the largest schemes have been reclassified in the following tables in accordance with the requirement
of SFAS132. The changes in projected benefit obligation, plan assets and details of the funded status of these retirement plans, together with the changes
in the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligations of the Group’s US business, are given below. The measurement date for UK and US pension
plans is 30 June and the measurement date for the Australian and South African plans is 30 September. The difference between the UK and US GAAP
information disclosed in note 8a) and c) is included in note 30.
Investment strategy for the schemes is generally set by their respective trustee or fiduciary, after taking advice from their investment advisers,
and in consultation with the company. The strategy reflects the funding position of the schemes, and a careful assessment of the risks inherent over
the long term in various asset classes. The assets of the schemes are diversified by asset class, by investment manager and by geography, in order to
reduce risk. Strategy is reviewed periodically.
At 30 June 2004 the measurement date for SFAS132 reporting, the target asset allocation and actual asset allocation of the main UK scheme was:
2004 2003
T arget Actual Actual
Equity securities 70.0% 71.9% 73.0%
Debt securities 20.0% 19.2% 20.5%
Real estate 10.0% 7.8% 5.0%
Cash 0.0% 1.1% 1.5%
In the US, the fiduciary invests in short-term bonds to broadly cash match the liabilities that are expected to fall due within three years. The balance of the
plan’s assets are currently invested in equities. Following this policy, the actual asset allocations of the plan at 30 June 2004 was as follows:
2004 2003
Equity securities 77.5% 87.4%
Debt securities 22.5% 12.6%
The company establishes the long-term expected rate of return on the schemes’ assets by developing a long-term rate of return assumption for each
asset class, taking into account such factors as the market yield on bond investments of appropriate duration, and the expected risk premium for other
asset classes, based on long-term historical trends. A single, long-term return assumption is then calculated as a weighted average return, based on the
expected returns for each asset class.

For the post retirement medical benefits plan at 30 September 2004, the initial health care cost trend rates for valuing the medical benefits and drug
benefits post age 65 were 9.0 per cent (2003: 9.0 per cent) and 3.2 per cent (2003: 3.5 per cent) respectively. The rates for valuing post age 65 medical
benefits are assumed to reduce gradually to 4.5 per cent in 2011 (2003: 4.5 per cent in 2009). The rates for valuing drug benefits post age 65 are assumed
to reduce gradually to 0.65 per cent in 2011 (2003: 1.1 per cent in 2010). For valuing pre age 65 medical and drug benefits, a blended health care trend
rate of 9.0 per cent was used for 30 September 2004 (2003: 9.0 per cent). This blended rate was assumed to reduce gradually to 4.5 per cent in 2011
(2003: 4.5 per cent in 2010).

10.Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue 
during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential dilutive shares.
The company has only one category of potential dilutive shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the
average market price of the company’s shares during the year and where any performance conditions have been met at the balance sheet date.
Adjusted earnings per share (excluding exceptional items) are presented in order to show the underlying earnings performance of the Group.

c) Short-term interest rates
The average interest rate on commercial paper for the year to 30 September 2004 was 3.3 per cent (2003: 2.5 per cent) and on other short-term
borrowings was 9.3 per cent (2003: 8.7 per cent).
d) Facilities
The Group maintains a number of short and medium-term committed lines of credit. The main medium-term facilities are multi-currency agreements 
with a group of relationship banks, under which the Group may borrow up to US$450.0 million (£249 million) (2003: US$450.0 million (£271 million))
for general corporate purposes. These facilities were undrawn both at 30 September 2004 and 30 September 2003. The following table shows the
maturity profile of these facilities.

Additional committed facilities are maintained by the principal operating units in the Group.
e) Security
The secured loans, maturing between 30 September 2004 and 2019, are principally secured by charges over the property, plant and machinery, stocks
and trade debtors of certain overseas subsidiaries.
21.Financial instruments
a) Interest rate, currency and counterparty exposure
The Group’s approach to managing currency and interest rate risk and its use of swaps in that process is described on page 50 in the financial review
under the heading ‘management of financial risks’.
Interest rate swaps
At 30 September 2004, the Group had entered into five interest rate swap agreements (2003: six) with its main relationship banks with notional principal
amounts of £285.3 million (2003: £417.6 million). The swaps’ underlying currencies are sterling, US dollars and Japanese yen. The following table shows
the maturity profile and weighted average interest rates payable and receivable on interest rate swaps at 30 September:

Within one year – 125.0
285.3 417.6
% %
Weighted average receivable swap rate 3.8 5.2
Weighted average payable swap rate 4.5 4.0
The weighted average receivable/payable swap interest rate is calculated by applying the notional swap interest received or paid, using rates applicable at
the financial year end, to the notional principal of outstanding swaps at the financial year end.
During the year, the Group also entered into four interest rate swap agreements that are due to commence in 2006 and 2007 for a period of five
years. The notional principal amounts of these swaps are £105.4 million and their underlying currencies are US dollars and Japanese yen.

Currency swaps
At 30 September 2004, the Group had entered into 25 currency swap agreements (2003: 13) with its main relationship banks with notional principal
amounts of £593.1 million (2003: £474.7 million). The maturity dates range between one month and 48 months from the balance sheet date (2003:
between one month and 56 months). The following table illustrates the impact of the currency swaps on the Group’s net debt at 30 September:

The weighted average receivable interest rate on currency swaps was 3.9 per cent (2003: 3.4 per cent) and the weighted average payable interest rate
was 4.1 per cent (2003: 2.9 per cent). The weighted average receivable/payable swap interest rate is calculated by applying the notional swap interest
received or paid, using rates applicable at the financial year end, to the notional principal of outstanding swaps at the financial year end.
The currency and interest rate exposure of the net borrowings of the Group at 30 September, after taking into account interest rate and currency
swaps entered into by the Group, is given in the table below.

Counterparty risk
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. There are procedures and policies in place limiting the Group’s exposure to concentrations of credit or
country risk.

1. For those bearing either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value. For those bearing a fixed rate of interest an assessment of
the interest rate at which the Group could make the same loan under current conditions has been made. Unless this differs significantly from the fixed rate it is also deemed that the carrying
amount approximates to the fair value. Where this does differ significantly, the fair value is based on the discounted value of future cash flows.
2. For equity instruments listed on a recognised stock exchange the fair value is the quoted market price. For other equity instruments it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the 
fair value.
3. The fair value is the quoted market price. Where no quoted market price exists, it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
4. As all bear either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
5. For those bearing a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value. For those bearing a fixed rate of interest the fair value is either the quoted
market price where a liquid market exists or has been calculated using well established pricing models.
6. The carrying amount is deemed to approximate to the fair value.
7. The fair value is based on market valuations at the balance sheet date.
8. The fair value is based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
9. Includes foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements.
ii) Hedges
As explained on page 50 of the financial review under the heading ‘management of financial risks’, the Group’s policies are to use forward foreign exchange
contracts to hedge transactional currency exposures (principally arising through anticipated sales and purchase transactions) and swap agreements to manage
interest rate risks and hedge structural currency exposures.
Currency swaps are only held to change the currency of the Group’s borrowings to match better its net investments in its overseas subsidiaries.
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, the assets and liabilities arising from these swap agreements are translated into sterling at the spot rate ruling 
at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses (to match the exchange 
gains or losses on the net investments in the overseas subsidiaries).
The carrying amount of the swap agreements (as shown in note 21 b) i)) is the result of the exchange gains and losses recognised in the statement
of total recognised gains and losses, and is analysed in the deferred gains and losses table shown below.

c) Currency exposures
As outlined on page 50 in the financial review under the heading ‘currency risk’, it is the Group’s policy to hedge against the potential impact on its profit
and loss account of the currency gains and losses arising from monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the operating or functional currency of
the operating unit involved.
After taking account of the hedging transactions, there was no significant net profit and loss account exposure to currency gains and losses arising
from monetary assets and liabilities at 30 September 2004.

and £15.2 million (2003: £2.2 million) of loans to joint ventures and associates which have no fixed date of repayment.
The floating rate financial assets, which principally comprise cash and deposits, current asset investments and loans to joint ventures and associates,
carry interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of the balance.
The principal benchmark rates for floating rate financial assets are LIBOR for sterling balances, US LIBOR for US dollar balances, Australian bank bill
rate for Australian dollar balances, South African prime rate for South African rand balances and Japanese yen LIBOR for Japanese yen balances.

The floating rate financial liabilities principally comprise debt which carries interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of 
the balance.
The principal benchmark rates for floating rate financial liabilities are LIBOR for sterling balances, US LIBOR for US dollar balances, Australian bank
bill rate for Australian dollar balances, South African prime rate for South African rand balances and Japanese yen LIBOR for Japanese yen balances.
The maturity profile of borrowings is set out in note 20 b). Floating rate financial liabilities other than borrowings are mainly employee incentive
provisions. These are expected to be utilised over the period to 2011 depending on the future choices of the relevant employees. Financial liabilities on 
which no interest is paid principally relate to creditors due after more than one year. The majority of the amount relates to deposits for cylinder rentals.
It is not anticipated that this balance will reduce significantly in the short to medium term. The remaining balances falling due after more than one year 
are expected to be paid or utilised by 2009.

Notes to the financial statements
116 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 22.Provisions for liabilities and charges continued
Incentive and other employee provisions include long-term share incentive units and deferred compensation plans. Note 7 contains further details of the
long-term share incentive units.
Provision for uninsured losses covers third party liabilities or claims. Due to the time frame that is often involved in such claims, a significant part of
this provision is subject to actuarial valuation. Where this is not appropriate, other external assessments are used.
Environmental provisions have been set aside to cover the costs of remediation for a number of hazardous waste sites. The costs are expected to be
incurred between 2005 and 2030. Due to the period over which this expenditure is likely to be incurred, the provision has been discounted at a rate of 
four per cent. The effect of discounting is £8 million. Management expects that payments will be approximately £4 million each year for the next five years
and £10 million in total thereafter.
Other provisions are principally for warranty and legal costs.
Further information on deferred tax is disclosed in note 4.

There are no material exchange control restrictions on the remittance of funds to the UK.
ii) Goodwill written off against reserves in respect of continuing businesses acquired prior to 30 September 1998 amounts to £154.0 million 
(2003: £178.3 million). The decrease in the year principally reflects the disposal of the US packaged gas business and movements in exchange rates.
iii) In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, exchange gains (net of losses) on net borrowings credited to reserves in the year amounted to 
£59.7 million (2003: £20.4 million charge).
iv) There are no non-equity shareholders’ interests in the share capital and reserves of the Group.
v) The amount of the pensions’ reserves is equivalent to the net pensions liabilities (see note 8) adjusted for current tax of £22.0 million (2003: £nil,
2002: £nil).
vi) Own shares
The application of UITF38: Accounting for ESOP trusts has required the investment in own shares to be reclassified in the balance sheet as a deduction in
arriving at shareholders’ funds (see note 31).
At 30 September 2004, 5.0 million shares in the company were held pending the exercise of share options. Based on the company’s share price at
30 September 2004 of 884p, the market value of own shares held was £44.3 million. This compares with the acquisition cost above. The amount paid for
the shares reduces profit available for distribution.
Information on share option schemes appears in the report on remuneration and in notes 7 and 23.

b) Legal proceedings
Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings, including some in which claims for damages in large amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors believe that such litigation should be
disposed of without material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition or profitability.
Welding fumes litigation 
A US subsidiary of the Group, The BOC Group, Inc., has been named in US lawsuits alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes. Certain of these
cases have been either filed in, or transferred for pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where a multi-district
litigation (MDL) proceeding has been commenced. The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating pre-trial proceedings in cases pending in different
federal district courts in the US. It is currently contemplated that the MDL court will try three cases during the MDL proceeding. The first such case is
currently scheduled for mid 2005. In addition to the cases in federal court, The BOC Group, Inc. is a defendant in a number of similar cases pending in
state courts. These cases are in different stages of procedural development, and certain cases are scheduled for trial from time to time.
From the time Airco was purchased in 1978 until 2003 The BOC Group, Inc. had never had an adverse jury verdict returned against it in a case
alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes. On 28 October 2003, a jury in Madison County, Illinois, rendered a verdict against The BOC Group, Inc.
and two co-defendants. The jury awarded US$1 million to Mr Elam, a former labourer who asserted that his idiopathic Parkinson’s disease was
attributable to his exposure to welding fumes over a period of years. BOC believes that the verdict is inconsistent with the decisions rendered by juries in
previous cases, is not supported by the existing scientific evidence and is pursuing an appeal in the Illinois court system. On 12 May 2004 a jury in
Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, returned a verdict against The BOC Group, Inc. and one co-defendant. The jury awarded Mr Y encho, who alleged that
his injury was caused by exposure to asbestos welding rods, US$525,000, to be divided between the defendants. BOC believes that the jury verdict is
inconsistent with the evidence introduced at trial and believes that there are strong grounds for a successful post-trial motion and, if necessary, an appeal.
The BOC Group, Inc. believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in these various proceedings related to alleged injury from exposure
to welding fumes and intends to defend vigorously such claims. Based on its experience to date, together with its current assessment of the merits of the
claims being asserted and applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or profitability and no provision has been made.
The welding electrodes business was sold in 1986 and the sale of the US packaged gas business, including the operations involved in distributing
packaged gases and welding equipment, was completed in July 2004.
Fluorogas litigation 
In February 2003, the company was notified that a jury verdict in the US District Court for the Western District of T exas (the District Court) was
obtained for US$132 million against Fluorogas Limited, The BOC Group, Inc. and The BOC Group plc. The verdict arose primarily out of an alleged
breach of a memorandum of understanding by Fluorogas Limited before it was acquired by The BOC Group plc in September 2001. In March 2003,
the court also awarded interest and costs against the defendants, making them jointly and severally liable for a total of US$174 million. A bond for the 
full amount was posted with the District Court as part of the normal appeals process.
In August 2004, the appellate court reversed the entire judgement against the BOC entities and all but US$170,000 in reliance damages against
Fluorogas Limited. In addition, the appellate court remanded for reconsideration by the District Court an award of attorney’s fees on the US$170,000
recovery.
Fluorogas Limited was placed in administration under the Insolvency Act of 1986 pursuant to an order of an English Court. It is expected to remain
in administration until the conclusion of the remand proceedings in the District Court.
ERISA litigation
An action was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois (the District Court) against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement
Plan (the Plan). The plaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly affected, alleging that the Plan improperly calculated 
lump sum distributions from the Plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
In November 2003, the parties reached an agreement to settle at US$69 million (£43.2 million). The settlement was approved by the District Court
at a fairness hearing on 12 March 2004.

In September 2004, BOC acquired an additional 30 per cent ownership interest in Compania de Nitrogeno de Cantarell (CNC) from Duke Energy,
increasing BOC’s overall stake in CNC to 65 per cent. This followed a decision by Duke Energy that a sale of their interest was more in line with their
long-term strategy. BOC continues to account for CNC as a joint venture as, in accordance with UK GAAP FRS9 (Associates and joint ventures), it is a
company jointly controlled by BOC and another party.
On 30 July 2004 BOC completed the sale of its US packaged gas business to Airgas Inc. In February 2004 BOC disposed of its 50 per cent holding
in Birlesik Oksijen Sanayi (T urkey). These disposals affected the ISP business segment.

In January 2003, the Group combined its Japanese gases business Osaka Sanso Kogyo KK (OSK) with part of Air Liquide Japan to form Japan Air Gases Ltd.
The net effect of the transaction was to exchange 55 per cent of the OSK business for a 45 per cent equity share in Japan Air Gases Ltd. This transaction
was accounted for in accordance with UK GAAP (UITF31 – ‘Exchange of businesses or other non-monetary assets for an interest in a subsidiary, joint
venture or associate’).
The unrealised profit of £8.2 million on the disposal of OSK was recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.

these accounts.
30.US accounting information
a) Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles and other US accounting information
The financial statements of The BOC Group plc are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK (UK GAAP), which
differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the US (US GAAP).
Set out below is a summary of the more significant adjustments which would be required if US GAAP had been applied, together with reconciliations
of net profit, other comprehensive income and shareholders’ funds from a UK GAAP to a US GAAP basis. Also presented on a US GAAP basis are a
movement in shareholders’ funds, a consolidated cash flow statement, information on earnings per share, information on stock based compensation and
details of recently issued US accounting pronouncements.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Under UK GAAP , goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1998 accounted for under the purchase method has been eliminated against shareholders’ funds.
Additionally, UK GAAP requires that on subsequent disposal or closure of a business, any goodwill previously taken directly to shareholders’ funds is then
charged against income. The Group adopted FRS10 in 1999, which requires goodwill on subsequent acquisitions to be capitalised and amortised over a
period not exceeding 20 years.
Under US GAAP , following the adoption of SFAS142 (Goodwill and other Intangible Assets), which was effective for the Group from 1 October
2002, goodwill continues to be capitalised, although amortisation is no longer charged to the income statement. Instead, an annual impairment test is
carried out, with any identified impairment loss recorded in the income statement. Other intangible assets with a finite life continue to be amortised
under both UK and US GAAP . UK GAAP is highly prescriptive with regard to the recognition of intangible assets, although US GAAP rules result in the
recognition of a greater amount of intangible assets. Therefore, differences arise in the classification of some intangible assets and goodwill between 
UK and US GAAP . Amortisation that has been charged against goodwill under UK GAAP is added back in the reconciliation to net income on a 
US GAAP basis.
The average life of other intangible assets is ten years and the annual amortisation charge under US GAAP is expected to be approximately
£1 million.
Impairment of goodwill
Under UK GAAP , goodwill impairment reviews are carried out at the end of the first financial year following an acquisition, and also when an indicator 
of impairment exists. The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill with the higher of the net realisable value and the 
value in use.
Under US GAAP , goodwill impairment reviews are also conducted when an indicator of impairment exists, in addition to an annual goodwill
impairment test, as required by SFAS142. The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its fair value. Where the
carrying value is greater than the fair value, the impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of goodwill in the reporting unit over the
implied fair value of the goodwill.
Profit or loss on the partial disposal of Group companies
Under UK GAAP (UITF 31), gains on the partial disposal of Group companies involving non-monetary consideration are recorded in the statement of
total recognised gains and losses. Under US GAAP , such gains and losses are recorded in the income statement.
Deferred tax
The Group adopted FRS19 (Deferred tax) in 2002 for UK GAAP purposes. This requires that full provision for deferred tax is recognised in the financial
statements. The adoption of FRS19 has eliminated most of the differences that previously existed between UK GAAP and US GAAP in the accounting 
for deferred tax. As a result, the tax adjustment now primarily relates to the deferred tax effect of other US GAAP adjustments.
Notes to the financial statements
124 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 30.US accounting information continued
Revaluation of fixed assets
UK GAAP allowed for the periodic revaluation of land and buildings with depreciation then being calculated on the revalued amount. Any surplus 
or deficit (to the extent that the revaluation reserve was in surplus) on the revaluation was then taken directly to shareholders’funds. With the 
Group’s adoption of FRS15 in 2000, the Group no longer revalues fixed assets. Under US GAAP , revaluations of fixed assets are not permitted and,
as a result, the reconciliation restates fixed assets to historical cost. The depreciation charge and any write downs of previously revalued assets are
adjusted accordingly.
Impairment of tangible fixed assets
Under UK GAAP , a tangible fixed asset is reviewed for impairment if an indication exists that the asset may be impaired. If necessary, an impairment loss 
is recorded. A value in use calculation is carried out, based on discounted pre-tax future cash flows from the asset (or income generating unit to which
the asset belongs).
Under US GAAP , a preliminary review of the tangible fixed asset is carried out using undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted future cash
flows are less than the asset’s carrying value, an impairment loss is required. The impairment loss will be calculated using discounted future cash flows, or
the asset’s market value.
Under US GAAP , the reversal of previously recognised impairment losses is not permitted.
Restructuring costs
Under UK GAAP , when a decision has been taken to restructure, supported by a detailed formal plan and the creation of a valid expectation in those
affected that the restructuring will take place, the necessary provisions are made for impairment of asset values together with severance and other costs.
Under US GAAP (SFAS146), the requirements for charging restructuring costs to income are more prescriptive and all significant actions arising
from the restructuring plan and their completion dates must be identified by the balance sheet date.
Pensions
For UK GAAP reporting (FRS17 – Retirement benefits), the pension asset or liability in the balance sheet represents the difference between the market
value of pension scheme assets at the balance sheet date and the present value of pension scheme liabilities at that date, net of deferred tax.
Under US GAAP (SFAS87), plan assets are valued by reference to market-related value at the date of the financial statements. Liabilities are assessed
using the rate of return obtainable on fixed or inflation-linked bonds.
FRS17 requires that past service costs are recognised in full in the period in which they become vested. SFAS87 requires past service costs to be
amortised over the remaining service lives of the employees to whom the amendments relate.
There is a significant difference in the treatment of actuarial gains and losses arising during the accounting period. UK GAAP recognises the actuarial
gains and losses in full in the year in which they arise in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. Under US GAAP , the actuarial gains and losses
which exceed ten per cent of the value of the assets or liabilities at the start of the accounting period are amortised over the remaining service lives of 
scheme members.
Where an additional minimum liability exists under US GAAP , (ie where the amount provided for any scheme does not cover the unfunded
accumulated benefit obligation for that scheme), this must be recognised in the balance sheet under SFAS87. The adjustment resulting from the
recognition of an additional minimum liability is reported as an intangible asset to the extent of the unrecognised prior service cost, after eliminating
amounts previously shown as a prepaid benefit cost. Any excess above these amounts is reported in comprehensive income.
Post retirement medical costs
For UK GAAP reporting (FRS17 – Retirement benefits), the post retirement medical liability is discounted using the bond yield on suitable high quality
corporate bonds, and disclosed net of related deferred tax.
For US GAAP (SFAS106), the liabilities are assessed and discounted using the rates of return obtainable on high quality fixed income investments.
Differences between the UK and US GAAP figures arise largely from the treatment of actuarial gains and losses.
Securities investments
Under UK GAAP , current asset investments (of all types) are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Fixed asset investments are stated at cost,
or alternatively, at market value or at directors’ valuation.
Under US GAAP , securities which are determined to be ‘available-for-sale’ are stated at fair value and any unrealised gains or losses included as a
separate component of shareholders’ funds. The deferred tax consequences of unrealised gains or losses are also charged or credited to shareholders’
funds.
Contingent consideration
Under UK GAAP , contingent consideration is provided for as a liability when the likelihood of payment is considered to be probable.
Under US GAAP , contingent consideration is not recognised until the liability is determined beyond reasonable doubt. The elimination of 
contingent consideration for US GAAP purposes also impacts on the value of goodwill arising on acquisitions, therefore there is no net impact on
shareholders’ funds.
Financial instruments
The Group enters into a number of currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to currency and
interest rate risks. Under UK GAAP , such instruments are shown at their carrying value.
Under US GAAP , these instruments are marked to market and any change in value is recognised in either the income statement or through
comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS133 depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, the 
type of hedge transaction.
Accounting for swaps
Under UK GAAP , gains or losses on closing out interest rate swap contracts taken to hedge the Group’s fixed/floating interest rate position can be taken
to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the remaining hedge period.
Notes to the financial statements

Share of results and net assets of joint ventures and associates
The Group’s share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates (as calculated under UK GAAP) is shown within fixed asset investments.
For the purposes of the reconciliations set out below, the Group’s share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates has been adjusted
to recognise a difference in the method of reporting profits under US GAAP .
Sale and leaseback transactions
Under UK GAAP , any profit or loss on the sale and operating leaseback of fixed assets can generally be taken to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the contract lease period.
Comprehensive income
Under US GAAP , SFAS130 establishes requirements for the reporting of comprehensive income and its components (revenue, expenses, gains and
losses) in a full set of general purpose financial statements. Components of comprehensive income for the Group determined on a UK GAAP basis
include profit for the financial year, pension actuarial gains and losses, and foreign currency translation gains and losses. Information regarding the Group’s
foreign currency translation gains and losses is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses under UK GAAP on page 81.
b) Income statement in US GAAP format
The Group profit and loss account on page 78 complies with UK GAAP . For SEC reporting purposes this presentation would be considered ‘non GAAP’
and therefore disclosed below is the income statement which meets the SEC reporting format set forth in Item 10 of Regulation S-X. The financial

f) Consolidated cash flow statement 
The Group cash flow statement on page 80 has been prepared in accordance with UK accounting standard FRS1, the objectives and principles of which
are similar to those set out in US accounting principle SFAS95, Statement of Cash Flows. The principal differences between the standards relate to
classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under FRS1, cash flows are presented separately for: a) operating activities; b) dividends from joint ventures and associates; c) returns on investments
and servicing of finance; d) tax paid; e) capital expenditure and financial investment; f) acquisitions and disposals; g) equity dividends paid; h) management of
liquid resources; and i) financing. Under SFAS95, however, only three categories of cash flow activity are reported: a) operating activities; b) investing
activities; and c) financing activities. Dividends from joint ventures and associates, cash flows from returns on investments and servicing of finance
(excluding dividends paid to minorities) and tax paid under FRS1 would be included in operating activities under SFAS95; capital expenditure and
acquisitions and disposals would be included in investing activities under SFAS95; equity dividends would be included as a financing activity under SFAS95.
Under FRS1, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with any qualifying financial institution, less overdrafts from any
qualifying financial institution repayable on demand. Under SFAS95, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits but also includes cash equivalents which
are short-term, highly liquid investments. Generally only investments with original maturities of three months or less come within this definition.
Set out below, for illustrative purposes, is a summary consolidated statement of cash flows under SFAS95.
2004 2003 2002
£ million £ million £ million
Net cash provided by operating activities 673.5 562.4 620.2

Exchange and other movements (2.0) 14.0 (34.6)
Cash and cash equivalents at 30 September 289.7 76.4 181.9
g) Stock-based compensation
For US reporting purposes the company applies APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations, in accounting
for its share option plans. By applying this statement the employee share schemes are deemed non-compensatory and therefore do not result in an
expense for financial reporting purposes. With the exception of the Long-T erm Incentive Plan, grants of share options under executive schemes are at
the market price of the company’s shares at the time of grant. The schemes are deemed compensatory and a charge is only recognised when certain
performance conditions are met.
If compensation cost for the Group’s share option plans had been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those
plans consistent with the method of SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Group’s net income under US GAAP would have been:
2004 2003 2002

Diluted – pro forma 59.1 52.2 51.0
The Black-Scholes model was used to measure the compensation expense under SFAS123. The assumptions used for grants in 2004 included a dividend
yield of 4.5 per cent (2003: 4.5 per cent, 2002: 4.0 per cent), expected share price volatility of 29.5 per cent (2003: 30.6 per cent, 2002: 31.0 per cent),
a weighted average expected life of 4.9 years (2003: 5.0 years, 2002: 5.0 years) and a weighted average interest rate of 4.8 per cent (2003: 4.0 per cent,
2002: 4.9 per cent). The weighted average interest rate is based on UK Gilts on the date of grant with a maturity similar to the related options.

i) Recently issued accounting pronouncements implemented in the year
SFAS132 (revised) – Employers’ disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits
SFAS132 (revised) was issued in December 2003 and is effective for years ending after 15 June 2004. This statement revises employers’disclosures about
pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by SFAS87, SFAS88
and SFAS106 and retains the disclosure requirements contained in SFAS132. It requires additional disclosures about the types of plan assets, investment
strategy, plan obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit post retirement plans.
These additional disclosure requirements are presented within note 8c) to the financial statements.
FIN46 (revised) – Consolidation of variable interest entities
FIN46 (revised) was issued in December 2003. Application of this interpretation is required for all public entities that have interests in variable interest
entities for periods ending after 15 December 2003. Application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for
periods ending after 15 March 2004. This interpretation requires the primary beneficiary to consolidate a variable interest entity if it holds a variable
interest that will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns if they occur, or both. The
effect of FIN46 (revised) has led to the Group’s interest in Compania de Nitrogeno de Cantarell being accounted for as a subsidiary under US GAAP .
This resulted in additional total assets of £456.9 million, total liabilities of £494.4 million and minority interests of £13.1 million. There is no material impact
on the income statement. The £29.7 million adjustment in respect of the variable interest entity relates to the £13.1 million minority interests and other
specific US GAAP adjustments within the entity.
EITF01–8 – Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 
In May 2003, the Emerging Issues T ask Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue 01–8. Issue 01–8 provides guidance for determining whether an
arrangement contains a lease that is within the scope of SFAS13 Accounting for Leases. If it is determined that a lease exists, the lease and non-lease
components of a combined sales arrangement must be accounted for separately. Issue 01–8 is effective prospectively for arrangements initiated, modified,
or acquired after 1 July 2003.
Management has evaluated the impact of EITF Issue 01–8 on its on-site supply agreements and has concluded that it does not have a material impact
on the Group’s results or financial position.
j) Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet implemented
EITF04–1 – Accounting for Pre-existing Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination
EITF04–1 applies when two parties that have a pre-existing contractual relationship enter into a business combination. Specifically, the issue is whether a
consummation of a business combination between two parties that have a pre-existing contractual relationship should be evaluated to determine if a
settlement of a pre-existing contractual relationship exists, thus requiring accounting separate from the business combination. If separate accounting is
required, then the measurement of the settlement amount will be decided. Finally, if it is determined that assets of the acquired entity that are related to a
pre-existing contractual relationship with the acquiring entity should be recognised as part of the business combination, whether the acquiring entity
should recognise those assets as intangible assets apart from goodwill will be decided.
k) Other information
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial

The application of UITF37 (Purchases and sales of own shares) and UITF38 (Accounting for ESOP trusts) has not had any impact on the Group profit 
and loss account. The impact on the balance sheet at 30 September 2004 has been to reduce fixed assets and shareholders’ funds by £42.1 million
(Parent: £41.6 million).
The prior year adjustment of £48.1 million (Parent: £42.5 million) comprises:
a) a reclassification of the cost of own shares of £48.8 million (Parent: £43.2 million) from fixed assets – investments to shareholders’ funds; and 
b) a reclassification of the provision of £0.7 million (Parent: £0.7 million) previously held against own shares to shareholders’funds.

Dividends
Ordinary shares
The company has paid cash dividends on its Ordinary shares in every year since 1899. Since 1988, the dividend policy has been to pay two interim
dividends, one in February and one in August. The dividends are reported in the accounts in the year in which they are paid.
Two dividends were paid in 2004. A first interim dividend of 15.5p (net) per share was paid in February and a second interim dividend of 24.5p (net) 
per share was paid in August. Future dividends of the company will be dependent upon future earnings, the financial position of the company and other
factors. A first interim dividend of 15.9p (net) per share has been declared for payment on 1 February 2005.
The table below sets out, in UK pence, the total of the cash amounts of the dividends per share.

T axation
A summary of the principal tax consequences for certain beneficial holders of Ordinary shares of BOC and ADSs representing Ordinary shares is set 
out below. This summary applies to citizens or residents of the UK or US, or otherwise who are subject to UK tax or US federal income tax on a net
income basis in respect of such securities. It is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis of all of the potential tax consequences of holding Ordinary
shares or ADSs and does not purport to deal with persons who hold their Ordinary shares or ADSs in special circumstances, such as financial institutions,
tax exempt organisations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, persons who own, directly or indirectly or by attribution, ten per cent or more of
the outstanding share capital or voting stock of BOC, persons holding Ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a ‘hedge’, ‘straddle’ or other risk reduction
transaction, or who acquired such Ordinary shares or ADSs through the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation. All holders
and investors are advised to consult their tax advisors on the tax implications of their particular holdings, including the consequences under applicable
state and local law.
The statements of tax laws set out below are based on the laws in force at the date of this report unless otherwise noted, and are subject to any
subsequent changes in UK and US law, or in any double tax convention between the UK and the US.
UK shareholders
The following information applies to individuals who hold Ordinary shares and who are resident or ordinarily resident in the UK for UK tax purposes 
(UK resident holders).
Taxation of capital gains 
A UK resident holder will be liable to UK tax on the gain from the disposal of Ordinary shares. For the purposes of calculating the gain from the disposal
of Ordinary shares, a UK resident holder who held Ordinary shares prior to 31 March 1982 may substitute the market value of such shares as at that date
for the original cost of such shares. The market value of Ordinary shares on 31 March 1982 was 168.75p per Ordinary share.
A UK resident holder may also be entitled to indexation relief and taper relief when selling shares. Indexation relief is calculated on the market 
value of shares held at 31 March 1982 and on the cost of any subsequent purchases from that date. Indexation relief is not available for periods after 
1 April 1998. T aper relief provides UK resident holders with relief from tax on gains accrued on the disposal of Ordinary shares held or acquired after 
5 April 1998. The amount of taper relief available depends on the length of time such shares have been held and on the UK resident holder’s individual
facts and circumstances.
Taxation of dividends 
A UK resident holder is entitled to a tax credit on receipt of a cash dividend. The tax credit is a fixed proportion of the dividend and is currently 
1
/9
th of
the cash dividend received.
The income subject to UK income tax is the sum of the dividend and the attached tax credit, with the tax credit being available as a deduction
against any resulting tax liability.
Special rates of tax apply to dividend income: the ‘ordinary rate’ is ten per cent and applies to individuals liable to tax at the basic or lower rates of tax;
the ‘upper rate’ is 32.5 per cent which applies to the extent that income exceeds the basic rate band.
For a UK resident holder liable to income tax only at the basic or lower rates of tax, there will thus be no further tax liability in respect of the
dividend received. If, however, the UK resident holder is subject to income tax at the higher rate there will be a further tax liability on the sum of the cash
dividend received and the associated tax credit. Where a UK resident holder’s tax liability is less than the associated tax credit, no refund is available.
By way of example, the payment by BOC of a cash dividend of £90 would have an associated tax credit of £10 and a UK resident holder is treated
as receiving a gross dividend of £100. The upper rate tax of 32.5 per cent on the gross dividend is £32.50. Therefore the UK resident holder liable to tax
at the upper rate will have a tax liability of £22.50, being the tax liability on the gross dividend of £32.50 less the tax credit of £10.
Stamp duty 
Stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5 per cent of consideration payable is normally payable on the purchase price of shares.
Inheritance tax 
Individual shareholders may be liable to inheritance tax on the transfer of Ordinary shares. Inheritance tax may be charged on the amount by which 
the value of a shareholder’s estate is reduced as a result of any transfer by way of gift or other gratuitous transaction made by them or treated as made 
by them.
US holders
For the purposes of this summary, a US holder is a beneficial owner of ADSs who is an individual citizen or resident of the US, a corporation or other
entity organised under the laws of the US or any state thereof, an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its
source, or a trust if a court within the US is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons have
the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
US holders should be aware that a new UK-US Income T ax Convention, as amended by a Protocol to the Convention signed on 19 July 2002,
came into force on 31 March 2003 (the New Convention). The New Convention generally has effect in respect of dividends paid on or after 1 May 2003.
However, a US holder entitled to benefits under the US-UK Income T ax Convention that came into force on 25 April 1980, as amended by Protocols 
(the 1980 Convention) may elect to have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue in their entirety for an additional 12 months if the election to
apply the 1980 Convention would result in greater benefits to the holder. If a US holder were to make an effective election, the discussion below with
respect to dividend payments made pursuant to the 1980 Convention would continue to apply to dividends paid by the company prior to 1 May 2004.
The discussion below notes the instances where the relevant provisions of the New Convention produce a materially different result for a US holder.
US holders should note that certain articles in the New Convention limit or restrict the ability of a US holder to claim benefits under the New Convention 
and that similar provisions were not contained in the 1980 Convention. US holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the applicability of
both Conventions.
US holders of ADSs are treated as owners of underlying Ordinary shares for the purposes of the New Convention, the 1980 Convention and 
the convention relating to estate and gift tax (the Estate T ax Convention) and for the purposes of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended 
(the Code).
Shareholder information Shareholder information
135 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004
Taxation of dividends 
Under current UK tax legislation, no tax will be withheld from dividend payments made by BOC. Under the 1980 Convention US holders of ADSs are
treated as receiving dividend income equal to the sum of the dividend and the associated tax credit, reduced by UK withholding tax at a rate not exceeding
15 per cent of the amount of the dividend and the associated tax credit. As the tax credit is equal to 
1
/9
th of the dividend the withholding tax is equal to the
tax credit.
This will be the case where the holding is not effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base in the UK and provided that the
shareholder is not subject to the special rules of the 1980 Convention such as those applying to US tax-exempt entities and certain investment or holding
companies where 25 per cent of the capital is held directly or indirectly by persons who are not individual residents or nationals of the US.
Thus, under the 1980 Convention, a US holder receiving a dividend of £90 will be treated as receiving taxable income of £100 less UK withholding 
tax of £10. No refund of UK tax is available.
Dividends received by a US holder will be foreign source income for US federal income tax purposes in the amount equal to the US dollar value of
the gross dividend (that is the sum of the dividend and the associated tax credit if applicable), on the date of such payment. Generally, dividends will not
be eligible for the ‘dividends received’ deduction allowed to US corporations under the Code. Subject to certain limitations, the UK tax treated as
withheld from payments will be available as a credit against US tax.
Under the New Convention which generally applies with respect to dividends paid on or after 1 May 2003 (unless an effective election is made to
extend the applicability of the 1980 Convention) a US holder has no right to receive the associated tax credit with the dividend payment made by BOC.
US holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether they are eligible for benefits under the 1980 Convention and the New
Convention, whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available with respect to dividends received from BOC, and whether it may be
advisable in light of the holder’s particular circumstances to elect to have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue in force until 1 May 2004.
The US dollar amount of any dividends received by a non-corporate US holder prior to 1 January 2009 that constitute qualified dividends will be
taxable to the holder at a maximum rate of 15 per cent, provided that certain holding periods are met. BOC currently believes that dividends paid with
respect to its ADSs should be treated as qualified dividends for the 2004 taxable year. The US Treasury and the US Internal Revenue Service have
announced their intention to promulgate rules pursuant to which holders of ADSs, among others, will be permitted to rely on certifications from issuers
to establish that dividends are treated as qualified dividends. US holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of the
reduced dividend tax rate in light of their own particular situation and the computations of their foreign tax credit limitation with respect to any qualified
dividends paid to them, as applicable.
Taxation of capital gains 
Generally, a US holder who is not resident or ordinarily resident in the UK for tax purposes should not be subject to UK tax on any gain from the disposal
of ADSs, but will be subject to US tax on any capital gain realised on the sale or other disposal of ADSs.
US information reporting and backup withholding
Dividend payments made with respect to ADSs and proceeds from the sale or other disposal of ADSs may be subject to information reporting to the
US Internal Revenue Service and backup withholding at a current rate of 28 per cent. Holders should consult their own advisors as to the application to
them of the information reporting and backup withholding rules.
Stamp duty 
In practice no UK stamp duty is payable on the transfer of an ADS, provided that the separate instrument of transfer is not executed in, and always
remains outside of, the UK. No stamp duty reserve tax is payable on an agreement to transfer ADSs.
Estate and gift tax 
Under the Estate T ax Convention, a US holder generally is not subject to UK inheritance tax.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders 
There are currently no exchange controls or other limitations in the UK affecting security holders. Shareholder information

CHAIRMAN’S
ST A TEMENT
2004 was a good year for your company. BOC has a
consistent strategy that has been well implemented – 
a testament to all BOC’s management and staff.
Y our board owns and reviews this strategy.We follow a 
well-defined annual process that allows all members of the board 
to examine every aspect of the Group’s progress and opportunities.
Much can be learnt by questioning and testing in the formal
environment of the boardroom, but there is no substitute for seeing
the strategy at work in the real world, with customers, business
partners and staff. For that reason we hold two board meetings 
each year outside our Windlesham headquarters.We went to China 
in the autumn of 2003 and saw the impressive work underway in the
Shanghai and Nanjing areas to develop world-scale petrochemical
complexes; these are areas where BOC has established an important
presence.We also spent a day with the management team of our
logistics business, Gist. For our first meeting of the 2005 financial 
year we visited South Africa and saw the progressive economic 
and social developments to which our Afrox subsidiary is making 
a major contribution. Over the next 12 months we will also visit 
Poland and the US.
An important element of the strategy over recent years has 
been to reshape our portfolio of businesses to enhance future 
growth and profitability.We will continue to examine opportunities 
as and when they arise.
Returns to our shareholders
In 2004 BOC paid a first interim dividend of 15.5p per share in
February 2004 and a second interim dividend of 24.5p per share in
August, making a total of 40p for the year as a whole, an increase of 
2.6 per cent on 2003. Having held the first interim dividend at 15.5p 
for several years, while growing the second interim dividend, we have
reached our aim of a 40:60 ratio between the two interim dividends.
As a result your board has decided to raise the first interim dividend 
by 2.6 per cent to 15.9p to be paid on 1 February 2005. In 2004 our
dividends were covered 1.58 times by adjusted earnings and we look 
to build our dividend cover towards two-times over the medium term.
We therefore aim to grow the dividend progressively, albeit at a lower
rate than earnings per share growth.
Again this year, as in the two previous years, I include graphs 
comparing BOC’s total shareholder returns since 2000 with all
FTSE100 companies and with its main gases competitors.The message
remains the same.We have performed well compared with other UK
companies but a gap requires to be bridged with our competitors.
Corporate Governance
BOC complies with the existing Combined Code on Corporate
Governance and I reported last year that we already substantially
complied with the revisions to the code announced in 2003, even
though we need not have done so until 2005.This is part of our
continuing commitment to the highest standards of governance and
integrity.Throughout BOC there is a strong commitment to the
principles of ACTS – accountability, collaboration, transparency and
stretch.These principles, supported by a well established Code of
Conduct, provide strong safeguards at all levels of the organisation.

Corporate responsibility
Y our company is well aware that it is judged not only by its
financial success but also by how this financial success is achieved.
How well we manage social, environmental and ethical (SEE) risks is
important to the long-term health of our business. For the first time 
this year BOC participated in the independent survey of companies’
corporate responsibility performance conducted by the UK’s Business
in the Community. 500 companies were invited to participate, 139 did
so, including 56 from the FTSE100. BOC was ranked 25th with an
aggregate score of well over 90 per cent.This was a good result 
and confirmed our belief that we are performing well against these
measures. More recently, we have surveyed all our business units to 
gain a thorough understanding of how they see our SEE risks and 
how we are managing them.This will form the basis of our next series
of initiatives.
A US subsidiary of The BOC Group, along with other companies
in the welding products industry, has been the subject of injury claims
based on allegations that manganese in welding fumes causes
Parkinson’s disease or symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease.We are
not aware of any credible scientific evidence linking manganese in
welding fumes to neurological damage under typical welding conditions.
Board of directors
We welcomed three new non-executive directors to our board
this year. Guy Dawson joined in March. He was until 2003 chairman of
European investment banking at Merrill Lynch having previously been
with Morgan Grenfell and Deutsche Bank.Anne Quinn and Iain Napier
were appointed in May.Anne is group vice president of BP’s gas,
power and renewables business stream. Iain is chief executive of
Taylor Woodrow and brings previous experience of the brewing
industry. Fabiola Arredondo and Roberto Mendoza resigned from the
board during the year, each because of increasing demands on their
time from their other commitments. Both Fabiola and Roberto have
made valuable contributions to BOC for which I thank them.
In May I announced that T ony Isaac had accepted the board’s
invitation to continue as your chief executive until the Annual General
Meeting in January 2007.We are very pleased that he will continue to
provide leadership in the successful execution of our strategy.
My thanks always go first to BOC’s employees around the world 
as they make your company what it is. It is our talented and dedicated
people that make the difference in a competitive market. I thank our
customers for choosing BOC. I thank all those who partner, supply and
contribute to BOC wherever we do business. Finally, I thank you our
shareholders for your continuing support.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REVIEW
BOC performed strongly in 2004 in a generally favourable
economic environment. Each quarter we reported adjusted
operating profit and earnings significantly ahead of the
equivalent period in 2003. Our two gases lines of business,
Process Gas Solutions and Industrial and Special Products,
saw mostly buoyant trading conditions although the
strength of the rand restrained industrial activity in 
South Africa. Semiconductor manufacturers increased 
their investment this year after an extended period 
of reduced activity and this benefited BOC Edwards.
As a result we reported adjusted operating profit for 
the year of £576.9 million, up 15 per cent, on turnover 
up nine per cent at £4,599.3 million. Adjusted profit before
tax rose 20 per cent.
I explained last year that our adjusted figures eliminate exceptional
items that would otherwise create distortions.Also our year-on-year
comparisons are at constant currency, shorn of the effects of converting
local profits into sterling.This way we show clearly how we performed
in the competitive markets of the 50 or so countries where we
operate.When I describe our business performance below I will do 
so on this basis. Our statutory results include exceptional items and
reflect currency movements when comparing performance with last
year. On this basis turnover increased by six per cent, operating profit 
by 28 per cent and profit before tax by 17 per cent.
Successful businesses
Process Gas Solutions delivered a nine per cent increase in
turnover and raised adjusted operating profit by ten per cent.At the
start of the year in China we and our joint venture partners announced
that we would invest over US$100 million in three schemes at Taiyuan,
Suzhou and in the Pearl River region. In June 2004 we announced the
setting up of a joint venture with Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical
Company Ltd (SPC).This is the second joint venture with a subsidiary
of Sinopec, China’s leading petrochemical company, following our
agreement in 2002 with Sinopec Yangzi Petrochemical Corporation.
This second joint venture intends to invest in some 3,000 tonnes a day
of industrial gas production assets currently owned by SPC before
embarking on building a new world-scale air separation unit.This flow
of new orders means that we will double our production capacity in
China by the end of 2005, with a corresponding increase in turnover.
Elsewhere we were successful in winning key hydrogen orders for BP
and Sunoco refineries in the US, in acquiring Duke Energy’s 30 per cent
ownership interest in Compañía de Nitrógeno de Cantarell, the joint
venture company that owns the world’s largest nitrogen complex in
Mexico, and in winning the order with our joint venture partners for
the largest air separation unit in Thailand.As well as supplying hydrogen
for today’s applications we continue to invest for the opportunities
predicted for hydrogen energy in the decades to come.
Industrial and Special Products grew both turnover and adjusted
operating profit by three per cent and ten per cent respectively.
2004 was the first full year of contributions from two recent
acquisitions, namely Praxair’s Polish gases business and Air Products’
packaged gas business in Canada.
“SIGNIFICANTL Y
IMPRO VED
PERFORMANCE 
O VER 2003” 07 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2004
BOC Edwards saw the long-awaited upturn in investment 
by the semiconductor industry as well as increased demand from
growing markets, notably flat panel displays in Asia.The result was a 
27 per cent rise in turnover and a 181 per cent increase in adjusted
operating profit.
Gist, our logistics business, did well to maintain turnover following 
the loss last year of Marks & Spencer’s general merchandise business.
Adjusted operating profit fell by 14 per cent, but in 2003 we included a 
£4.1 million gain resulting from the M&S contract termination; without 
this one-off payment adjusted operating profit would have been flat
year on year.
Afrox hospitals continued to grow and perform well, turnover
rising by nine per cent and adjusted operating profit by 16 per cent.
In November 2003 we announced that African Oxygen Limited 
had agreed to sell its majority shareholding in Afrox Healthcare Limited 
to a consortium led by two major black economic empowerment
investors.We then announced in January 2004 our intention to sell 
our US packaged gas business, part of our north American Industrial 
and Special Products unit, to Airgas for up to US$200 million.
We completed the US disposal successfully in July this year while the
Afrox Healthcare sale remains subject to final clearance by the
competition authorities in South Africa.The motives for these two
disposals were very different. In Afrox Healthcare we have a business in
which we have invested successfully over recent years.The medium to
long-term future for private healthcare is uncertain in South Africa and
we had the opportunity to sell a highly successful business and let it
develop further under new black economic empowerment ownership.
Our US packaged gas business also received much attention and
investment over the years, but it never fulfilled its promise. Its sale and
the successful transfer of over 1,000 of our employees to the new
owner is a good outcome.We retain a large presence in the US, with
substantial and successful businesses that will benefit from increased
management focus and a reduced overhead cost base.
The two significant joint ventures we have established in the 
last two years – Linde BOC Process Plants and Japan Air Gases –
continue to perform well.
Cash
Operating cash flow was £758.5 million, up some eight per cent
on last year, due to improved operating profit and better management
of working capital. In addition, proceeds from disposals and lower levels
of capital expenditure resulted in a decline in our net borrowings for
the sixth successive quarter, ending the year down £405.7 million at
£962.4 million.This was after paying a further £64 million into the 
main UK pensions scheme, an increase of £28 million over last year.
Managing to the highest standards
We continue to use our global structure to transfer best 
operating and commercial practice, to offer the highest standards 
of service to all our customers, and to meet the needs of our key
customers wherever they do business in the world. Our operating
procedures are supported by global programmes such as our Code 
of Conduct and we work hard to tap the full potential of our diverse
and talented workforce.
It is important that we manage all our business risks, not just 
the financial ones. Operating as we do in a hazardous industry,
everyone must pay the greatest attention to safety, whether it be the
safety of fellow employees, of our customers and suppliers or indeed of
those in the communities where we live and work.We concentrate on 
making safety second nature for all our employees. By managing these 
non-financial risks we protect our business and the reputation of BOC.
There has been one change this year to the executive
management team. Greg Sedgwick returned to his native Australia to
take up an appointment as chief executive of a listed building products
company; I wish him well in his future career. Mark Nichols, who had
been based in Singapore, has succeeded Greg as Group director for
business development. BOC is fortunate in having good people at all
levels of the organisation and we place great emphasis on recruiting,
developing and retaining the best people wherever we find them in 
the world.We have a diverse workforce and I take a personal interest
in ensuring that this diversity is reflected increasingly at all levels.
I thank all employees of BOC for their hard work and for the
contribution they have made to a successful year. Keeping our
customers satisfied is more important than ever and we strive to
deliver the same high standard of service wherever our customers
choose to do business with us.We work hard to deliver the financial
returns our shareholders expect.We are also well aware of the 
wider responsibilities we have to the economic and social life of the
countries where we operate.All of this depends on the people of 
BOC and they respond by delivering high performance day by day.

OUR STRA TEGY
AR OUND THE 
W ORLD
BOC has three lines of business,two specialist businesses and 
a comprehensive strategy. Consistently applied,this strategy 
has led to major changes in our business portfolio. It has seen
resource concentrated in Asia and growth markets around 
the world. It has produced investment in technologies and 
new markets of the future. And it has enabled us to work 
more efficiently and effectively to serve our customers today.
Some of the results of BOC’s strategic thinking are in the 
pages that follow. 09 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2004
PROCESS GAS
SOLUTIONS
With its headquarters in Singapore and
with technical specialists in all the key
markets of the world, Process Gas
Solutions installs and operates complex
plants for some of the world’s largest
and most demanding industrial
customers. It also delivers liquefied
gases and runs on-site plants for those
requiring bulk supplies. Process Gas
Solutions does business wherever its
key customers do business.
BOC ED W ARDS
The semiconductor industry is one of
the most innovative on the planet and
BOC Edwards is one of its innovative
suppliers. Traditionally known for 
its vacuum and electronic gases
technology, BOC Edwards now offers
a broad range of products and services
for its semiconductor customers as
well as other high technology growth
industries. Innovation gives BOC
Edwards the edge, whether it is
developing the products and services
demanded by its high technology
customers or producing effective
solutions for a host of other markets.
BOC has two specialist businesses: 
Afrox hospitals, a supplier of 
private health care in southern Africa
and Gist, a logistics business.

Industrial and Special Products delivers
products and services to a host of
specialist businesses. With distribution
networks that bring it close to its

SEEING     11 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2004
Around the world
Process Gas Solutions operates on a global scale and is used
to dealing with big numbers. Our 6,500 operations people
look after 900 production plants. They deliver gas to
customers through pipelines and in 2,000 vehicles. They
make 1.5 million deliveries of liquefied gas each year, storing
it in over 20,000 insulated tanks at our customers’ sites.
For as long as our operations people can
remember, the emphasis has been on becoming more
efficient. We measure everything, from how much
electricity it takes to produce each cubic metre of gas, to
how many kilometres each truck has to travel to deliver
that gas to a customer. We then consistently improve each
of these measures, as we have done for decades. 
Computing power and improved communications
technology helps, but working against us has been the
steady, and more recently spectacular, increase in energy
costs. We try and keep all of our plants operating reliably
and at peak efficiency all the time, adapting to changes in
demand patterns and input costs. We use real time
information about the weather and power pricing to adjust
our operations. We know second by second how our plants
are performing. And we have process data stretching back
over time with which we can compare current performance. 
The result is a stream of energy efficiency projects.
As an example, in the US we have just finished investing 
$1.3 million to improve a 14,000 horsepower compressor
at one of our sites in California. It took a year to plan and
another year to implement the changes and the end result 
is a three per cent power saving. Saving power has
important environmental benefits and, as carbon trading
becomes an economic reality in many parts of the world, 
it can save money twice over. Our plant at Port Kembla 
in Australia calculates that its power savings this year 
equate to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of nearly
5,800 tonnes of carbon dioxide. The plant is one of many
we have equipped with linear model predictive control
(LMPC) as part of our global programme to optimise plant
performance and it has been able to trade its carbon 
savings on the open market. 
It’s the same story in every part of our business –
doing more with less – and ensuring that everything we do
is done safely. It’s just that the figures look that much bigger
when you work on the scale of Process Gas Solutions.

This bus is taking part in a trial. It and ones like it are on the streets of London,
England and Perth, Australia carrying passengers for a living. But unlike other
buses, it’s virtually silent and its exhaust emission is water vapour, pure 
and simple, because it’s a bus running on electricity from fuel cells driven 
by hydrogen. 
The word is out that hydrogen could be the fuel of the future. 
Clean, efficient and plentiful, especially when derived from renewable resources,
it is a strong candidate to succeed hydrocarbons later in the century. Right now,
its most important role is in helping make the hydrocarbons we burn in our 
cars more environmentally-friendly by removing sulphur from oil as part of the
refining process. Hydrogen also helps refiners extract more light products from
barrels of heavier crude oil. 
This year BOC has won contracts that will increase the amount of
hydrogen we supply to the refining industry by a quarter. We already operate
the southern hemisphere’s largest hydrogen plant serving BP’s refinery at Bulwer
Island in Australia. We are now building one of the largest hydrogen plants in 
the US to supply BP and Sunoco refineries at Toledo in Ohio. 
The role that hydrogen has to play in the future energy needs of the
world still has to be worked through. As oil becomes less plentiful and more
expensive the search intensifies for alternative fuels that combine oil’s flexibility
and availability. And hydrogen is a contender for the leading role.

Fast and efficient supply chains are essential for any retailer.
When Marks & Spencer places an order on one of its food
suppliers at 06.00 it normally expects the product to be on
sale in its stores from 07.30 the following day. Gist manages
the supply chain for most of M&S’ chilled and ambient food
and all these products pass through its six distribution
centres and out to M&S stores throughout the UK.
The trial of radio frequency identification, or RFID, started
in 2003 at Gist’s Barnsley depot. In the world’s biggest
RFID implementation project in the retail sector, M&S
tagged 3.5 million of its food trays with microchips that 
can store information about the product in the tray – far
more information than a traditional bar code could handle. 
The information can be read, changed and updated easily
and allows M&S and its suppliers to follow the product all
the way from factory to store. As the trays are wheeled
past an RFID sensor the data are read, systems updated,
and the operator is told where to position the trays ready
for the next stage of delivery. It used to take 30 seconds 
or more to scan a stack of trays using hand-held bar code

The programme won Retail W eek magazine’s retail
technology solution award this year and is expected to be
fully implemented by early next year. When this is done

MOVINGTOWORLD-SCALE
Developments in Asia continue to change the
economic map of the world 17 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2004
Around the world
For years Asia has been the growth region of the world. 
It suffered in the financial crisis of the late 1990s and has
taken economic knocks recently from SARS and bird flu
but, even so, over virtually any recent period you wish to
choose it has delivered faster growth than other parts of
the world. This is important to BOC because we started
investing seriously in Asia at an early stage and we have
consistently built our regional leadership.
Looking around Asia there are few countries
where we are not number one or two, and in most we can
claim leadership. China has drawn the growth spotlight onto
itself recently but the very scale of what is being undertaken
in China should not disguise the developments taking place
in the region as a whole.
BOC Edwards is a core supplier to the top
semiconductor manufacturers, and today you will find 
most of them building new 300mm wafer fabs in Asia. 
The traditional markets of Europe and the US remain
important but again the message is that growth comes 
from the east. For Process Gas Solutions the US market 
will deliver many opportunities over the next few years, but
it is in Asia, and particularly China, that the new world-scale
developments are underway. The headquarters of Process
Gas Solutions moved to Singapore two years ago and in
Shanghai we are growing a talented and knowledgeable
team able to deliver and manage the major projects we 
have already won.
BOC’s future is built around all the countries 
in which it operates, with Asia taking a special role. 
Asia offers exciting growth opportunities. Asia offers 
new and challenging industries. And, most importantly, 
Asia offers talented people who will grow our business 
and make successful careers in BOC.

Around the world
The face of BOC has changed
substantially over the past six years.
We have taken opportunities to
develop our business where growth
and profit expectations are good. 
At the same time we have tackled
underperforming units and those 
likely to deliver lower growth. 
We started the process of
local consolidation when we sold 
our Benelux and German industrial
gases operations in 1998. Since then
we have bought and assimilated
operations that add profitable business
in key markets around the world. 
These acquisitions have been across all
our business areas. We have bought
plants in Asia and Latin America that
supply hydrogen and air gases to
important customers. We have
bought specialist technology and
vacuum pump capability to expand
BOC Edwards’ capability. And we
have acquired local operations from
our competitors in Europe, north
America and Asia to improve the
range of products and services we can
give our customers. All these are in
our traditional business areas; when
we acquired EMC, a water services
company in the US, we added a
completely new service to offer our
industrial customer base.
Where it makes commercial
sense we have combined with others.
By forming Linde BOC Process Plants
we gained access to improved
technology while reducing our costs. 
In Japan we merged OSK with Air
Liquide’s industrial and medical gases
business to form Japan Air Gases. 
This has produced a stronger
competitor with a lower cost base. 
In South Africa we have
grown our Afrox hospitals business,
largely by acquisition. Today it is one 
of the leading private hospital groups
in the country and we are in the
process of selling the business to black
economic empowerment investors. 
At the same time, our packaged gas
business in the US did not deliver the
performance we required and we sold
it this year.

OPERA TING REVIEW
Asia remains a focus for growth with China having attracted the
most attention and the greatest levels of foreign direct investment.
We brought on stream little new capacity in China this year but 
have four large air separation units and five on-site production units
currently under construction to meet growing customer demand in 
key economic regions, such as Dalian,Tianjin,Taiyuan, Nanjing, Shanghai
and the Pearl River delta.These new plants consolidate our position
with a number of existing customers and establish us in important 
new industrial parks.The move of manufacturing from Taiwan to
mainland China appears to have slowed and as a result our business 
in Taiwan saw increased adjusted operating profit with plants running 
at high levels of capacity. New argon and hydrogen capacity coming 
on stream in Korea contributed to improved performance there.
General economic growth elsewhere in Asia, increased demand 
for steel from China and continued growth in electronics packaging
supported our business activity in India, Malaysia, Singapore and 
the Philippines.Thailand experienced growth from petrochemical
expansions while bird flu adversely affected the food industry there.
In the US a new hydrogen plant serving the Citgo refinery in
Illinois came on stream and several steel customers emerged from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, again supported by higher world
prices for steel and increased demand from China.We won the
contract to supply hydrogen to BP’s refinery in T oledo and this was
followed shortly afterwards by a similar award from Sunoco. Our joint
venture with Linde, building process plants in Oklahoma, has been an
important factor in bidding successfully for business with US refiners.
Our ‘premier beverage’ carbon dioxide service for carbonated drink
producers continued to grow but competition intensified as additional
volume entered the market from new carbon dioxide sources in 
the mid-west. Our water services business announced a major 
multi-year contract from a food manufacturer and has an extensive 
list of prospective industrial customers. In Latin America our new 
400 tonnes-a-day plant entered production serving CST in Brazil,
the world’s biggest producer of steel slabs for export.
In 2003 our business in the UK saw some notable customers
move production to lower cost environments.The trend was much
reduced this year. Growth at Corus led to increased demand and 
we signed a 15 year deal to supply 30 per cent more oxygen,
nitrogen and argon to its strip products plant at Port Talbot in 
Wales.Adjusted operating profit in the UK was helped by excellent
plant performance and by continuing efficiency improvements.
Polish production grew and a new operations centre was established 
to control our key plants in that country. Ireland, on the other hand,
saw further customer closures in the year. Cryostar, our specialist
business based in France, continued its good performance: it supplies 
a range of products for liquefied natural gas carriers and these ships 
are being built in greater numbers.
BOC reports results on a statutory basis and in a form that
isolates the impact of currency movements from year to year
and eliminates the impact of exceptional or non-recurring
items. BOC’s management believes this second approach 
will assist shareholders in comparing performance with 
previous periods. Where exceptional or non-recurring items 
are eliminated the results are referred to as ‘adjusted’.
T urnover and operating profit details on each basis for 
each line of business and specialist business will be found in 
each section. The discussion of business performance that
follows is based on figures adjusted for exceptional items 
and constant currency.
Process Gas Solutions
Process Gas Solutions achieved growth in both turnover and
adjusted operating profit as industrial activity remained strong in most
parts of the world.We delivered more to the metals industries in
general and for iron and steel production in particular as it rose driven
by demand from China. Increased activity in the chemicals and refining
sector resulted in major project wins as the year drew to a close.
We maintained our leading position in the food sector although market
conditions varied around the world.The electronic packaging market
continued to grow strongly in Asia, driving demand for liquid nitrogen as
the industry continued to move to lead-free soldering.The rapidly rising
cost of oil was, and will remain, a feature of the business environment as
it feeds into increased power costs and higher natural gas prices.

Operating review
A growing economy, strong commodity prices for minerals and
increased demand for steel were positive factors in Australia although
continuing rationalisation and business closures driven by the high level
of the Australian dollar moderated growth.The hydrogen fuel bus trial
in Perth was successfully commissioned, following a similar project now
underway in the UK.
South Africa saw export manufacturing decline as the rand
strengthened, with gold and platinum mines particularly affected, but 
in common with other parts of the world, steel production remained
buoyant.Adjusted operating profit grew ahead of turnover largely due
to active cost management.
Industrial and Special Products
Industrial and Special Products (ISP) performed well this 
year with improvements to the business in all parts of the world.
Economic conditions were generally good, with South Africa being 
the notable exception as the mining and manufacturing sectors 
were affected by the strength of the rand. Elsewhere, the sale of our
packaged gas business in the US left us with a smaller but potentially
more profitable business.We also disposed of a small business in Turkey.
The strength of ISP has traditionally been its ability to deliver 
well-targeted products and services to the diverse markets and
economies in which it operates. In recent years we have overlaid 
strong global strategies onto this successful formula. Our key markets
for industrial, medical, hospitality and special products and services 
now have global direction.World-class operating and commercial
practice is now widespread, delivering higher levels of customer 
service and efficiency.
In Europe both turnover and adjusted operating profit improved.
The UK still faces a challenging manufacturing environment where 
high levels of customer service are of the greatest importance.
Our customers tell us that they particularly value certain aspects of our
service.We measure each of these and have continuous improvement
programmes in place for all of them.While maintaining our position in
the core UK market for industrial gases we grew our equipment
business by rebranding and improving our network of retail outlets.
In medical, we continue to benefit from further additions to our range
of lightweight cylinders and improved service offerings to hospitals.
Following our agreement last year with Hudson Technologies we
deployed the first of their units in the UK, offering an environmentally-
friendly service to our refrigeration customers. Our Sureflow business
that serves pubs and clubs successfully integrated the new business it
won last year in the UK and added an important win, Heineken, to its
list of customers in Ireland. In Poland sales and adjusted operating profit
increased in the first full year since we acquired Praxair Polska in
January 2003.
The Australian economy performed well last year and our business
delivered a very strong performance, improving its position in each of
its target segments. Sales and adjusted operating profit improved as a
result, with the largest volume increases being seen in industrial and
safety products. Oil and gas projects in Western Australia and on the
north west shelf, and mineral projects in central Queensland were
highlights. Customers increasingly use the Internet to do business with
us and we are extending this capability to our agents through the
introduction of PartnerNet.At the same time we have centralised all
information processing in the UK, with the Internet again being used to
pass real-time data back and forth across the world. New Zealand also
had a good year backed by improving economic performance.

Operating review
BOC Edwards
The improvement in BOC Edwards’ most important market, the
semiconductor industry, led to order intake growth from the start of
the year.This fed through into higher sales from the second quarter
onwards. Sales of chemical management equipment for new 300mm
semiconductor fabs and for fab expansions increased, helped by the
introduction of the LiquiSys flow control product line. Kachina saw
higher sales of its value-added services that reduce its customers’ cost
of ownership. Our nitrogen trifluoride plant in South Africa increased
both production and sales.
T ogether with Gist, BOC Edwards won a major gas and chemical
supply chain services contract from a leading semiconductor
manufacturer, which is a major shift in the industry’s approach to 
supply chain management.
The liquid crystal display (LCD) industry, producing flat panel
display products for a variety of uses, sustained its recent growth.
This generated increased sales of vacuum products throughout Asia 
as well as higher gases sales to plants in Taiwan backed by multiple 
new gases contracts. On-site fluorine generators have been installed
with a number of LCD and semiconductor manufacturers, the most
comprehensive installation being at LG Philips’ sixth generation flat
panel manufacturing facility in Korea.
The Japanese market was buoyant. BOC Edwards sells vacuum 
and other semiconductor equipment directly into this market while
gases sales are made through our Japan Air Gases joint venture with 
Air Liquide.We strengthened our position in China with leading
semiconductor and LCD manufacturers, including winning the vacuum
and exhaust business for the first 300mm wafer fab to be built in China.
There was a similar market improvement in Taiwan for equipment and
materials.At the Hsinchu science park we invested in three new plants,
expanding our gas supply and pipeline network to serve new 300mm
foundry and LCD customers. Equipment sales in Korea developed well.
Our pharmaceutical systems business had a good year. It saw
increased demand for its large, complex freeze drying and loading
systems. Some general vacuum markets improved, notably scientific
instruments, but others in industrial sectors such as aerospace
metallurgy remained depressed.
New vacuum product development included a range of pumps for
the forthcoming generation-7 LCD plants; pumps for semiconductor
applications that are smaller, use less power and have better monitoring,
sensing and control capability; and new turbo and scroll pumps for the
general vacuum market. New slurry delivery and copper abatement
systems, a new wet scrubber and additional exhaust products were
added to the range.
In both Australia and South Africa our liquefied petroleum gas
businesses had an excellent year.We have again demonstrated our
improved ability to respond rapidly to volatile raw material prices,
which are often related to the price of oil, while continuing to grow
volumes in both countries.The industrial market in South Africa saw
reduced production in the early part of the year owing to the strong
rand but activity levels rose later in the year. Overall, both turnover 
and adjusted operating profit improved, the latter helped by operating
and overhead efficiencies.Afrox continues to respond to its social 
and economic environment with a seven-point black economic
empowerment strategy and it has won notable awards in South Africa
for its governance approach, including being named best-governed
company by Deloitte & T ouche.
In the Americas, the divestment of our US packaged gas 
business was completed at the end of July and as a result turnover 
for the year declined. However, adjusted operating profit improved.
Canada benefited from underlying improvements in performance as
well as a full year of trading following our acquisition of Air Products’
packaged gas business. In Latin America,Venezuela produced a notable
performance, improving turnover and adjusted operating profit despite
political unrest, and the continued roll-out of global product and
efficiency programmes contributed to growth throughout the region.
In Asia, our joint venture Japan Air Gases performed well and
delivered expected synergies ahead of time.Taiwan saw strong growth
and TIG, our business in Thailand, performed well. Elsewhere, Hong
Kong continues to see manufacturing move to China while bird flu
generally had the effect of dampening economic growth.

Afrox hospitals
In contrast with recent years, new acquisitions contributed little 
to Afrox hospitals’ increased turnover.We increased our shareholding 
in Wilgeheuwel hospital during the year and had a small benefit from
annualised acquisitions made last year while also disposing of three 
less productive units.The largest impact on turnover came from well
managed changes to the pricing regime first introduced in 2003.
In response to legislation and discussions with medical insurance
agencies the business has negotiated daily charges and increasingly 
uses a risk-sharing model for medical and surgical interventions.
Adjusted operating profit benefited as increased turnover was 
managed with no addition to the overhead structure.
Afrox hospitals has a management contract supporting the UK’s
national health service in two projects at Bassetlaw and Ilkeston.
Some 40 South African doctors and nurses enjoy short-term 
career development in the UK while their pensions and medical aid
programmes are maintained in South Africa for when they return after
their secondment. Every year Afrox hospitals trains some 700 nurses
and the programme in the UK offers an attractive alternative to the
permanent loss of qualified staff overseas.
For most of the year the business has been subject to an agreed
acquisition by a group led by two major black economic empowerment
investment groups in South Africa.This process has been extended by
the competition authorities. In the meantime the business continues to
perform well.
Gist
Y ear on year growth from existing customers, together with new
business wins, enabled us to offset the revenue lost last year following
the termination of Marks & Spencer’s general merchandise business.
Among the business wins was the Dutch flower producer Intergreen,
for which we now transport horticultural products between the
Netherlands and the UK, and John Rannoch Foods, one of Marks &
Spencer’s major poultry suppliers.Through Intergreen we have added
two new locations to the Gist operational network.
Gist manages the supply chain for Marks & Spencer’s chilled and
ambient food and, to meet growing demand, invested over £9 million in
a new 100,000 square foot refrigeration facility at Faversham in Kent.
It also manages the warehouse and distribution operations for Budgens,
the UK convenience store group, and order fulfilment for Ocado, the
on-line grocery shopping company.
In 2003 a long, hot summer produced a big increase in the
demand for beer and Gist responded by delivering record volumes 
for its brewing customers.This year Carlsberg UK, one of the UK’s
biggest brewers, saw peaks of activity linked to two sporting events –
Euro 2004 and the Olympics – and again the flexibility of Gist’s supply
chain solution enabled it to respond.

CORPORA TE
RESPONSIBILITY
An organisation can be vulnerable if it does not manage its social,
environmental and ethical risks, which is why in BOC we manage these
risks in the same way as we do all other aspects of our business.
We make clear to all our employees what is expected of them.
Our Code of Conduct has been in place for over a year, we have
trained all our employees on its contents and we ensure that all new
recruits receive a full briefing.
We continue to expand our IMSS system that holds electronic
copies of all our reference material, manuals, procedures and standards.
Teams of experts have assembled our global knowledge covering every
aspect of our operations and it is all available on IMSS.There is also a
function called Traccess that lists which chapters of information each
employee must know to do his or her job safely and shows graphically
whether it has been successfully assimilated.
Our internal standards are based on external commitments.
BOC has signed the UN’s Global Compact that outlines nine principles
supporting human rights, labour and the environment.These are
embedded in our Code of Conduct.This year the UN introduced a
tenth principle against corruption.We played a full part in the
consultation process leading up to the adoption of this principle, which
is also embedded in our code. If employees have concerns related to
the likes of legal compliance, ethical conduct or adherence to our Code
of Conduct we encourage them to raise them, with most issues being
reported through line managers. But we also have a free confidential
helpline to handle employees’ questions or concerns. It is available at
any time and is managed by an external agency.
Because we operate in a potentially hazardous industry our
priority has consistently been the safety of our employees and all those
with whom we work. Safety is always the first item on the agenda of
the executive management board.While we continue to track lagging
indicators of our safety performance, notably the number of lost time
injuries, medical treatment cases, and passenger car and truck accidents,
we are moving towards measuring a set of predictive or leading
indicators such as how quickly investigation reports are finished, the
effectiveness of our training, and how long it takes to complete
corrective actions.This year we launched Safety in BOC following a
detailed independent audit of our safety processes around the world.
Our objective is very clear – at BOC we don’t want anyone to get hurt
– and we are concentrating on making safety an integral part of
everyone’s behaviour.The message is that safety must be 100 per cent
of our behaviour, 100 per cent of the time.
Our modern world would not work without industrial gases.
But playing an essential role in the economic life of some 50
countries is not the only standard by which a company like
BOC measures itself. We take seriously our responsibilities
to all those who have a stake in our business – our
customers, our shareholders, our employees, our suppliers
and all those who live and work in the communities where
we are active – and we measure our impact upon them.
Until this year we measured ourselves mainly against a series of
internal benchmarks.They gave us an understanding of how we were
doing but were not ideal for reporting our performance externally.
In 2004 we decided to take part in Business in the Community’s
corporate responsibility index having for a number of years taken part
in the same organisation’s environmental performance survey.
This comprehensive and independent analysis allowed us to 
compare ourselves with 139 other UK companies, including 56 from
the FTSE100. BOC came 25th with a score of 91.7 per cent.
The completed questionnaire we submitted for assessment, all 96 pages
of it, is available and can be viewed with a wealth of other information
in the corporate responsibility section of our website, boc.com.
As a sign of the general regard for our performance in this area 
BOC was voted Britain’s most admired company for community 
and environmental responsibility in a poll conducted by Management
Today magazine.

Corporate responsibility
In a communications survey conducted with 4,000 BOC
employees this year the two issues they identified as being most
important for them were safety and the Code of Conduct. In response
to a further question, they rated their satisfaction with the way
information on these issues was communicated to them higher than
any of the other topics we measured.
BOC-developed technologies and products make important
environmental contributions, whether they are reducing harmful
emissions from combustion processes or dealing with the waste
streams from a range of manufacturing processes.This year BOC 
and the Cardiff Harbour Authority in the UK won the IChemE’s 
ABB-sponsored environment award for the Harbour Four oxygenation
barge which ensures oxygen levels are maintained in Cardiff Bay during
dry spells or periods of high temperatures.The environmental impact 
of our own operations is constantly monitored and continuous efforts
are made to improve our performance.We collect environmental data
on-line from around 550 of our industrial sites. Energy, particularly
electricity, is one of our major costs and also a major environmental
factor for us.We continue to apply new technologies to our air
separation plants to improve energy consumption and thus reduce
associated carbon dioxide emissions.
We also make an environmental contribution through the BOC
Foundation for the Environment, which was established in 1990 with
initial funds of £1 million and has since supported some 120 projects.
Concentrating on scientific ideas to improve air or water quality, it helps
take these to the stage where they can be practically demonstrated and
widely adopted.
This year in the UK we re-launched our joint-giving scheme where
we match the charitable donations of employees.We have similar
schemes in other parts of the world supporting charitable and
community projects.We also made our third annual BOC emerging
artist award, worth £20,000 to the winner, to help launch a young artist
on a successful career. During the year we hosted exhibitions of the
work of the winner and the short-listed finalists in the atrium of the
Group’s headquarters at Windlesham.
Educating the scientists and engineers of the future is important
for society generally and particularly for BOC as an employer that 
seeks highly qualified staff.We are continuing to build our education
website as part of boc.com.There teachers and students can learn 
the properties and uses of gases and view videos of experiments
undertaken by our employees who visit schools as members of the
Science Ambassadors scheme.
BOC is a successful business and it understands the responsibilities
that accompany this success. BOC intends to continue to fulfil its wider
responsibilities in all the societies and cultures where it operates.

designed to endorse outstanding individual and team performance.
Retirement benefit plans BOC fully supports its people’s efforts to
provide for their retirement and provides a range of opportunities for
them to participate in programmes tailored to suit local conditions.
Employee share schemes Employees are encouraged to share the
financial benefits of the Group’s success through a number of option
and incentive schemes.
Diversity BOC values the diversity of its workforce and is committed
to maintaining a workplace free from discrimination for reasons of race,
creed, culture, nationality, gender, sexual orientation or marital status.
Safety, health and environment
BOC operates in a hazardous industry and the safety of all 
those associated with our business is our highest priority.
Hazards encountered by our employees include flammable and 
toxic gases and operations involving high pressures and extreme
temperatures.The movement of product is central to all our
businesses, involving exposure to hazards associated with driving,
distribution and service operations.The Group has traditionally
measured its safety performance against a set of reactive or lagging
indicators, such as lost workday cases, and has additionally recently
introduced a set of predictive, or leading, indicators.
BOC has an on-line environmental survey gathering data from 
all its sites as part of a comprehensive environmental programme.
BOC aims to minimise the environmental impact from its sites and 
to comply fully with all material environmental laws and regulations.
BOC also contributes a variety of products and technologies to 
meet the environmental needs of its customers.
Supplier payment policy
The Group applies a policy of agreeing and clearly communicating the
terms of payment as part of the commercial arrangements negotiated
with suppliers and then paying according to those terms. In addition,
the UK-based businesses have committed to the ‘Better Payment
Practice Code’.
Corporate donations
The Group made donations of £840,000, of which £288,000 went 
to UK-registered charities. £310,000 was used to support The BOC
Foundation for the Environment. As in previous years, no political
donations were made in the European Union.
Dividends
Two dividends were paid in 2004. A first interim dividend of 15.5p 
per share was paid in February and a second interim dividend of 
24.5p per share was paid in August. A first interim dividend of 
15.9p per share has been declared for payment on 1 February 2005 
and participation in the dividend reinvestment plan will be available 
to shareholders whose applications have been received by Lloyds TSB
Registrars by 11 January 2005.
Corporate governance
The BOC Group is committed to business integrity, high ethical 
values and professionalism in all its activities. As an essential part of 
this commitment, the board supports the highest standards of
corporate governance.
The board has applied the principles contained in Section 1 of the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance appended to the UK
Listing Authority Listing Rules and has complied throughout the year
with the provisions set out therein as they applied to the company.
In 2003 the Combined Code on Corporate Governance was
revised with the new code taking effect for reporting years beginning
on or after 1 November 2003. Although BOC is not required to
report on how it has applied the principles of the revised code until
2005, the company has a strict policy of reviewing its corporate
governance procedures and has implemented changes as considered
appropriate such that at this time BOC is substantially in compliance
with the provisions of the new code.
In November 2003, the SEC approved changes to the listing
standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) related to the
corporate governance practices of listed companies. BOC, as a foreign
private issuer with American Depositary Shares listed on the NYSE, is
required to comply with certain of these rules and must disclose any
significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from
those followed by US domestic companies under the NYSE listing
standards. At this time, BOC does not believe that there are any
significant differences in the corporate governance practices followed
by the company, as compared to those followed by US domestic
companies, except that the membership of the nomination committee
is not composed entirely of independent non-executive directors.
The membership of the nomination committee is however in line with 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, which permits
membership of this committee to be composed of a majority of
independent non-executive directors.
Risk management and internal control The board of directors has
overall responsibility for the Group’s system of risk management and
internal controls.
The BOC risk management programme assists management
throughout the Group to identify, assess and mitigate business risk.
During 2004 approximately 100 risk workshops or reviews have been
conducted.The output from each assessment is a set of prioritised
risks with associated action plans. A report to the board is made twice
a year of the key risks facing the Group and actions to manage these
key risks.
The directors have delegated to executive management the
establishment and implementation of a system of internal controls.
The internal control system is monitored and supported by an internal
audit function that operates on a global basis and reports its results to
management and the audit committee of the board.The system is
rigorous and designed to ensure that directors maintain full and
effective control over all significant strategic, financial, organisational and
compliance issues.
Having reviewed its effectiveness, the directors are not aware 
of anything in the Group’s system of internal controls during the
period covered by this report which would render them ineffective.
The board and committees A complete list of the company’s
directors, with their biographies, photographs, and board committee
memberships can be found on pages 26 and 27. A summary and
explanation of their remuneration is given on pages 32 to 34.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ ST A TEMENT
To the members of The BOC Group plc 32 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2004
The report below is a summary of the directors’ remuneration report.
The full report setting out the composition of the remuneration
committee, the remuneration policy, together with full details of the
directors’ emoluments, pensions, share options and shareholdings, is
contained within the report and accounts 2004 on pages 64 to 75.
Copies of the full directors’ remuneration report can be obtained,
free of charge, from BOC or may be viewed on, or downloaded from,
BOC’s website, www.boc.com
The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises all the independent 
non-executive directors. It sets the overall remuneration policy of the
Group and makes recommendations to the board on the framework
of executive remuneration. It meets six times a year. Specifically, the
remuneration committee determines, on behalf of the board, the
detailed terms of service of the executive directors and other
members of the executive management team including basic salary,
performance-related bonus arrangements, benefits in kind, long-term
incentives and pension benefits.The remuneration committee also
reviews the remuneration of the chairman, following a recommendation
from the chief executive and the senior independent director.
The board as a whole determines the non-executive directors’ fees.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term
after which, whilst not automatic, their appointment may be extended
for a second term subject to mutual agreement and shareholder
approval.The fees are set at a level which will attract individuals with
the necessary experience and ability to make a significant contribution
to The BOC Group’s affairs and are benchmarked with those fees paid
by other UK listed companies.The non-executive directors do not
have contracts of service nor do they participate in the Group’s
variable compensation arrangements, its long-term incentive
arrangements or its pension arrangements, nor do they receive any
benefits in kind.
Remuneration policy
BOC’s remuneration policy for executive directors and other executive
management is designed to attract and retain executives of the highest
calibre so that the Group is managed successfully to the benefit of 
its stakeholders. In setting remuneration levels the remuneration
committee takes into account the remuneration practices found 
in other UK listed companies of similar size, internationality and
complexity.The policy is to pay salaries and total remuneration
around mid-market levels for on target performance and to provide
the opportunity, via annual and long-term incentives, for executives 
to be rewarded at the 75th percentile if this is justified by the
achievement of top of the range performance goals. It is the 
view of the remuneration committee that performance-related
remuneration should form a substantial element of total remuneration.
Based on assumptions about expected values for awards from the
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and Executive Share Option Scheme
(ESOS), the proportion of performance-related remuneration to fixed
remuneration (excluding pensions and benefits in kind) for current
arrangements is approximately 60 per cent.
Remuneration components 
Basic salary Salaries for executive directors and executive 
management board members are based on median market rates
drawn from market data provided by Towers Perrin and take account
of an executive’s experience, responsibilities and performance.
Performance is assessed both from an individual and business
perspective. Executive salaries are reviewed annually by the
remuneration committee. Remuneration for those executives of
businesses outside the UK is denominated in the local currency.
Variable compensation plan (VCP) The executive directors and senior
management participate in the variable compensation bonus plan.
The plan focuses on annual objectives and links individual performance
with business plans.The financial targets for the executive directors and
other executive management board members are set on an annual
basis by the remuneration committee and performance against 
these targets is reviewed by the remuneration committee on a 
six monthly basis.The remuneration committee considers that a 
six monthly review acts as a significant incentive and is conducive to
sustaining performance throughout the year.The financial targets are
based equally on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted
return on capital employed (ROCE) at Group level. Adjusted means
excluding exceptional items. Bonuses are assessed two-thirds on these
financial targets with the remaining third based on personal objectives.
These are based on BOC’s strategic priorities and include safety,
growth, people and change management and productivity. Performance
is measured against key performance indicators determined during
formal appraisals.There is a threshold performance level below 
which no bonus is paid. For 2004 the financial targets set by the
remuneration committee were EPS 56.2p and ROCE 13.3 per cent
and the achievement against these targets was EPS 63.2p and ROCE 
15.4 per cent. The remuneration committee agreed that the maximum
bonus payable would be 100 per cent of salary.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) Executive directors, members 
of the executive management board and a number of other key
executives selected from the company’s global operations participate
in the LTIP . The remuneration committee has the discretion to grant
awards up to a maximum of two times salary.The award made in
February 2004 to the chief executive was based on 1.9 times salary
and for other board directors 1.5 times salary.There are three
performance conditions: total shareholder return (TSR), adjusted
earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted return on capital employed
(ROCE). Up to one-third of the award could vest in respect of each
performance condition.
The TSR performance condition compares BOC’s TSR
performance with two separate comparator groups, a UK comparator
group comprising 31 industrial and manufacturing companies and a
global industrial gases group of six leading companies as follows:
UK group
Aggregate Industries Hanson Rolls-Royce
AMEC IMI Scottish & Southern
Anglo American ICI Energy
AWG International Power Scottish Power
BAE Systems Invensys Severn Trent
BG Group Johnson Matthey Shell Transport
BHP Billiton Kelda Group & Trading
BP National Grid Smiths Group
BPB Transco T omkins
Centrica Pilkington United Utilities
Corus Group Rio Tinto
FKI RMC Group
Global gases group
Airgas (US – S&P 500 Index) 
Air Liquide (France – CAC 40 Index) 
Air Products & Chemicals (US – S&P 500 Index) 
Linde (Germany – DAX 30 Index) 
Nippon Sanso (Japan – NIKKEI 225 Index) 
Praxair (US – S&P 500 Index) 
When determining BOC’s performance relative to the global gases
group, the TSR for BOC and the comparator companies will be
adjusted (adjusted TSR) so that it reflects the excess (or shortfall) in
returns relative to the local stockmarket index where each company
has its primary listing.The nationality and the local stockmarket index
that will be used to calculate the adjusted TSR for each company is
shown in the parentheses.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERA TION 33 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2004
For the award made in February 2004 which will vest in February
2007 the target set by the remuneration committee is such that if the
company’s TSR position measured over a three year period is median
in respect of both comparator groups, then 40 per cent of the shares
in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the company’s TSR
position is upper quartile all of the shares in respect of the TSR part 
of the award will vest. If the TSR performance is between the median
and upper quartile a proportion of between 40 per cent and all 
of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest. If the
company’s TSR position is below the median for both comparator
groups the TSR part of the award will lapse. The same TSR
performance criteria was used for the award made in February 2003.
The adjusted EPS performance condition is based on the
company’s EPS relative to three year targets on a sliding performance
scale. For the award made in February 2004 which will vest in
February 2007 the target set by the remuneration committee is 60.3p
at the end of the three year performance period for minimum vesting.
If this is achieved 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the EPS part
of the award will vest. All of the shares in respect of the EPS part of
the award will vest if the company achieves 69.3p at the end of the
three year performance period. If the EPS performance is between
60.3p and 69.3p a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the
shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest. If EPS is less
than 60.3p over the three year period the EPS part of the award will
lapse. The EPS targets for the award made in February 2003 were
64.7p for minimum vesting and 74.4p for full vesting.
The adjusted ROCE performance condition is based on the
company’s ROCE relative to three year targets on a sliding
performance scale.The minimum target set by the remuneration
committee for the award made in February 2004 which will vest
in February 2007, is 13.5 per cent at the end of the three year
performance period. If this is achieved 40 per cent of the shares in
respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest. All of the shares in
respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest if the company
achieves a ROCE of 15 per cent. If the ROCE performance 
is between 13.5 per cent and 15 per cent a proportion of between 
40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the
award will vest. If the ROCE is less than 13.5 per cent the ROCE part
of the award will lapse. The ROCE targets for the award made 
in February 2003 were 13.0 per cent for minimum vesting and 
14.5 per cent for full vesting.
In setting three performance conditions for the LTIP award, the
remuneration committee took the view that these were the most
important measures that drive or measure sustainable improvements
in shareholder value: the TSR performance condition measures
comparative performance while EPS and ROCE reflect a core part 
of the company’s business strategy, which is to improve both earnings
growth and capital efficiency.
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 (ESOS 2003) Executive
directors, members of the executive management board and 
other selected middle and senior management throughout the
company’s global operations currently participate in the ESOS 2003.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to grant awards up to
a maximum of two times salary.The awards made in November 2003
to the chief executive and other members of the board were based
on one times salary.The performance condition set for the ESOS 2003 
by the remuneration committee is that the growth in the adjusted 
EPS over a three year performance period must be equal to or 
greater than the growth in the UK retail prices index (RPI) plus 
three per cent per annum over the three year performance period.
The performance is assessed on the company’s published results.
If the performance condition is satisfied at the end of the performance
period then the awards would be exercisable in full. In line with
current corporate governance best practice there is no rolling
re-testing of performance. In the event that the performance 
condition is not satisfied over the original three year period then the
remuneration committee has the discretion to re-test performance
after five years, but only where the remuneration committee believes
the extension to be a fair and reasonable basis for assessing the
sustained underlying performance of the company. The remuneration
committee considers this performance condition to be a challenging
performance hurdle when compared to the company’s adjusted EPS
compound annual growth rate before exceptional items over the last
ten years of around four per cent. Awards under the LTIP and ESOS
2003 are not pensionable.
Savings Related Share Option Schemes
These are operated in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, and
are open to all employees including executive directors with one year’s
service or more.The UK scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue.
The current schemes are due to expire in 2005 and a proposal to
adopt new schemes is to be put to shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting in January 2005.
TSR performance
The graph above has been included to meet the requirement set out
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. It shows
BOC’s total shareholder return (TSR) performance, assuming dividends
are reinvested, compared with all FTSE100 companies.This has been
chosen because it provides a basis for comparison against companies
in a relevant, broad based equity index of which BOC is a constituent
member. The remuneration committee decided that other comparator
groups were more appropriate as performance measurement for the
LTIP . A graph showing BOC’s TSR performance compared with the six
major gases companies relative to respective local indices, which is one
of the comparator groups chosen for the LTIP , is shown in the
chairman’s statement on page 5. The October 1999 position reflects
the premium arising from the pre-conditional cash offer of £14.60 per
share made jointly by Air Liquide and Air Products.
Remuneration proposals 
During the year the remuneration committee reviewed the
performance-related elements of the executive remuneration package
and decided that it was necessary to make a number of changes.
In considering the current package and possible changes, the
remuneration committee was concerned more with the effectiveness
of some of the arrangements rather than their level. As stated the
policy is to pay salaries and total remuneration around mid-market
levels for on target performance and to provide the opportunity,
via annual and long-term incentives, to reward executives at the 
75th percentile if this is justified by the achievement of stretching
performance goals.There is no intention to change this policy.
The proposed changes are intended to make the reward package
more effective. It will increase the expected value of the total package
for the achievement of stretching performance goals.The proposed
changes also enhance the retention value of our remuneration
arrangements.The remuneration committee believes that the annual
bonus plan (VCP) and the LTIP are effective and do focus attention 
on the main drivers of BOC’s performance, particularly ROCE and
earnings growth.There is also alignment with shareholder interests 
via the TSR element of the LTIP and the fact that awards under the
LTIP are delivered in shares. However, the remuneration committee
has become concerned about the efficiency and effectiveness

BOC FTSE100 34 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2004
of the Executive Share Option Scheme. Being totally dependent upon
stockmarket movements share options can generate a range of
rewards from large to zero with variable motivational or retention
value.The remuneration committee is also concerned that the dilution
impact of options is inefficient from a shareholder standpoint.
For the reasons outlined above the remuneration committee
proposes:
• to cease making option awards under the Executive Share Option
Scheme (ESOS) to the executive directors and other executives
covered by the VCP . However, the ESOS will be kept in place for the
time being for employees below this level until an alternative scheme
can be developed in the near future.The facility will also be kept to
make option awards to executives who are covered by VCP on an
exceptional basis, for example as part of a hiring package.There is
however no intention to make any further awards to existing
executive directors;
• to increase the target and maximum value of the VCP to 
110 per cent and 160 per cent respectively of salary and at the
same time introduce a deferred, share-matching plan compulsorily
deferring one-third of the VCP bonus (see details below).
The current target value of the VCP is 73.4 per cent and the plan 
is capped at 100 per cent;
• to seek approval to increase the maximum award levels to be 
made under the LTIP from 200 per cent to 250 per cent of salary.
The remuneration committee’s purpose in seeking approval for 
a higher maximum is simply to give flexibility to remain fully
competitive in the event that a higher level of award is required 
for an appointment to an executive role. In the immediate term,
however, this change would have little practical impact as the
intention next year is simply to increase the chief executive’s
conditional share award from 1.9 times salary to 2.0 times and to
make no increase to the 1.5 times salary award received by other
directors last year.
Share Matching Plan
The main features of the proposed Share Matching Plan are
as follows:
• at the same time that the VCP opportunity is increased, one-third 
of any VCP award (an amount equivalent to the increase) will be
compulsorily applied to the acquisition of BOC shares;
• the executives will become entitled to these shares only if they are
still in service with BOC three years after the award is made;
• executives will then receive an additional number of shares equal to
the value of dividends paid during the deferral period on these shares;
• executives may also receive a matching share award of up 
to 100 per cent of the number of shares originally allotted.
The percentage award will depend on BOC’s performance over 
the deferral period. Adjusted EPS will account for 75 per cent of 
the performance weighting with TSR accounting for the remaining 
25 per cent;
• the adjusted EPS performance condition is based upon the
company’s EPS relative to three year targets.These targets will be 
on a sliding scale, where a five per cent per annum growth rate over
three years is required for the minimum award of 25 per cent of
that portion.The maximum award will be achieved if EPS growth is
12 per cent per annum over the three year period;
• the TSR performance condition compares BOC’s TSR performance
against the same UK comparator group as used for the LTIP . Awards
will vest for this portion where BOC’s TSR position is at median,
measured over three years. At this point, 25 per cent of this portion
of the award will vest. A maximum award of 25 per cent overall will
vest if the company is ranked at or above the upper quartile.
As previously stated, it is the view of the remuneration committee that
performance-related remuneration should form a substantial element
of total remuneration.The effect of these proposals would lead to a
shift in the balance of variable performance-related remuneration to
fixed remuneration.
Service contracts
The company’s policy is for all executive directors to have contracts 
of employment that terminate on the attainment of retirement age.
In order to mitigate its liability on early termination, the company’s
policy is that it should be able to terminate such contracts on no 
more than 12 months’ notice, and that payments on termination are
restricted to the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement
(calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over the
preceding two years) for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Pensions
During the year, four directors accrued benefits under the defined
benefit schemes operated by the company. Contributions amounting
to £283,000 were paid by the company to money purchase plans in
respect of two directors.

1. Basis of preparation
• These accounts are based on the historical cost accounting convention in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and comply with all
applicable UK accounting standards.
• The accounts are prepared on the going concern basis.This means that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the
foreseeable future.
• The Group accounts include the accounts of the parent undertaking and of all subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. Subsidiary
undertakings are those businesses controlled by the Group and their results are fully included. Joint ventures are those businesses which the
Group jointly controls with one or more other parties. Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a participating interest and
exercises significant influence.
• The results of businesses acquired are included from the effective date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions during the year (the difference
between the fair value of the purchase price of a business and the fair value of the net assets acquired) is capitalised and amortised over its
useful economic life.

4. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings
Group companies are parties to various legal proceedings, including some in which claims for damages in large amounts have been asserted.
The outcome of litigation to which Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors believe that such litigation should
be disposed of without material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition or profitability.
Welding fumes litigation A US subsidiary of the Group,The BOC Group, Inc., has been named in US lawsuits alleging injury from exposure to
welding fumes. Certain of these cases have been either filed in, or transferred for pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern
District of Ohio, where a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding has been commenced.The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating 
pre-trial proceedings in cases pending in different federal district courts in the US. It is currently contemplated that the MDL court will try three
cases during the MDL proceeding.The first such case is currently scheduled for mid 2005. In addition to the cases in federal court,The BOC
Group, Inc. is a defendant in a number of similar cases pending in state courts.These cases are in different stages of procedural development,
and certain cases are scheduled for trial from time to time.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS 39 The BOC Group plc Annual review 2004
4. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings continued
From the time Airco was purchased in 1978 until 2003 The BOC Group, Inc. had never had an adverse jury verdict returned against it in a case
alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes. On 28 October 2003, a jury in Madison County, Illinois, rendered a verdict against The BOC
Group, Inc. and two co-defendants.The jury awarded US$1 million to Mr Elam, a former labourer who asserted that his idiopathic Parkinson’s
disease was attributable to his exposure to welding fumes over a period of years. BOC believes that the verdict is inconsistent with the decisions
rendered by juries in previous cases, is not supported by the existing scientific evidence and is pursuing an appeal in the Illinois court system.
On 12 May 2004 a jury in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, returned a verdict against The BOC Group, Inc. and one co-defendant.The jury
awarded Mr Yencho, who alleged that his injury was caused by exposure to asbestos welding rods, US$525,000, to be divided between the
defendants. BOC believes that the jury verdict is inconsistent with the evidence introduced at trial and believes that there are strong grounds for
a successful post-trial motion and, if necessary, an appeal.
The BOC Group, Inc. believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in these various proceedings related to alleged injury from
exposure to welding fumes and intends to defend vigorously such claims. Based on its experience to date, together with its current assessment
of the merits of the claims being asserted and applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of these proceedings
will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or profitability and no provision has been made.
The welding electrodes business was sold in 1986 and the sale of the US packaged gas business, including the operations involved in
distributing packaged gases and welding equipment, was completed in July 2004.
Fluorogas litigation In February 2003, the company was notified that a jury verdict in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas
(the District Court) was obtained for US$132 million against Fluorogas Limited,The BOC Group, Inc. and The BOC Group plc.The verdict arose
primarily out of an alleged breach of a memorandum of understanding by Fluorogas Limited before it was acquired by The BOC Group plc in
September 2001. In March 2003, the court also awarded interest and costs against the defendants, making them jointly and severally liable for a
total of US$174 million. A bond for the full amount was posted with the District Court as part of the normal appeals process.
In August 2004, the appellate court reversed the entire judgement against the BOC entities and all but US$170,000 in reliance damages
against Fluorogas Limited. In addition, the appellate court remanded for reconsideration by the District Court an award of attorney’s fees on the
US$170,000 recovery.
Fluorogas Limited was placed in administration under the Insolvency Act of 1986 pursuant to an order of an English Court. It is expected to
remain in administration until the conclusion of the remand proceedings in the District Court.
ERISA litigation An action was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois (the District Court) against The BOC Group
Cash Balance Retirement Plan (the Plan).The plaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly affected, alleging that
the Plan improperly calculated lump sum distributions from the Plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
In November 2003, the parties reached an agreement to settle at US$69 million (£43.2 million).The settlement was approved by the
District Court at a fairness hearing on 12 March 2004.
5. US accounting information
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles (UK GAAP).
These differ in certain respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the US (US GAAP).
The application of the different accounting principles results in adjustments being needed to show what the Group’s profit would be under
US GAAP . The main adjustments are shown individually in the table below.

6. Comparative information
In 2004, the Group applied UITF37 (Purchases and sales of own shares) and UITF38 (Accounting for ESOP trusts).These deal mainly with 
the balance sheet accounting treatment for own shares and do not have any impact on Group earnings. The impact on the Group balance sheet
has been to reduce fixed assets and shareholders’ funds by £42.1 million (2003: £48.1 million, 2002: £42.5 million). Comparative figures have
been restated accordingly.

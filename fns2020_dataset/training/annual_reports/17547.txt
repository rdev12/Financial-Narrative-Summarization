Overview Highlights / Welcome to Yell – Chairman’s statement
Welcome to Yell – Chairman’s statement
This has proved to be a very tough year for Yell and for the
economy in general. In this context, delivering last year’s
guidance of broadly ﬂat EBITDA (at constant exchange rates)
has been no small achievement. The process improvements
implemented throughout the year mean that the business is
now running more eﬃciently than ever. The associated cost
beneﬁts, as well as the continued rapid growth of our internet
businesses, partially oﬀset the decline in print revenue leaving 
an underlying 4.6% reduction in group revenue.
Our reported results reﬂect the beneﬁt of the weaker pound with
our revenue up 8.1% to £2,397.9 million and a 10.4% growth in
EBITDA to £816.1 million, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS)
up 9.3%. At constant exchange rates, adjusted EPS was down
3.5%. Reported EPS was signiﬁcantly down, mainly due to the
one-oﬀ write-down of goodwill associated with the acquisition 
of Yell Publicidad (TPI). This write-down reﬂects the reductions 
in asset values as a result of the economic recession and our
revised forecasts for the business, reﬂecting the severity of the
economic downturn in Spain. The carrying value of the UK and
US businesses are unaﬀected.
Our operating cash performance was particularly strong at
£730.2 million (up 16.6% or 4.9% at constant currency) as we
again increased the proportion of EBITDA we convert to cash.
This cash was more than adequate to service both the interest 
on our debt and capital payments and, in the year, we repaid
£232 million of capital in accordance with the agreed repayment
schedule. Since our debt is denominated in the same currencies
as our earnings, the weaker pound resulted in our reported net
debt increasing to just over £4.2 billion; but our leverage
decreased to 4.7 times EBITDA. 
We continue to oﬀer excellent value to our customers as we remain
their best source of business leads, regardless of channel. Print
remains a very signiﬁcant source of valuable leads and the year
saw us take increasing steps to prove this value. At the same time,
internet usage and revenue has increased in all our countries
and we continue to enhance the value we deliver to both users
and customers. 
The Board remains conﬁdent that our core business proposition
is as relevant as ever. 
Concerns over the revenue impact of the economic downturn and
over our level of debt have interacted to result in a signiﬁcant
decline in our share price. This is a key concern for all of us on
the Board. I can assure you that one of our overriding priorities 
is to resolve our capital structure issues. This will then enable 
the business, without distraction, to deliver revenue and proﬁt
growth when the economic recovery eventually comes. 
During the year, we committed to reduce our leverage to below
four times net debt to EBITDA and, to assist this, we cancelled 
the dividend which we had halved last May. The Board does not
propose to reinstate a dividend until our leverage is below four
times EBITDA.
There are a number of Board changes taking place at the 
Annual General Meeting this year. Both Lord Powell and I will 
not be seeking re-election. Lord Powell has been a member of
the Board since before the Company ﬂoated and his contribution
has been greatly valued. Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros who
has extensive business experience with leading corporations in
Spain joined the Board in May and will be seeking election for
the ﬁrst time. We welcome his participation on the Board.
In completing my seven-year involvement with this group I would
like to take this opportunity to wish the Board and management
every success in the years ahead. The capital structure issues are
a challenge but outstanding operational performance is continually
being enhanced. This is a talented and experienced management
team, who have delivered a very strong operational performance
against the backdrop of an exceptionally hostile environment. 
I am conﬁdent they will ensure that the business recovers strongly
when the economic environment improves.
At the end of this report you will ﬁnd the Notice of the Annual
General meeting which gives full details of the meeting and the
resolutions on which I ask you to vote. The AGM will be held on
24 July 2009 at the oﬃces of Herbert Smith, Exchange House,
Primrose Street London, EC2A 2ED.
I look forward to meeting you then.

Chief Executive Oﬃcer’s strategic overview
John Condron
Chief Executive Oﬃcer
A strong performance in a very tough year
The last year has seen the toughest economic environment 
that any of us have ever experienced. The credit crunch, which
began in 2007, has turned into a global economic recession.
The confusion and the uncertainty has led to extreme caution
and a negative outlook on the part of small and medium-sized
enterprises – our core customer base – which has consequently
had a direct impact on our revenues. 
We have addressed the recession by taking early steps to reduce
our own costs and increase eﬃciency; by focusing on driving 
the usage of our products and services and demonstrating their
cost-eﬀectiveness to our customers; by continuing aggressively 
to grow our internet services and revenues; and by focusing on
customer retention, maintaining high rates of customer loyalty.
As a consequence, Yell has delivered EBITDA at broadly 
the same level as last year with substantially increased cash 
ﬂows and decreased leverage, whilst continuing to invest in 
our future. Given the economic backcloth, that is a creditable
business performance, and I would like to sincerely thank all
14,000 Yell people for the huge eﬀort made in this exceptionally
challenging year.
Regrettably, the economic pressure on our revenue, concerns
over our level of debt in what has been an illiquid credit market
and a lack of conﬁdence in the global directories sector generally,
has resulted in a very signiﬁcant decline in our share price. This is
obviously a great concern, and everyone at Yell is committed to
reversing this decline by demonstrating to all our stakeholders
the continuing value of our products and services and the
strength of our business model.
Yell oﬀers quality business leads 
Our 1.6 million customers choose to advertise with us because
they want real business enquiries and they know that is what Yell
delivers. They know consumers use our products once they have
made a decision to buy, not browse. And they also know that our
multichannel platform means that we will bring them these leads
via the search channel preferred by the consumer. 
Print continues to generate great value for customers. We know
this because we measure it. Indeed, we are so conﬁdent about
the continuing value of print advertising that, over the last year,
we have signiﬁcantly increased the number of monitored telephone
lines that we have made available to our print customers. These
lines provide the customer with a telephone number that is
unique to their Yell print advertising. All calls to these lines are
monitored – enabling us to prove the value we deliver.
We have also continued to invest in our internet channels. 
The results of this can be seen in our usage numbers which
increased throughout the year with all countries increasing
internet user numbers by around 25% in March. This has led to
the substantial growth of our internet revenues, which are now
15% of total Group revenues. We are continuing to build on this
success with the recruitment of a number of highly experienced
New Media specialists who are helping to ensure we are best
placed to continue our success story in the internet space. 
As technology evolves, we fully intend to be at the forefront 
to the extent such technology enhances our ability to deliver
quality leads to our customers. For example, this year we have
further developed our mobile search capabilities, ensuring our
data is easily usable on an increasing number of devices. And 
the inclusion of 2-D bar codes in our print advertising is a great
example of new technologies being applied to add value to our
traditional print products. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_11
Performance Chief Executive Oﬃcer’s strategic overview
Our focus on usage, regardless of channel, is the key to our
success. It is why we invest substantially in driving usage to 
our products and services – through traditional advertising 
and promotion and, increasingly, through search engine
optimisation and marketing. 
Six markets, one approach
Each of our operations is managed at a local level with local
management. This means they understand and are able to 
react to the diﬀerent opportunities each market presents. 
That said, in each of the markets, you will ﬁnd the same
underlying focus on driving usage and delivering value. Our
customer strategy in each of our markets is very simple – Win,
Keep and Grow – albeit in this diﬃcult economy, our priority is
customer retention (Keep); rather than winning or growing.
In the UK, this was the ﬁrst year in which we published books
under the RPI – 0% price control. This followed several years 
of operating under an RPI – 6% restriction. This signiﬁcant
loosening of price regulation will, we believe, enhance our 
ability to compete eﬀectively in the ever-growing market for
business leads; albeit its impact in the current year has been 
counterbalanced by the prevailing economic environment. 
In the internet space, we have continued to improve Yell.com
with better search functionality, new products and content
features that improve our customers’ ‘ﬁndability’ on both
Yell.com and the web generally. We recently announced 
that we have reached an agreement to sell Google AdWords 
in the UK. This is another step to delivering more leads to 
our customers. 
In the US, the competitive landscape continues to evolve. 
The very heavily indebted incumbent publishers have continued
to post revenue declines throughout the year and have begun 
to close some of their unproﬁtable companion and expansion
directories. At the same time, they have continued to compete
much more aggressively on price – albeit on an ad hoc basis
which makes direct comparisons with our rate card more diﬃcult.
The independent publishers, which had increased in number over
recent years, are also facing diﬃculties. The economic downturn
has seen their access to credit and customer spend restricted 
and we have seen far fewer launches coupled with an increase 
in withdrawals from the market.
Our response in the US has been to continue to compete in every
market, focusing on value and service. In print, we have decreased
the size of our books to make them easier to use and continued
to beneﬁt from our national footprint. Online, we have continued
to develop our yellowbook.com site; adding new functionality
such as ratings and reviews and electronic coupons. 
In Spain, the back to basics approach is going as planned,
although the severe economic downturn is masking many of 
the integration beneﬁts. The sales force is better trained and
more appropriately incentivised than prior to the acquisition. The
product portfolio has been rationalised and we have completed
the unbundling of products, giving our customers much better
visibility of relative value.
In Latin America, we continue to take advantage of growing
economies with strong print and internet businesses in Argentina,
Chile and Peru.
Managing through the recession
Yell meets a fundamental business need – the need to deliver
quality business leads for our advertising customers. That 
need is never going to go away, and we are highly eﬃcient 
and cost-eﬀective in meeting that need.
Our customers recognise this and recognise that our strength 
is not just in printed directories, but also in internet local search
and telephone-based services – both ﬁxed line and mobile.
These are the reasons for our high customer loyalty today, 
and they are the reasons why each of our markets oﬀer 
growth opportunities when the economic recovery comes – 
as it surely will. 
Over the last 18 months, we have ensured we are best 
positioned to withstand the economic pressures, and to take
advantage of economic recovery. We have reduced our cost 
base by £250 million by reviewing all our activities and processes,
improving sales force eﬃciency, rescheduling publishing schedules,
automating processes and improving our customer targeting.
This means we are now operating more eﬃciently than ever
before and this has given us the capacity to continue investing 
in our business.
Our key asset is our people – not only our best in class sales
force, which is eﬀectively the sales and marketing department 
of so many small businesses, but also all those who work 
so hard and so eﬀectively in making sure we deliver the best
possible products and service to our customers. We will always
continue to invest in our people, and I am proud we have again
been recognised as an Investor in People in the UK and listed 
as one of the top 50 service companies to sell for in the US.
The future
Last year has not been easy; nor will this year be. But we 
have taken the necessary actions and will continue to do so. 
We have produced ﬁnancial results as guided. We shall continue
to manage our business aggressively and ensure Yell remains 
the best source of business leads in all our markets. Looking
forward, we have the business model, the organisation, the team
to manage through the tough times and seize the opportunities
we expect to arise as the economy recovers.
John Condron
Chief Executive Oﬃcer 12_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Financial Oﬃcer’s review
Despite the signiﬁcantly tougher economic environment, Yell
delivered last year’s guidance of broadly ﬂat adjusted EBITDA 
at constant exchange rates. Signiﬁcant downward pressure on
revenue was largely oﬀset by eﬃciency improvements, which
allowed us to maintain investment for the future. Our increased
operating cash ﬂow of £730 million funded our interest and debt
repayment obligations and reduced leverage. We reduced the
value of goodwill associated with Yell Publicidad after recognising
the eﬀects of the long and deep recession. Reﬁnancing the
Group, which is eﬀectively due before April 2011, remains 
a clear priority.
Overview
The economic downturn and the turmoil in the credit markets 
last year were worse than anyone expected, and this directly
aﬀected our customers and, as a consequence, our revenues.
Despite this, Yell delivered against the guidance we gave a year
ago with broadly ﬂat adjusted EBITDA at constant exchange rates,
increased operating cash ﬂow and substantially increased free
cash ﬂow.
Reported results reﬂect the beneﬁt of the weaker pound, with
revenue up 8%, adjusted EBITDA up 10% and operating cash 
ﬂow up 17%. At constant exchange rates, revenue was down 5%,
adjusted EBITDA was down 2%, and operating cash ﬂow was up
5%. The average eﬀective US dollar exchange rate in 2009 was
about $1.66 to £1.00 versus $2.01 last year. The average eﬀective
Euro exchange rate in 2009 was about €1.19 to £1.00 versus
€1.41 last year.
In the current environment, our customers are displaying
signiﬁcant caution, and this has had an increasingly negative
eﬀect on our print revenues. The 5% reduction in Group revenue
at constant exchange rates includes the 12% organic reduction 
in the last quarter of the year, as we had guided. In contrast, 
our internet businesses continued to grow rapidly, up 38% at
constant exchange rates for the year, and now account for 
15% of our total revenues. 
We oﬀset the revenue decline by eﬃciency improvements, 
which also allowed us to maintain our investments, particularly
in internet services. Over the last 18 months, we reduced our 
cost base by £250 million, or 20%. We expect £100 million of 
this reduction to beneﬁt the 2010 ﬁnancial year. 
Operating cash ﬂow of £730 million remained very strong, with
cash conversion up four percentage points to 89%, at the top
end of guidance. Free cash ﬂow before payment of exceptional
items increased 34% to £395 million allowing us to meet our
interest and debt repayment obligations and reduce our net 
debt multiple from 4.9 times to 4.7 times adjusted EBITDA.
Headroom on our tightest debt covenant was 15%. Fluctuations
in exchange rates do not materially aﬀect debt covenant testing,
because for this purpose adjusted EBITDA and interest for 
the last twelve months and net debt are translated at similar
exchange rates, with debt being broadly denominated in the
same currency as our earnings. 
Pre-tax exceptional charges of £1,375 million comprised primarily
the £96 million cash restructuring charges from cost reduction
and eﬃciency programmes and a £1,272 million non-cash 
charge to impair Yell Publicidad goodwill, reﬂecting primarily 
the implications of the economic downturn.

Yell UK products provided £692 million or 29% of the Group’s
revenue. 
Driven by a 26% increase in unique users, Yell.com’s revenue
grew by 18% to £164 million. Internet revenues are now 24% 
of total UK revenues, up from 19% last year. Yell.com’s revenue
per average searchable advertiser at £772 was 14% higher than
last year, while customer numbers increased 4%. 
Print revenue declined 11%. We had 10% fewer print customers,
primarily as a result of planned lower new customer acquisition,
with 73% retention remaining relatively resilient. Print yield of
£1,293 was broadly ﬂat with cautious customer behaviour being
nearly oﬀset by the retention of higher value customers.
The UK adjusted EBITDA growth was 2%. The overall UK adjusted
EBITDA margin of 39% was up from last year’s 36%, reﬂecting a
10% decrease in costs.

Yellowbook products provided £1,182 million or 49% of the
Group’s revenue. The weakening pound resulted in an 18%
sterling denominated revenue increase while revenue was 
2% lower in US dollar terms. 
Yellowbook.com revenue grew 97% to $227 million. The 16.8 million
unique visitors during March 2009 were 24% higher than a year
earlier. Searchable advertisers at 31 March 2009 fell 3% to 366,000
as revenue per average searchable advertiser nearly doubled
from $308 to $598.
Yellowbook.com revenue growth only partially oﬀset the 9%
organic reduction in print revenue. The reduction was driven 
by 8% fewer customers as we refocused on yield and retention.
Average revenue per unique print advertiser was broadly ﬂat 
at $2,737 and retention was slightly down at 68%.
Adjusted US dollar EBITDA was down 4% to $564 million 
and the proﬁt margin of 29% was unchanged from last year,
reﬂecting the increased investment in Yellowbook.com funded 
by the savings from our eﬃciency drive.

Yell Publicidad products provided £524 million or 22% of 
the Group’s revenue. The weakening pound resulted in an 
8% sterling denominated revenue increase against an 8%
decrease at constant exchange rates. 
Internet revenue in Spain was €50 million. It grew 14% as 
we more fully monetised the growth in usage indicated by the
25% increase in unique visitors. Unbundling led to an expected
reduction in searchable advertisers, which numbered 116,000 
at year end with the average value per advertiser in the year
more than doubling to €329.
Páginas Amarillas (our Spanish Yellow Pages directories) same
market revenue fell 15% due to severe economic pressures.
Customer numbers fell 11% as retention rates went from 85%

Revenue from Latin America at €163 million increased 9% at
constant exchange rates. Latin America, which has not yet been
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the global recession, now accounts for
26% of Yell Publicidad revenues. 
The €248 million (£209 million) of adjusted EBITDA is 5% 
lower than last year, reﬂecting increased investment while 
lower revenues were oﬀset by cost savings. The 40% adjusted

The Group converted 89% of adjusted EBITDA to cash, as

growth rate of working capital as print sales declined. Capital

reﬂected investment in information technology to support

Before payments of exceptional items, we created £395 million 
of free cash ﬂow in the year, which was 34% higher than the
£294 million of free cash ﬂow last year, reﬂecting the increase 
in operating cash ﬂow as increased interest payments were 
oﬀset by lower tax payments. 
Interest and tax
Yell’s net interest expense was £297 million compared with 
£263 million in the prior year. The increase in average interest
rates of 0.4% reﬂects ﬁve months of margin increases agreed
with the covenant reset in the autumn.

Average net debt 3,951 3,706 7%
Average interest rate 7.5% 7.1%
Net interest expense 297 263 13%
We expect interest rates to increase to around 8% next year;
slightly more than this year due to the agreed margin increases.
Changes in market rates should have little eﬀect, because we
have ﬁxed interest rates on 100% of our debt until September
2010 with 50% ﬁxed thereafter until March 2011.

diﬀerent tax jurisdictions.
Taxes paid were 13% of adjusted proﬁt before tax, reﬂecting 
the beneﬁt of tax-allowable amortisation in the US and the
immediate tax beneﬁts on exceptional restructuring charges. 
We expect taxes paid as a percentage of the coming year’s
adjusted proﬁt before tax to be around 20%.

to show more clearly the underlying trends in performance. 
In 2009 we recognised an impairment loss (£1,272 million) 
on goodwill related to our operations in Spain (£1,104 million),
Chile (£120 million), Argentina (£41 million) and Peru (£7 million)
during the year. The loss was largely caused by decreases in 
our forecast results to reﬂect the deepening global recession 
and also increases in discount rates. More information on the
impairment charge is presented in note 11 on page 62.
In 2009 we charged £96 million of restructuring costs associated
with reducing our cost base by 20%. In addition, we charged 
£14 million for the cancellation of share plans and recognised a
£7 million credit for a net release of litigation accruals no longer
needed. More information on exceptional items is presented in

Balance sheet
The table below summarises the main assets and liabilities of 
the Group:
£ millions 2009 2008
Goodwill and other intangible assets 4,753 5,217
PP&E and investments 126 109
Working capital 729 593
Deferred taxes, net (482) (417)
Pension (deficit) surplus (22) 14
Financial instruments, net – 
at fair value (206) (90)
Net debt (4,207) (3,759)
Net assets 691 1,667
Intangible assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets are still the largest items 
on Yell’s balance sheet, despite the impairment charge. These
largely arose from business acquisitions. The book value of
intangible assets is a historical cost ﬁgure largely based on third-
party valuations at the time of acquisition. Goodwill is presented
net of impairments and is the value attributed to our people and
the expected synergies and growth of the acquired operations 
at the date of acquisition.
Net debt 
Net debt at year end was 4.7 times pro forma adjusted EBITDA 
at consistent exchange rates (the same basis as our debt
covenants) compared with 4.9 times on the same basis last year.
The movement in net debt for the year ended 31 March 2009
arose as follows:
£ millions
Net debt at 1 April 2008 3,759
Currency movements 714
Free cash flow before exceptionals (395)
Cash paid for exceptionals 57
Dividends paid 44
Net financing costs increasing debt 11
Acquisitions, net of cash acquired 10
Net own shares purchased and issued 7
Net debt at 31 March 2009 4,207
Our reported net debt signiﬁcantly increased during the 
year despite making scheduled repayments because sterling
weakened against other currencies. Our debt is intentionally
denominated in the same currencies as our earnings and cash
ﬂows, thus protecting our ability to service the debt. 
Pensions
We operate a deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme for people
employed in the UK before 1 October 2001. At 31 March 2009 
we have reported a net deﬁcit of £22 million as compared with 
a net surplus of £14 million at 31 March 2008. This change is the
result of the eﬀect of increased mortality rates and decreased
asset values net of the eﬀect of increased real interest rates and
decreased number of active members. We discuss the sensitivity
of actuarial assumptions on pages 23 and 24 and note 23 to the
ﬁnancial statements. For the people employed in the UK after 
30 September 2001 and employees in the US and Spain, we do
not have pension plans where we have to record a net asset or
net liability.
Control environment
We undertake various activities within a risk management
framework to ensure that risk and uncertainty are properly
managed and that appropriate internal controls are in place.
Please refer to a detailed discussion of this topic in the section
‘Principal risks’ beginning on page 20.
Outlook
The uncertainties about the depth and length of the current
economic crisis make it very diﬃcult to forecast more than three
months ahead. Therefore, we will be providing guidance for 
only one quarter ahead during ﬁscal 2010. In the quarter ending 
30 June 2009, we expect revenues at constant exchange rates to
fall 11% and EBITDA to fall by around 20%. The decline in EBITDA
stems from decreased revenues and increased investment in 
the quarter relative to one year earlier. We also expect cash
conversion to remain very strong and covenant headroom 
at 30 June 2009 to remain at around 15%.
Capital structure
We indicated, at the time of the covenant reset, our objective 
to bring net debt down below four times EBITDA as quickly 
as possible. We also suspended our dividends to support 
this objective. 
The Group’s cash ﬂow forecasts show that in the year ahead
interest payments can be fully met, with further cash generated
to repay debt. However, our ability to stay within our debt
covenants in the year ahead will be inﬂuenced by uncertain
future trading conditions. The implications of this and details 
of our ﬁnancial covenants are discussed more fully under 
‘Debt and ﬁnancing risk factors’ beginning on page 21 and 
in note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements on page 49.
We have funded the business largely from bank debt, which 
we will eﬀectively have to reﬁnance before April 2011. Our 
priority for the year ahead will be to continue actively reviewing
with advisers our funding options and assessing the most
appropriate steps to take toward reﬁnancing the Group.

(a) EBITDA is not a measurement of performance under IFRSs. EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by the Group’s cash ﬂow statement
and needs to be considered in the context of our ﬁnancial commitments. We believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly reported and widely used by investors
in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges, which can vary signiﬁcantly depending
upon accounting methods (particularly when acquisitions have occurred) or non-operating factors. Accordingly, EBITDA has been disclosed in this document to
permit a more complete and comprehensive analysis of our operating performance relative to other companies and of our ability to service our debt. EBITDA is
one of the key measures that we use to assess our success in achieving growth and operational eﬃciencies. See the reconciliation of Group operating proﬁt to
EBITDA in note 2 to the ﬁnancial statements.
EBITDA comprises total Group operating proﬁt before depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges, all being non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA in the year
ended 31 March 2009 excluded £95.5 million of restructuring costs and £14.3 million of accelerated share plan costs, net of an exceptional credit of £6.8 million
that arose from a net release of accruals for litigation settlements in the US. Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2008 excluded £14.5 million of restructuring
costs net of an exceptional credit of £11.8 million that arose from releasing accruals for litigation settlements in the US. Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended 
31 March 2007 excluded restructuring costs of £8.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2006 excluded costs of £4.4 million arising from the
TransWestern acquisition, and an exceptional credit of £5.0 million from releasing a provision for IPO costs. Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended 31 March 2005
excludes exceptional items comprising £36.5 million of litigation costs, including the class action settlement associated with a Yellowbook advertising campaign.

(a) The number of total live advertisers is a count of all unique advertisers at the date of the period end with a live advertisement, regardless of product. Total live
advertisers cannot be used to calculate average revenue per advertiser, as the basis of measurement diﬀers for each product and should not be aligned with
revenue recognised in the current period.
(b) The number of unique advertisers in printed directories that were recognised for revenue purposes and have been billed. Unique advertisers are counted once
only, regardless of the number of advertisements they purchase or the number of directories in which they advertise.
(c) Retention in the UK and Spain is based on the proportion of prior year unique advertisers who have renewed their advertising. In the US it is based on unique
directory advertisers.
(d) Unique advertisers with a live contract at month end. These ﬁgures refer only to those advertisers for whom users can search. They exclude advertisers who
purchase only products such as banners and domain names.
(e) The number of unique users who have visited Yell.com or PaginasAmarillas.es once or more often in the indicated month. Unique users are measured according

Principal risks
In this section we set out how we manage potential risks and
uncertainties that could have a material eﬀect on the Group’s
long-term performance and could cause actual results to diﬀer
materially from historical results. We have quantiﬁed the risks
arising from market ﬂuctuations and our use of estimates under
the heading ‘Sensitivity analyses’ at the end of this section.
Risk management
Our commentary regarding ﬁnancial information in this business
review should be read in conjunction with the audited ﬁnancial
statements. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and
involve risks and uncertainties. The discussion of estimated
amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses is forward-
looking and also involves risks and uncertainties. Caution 
should be exercised in relying on these analyses. Actual results
may diﬀer materially from those in forward-looking statements.
Risk management processes
We undertake various activities within a risk management
framework to ensure that risk and uncertainty are properly
managed and that appropriate internal controls are in place:
• The directors have overall responsibility for establishing 
and maintaining the systems of internal control and risk
management, and for reviewing their eﬀectiveness. These
systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. The systems
also provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
• We carry out an annual detailed risk assessment to identify 
the nature and extent of key operational and ﬁnancial risks
facing the Group. We consider the likelihood of these risks
materialising and we ensure mitigation plans are in place
where we believe they are appropriate. This process has 
been in place for the reporting periods covered by this 
report and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report.
• We have developed a risk-based internal audit plan to 
evaluate the overall provision of assurance provided by 
the processes managing each key risk.
• The Audit Committee and senior management regularly 
review the risk assessment and internal audit plan.
• We have voluntarily designed and implemented ﬁnancial
reporting controls in line with what we believe are best
practices. We have fully documented the systems, processes
and key controls that produce ﬁnancial reporting. We update
our documentation and test the identiﬁed key controls
annually. This testing is in addition to, and runs parallel with,
the internal audit plan and risk assessment programme.
• The Board, with advice from the Audit Committee, has completed
its annual review of the eﬀectiveness of the system of internal
controls in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Report
(updated October 2005), and is satisﬁed that it complies with
that guidance.
• It is not possible to identify every risk that could aﬀect our
business, and the actions taken to mitigate identiﬁed risks
cannot provide absolute assurance that a risk will not adversely
aﬀect our business or ﬁnancial performance. The principal 
risks and uncertainties we have identiﬁed are outlined on 
the following pages.
Strategic risk factors
At present the majority of our revenue comes from printed
classiﬁed directories. Increasingly, consumers are using a 
wider variety of channels to ﬁnd local businesses, most 
notably the internet. Our aim is to deliver quality business 
leads to our advertisers. Therefore, we constantly monitor
changes in technology and user preferences to ensure our
channels remain the best place to search for local businesses.
Accordingly, we continue to innovate and invest in line with 
these changing trends so as to improve all our channels and
products. The success of this can be seen in the internet, where
millions of users use our sites each day, and online revenue 
now accounts for 15% of the total Group. Looking forward, we 
expect usage behaviour to continue to change, with mobile
becoming increasingly popular and we are actively improving 
our oﬀering in that space.
The Group operates in competitive markets, competing for 
usage and advertiser spend against traditional print media, 
a host of internet search companies, most notably Google, 
and many other businesses such as internet search optimisation
and marketing agencies. We meet this challenge by retaining 
a close relationship with our customers through our highly
trained sales force and proving the excellent value of our
products to our customers. 
In the US we face particular competition from incumbent and
independent directory publishers, all of whom are increasingly
competing on price. We are addressing the competitive forces as
rapidly as they arise in all our markets through our product design,
technological innovations, promotional techniques, pricing
propositions and our approach to sales; we intend in particular
to manage and grow our online usage and revenue share.
In the slightly less-developed markets of Spain and Latin America
our ‘back to basics’ approach has seen us continue to invest in
usage, to rationalise our business activities, and to undertake a
revitalisation of the sales force entailing a focus on new payment
schemes and sales methods.
In all our markets we focus on the value we oﬀer to advertisers
relative to the value oﬀered by competitors.
In the 2009 ﬁnancial year, 21% of the Group’s revenue (Yellow
Pages revenue in the UK) was subject to regulation, compared 
to 25% during the 2008 ﬁnancial year. This regulation reduced
our ability to respond to competitive pressures by restricting 
our pricing ﬂexibility. The price cap limited price increases to 
the prevailing rate of the UK retail price index (RPI). A review 
of the undertakings given by the Group to the UK’s Competition
Commission is planned in 2010. We will continue to present our
case that regulation is not justiﬁed in this competitive market.  Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_21
Performance Principal risks
Operational risk factors
A signiﬁcant part of our revenue comes from selling advertising
to small and medium-sized enterprises. In these times of economic
uncertainty and tight credit markets, many businesses can be
expected to spend less money on advertising. We attempt to
mitigate this eﬀect by providing evidence of the value that the
customer receives from advertising with us.
Small and medium-sized enterprises tend to have limited ﬁnancial
resources and experience higher failure rates than large businesses.
It is a normal and necessary business practice for us to oﬀer credit
terms to these customers. We mitigate the risks of incurring bad
debts and longer collection times through tailored credit vetting
procedures. In new markets, we accept higher levels of customer
churn and bad debts, because this is a necessary investment 
in establishing an initial presence. The diversity and size of our
customer base mitigate material shifts in customer churn and
increases in bad debt expense.
We rely on our sales force, which comprises 55% of our
employees, to drive revenue growth in our competitive markets.
We aim to recruit and retain high-quality people through our
remuneration, training and development programmes.
We rely on our suppliers who work in partnership with us 
to deliver our products. We have long-standing relationships 
with most of our key suppliers, the most important of which 
are UPM-Kymmene Corporation, Quebecor World, RR Donnelley
and Einsa Print International. Paper is our single largest raw
material expense, but in the 2009 ﬁnancial year paper costs
were equivalent to only 6% of Group revenue. We limit our
exposure to market ﬂuctuations through contracts and pricing
arrangements with these suppliers.
Our trademarks and intellectual property rights, such as our
Yellow Pages and Yell.com brand names in the UK, Páginas
Amarillas in Spain and our Yellowbook brand name in the US, 
are important to our business. We rely upon a combination 
of copyright and trademark laws, contractual arrangements 
and licensing agreements to establish and protect these rights. 
If necessary we will use all legal remedies available to protect 
our rights.
Debt and ﬁnancing risk factors
The principal ﬁnancing and treasury exposures faced by the
Group arise from working capital management, the ﬁnancing of
acquisitions and property, plant and equipment, the management
of interest rates on the Group’s debt and the investment of surplus
cash. The treasury function manages those exposures with the
objective of remaining within ratios covenanted with the lenders
of its bank debt. The Group purchases or sells derivative contracts
for hedging purposes only (as referred to below) and does not
use derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
The Group’s treasury function’s primary role is to fund investments
and to manage liquidity and ﬁnancial risk, including risk from
volatility in currency and interest rates and counterparty credit
risk. The treasury function is not a proﬁt centre and its objective
is to manage risk at optimum cost.
The Board sets the treasury function’s policy and its activities are
subject to a set of controls relative to the size of the investments
and borrowings under its management.
Counterparty credit risk is closely monitored and managed 
within controls set by the Board. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments,
including forward foreign exchange contracts, are normally used
only for hedging purposes.
Yell Group has funded the business largely from cash ﬂows
generated from operations and bank debt in the form of term
loans. We will require access to funding before April 2011 in order
to reﬁnance nearly half of our term loans, which mature at that
time. Whilst we enjoy sound relationships with our lenders and
are currently able to service our level of debt, there is a risk, given
current world economic conditions that the debt markets will remain
in their prevailing state, where the cost of debt is relatively high
and access is either restricted or not possible at all.
Net debt at 31 March 2009 was 4.7 times annualised pro forma
adjusted EBITDA at consistent exchange rates compared with 
4.9 times on the same basis at 31 March 2008. About £323 million
of our long-term bank debt will contractually fall due prior to 
31 March 2010. Details of the Group’s borrowings are disclosed 
in note 16.
We have contractual debt obligations and covenants that reﬂect
our leverage. These could restrict ﬂexibility in our use of ﬁnancial
resources to:
• Carry out our business
• Finance working capital, capital expenditures or other business
opportunities
• React to changing market conditions, changes in our business
or changes in the industry in which we operate
We have access to a £400 million revolving credit facility, of
which £400 million remains committed (subject to covenant
adherence) until April 2011, uncommitted facilities of £54 million
in Spain and Latin America and cash of £51.1 million that we can
use to mitigate the potential risks described above. We believe
that, with the revolving credit facility, we have suﬃcient access 
to working capital to meet our operating and capital expenditure
requirements in the 2010 ﬁnancial year. 
The Group is currently in full compliance with the ﬁnancial
covenants contained in its borrowing agreements, as set out 
in the table below. The net cash interest cover covenant requires
that the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest payable for
the twelve-month period to the date of the covenant test should
not be below speciﬁc threshold ratios at speciﬁc test dates. The
debt cover covenant requires that the ratio of net debt at the
testing date to adjusted EBITDA for the previous twelve-month
period not exceed speciﬁc threshold ratios at speciﬁc test dates. 22_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009
Principal risks continued
The threshold ratios at 31 March 2009 and for each test date 
in the 2010 ﬁnancial year are set out below, as well as, reported
ratios and headroom at 31 March 2009:

do not always agree with the deﬁnitions used in this Annual Report, primarily
because twelve-month pro forma results are used for the covenant tests.
(2) Calculated as the % by which EBITDA could have fallen before covenant
restrictions were reached and includes reduced headroom for the nine
months before covenant reset.
As a consequence of increasingly uncertain trading conditions,
there is a risk that the Group might need to reset its ﬁnancial
covenants with its lenders to avoid a breach of those covenants.
The following sensitivities are forward-looking statements that
could be aﬀected by several diﬀerent variables and should be
considered as the mid point in a range extending ﬁve percentage
points above and below the ﬁgure given. A breach could happen
if EBITDA were to fall in comparison to the previous year’s
comparable period by approximately 70% in the three months
ending 30 June 2009, by approximately 33% in the six months
ending 30 September 2009, by approximately 19% in the nine
months ending 31 December 2009, or by approximately 13% in
the year ending 31 March 2010. This could also happen if EBITDA
for the twelve months ending 30 June 2010 is approximately 
9% less than EBITDA for the year ended 31 March 2009.
If the Group is required but not able to agree amendments to 
the covenants such that undertakings to the Group’s lenders 
are breached, then the syndicate of lenders would have the 
right, but would not be obliged, to demand immediate repayment 
of all amounts due to them subject to a two-thirds majority vote
of the lenders approving such action. 
Whilst this eventuality would, if it arose, cast doubt on the 
future capital funding of the Group, the Group’s cash ﬂow
forecasts show suﬃcient resilience, despite the uncertain
outlook, that in the year ahead interest payments will be fully
met, with further cash generated to repay debt. For this reason
the directors believe that adopting the going concern basis in
preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements is appropriate. 
There has been no change in the role that ﬁnancial instruments
have in creating or changing the Group’s risk between 31 March
2009 and the date of these ﬁnancial statements.
Interest is payable under our senior credit facilities at a variable
rate based on LIBOR plus a margin. We could be adversely
aﬀected if the interest rates we pay were to rise signiﬁcantly. 
We mitigate this risk by ﬁxing a portion of our interest rate
through hedging arrangements:
• At the end of each quarter we review our future interest
payment obligations in assessing the appropriate amount 
of hedging for at least the next 27 months.
• We have ﬁxed interest on at least 97% of the indebtedness
under the term bank facilities using interest rate swaps over the
period to September 2010 and around 50% until March 2011.
• At 31 March 2009, we had £204.5 million net losses on interest
rate swaps that were available for recognition as an increase 
of interest expense when settled in the future.
Our ﬁnancial statements are presented in pounds sterling, 
and changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and 
the pound sterling and the euro and the pound sterling will
aﬀect the translation of the results of our businesses with
US dollar or euro functional currencies. Our exposure to currency
ﬂuctuations will depend on the mix of foreign currency and
pounds sterling denominated indebtedness and the extent 
of any hedging arrangements:
• The composition of our debt partially hedges exchange 
rate ﬂuctuation, because 46% of our debt and 45% of our 
net interest expense are denominated in US dollars, thereby
reducing our US EBITDA exposure by approximately 26%.
Additionally, 25% of our debt and 21% of our net interest
expense are denominated in euros, thereby reducing our 
Euro EBITDA exposure by approximately 28%.
• We do not currently intend to use derivative instruments 
to hedge any foreign exchange translation rate risk relating 
to foreign currency-denominated ﬁnancial liabilities, although
we will continue to review this practice.
We have operations in countries where the functional currency 
is not pounds sterling. Signiﬁcant cash inﬂows and outﬂows
associated with the Group’s operations within a country are
generally denominated in local currency to limit the risks of
foreign exchange movements on the local results. We use
derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge foreign exchange 
rate risk on signiﬁcant transactions that are not denominated 
in local currency.
Financial reporting and related risk factors
We recognise the revenue and costs directly related to sales,
production, printing and distribution from advertisement sales
for a printed directory edition when we have completed delivery
of that directory edition. Because the number of editions and
type of directories are not evenly distributed during the year 
or published in the same quarter every year, our revenue and
proﬁts do not arise evenly over the year:
• During our 2009 ﬁnancial year the four ﬁnancial quarters
accounted for, respectively, 19%, 23%, 27% and 31% of 
Group revenue.
• Diﬀerent directories may grow at diﬀerent rates, such that
growth may not be evenly distributed between quarters.
• We sometimes need to rephase our timing of distributions 
into a later period for operational reasons, such as when we
rescope directories or integrate acquisitions. We mitigate the
risk of misunderstanding the nature of our growth by reporting
an analysis of our revenue growth on a like-for-like basis.
Operating proﬁt, EBITDA and other ﬁnancial indicators generally
relied on by investors to evaluate a company’s ﬁnancial
performance may not, in our case, reﬂect actual cash received 
or expended during a given period:
• The period in which we recognise revenue may be diﬀerent 
to the period in which our advertisers receive and pay 
our invoices.
• The period in which we recognise expenses may be diﬀerent 
to the period in which we pay the supplier. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_23
Performance Principal risks
• We mitigate the risk of misunderstanding the nature of our
growth in proﬁts and cash ﬂow by reporting a reconciliation 
of our operating proﬁt to EBITDA and our EBITDA to operating
cash ﬂow, see note 2 on page 55.
We make subjective and complex judgements, giving due
consideration to materiality, when estimating inherently
uncertain amounts included in the ﬁnancial statements. We
mitigate the risk of results being materially diﬀerent by regularly
reviewing our estimates and updating them when appropriate. 
A description of what we consider to be the most signiﬁcant
estimates follows. Actual results could be diﬀerent, but we do 
not believe materially diﬀerent unless otherwise indicated:
• Receivables are reduced by an allowance for amounts that 
may not be collectible in the future. We continuously monitor
collections and payments from our customers and maintain a
provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical
experience and any speciﬁc customer collection issues that 
we have identiﬁed. We have demonstrated the ability to make
reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful
accounts based on signiﬁcant historical experience.
• Bad debts as a percentage of revenue in the US at 7.8% reﬂects
the market conditions in the US, when compared to the 2.4% 
in Spain and 4.3% in the UK where the directories are more
mature. Our consolidated bad debt expense was £134.6 million
during the 2009 ﬁnancial year and at 5.6% of revenue was
higher than the previous year (4.4%). 
• Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment or whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts may not be recoverable and at the end of the ﬁrst 
full year following acquisition. The carrying value of our
operations are compared to their estimated recoverable values
to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The recoverable
value is estimated from a discounted cash ﬂow model that
relies on signiﬁcant key assumptions, including after-tax cash
ﬂows forecasted over an extended period of years, terminal
growth rates and discount rates. We use published statistics 
or professional advice where appropriate when determining
the assumptions we use. In 2009 we recognised an impairment
loss (£1,272.3 million) on goodwill related to our operations 
in Spain (£1,103.9 million), Chile (£120.1 million), Argentina
(£40.8 million) and Peru (£7.5 million). Financial projections 
for all our operations were reduced to reﬂect the deepening
economic recessions in Europe and the US and the expectation
that the recession will spread to Latin America. This reduction
was the main cause of the impairments in Spain and Chile. 
The goodwill in relation to Argentina would not have been
impaired had the discount rate applied to that operation 
not changed to reﬂect speciﬁc risks arising in that country. 
The goodwill in relation to Peru would not have been impaired
had the terminal growth rate applied to that operation not
been adjusted to reﬂect the more cautious outlook we have
taken in all jurisdictions. At 31 March 2009, the fair values of
our operations in Spain, Chile, Argentina and Peru equalled
their carrying values and, consequently, any adverse change 
in a key assumption with all other assumptions held unchanged
would cause recognition of further impairment losses. Details
of the Group’s impairment reviews and sensitivities to changes
in assumptions are disclosed in note 11 on page 62.
• Other non-current intangible assets and plant and equipment
are long-lived assets that are amortised over their useful lives.
Useful lives are based on management’s estimates of the period
over which the assets will generate beneﬁts. The values of
property, plant, equipment and assets with indeﬁnite lives are
reviewed annually for impairment. Other non-current intangible
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not
be recoverable and at the end of the ﬁrst full year following
acquisition. Historically, we have not reduced the value of 
these assets as a result of the impairment analyses, nor have
we realised large gains or losses on disposals of property, plant
and equipment.
• The determination of our obligation, expense and contribution
rate for pensions is dependent on the selection of assumptions
that are used by our actuaries in calculating such amounts.
Those assumptions include, amongst others, expected mortality
rates of scheme members, the rate at which future pension
payments are discounted to the balance sheet date, inﬂation
expectations, the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets and average expected increase in compensation over
and above inﬂation. We believe that our assumptions are
appropriate because we regularly seek advice from experts.
However, diﬀerences in our actual experience or changes 
in our assumptions can materially aﬀect the amount of our
future pension obligations, future valuation adjustments in 
the statement of recognised income and expense and our
future employee expenses.
• We value the portfolio of assets held by the deﬁned beneﬁt
pension scheme in the UK at market value when calculating our
net pension asset or deﬁcit. Values will increase and decrease
as markets rise and fall. The trustees and management have
an agreed strategy to mitigate the risk of having insuﬃcient
funds, if markets fall. The trustees annually match the low-risk
asset portfolio against the cash outﬂows for the following
twelve years. Against longer term cash payouts they match 
a combination of investments in index-linked gilts to mitigate
inﬂation risk, and higher risk assets to get higher rates of
growth. The trustees also work with management to ensure
suﬃcient assets will be available to settle obligations extending
beyond twelve years.
• The determination of our obligation and expense for taxes
requires an interpretation of tax law. We seek appropriate,
competent and professional tax advice before making any
judgements on tax matters. Whilst we believe that our
judgements are prudent and appropriate, signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in our actual experience may materially aﬀect 
our future tax charges.
• We recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from
temporary diﬀerences where we have a taxable beneﬁt or
obligation in the future as a result of past events. We record
deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe they are 
more likely than not to be realised. Should we determine 
in the future that we would be able to realise deferred tax
assets in excess of our recorded amount or that our liabilities
are diﬀerent to the amounts we recorded, then we would
increase or decrease income as appropriate in the period 
such determination was made.
• The determination of our obligation and expense for exceptional
lawsuits was based on management’s best estimates after
taking into consideration appropriate advice from legal experts.
The amounts could be diﬀerent when settled.  24_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009

Yell’s share capital consists of ordinary shares of £0.01 each (‘Yell
shares’) which are fully paid up and quoted on the London Stock
Exchange. Full details of the movements in the authorised and
issued share capital of Yell during the reporting period are
provided in note 24 to the ﬁnancial statements.
The holders of Yell shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote
at any general meeting of Yell and to appoint a proxy or proxies
to exercise these rights. At a general meeting, every shareholder
present in person, by proxy or (in the case of a corporate member)
by corporate representative, has one vote on a show of hands
and on a poll has one vote for every share held.
To decide who can attend or vote at a general meeting, the
notice of the meeting can give a time, which must not be more
than 48 hours before the meeting, by which shareholders must
be entered on the register in order to have the right to attend 
or vote at the meeting.
If a shareholder has been properly served with notice under
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 requiring information
about interests in shares, and has failed to supply such
information within fourteen days after service of the notice, 
then the shareholder is not entitled to attend and vote at a
shareholder meeting.
Where the participants under Yell’s employee share plans 
may be the beneﬁcial owners of shares, but not the registered
owners, the voting rights are normally exercised at the discretion
of the participants.
Holders of Yell shares may, by ordinary resolution, declare
dividends but may not declare dividends in excess of the amount
recommended by the directors. The directors may also pay
interim dividends if it appears that such dividends are justiﬁed 
by the proﬁts available for distribution.
Any shareholder may transfer all or any of his shares in
certiﬁcated form by instrument of transfer in the usual common
form or in any other form which the directors may approve. 
The transfer instrument shall be signed by or on behalf of the
transferor and, except in the case of fully-paid shares, by or on
behalf of the transferee. Where any class of share is for the time
being a participating security, title to shares of that class which
are recorded as being held in uncertiﬁcated form, may be
transferred by the relevant system concerned.
The directors may in their absolute discretion refuse to register
any transfer of shares (being shares which are not fully paid or
on which Yell has a lien), provided that if the share is listed on
the Oﬃcial List of the UK Listing Authority such refusal does 
not prevent dealings in the shares from taking place on an 
open and proper basis. The directors may also refuse to register
a transfer of shares unless the transfer instrument: (a) is lodged 
at the registered oﬃce, or such other place as the directors may
appoint, accompanied by the relevant share certiﬁcate(s); (b) is 
in respect of only one class of share; and (c) is in favour of not
more than four persons jointly.
The directors may refuse to register the transfer of a share 
in uncertiﬁcated form to a person who is to hold it thereafter 
in certiﬁcated form in any case where Yell is entitled to refuse 
(or is excepted from the requirements) under the Uncertiﬁcated
Securities Regulations 2001 to register the transfer; and they 
may refuse to register any such transfer in favour of more than
four transferees. 
No person holds Yell securities carrying special rights with regard
to control of Yell. Yell is not aware of any agreements between
holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer
of securities or on voting rights.
Yell’s Articles of Association may only be amended by a special
resolution of Yell’s shareholders.
Signiﬁcant agreements
On 27 April 2006, Yell and certain of its subsidiaries entered 
into a senior facilities agreement (the ‘Facilities Agreement’) 
with Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Deutsche Bank AG,
Goldman Sachs International and HSBC Bank plc and certain
other ﬁnancial institutions as lenders, pursuant to which the
lenders agreed to make available to the Group certain term
loans and a revolving credit facility, details of which are set 
out in note 21 to the ﬁnancial statements. Under the terms of 
the Facilities Agreement, a majority of lenders holding more 
than 66
2
⁄3% of total commitments can require all amounts
outstanding under the Facilities Agreement to be repaid if 
there is a change of control of Yell. 
No other agreements that take eﬀect, alter or terminate upon a
change of control of Yell following a takeover bid are considered
to be signiﬁcant in terms of their potential impact on Yell’s business. 26_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009
Directors’ report continued
Details of the change of control provisions in Yell’s employee share
plans may be found within note 30 to the ﬁnancial statements.
There are no other agreements between Yell and its directors 
or employees providing for additional compensation for loss 
of oﬃce or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Substantial shareholders
Yell maintains a record of substantial shareholdings in accordance
with the provisions of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of
the Financial Services Authority. As at 3 June 2009, Yell had
received notiﬁcations from the following parties that they have
an interest in 3% or more of the Company’s issued share capital:
Number of % of issued

Directors, their powers and appointments, their interests 
and indemnity arrangements
The table below shows directors of the Company during the year:
Our directors will submit themselves for re-election (or in the case
of newly appointed directors, election) at the Annual General
Meeting on 24 July 2009. Biographical details of the directors
seeking election or re-election are shown on pages 28 and 29.
The Board of directors is responsible for the management of
Yell’s business and may exercise all the powers of the Company
subject to the provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of
Association. The directors must limit Yell’s borrowings and exercise
all voting and other rights or powers of control exercisable by Yell
in relation to its subsidiary undertakings, so as to ensure that the
total amount of all moneys borrowed by Yell and its subsidiary
undertakings outstanding at any time will not exceed ﬁve times
the Adjusted Capital and Reserves (as deﬁned in Yell’s Articles of
Association) at that time. This ratio is currently exceeded following
the signiﬁcant goodwill impairment during the year. Resolutions
to authorise the exceeding of this restriction in the Articles will be
put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The directors require the approval of Yell’s shareholders in order
to increase or reduce Yell’s share capital or to buy back Yell shares.
Directors may be elected, removed and replaced by an 
ordinary resolution of the shareholders or appointed by the
Board. A director appointed by the Board shall retire and may 
be re-elected by the shareholders at the next Annual General
Meeting after his appointment.
At no time during the year did any director hold a material
interest in any contract of signiﬁcance with Yell, or any of its
subsidiary undertakings. 
Our directors’ emoluments are disclosed on page 41.
Details of our directors’ service contracts are disclosed on 
page 40.
The beneﬁcial interests of our directors and their immediate
families in Yell’s issued share capital are given on page 44. No
director had a material interest at any time during the year in
any derivative or ﬁnancial instrument relating to Yell’s shares
other than as disclosed on page 44.
Yell amended its Articles of Association in July 2008 to deal with
the provisions in the Companies Act 2006 on directors’ conﬂicts
of interest. The amendments included adding a provision to the
Articles of Association giving the Board power to approve situations
in which a director has an interest that conﬂicts, or possibly 
may conﬂict, with the interests of Yell. Since then, Yell has put in
place procedures for the disclosure and review of any conﬂicts, 
or potential conﬂicts, of interest and for the authorisation of such
conﬂict matters by the Board. In deciding whether to authorise 
a conﬂict or potential conﬂict the directors must have regard to
their general duties under the Companies Act 2006.
Charitable and political donations
During the past ﬁnancial year, Yell has made charitable
donations totalling £1.1 million, comprising £815,000 Yell UK,
£215,000 Yellowbook and £60,000 Yell Publicidad (2008 –
£1.1 million), which support various community related charities
and projects.
No political donations were made during the year.
People with disabilities
Yell is an Equal Opportunities Employer. We are committed to 
the employment of people with disabilities and guarantee an
interview for those who meet minimum selection criteria. We
provide training and development for people with disabilities,
tailored where appropriate, to ensure they have the opportunity
to achieve their potential. If a Yell person becomes disabled while
in our employment, we will do our best to retain them, including
consulting them about their requirements, making appropriate
adjustments, and providing alternative suitable provisions.

Governance Directors’ report
Information provision to our people
We seek feedback from our people on a wide range of topics
through day-to-day contact, team meetings and, in the UK,
through our annual employee feedback survey ‘Tell Yell’ , 
where our survey results are benchmark best.
We also conducted an employee feedback survey in the US 
and are working on improvements to the workplace as a result.
Each year we make a signiﬁcant investment in employee
communications to ensure that everybody knows and
understands Yell’s objectives, to ensure everyone is kept 
up-to-date with progress against plans, and to ensure
comprehensive communication of local and Group news.
Health and safety
We are committed to providing our people with a safe and
healthy working environment. We have a team of professionals
and a committee within Yell UK who manage our health and
safety responsibilities. The team develops and maintains our
health and safety policies and procedures and provides guidance
on safe working.
Our people and our contractors are required to report all health
and safety incidents and accidents on our online system. In 2009,
our accident rate for the UK at 0.308% was extremely low.
Approach to share ownership
We actively encourage our people to share in the future of Yell.
An employee ShareSave scheme operates in the UK, and a Stock
Purchase Plan operates for our people in the US. 
Financial instruments
Please see notes 16 and 17 to the ﬁnancial statements for details
in relation to Yell’s use of ﬁnancial instruments.
Policy and practice on payment of creditors
It is Yell’s policy to use its purchasing power fairly and to pay
promptly and as agreed. Payment terms for purchases under
major contracts are settled as part of the contract negotiations.
In the UK and US, it is Yell’s practice to make payments for other
purchases within thirty days following the end of the month in
which a correct and valid invoice is received. In other countries 
in which we operate, payment terms are usually longer and are
dictated by local custom.
At 31 March 2009, trade payables represented 39 days (2008 –
39 days) of purchases. Yell has no signiﬁcant trade creditors.
Post-balance sheet events
There are no post-balance sheet events.
Purchase of own shares
Yell is, until the date of the next Annual General Meeting,
generally and unconditionally authorised to buy back up to 10%
of its issued share capital at 3 June 2008 (78,109,963 shares). 
No such purchase has been made.
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
Each director of Yell conﬁrms that: (a) so far as he is aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which Yell’s auditors are
unaware; and (b) that he has taken all the steps that he ought to
have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that Yell’s auditors
are aware of that information. For these purposes, relevant 
audit information means information needed by Yell’s auditors 
in connection with preparing their report set out on page 45.
Auditors
Resolutions to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 
auditors of Yell and to authorise the directors to determine their
remuneration will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have conﬁrmed their willingness to
continue in oﬃce.

Governance and responsibility
Vision
Our vision for governance and responsibility at Yell is to provide
our shareholders and other stakeholders with conﬁdence that
Yell is a well-managed and responsible company.
The Board takes steps to engage with shareholders and to
evaluate the relevant ﬁnancial, social, ethical and environmental
issues that may inﬂuence or aﬀect Yell.
Governance and responsibility framework
We have established a framework which we believe identiﬁes 
all the elements of a sound approach to governance and
responsibility. We use this framework to set and monitor
governance and responsibility objectives, identify improvement
opportunities and ensure that activities are aligned with business
strategy. Through this framework we provide assurance to all our
stakeholders that Yell is a well-managed, responsible company.

responsibility achievements is available at www.yellgroup.com
and in the separate Corporate Responsibility report published
online at www.yellgroup.com.
Responsibility
This section summarises our approach to Corporate
Responsibility (CR) and our achievements during 2009. 
Our online CR report includes case studies that illustrate 
our programme.
CR is embedded within our business – in our dealings with
suppliers, our approach to recruitment, the contribution we
make to our communities and to charities, our work with trade
associations, and our approach to customer service – CR is a 
part of everyone’s role at Yell. 
Our CR strategy is focused on the following three strands:
• Minimising our impact on the environment
• Supporting enterprise, particularly small businesses
• Enhancing our employee volunteering opportunities
Environment
From green energy purchasing to carbon footprint measurement,
and from the recycling of plastic cups to the sourcing of paper
from sustainably managed forests, we continue to make progress
in this area.
Yellow Pages directories are made with very low weight paper
(34 gsm) and currently contain an average of 54% recycled ﬁbre
content. In Spain, our Páginas Amarillas directories also include
54% recycled ﬁbre. The remaining virgin ﬁbre used in the paper
production process is derived from sustainably managed forests.
Thanks to advances in technology, the percentage of recycled
ﬁbre used has increased regularly over the years and the mix
ensures that the quality of the paper and usability of the product
is balanced with any impact of the directories on the environment.
We source our virgin paper from sustainably managed forests 
in Finland. When a tree is harvested, new trees are always
replanted. Only one part of the felled tree is used for making
paper. The large bottom section of a tree is used to make
structural timber and furniture, the smaller, upper section is
turned into pulp for paper production and the tree top and
branches are used by sawmills and paper mills to generate
renewable energy. No part of the tree is wasted. 
Over the years we have given much time and eﬀort to further
improve the production of Yellow Pages directories. Eight years
ago we made the environmentally conscious decision to use a
yellow surface colour ink wash in our directories, rather than
paper dyed yellow to make the recycling process easier. This year,
we have reduced the intensity of the colour ink wash further to
enable Aylesford Newsprint, one of the largest newsprint mills in
the UK, to now accept the old directories into its recycling mix. 
This year, Yellowbook’s long-standing environmental practices
were complemented with an initiative to resize the Yellowbook
directories while maintaining content. The smaller directories
require 40% less material to make, generate less waste in the
manufacturing process and are lighter, reducing the environmental
impacts of the distribution process. Yellowbook continue to use
soy-based inks and cold-press printing processes.
Currently, almost 100% of UK local authorities provide some 
form of recovery facility for old directories. The easiest recycling
option for householders is via a kerbside collection scheme and
96% of local authorities currently oﬀer this option. Old Yellow
Pages directories can be recycled into cardboard packaging,
newsprint, egg boxes, insulation and animal bedding. Independent
research showed that in 2008, 72% of UK households recycled
their old Yellow Pages directory. In order to encourage the users
of our directories to recycle their old directory alongside other
household waste we include recycling information in relevant
classiﬁcations in all our directories across the Group, including
what, where and how to recycle.
Yellowbook works with Earth 911, an environmental information
network, to promote the recycling of directories in local communities
and partners with GreenFiber, a manufacturer of insulation
products made from recycled materials including old directories.
We are looking at new ways to increase directory recycling and
at innovative ways of reusing the paper from our directories. 
It will take time but our ultimate aim is to achieve 100% reuse 
or recycling of old Yellow Pages directories.
Yell UK has been registered to the environmental standard 
ISO 14001 since 1998 and two of our Madrid oﬃces have 
been registered to ISO 14001 since 2007. We aim to roll out
registration to the standard in all our Spanish oﬃces by 2012. 
Our environment policies for all our operations show our
commitment to reducing, reusing and recycling resources.
Yell is in the media sector and is classiﬁed as a low impact company
with regards to climate change. Working with the Edinburgh
Centre of Carbon Management (ECCM), we have measured our
CO
2
emissions across our operations in the UK, US and Spain. This
year, we have also established measurement for our operations
in Peru, Argentina and Chile. In 2008, our Group CO
2
emissions
(total scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions) were 330,127 tonnes.
Over the last ten years, we have reduced our total CO
2
operational
emissions in the UK by 44% (against 1999 baseline data). Directory
production has increased by 4% over the same period. 32_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009
Governance and responsibility continued
Enterprise
Our business has been built in partnership with small and
medium-sized businesses – building our business by bringing
sales to theirs. We do an excellent job of connecting thousands
of small businesses to their potential customers, but we can do
more to help, guide and support them through the challenging
phases of business growth.
We have more than 6,500 sales people across Yell Group to
service our advertisers and we aim to ensure they conduct
themselves with the highest standards of professionalism 
and integrity. In the UK we run a sales compliance campaign
‘Winning Fairly, Selling Fairly’ to ensure we maintain our ethical
approach to selling. In the US, our core value of ‘Think long term,
act with integrity’ provides the foundation for our commitment
to ethical selling. Each year our sales people are asked to
reaﬃrm their commitment to our high ethical standards.
Our Code of Ethics has been in place for a number of years 
and is available at www.yellgroup.com/ethics. Each year, all
senior managers across the Group are asked to certify their
understanding of, and compliance with, the Code.
Everyone in Yell has access to the Yell Whistleblowing Line
(managed by an independent third party). This line allows 
our people to report, in a secure and conﬁdential manner, 
any cases of unethical behaviour.
We work closely with trade associations in the UK to support
responsible business practice in areas such as building, 
home improvements, and health care, and we vet the use 
of trade association logos in the home improvement sector 
to minimise misuse.
To support trade association members we also sponsor 
trade association activities such as conferences, exhibitions 
and awards for more than 40 of the UK’s leading associations.
We have also speciﬁcally supported ‘apprentice awards’ within
several of these associations to encourage new business growth.
Having twice won a Queen’s Award for Sustainable Development,
in 2002 and 2007, we were selected by the Queen’s Award oﬃce
in 2008 to become a county ambassador to encourage local
businesses to apply for the Queen’s Awards for Enterprise 2009.
In 2008, we teamed up with horsesmouth.co.uk to sponsor 
The Small Business Mentor of the Year Award, an initiative aimed 
at celebrating and recognising mentors who have contributed
towards the success of small businesses. Horsesmouth.co.uk is an
online social mentoring network launched in January 2008. It is
an innovative means for people to network and provide business
mentoring, while retaining their anonymity if desired. The site is
made up of three areas – work, life and learning. Each of these
areas promotes knowledge sharing and advice – straight from
the horse’s mouth. 
Employee volunteering
We all beneﬁt in some way from being part of our local
community. By making a positive, personal contribution we can
strengthen the bond, reinforce our sense of community spirit 
and make a diﬀerence for others less fortunate than ourselves.
Yell is committed to supporting and encouraging people who 
get involved in fundraising for local causes. This year, Yell Group
contributed £1.1 million to the communities in which it operates
through cash, time and in-kind support.
Since 1999, Yell people have provided support for Marie Curie
Cancer Care’s Great Daﬀodil Appeal, helping them to raise 
over £21 million to fund Marie Curie Nurses. From 2008 we 
have changed the way we raise money for Marie Curie, moving
our support away from the centrally sponsored Great Daﬀodil
Appeal and into more localised, matched funding activities. This
will support our Community Champions network and gives our
people the opportunity to raise money in any way they want.
We continue to support the Woodland Trust through our Yellow
Woods Challenge and increasingly through the fundraising eﬀorts
of Yell UK people.
The ﬂooding in the Midwestern area of the US in June 2008
aﬀected many of our people, particularly in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
one of our regional hubs. Yellowbook people provided invaluable
assistance to the community, from making sandbags for vulnerable
areas along waterways to helping secure temporary shelter for
displaced colleagues. They also co-ordinated Yellowbook-wide
fundraising activities and were joined by the Yell Adworks
colleagues in the UK and US in raising money for the relief eﬀorts.
In 2008, Yell Publicidad people donated €14,000 to Entreculturas
and Aldeas Infantiles SOS Espana to assist with projects supporting
human development. In December 2008, Yell Publicidad people
donated €2,000 to the Spanish Red Cross to purchase toys for
underprivileged children in Madrid.
This year we were recognised as ninth in the Financial Times
‘Best Workplaces in the UK’ survey. We were also a top three
ﬁnalist for two special awards in Corporate Responsibility and
Learning and Leadership for Sustainability, showcasing our good
citizenship as a company and building on our track record for
training and leadership development to enhance performance.

Our executive directors are John Condron (Chief Executive Oﬃcer)
and John Davis (Chief Financial Oﬃcer).
Lord Powell of Bayswater was the Senior Independent Director
throughout the reporting period. On 7 May 2009, Richard Hooper
was appointed the Senior Independent Director upon the
announcement of Lord Powell’s resignation. All non-executive
directors are available to shareholders who wish to raise issues.
Our policy is that all directors stand for re-election (or, in the 
case of newly appointed directors, election) each year.
As previously announced, Bob Scott and Lord Powell will resign
from the Board with eﬀect from the close of business on 24 July
2009. Led by the Nomination Committee, Yell is actively recruiting
a replacement Chairman.
Approval of the appointment of Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros
as an independent non-executive director, eﬀective from 18 May
2009, will be sought at Yell’s Annual General Meeting due to be
held on 24 July 2009. 
John Condron (executive director) is a full-time director of companies
within the Yell Group and has no other commitments to external
companies and, consequently, does not receive any other fees.
John Davis is a non-executive director of Informa plc, and his fees
from Informa are set out in the Remuneration Report. Details of
our executive directors’ service contracts and our non-executive
directors’ letters of appointment can also be found in the
Remuneration Report on page 40. Letters of appointment 
now set out ﬁxed time commitments of at least one day per
month and all our directors are expected to demonstrate their
commitment to the work of the Board on an ongoing basis. 
In Spring 2009, our Board conducted a formal evaluation of its
overall eﬀectiveness. The evaluation focused on the collective
performance of our Board as well as on the performance of
individual directors, our Chairman and our Company Secretary.
The exercise was conducted by means of a survey completed by
each director and a one-to-one discussion between each director
and our Chairman. Following the survey the non-executive
directors also met, with and without our Chairman present, 
to discuss the performance of the Board and of the Chairman.
Biographies of all our directors seeking election or re-election at
the 2009 Annual General Meeting appear on pages 28 and 29.
Operation of the Board
Our Board has overall responsibility for leading and controlling
Yell and is accountable to shareholders for ﬁnancial and
operational performance. Our Board is also responsible for the
open and transparent communication of information relevant 
to this performance.
Our Board recognises the division in responsibility between our
Chairman (who ensures the eﬀective working of the Board) and
our Chief Executive Oﬃcer (who runs our Company). Our Board
has agreed a schedule of matters reserved for its decision which
includes the approval of ﬁnancial statements, major acquisitions,
Group strategy, and governance policies. The written schedule
also sets out the extent of the various delegated authorities
granted by our Board to our committees and our senior
management team.
Our directors have access to the services of our Company
Secretary, Howard Rubenstein, the removal of whom is a matter
reserved for the decision of the Board. Howard Rubenstein acts
as secretary to all of the Board Committees.
Our Company Secretary works with our Chairman to ensure 
that all our directors receive suﬃcient information, on a timely
basis, to enable the Board to run eﬃciently. A secure website 
has been established as an exclusive channel for our directors 
to share information, receive training material and Board papers,
and generally enhance the administration of Board business.
Analysts and brokers brieﬁngs and opinions are also provided 
to all directors through the website.
During the ﬁnancial year, training and presentations on the
implementation of the Companies Act 2006 and directors’
conﬂicts of interests were provided to the directors. At various
Board meetings throughout the year, our directors received
presentations by our UK, US, Spanish and Latin American 
senior management teams, highlighting key developments 
in their respective businesses and markets.
Our directors are entitled to take independent professional
advice, at Yell’s expense, about fulﬁlling their duties. Yell has 
also arranged appropriate Directors’ and Oﬃcers’ insurance
cover in respect of legal action against the directors.
Our Board is scheduled to meet at least six times in any calendar
year: January/February, March/April, May, July, September and
November. During the reporting period, our Board met 10 times
and the non-executive directors met once without the executive
directors present.  34_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by John Coghlan, who we
consider to have recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. The
other members during the year were Lord Powell of Bayswater,
Richard Hooper and Joachim Eberhardt. The Committee consists
entirely of independent non-executive directors. Our external
and internal auditors attend all meetings.
The Committee assists the Board in fulﬁlling its duties regarding
the reporting of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information to
shareholders. On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee
examines the eﬀectiveness of the Group’s internal controls 
and risk management by reviewing evidence of risk assessment
activity. Risk management processes are given on pages 20 to 24.
The Committee agrees the scope of the internal audit plan and
reviews it following the risk assessment activity. It reviews the
annual and interim ﬁnancial statements and the nature and
scope of the external audit.
The Committee met four times during the reporting period.
The Committee also reviews the independence and objectivity of
our external auditors. Our auditors are also required to conﬁrm
their independence at least annually.
Our policy for the provision of non-audit services by our auditors
is also kept under review by the Committee. The policy deﬁnes
the nature of non-audit work which may be undertaken and
establishes a ﬁnancial limit (up to £5 million per annum) on this
work. Included in this £5 million, is a pre-approved ﬁnancial limit
of £1.5 million for routine tax compliance and advisory services
that may be provided by the external auditors. All non-audit
projects above a ﬁnancial limit of £250,000 must be approved by
the Committee prior to the project commencing. Regular updates
are prepared for the Committee on the nature, cumulative costs
and extent of non-audit services provided by our auditors. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_35
Governance Governance and responsibility
The Committee also has oversight of the investigation of any
serious issues raised through the Yell Whistleblowing Line.
The Committee and our Board formally reviewed the
eﬀectiveness of the systems of internal control, including
ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls and risk
management systems during the last ﬁnancial year.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Joachim Eberhardt.
The other members of the Committee are Tim Bunting, 
Bob Scott and Lyndon Lea (who resigned from the Committee 
on 31 October 2008). In July 2007, our Chairman, Bob Scott, was
appointed as a member of the Committee following changes to
the Combined Code 2006 making him eligible for appointment
on account of his having been considered independent on his
appointment as Chairman. Following Bob Scott’s retirement from
the Board, a third independent non-executive director will be
appointed to the Committee to ensure ongoing compliance 
with the Combined Code.
The Committee has responsibility for making recommendations
to our Board on the policy for remuneration of executive directors
and on the process for review of their performance. It also has
responsibility for determining speciﬁc remuneration packages for
each of our directors, including pension rights, any compensation
payments and the implementation of executive incentive
schemes. No director may participate in discussions relating 
to their own terms and conditions of service or remuneration.
The Committee met six times during the reporting period.
During the year, the Committee received advice from our 
Chief Executive Oﬃcer, our Company Secretary, our Head of
Human Resources, and our Head of Reward. The Committee 
also received advice from Deloitte & Touche LLP in respect of
remuneration policy. Tax and risk management services were
also provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP during the year.
Our remuneration report appears from page 37.
Nomination Committee
Our Nomination Committee is chaired by Bob Scott and its other
members are John Coghlan, John Condron and Richard Hooper.
Lyndon Lea resigned from the Committee on 31 October 2008. Bob
Scott and Richard Hooper were appointed to the Committee with
eﬀect from 26 February 2009. The composition of this Committee
will be further reviewed following Bob Scott’s retirement to ensure
ongoing compliance with the Combined Code.
The Committee has responsibility for considering the size,
structure and composition of the Board, the retirement and/or
appointment of directors and ensuring that the Board has the
right blend of skills and experience. The Committee also reviews
the extent of our directors’ commitments outside Yell, to ensure
that those commitments are not detrimental to Yell or the
eﬃciency of the Board.
During the year, the Committee considered and recommended
the appointment to the Board of Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros.
The Committee consider that Mr Espinosa’s skills and expertise,
particularly as regards the Spanish marketplace, would add
signiﬁcant value to the Board.
Neither an external search agency nor open advertising (Combined
Code reference A.4.6) were considered necessary in connection
with the recruitment of Mr Espinosa.
The Committee met formally once during the ﬁnancial year.
Relations with shareholders
Yell is committed to ongoing communication with its shareholders
and other stakeholders. This was achieved through:
• Regular dialogue and presentations throughout the year to our
institutional investors. These presentations were subsequently
made available on our website, www.yellgroup.com
• Our Chief Executive Oﬃcer and Chief Financial Oﬃcer, senior
management, Company Secretary’s oﬃce, investor relations
and CR manager engaging with stakeholders on wider issues
relating to the Group.
• The issuing of quarterly press releases and half yearly reports.
• Announcements made through the London Stock Exchange,
where our shares are listed.
• Our Annual General Meeting, which gives all our shareholders
the opportunity to hear ﬁrst hand from our Board of Directors
and to raise questions. At our 2008 Annual General Meeting,
our directors were present, and informally met with our
shareholders after the meeting. All proposed resolutions are
put to a poll vote. Shareholders who might not be able to
attend the meeting are encouraged to vote by proxy. The
Annual General Meeting voting results were published through
the London Stock Exchange and on our website immediately
after the meeting.
• Sections dedicated to our shareholders on the Company’s
corporate website, www.yellgroup.com 36_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate governance and responsibility continued
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the
Remuneration report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements
for each ﬁnancial year that give a true and fair view of the state
of aﬀairs of the Company and the Group and of the proﬁt or loss
of the Group for that period.
In preparing those ﬁnancial statements the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently.
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent.
• State that the ﬁnancial statements conform with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union.
• Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on a going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business.
Description of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report, the
Remuneration report and the ﬁnancial statements
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements and the
Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 1985 
and as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for maintaining the integrity of 
the ﬁnancial information, including the Annual Report, on the
Yell Group plc website, www.yellgroup.com. Legislation in the 
UK concerning the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial
statements may diﬀer from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors conﬁrm that to the best of their knowledge:
• The Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements for Yell
Group plc (the ‘Company’), prepared in accordance with the
applicable United Kingdom law and in conformity with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole.
• The management report (which comprises the Directors’ Report
including the business review) includes a fair review of the
development and performance of the business and the position
of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Our remuneration report 
Remuneration report
From the Remuneration Committee Chairman
I, Joe Eberhardt, am pleased to be able to present the
Remuneration Committee’s yearly report. 
I conﬁrm that this report has been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of The Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002.
1. The Remuneration Committee
Members
The members of the Committee for the year ended 31 March 2009
were Tim Bunting, Lyndon Lea, Bob Scott and me, Joe Eberhardt.
Tim and I are independent, non-executive directors of the Company.
Bob, the Chairman of the Company, was independent on his
appointment as Chairman. Lyndon, who was an independent
non-executive director, resigned as a member of the Committee
on 31 October 2008.
John Condron, Yell’s Chief Executive Oﬃcer, is invited to attend
Remuneration Committee meetings but is not present when his
remuneration is discussed.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for Yell’s executive
director remuneration. The Committee’s terms of reference are
available on the Yell Group plc website (www.yellgroup.com) 
or from Howard Rubenstein, the Company Secretary.
We met on six occasions during the year and received advice from:
• The Chief Executive Oﬃcer
• The Head of Human Resources
• The Head of Reward
• The Company Secretary
• Deloitte & Touche, LLP (‘Deloitte’)
Deloitte were appointed by us to provide advice on remuneration
and also provided tax and risk management services to the
Company during the year.
Remuneration policy
We believe that a robust incentive and reward framework is
essential to support the business objectives and future success 
of the Company. Our remuneration policy continues to be based
on the following key principles:
• Simplicity and coherence
• Fairness of reward
• Alignment with shareholder interests
• Supporting the creation of shareholder value
• Variable reward based on appropriate performance targets
• Encouraging share ownership
• Incentivising exceptional performance with the potential for
exceptional rewards
We continue to recognise that the executive directors, John Condron
and John Davis, together with all Yell people are key to our success
and our growth as a leading international directories business.
John Condron’s and John Davis’ remuneration packages continue
to be aligned with business requirements and remain in keeping
with the remuneration principles outlined. Whilst no formal overall
review of their remuneration took place during the reporting
period, we continue to monitor the eﬀectiveness of the executive
remuneration structure and incentive plans for the executive
directors and for our other employees.
The graph above shows our performance relative to the FTSE 250
index. We consider this to be an appropriate comparison as Yell
Group plc was a constituent of the index for the majority of the
reporting year.
The graph also shows our performance relative to quoted 
media companies in the publishing sector. We consider this to 
be an appropriate comparison as Yell Group plc is a directory
publishing company.
We have prepared the performance graph in accordance with
the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The
performance graph is not an indication of the likely vesting 
of awards granted under any incentive plans.
Remuneration structure 2008/2009
The broad basis of our remuneration structure has not changed
from previous years and is illustrated by the diagram below:

2. The executive directors
Individual elements of their remuneration
John Condron’s and John Davis’ remuneration packages
comprise the following ﬁxed and variable elements:
Fixed remuneration
• Salary
• Pension
• Beneﬁts
Variable remuneration
• Annual and deferred bonus
• Share options
• Performance shares under the LTIP
The variable elements of remuneration are subject to the
achievement of predetermined performance targets. We believe
that there is an appropriate balance between ﬁxed and variable
remuneration. Excluding pensions and beneﬁts, for on-target
performance variable pay makes up approximately 60% of the
total remuneration package. This increases to approximately 81%
for maximum performance.
Base salary
Base salaries are set taking account of the individual’s:
• Role and responsibility
• Experience
• Long-term contribution
• Market positioning
Salaries are reviewed annually using benchmark data for
companies of a similar size to Yell Group plc, taking account 
of market capitalisation and enterprise value.
This year, we felt it appropriate that there should be no increase
in base salaries. Accordingly, Mr Condron’s and Mr Davis’ base
salaries from 1 April 2009 are the same as in the previous year
(as detailed in the table on page 41).
Pension
John Condron and John Davis participate in the Yell Pension Plan
which is a plan approved by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).
Under the applicable terms of the Yell Pension Plan, they will
receive retirement beneﬁts on a deﬁned beneﬁt basis.
John Condron
John Condron is a member of Section 2 of the Yell Pension Plan
and prior to 5 April 2006 he accrued an annual pension of 1⁄80th
of his Final Pensionable Earnings for each year of Pensionable
Service. In addition, he accrued a one-oﬀ cash sum of 3⁄80ths of
his Final Pensionable Earnings for each year of Pensionable Service.
He was not subject to the HMRC’s Earnings Cap for pension
purposes (due to his prior membership of the BT Pension Scheme)
and was entitled to an enhancement of his Pensionable Service
under the Yell Pension Plan (by reference to the BT Pension
Scheme), which was intended to continue until 13 November
2009. Under the terms of this enhancement, since 1 July 1996, 
he has been granted an additional 71 days of Pensionable Service
for each actual year of Pensionable Service in the BT Pension
Scheme or the Yell Pension Plan. The eﬀect of the enhancement
is that if he had continued accrual in the Yell Pension Plan until
his normal retirement date, John Condron’s forecasted total
Pensionable Service at age 60 would have been forty years.
As a result of changes in taxation of pensions after 5 April 2006,
John Condron chose to cease accruals in the Yell Pension Plan
after that date, although his pension and one-oﬀ cash sum remain
linked to his Final Pensionable Earnings at leaving, retirement 
or death. Since 5 April 2006, he has received cash payments of
27% of Basic Salary per annum; a rate calculated to be broadly
equivalent to Yell’s cost of his future beneﬁts had he continued
accrual in the Yell Pension Plan. The result is, therefore, cost-
neutral to the Company.
John Davis
John Davis is a member of Section 3 of the Yell Pension Plan. 
Until 5 April 2006, he was also a member of Section 1. Under
each of those Sections he accrued an annual pension of 1⁄60th
of his Final Pensionable Earnings up to the HMRC’s Earnings 
Cap for each year of Pensionable Service, giving a total accrual
of 1⁄30th each year. He was contractually entitled to a pension
based on uncapped pensionable salary for each year of service
under the Yell Pension Plan. As he was subject to the Earnings
Cap, the excess over the approved beneﬁt conferred under John
Davis’ contractual arrangement was provided on an unfunded,
unapproved basis.
As a result of changes in the taxation of pensions after 5 April
2006, John Davis chose to move his unapproved and Section 1
beneﬁts into Section 3 of the Yell Pension Plan and then cease
accruals in the Yell Pension Plan after that date, although his
pension remains linked to his Pension Scheme Salary at leaving,
retirement or death. Since 5 April 2006, he has received cash
payments of 48% of Basic Salary per annum. We have carefully
considered the position and are satisﬁed that this rate is broadly
equivalent to the cost to Yell of his future beneﬁts had he continued
accrual in the Yell Pension Plan. The result is, therefore, cost-neutral
for the Company.
Further details of John Condron’s and John Davis’ pension
beneﬁts can be found on page 41.
Annual bonus
Annual bonus arrangements are based on ﬁnancial and non-
ﬁnancial performance measures.
For the ﬁnancial year ended 31 March 2009 the executive directors
were eligible to earn a maximum annual bonus of 180% of base
salary. A proportion of any bonus awarded is paid in deferred
shares at all levels of performance. The proportion of deferred
shares increases as the level of bonus earned increases. Deferred
shares must be retained for a period of three years.
The table below summarises the proportion of cash and deferred
shares that would be earned for increasing levels of performance:
Cash Deferred shares Total
(as a % of salary) (as a % of salary) (as a % of salary)
Target performance 65% 20% 85%
Maximum 100% 80% 180%
Payment of annual bonus is subject to the achievement of
stretching performance requirements reﬂecting a combination 
of corporate and personal measures. The corporate targets are
based on EBITDA, revenue and cash ﬂow. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_39
Governance Our remuneration report
For the year ended 31 March 2009, the Committee noted that the
Company had delivered a strong EBITDA and cash performance
in very challenging economic circumstances. The Committee 
also acknowledged the operational success of the Group wide
restructuring which had helped to protect EBITDA and, as
importantly, had positioned Yell to respond strongly and quickly
to an improvement in trading conditions. 
The Company’s achievements in delivering strong growth in
internet usage, in maintaining very high levels of employee
satisfaction and commitment, and in securing continuing
recognition in sustainability indices were also noted.
However, notwithstanding that the Company’s ﬁnancial and 
non-ﬁnancial achievements in the reporting year justiﬁed a
bonus award, the executive directors notiﬁed the Committee 
that they wished to voluntarily waive any bonus award in light 
of the signiﬁcant impact on Yell people of the necessary, albeit
successful, restructuring programme. 
Accordingly, no bonus award was made to either of the executive
directors in respect of the reporting year.
Share options
Yell Group plc grants share options to John Condron and John
Davis under the Yell Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme.
Under the plan, options are granted to acquire Yell Group plc
shares. The exercise price of the options is equal to the market
value of the underlying Yell Group plc shares on the date the
options are granted.
In November 2008, John Condron and John Davis received option
grants with a market value equivalent to 200% of base salary.
This represented a reduction of 20% to the multiple granted in
previous years (250%). The reduction was implemented to take
into account investor views in light of the fall in Yell’s share price. 
Vesting of the options is subject to the achievement of the
following performance condition:
Options become exercisable if the ratio of net debt to adjusted
EBITDA is less than or equal to four by the end of the three-year
performance period. The options will lapse at the end of the
three-year performance period to the extent that the performance
condition is not satisﬁed. There is no provision for retesting.
The Remuneration Committee has conﬁrmed to shareholders that
in the event of any material changes to Yell’s capital structure, or
should the Committee wish to exercise any discretion as regards
the vesting of these awards, the Committee would consult with
major investors before the awards are vested.
We consider the debt reduction performance conditions to 
be, both, stretching, and, fully aligned with the Board’s priority
objective in the current environment. We will continue to review
performance conditions on an annual basis to ensure they are
appropriate and stretching. The Committee has conﬁrmed that
major investors will be consulted prior to the implementation 
of any future changes to performance conditions.
Further details of the options granted to John Condron and 
John Davis are shown on pages 42 and 43.
In November 2008, options granted to the executive directors in
November 2005 became due for vesting, subject to achievement
of the performance condition. The performance condition (EPS
growth, over the performance period, to exceed the growth in
RPI by 3% per annum) was met and, accordingly, 100% of the
options vested at an exercise price of £4.76.
Long-term Incentive Plan
John Condron and John Davis also received awards in November
2008 under the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP), to the value of
120% of base salary. This represented a 20% reduction in the
multiple applied to these grants in previous years (150%).
The 2008 award is subject to a relative TSR performance condition,
measured against an international comparator group of quoted
publishing companies. The amount of the award that ultimately
vests is dependent on where Yell Group plc is positioned within
the comparator group.
Yell Group plc’s performance % vesting
Below median 0%
Median 30%
Upper quartile 100%
If Yell Group plc is ranked between median and upper quartile
within the comparator group, the percentage of the award that
vests will be determined on a straight-line basis. To calculate 
the TSR performance, we use an average share price from the 
six-month period prior to the start of the measurement period
and an average share price based on the six-month period 
which ends on the last day of the measurement period. The
measurement period runs for three years from 1 April 2008. 
In November 2008, awards made to John Condron and John
Davis under the LTIP became due for vesting, subject to the
achievement of a TSR performance condition based on a FTSE
100 comparator group. At the end of the performance period,
the analysis showed that Yell was ranked 92nd (out of 100) 
and, therefore, the November 2005 LTIP award lapsed.
Further details of the awards made to John Condron and 
John Davis are shown on pages 42 and 43.
Other remuneration
The other elements of remuneration that our executive directors
receive are as follows:
• Participation in the ShareSave Plan
• Life assurance
• Private health cover
• Long-term disability insurance
• Provision of a car
• Telecommunications services
• Health club membership
• Allowance for personal tax and ﬁnancial advice
Our executive directors also receive reimbursement from the
Company for reasonable expenses incurred in the carrying out 
of their duties.
Shareholder alignment
A core principle of Yell’s executive remuneration policy is that our
reward packages should align the interests of executive directors
with those of our shareholders.
In the cases of John Condron and John Davis, this is achieved
through:
• Their substantial personal shareholdings which are comprised
of shares acquired at the time of Yell’s IPO (July 2003 – share
price £2.85) and in the open market (November 2007 – share
price £4.16). 40_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009
Our remuneration report continued
• Their participation in Yell’s long-term incentive plans which
require share price growth and the achievement of shareholder
value-related performance conditions in order to deliver beneﬁt
to the participants. The fall in Yell’s share price has signiﬁcantly
and adversely impacted the potential value of these awards.
Neither Mr Condron nor Mr Davis has exercised any executive
stock options granted since the date of Yell’s IPO (15 July 2003).
• The deferral of a proportion of annual bonus into shares. The
number of deferred shares awarded is based on the share price
at the date of grant. Therefore, a fall in the share price during
the deferral period will have the eﬀect of reducing the actual
value of the bonus award at the point of vesting. Since the
Deferred Bonus Plan was introduced in 2005, Mr Condron and
Mr Davis have received deferred share awards based on share
prices of £4.28, £4.90, £4.78 and 91 pence.
Minimum shareholding requirement
Executive directors are expected to maintain a minimum
shareholding requirement equivalent to 200% of base salary.
New directors will have a ﬁve-year period in which to build up
such a holding. As at the year end, John Davis’ shareholding 
was below this threshold. This is directly attributable to the fall 
in Yell’s share price. The Committee consider that no speciﬁc
action is needed in this regard given:
• The volatility surrounding Yell’s share price 
• Mr Davis’ substantial shareholding and long-term incentives
ensure his interests continue to be fully aligned with those of

(a) John Condron is a member of Section 2 of the Yell Pension Plan and prior to 5 April 2006 he accrued a pension of 1⁄80th of his Final Pensionable Earnings for
each year of Pensionable Service. In addition, he accrued a one-oﬀ cash sum of 3⁄80th of his Final Pensionable Earnings for each year of Pensionable Service.
As a result of changes in the taxation of pensions after 5 April 2006, John Condron chose to cease accrual in the Yell Pension Plan after that date, although 
his pension and cash sum remain linked to his Final Pensionable Earnings at leaving, retirement or death. Since 5 April 2006, he has received cash payments of
27% of Basic Salary per annum, a rate calculated to be broadly equivalent to Yell’s costs of his future beneﬁts had he continued accrual in the Yell Pension Plan.
(b) John Davis is a member of Section 3 of the Yell Pension Plan. Until 5 April 2006, he was also a member of Section 1. Under each of those Sections, he accrued an
annual pension of 1⁄60th of his Final Pensionable Earnings up to the HM Revenue and Custom’s Earnings Cap for each year of Pensionable Service (total accrual
of 1⁄30th each year). As he was subject to the Earnings Cap, John Davis also received part of this pension through an unfunded unapproved pension promise.
This increased his overall entitlement to 1⁄30th of his Pension Scheme Salary for each complete year of Pensionable Service and in proportion for a part year. 
To determine the transfer value of the unapproved pension we have used the standard cash equivalent transfer basis adopted by the Yell Pension Plan.
As a result of changes in the taxation of pensions after 5 April 2006, John Davis chose to move his unapproved and Section 1 beneﬁts into Section 3 of the 
Yell Pension Plan and then cease accrual in the Yell Pension Plan after that date, although his pension remains linked to his Pension Scheme Salary at leaving,
retirement or death. Since 5 April 2006, he has received cash payments of 48% of basic salary per annum; this rate has been calculated to be broadly equivalent
to Yell’s cost of his future beneﬁts had he continued accrual in the Yell Pension Plan.
(c) Net of member contributions. With eﬀect from 1 March 2005, both John Condron and John Davis participated in ‘SMART pensions’ . This is an option available 
to all members of the Yell Pension Plan, whereby members accept a reduction in their pay, in return for non-contributory membership. The reduction in each
member’s pay is equal to the contributions that the member would otherwise have paid. Yell’s contributions are increased by a corresponding amount.  42_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009

Yell Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme. These options were granted on ﬂotation. Options granted over shares with a value of three times salary 
will only be exercisable if the adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) over an initial three-year period is at least equal to RPI + 3% per annum at the end of the
period. If the target is not met, it may be retested at the end of the fourth year. Options granted over shares with a value of two times salary will only be
exercisable if the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) at the end of a three-year period exceeds the growth in the TSR of the companies making up
the FTSE 100. Options will be exercisable in full if the growth in the Company’s TSR would put the Company at the 25th position or higher (taken from the
top) of the FTSE 100. The proportion of options which may be exercised will be reduced on a straight-line basis to the 50th position of the FTSE 100, at
which point 25% of the options may be exercised. If the Company’s TSR at the end of the three-year period would place the Company below the 50th
position, no options will be exercisable.

Financial statements Auditors’ report
Independent auditors’ report to the members of Yell Group plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company ﬁnancial
statements (the ‘ﬁnancial statements’) of Yell Group plc for the
year ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the Group Income
Statement, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the
Group and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, the Group
Statement of Recognised Income and the related notes. These
ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in
the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having
been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the ﬁnancial statements
in accordance with applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This
report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with section
235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do
not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report 
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. The
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that speciﬁc
information presented in the Chairman’s Statement, the CEO’s
Strategic Overview, the Performance Review and governance and
responsibility that is cross referred from the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions 
of the Combined Code (2006) speciﬁed for our review by the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if
it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the eﬀectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial
statements. The other information comprises the Directors’
Report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Performance Review, 
the CEO’s Strategic Overview and governance and responsibility.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the directors in 
the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with suﬃcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• The Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of
the state of the Group’s aﬀairs as at 31 March 2009 and of its
proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year then ended.
• The parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent company’s aﬀairs
as at 31 March 2009 and cash ﬂows for the year then ended.
• The ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the
Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
• The information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent 
with the ﬁnancial statements.
Emphasis of matter – Going concern 
In forming our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements, which is not
qualiﬁed, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures
made in note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements concerning the ability
of the Company to continue as a going concern. There is a risk
that the Group may need to renegotiate its ﬁnancial covenants
with its lenders. If the Group needed to but were unable to 
agree amendments to the covenants and those covenants 
were breached, the syndicate of lenders would have the right to
demand, with a two-thirds majority vote, immediate repayment
of all amounts due to them. This right, together with other
remedies available to lenders, creates doubt about the future
capital funding of the Group. These conditions, along with the
other matters explained in note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements,
indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast
signiﬁcant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. The ﬁnancial statements do not include the
adjustments that would result if the company was unable to
continue as a going concern.

Financial statements Notes
1. Basis of preparation and consolidation,
accounting policies and critical accounting
estimates and judgements
Basis of preparation and consolidation
Yell Group plc (the Company) is a public limited company
incorporated, listed and domiciled in the UK.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation 
of ﬁnancial instruments (including derivative instruments) at 
fair value in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and
the Companies Act 1985. Accordingly, these ﬁnancial statements
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the
EU IAS Resolution. A summary of the more important Group
accounting policies is set out below.
‘The Group’ ﬁnancial statements consolidate the ﬁnancial
statements of the Company and all subsidiaries for the year
ended 31 March 2009.
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption available
under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and have not
presented an income statement for the Company alone.
Where the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiary undertakings do
not conform with the Group’s accounting policies, appropriate
adjustments are made on consolidation in order to present the
Group consolidated ﬁnancial statements on a consistent basis.
All signiﬁcant companies within the Yell Group during the period
of ownership have coterminous ﬁnancial years. All transactions
between the Group’s businesses have been eliminated in the
preparation of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The
results of companies and businesses acquired during the year 
are included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements from their
respective dates of acquisition.
Intra-group transactions, which have been eliminated on
consolidation of the Group, have not been disclosed, other 
than those shown in note 29, Related party transactions.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis. The Group is currently in full compliance with the ﬁnancial
covenants contained in all of its borrowing agreements.
However, as a consequence of the increasingly uncertain trading
conditions there is a risk that the Group would need to reset its
ﬁnancial covenants with its lenders. Details of our covenants 
and our management of the risks associated with meeting those
covenants are set out in our risk management disclosures that
begin on page 20.
If the Group were required but not able to agree amendments 
to the covenants such that undertakings to the Group’s lenders
were breached, then the syndicate of lenders would have the
right to demand immediate repayment of all amounts due to
them, but only after a two-thirds majority vote for such action. 
Whilst this eventuality would, if it arose, cast doubt on the future
capital funding of the Group, the Group’s cash ﬂow forecasts
show that in the year ahead interest payments will be fully 
met, with further cash generated to repay debt. For this reason
the directors believe that adopting the going concern basis in
preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements is appropriate. 
Nevertheless, the directors are making full disclosure, as required
by accounting standards, to indicate the existence of a material
uncertainty, which may cast signiﬁcant doubt about the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern. The ﬁnancial statements
do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group
was unable to continue as a going concern.
Brief details of principal subsidiary undertakings at each year
end, all of which are unlisted, are shown in note 15 to the
ﬁnancial statements.
Signiﬁcant accounting policies
(a) Revenue
Group revenue, after deduction of sales allowances, value 
added tax and other sales taxes, comprises the value of 
products provided by Group undertakings. Revenue from
classiﬁed directories and other directories, mainly comprising
advertising revenue, is recognised in the income statement 
upon completion of delivery to the users of the directories. 
Other revenue, principally from internet and voice products, 
is recognised from the point at which service is ﬁrst provided 
over the life of the contract.
(b) Cost of sales
Cost of sales are the costs incurred in developing directories 
and other Group products. Provisions for impairment of trade
receivables are also included within cost of sales.
(c) Advertising
The Group expenses the costs of advertising its own products
and services as the costs are incurred.
(d) Finance costs and income
Finance costs payable are charged as incurred using the 
eﬀective interest rate basis. Finance income is recognised 
on an accruals basis.
(e) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are transactions which by virtue of their
incidence, size, or combination of both are disclosed separately
in the notes to the ﬁnancial statements.

1. Basis of preparation and consolidation,
accounting policies and critical accounting
estimates and judgements continued
(f) Foreign currencies
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings
are translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates. The
results of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at
average rates of exchange for the year to the extent that these
rates approximate the actual rates.
Exchange diﬀerences arising from the retranslation at period-end
exchange rates of the net investment in foreign undertakings,
and on borrowings designated as hedges of such investments,
are taken to equity through the statement of recognised income
and expense.
All other exchange gains or losses are dealt with through the
income statement.
(g) Goodwill
Goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings
represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration
over the fair value of the net assets. Goodwill arising on
acquisitions is capitalised and is subject to impairment review,
both annually and when there are indications that the carrying
value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses.
(h) Other non-current intangible assets
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed 
to the assets and liabilities acquired. These net assets may
include software development costs, brand names, non-compete
agreements, contracts, customer commitments and customer
relationships, all of which are recorded as intangible assets 
and held at cost less accumulated amortisation. Software is
amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life,
which does not generally exceed four years. Brand names are
amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic
lives, which do not exceed forty years. Non-compete agreements
are amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the
agreement. Contracts are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the contract. Customer commitments are
amortised as the directories to which the commitments relate 
are published. Customer relationships are amortised on a basis
that takes into account the estimated customer retention 
rate at the date of acquisition. The useful economic lives of
customer relationships do not generally exceed eight years. 
The amortisation period and method are reviewed and adjusted,
if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
(i) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less
depreciation. Cost comprises the purchase price and any other
costs of bringing an asset into use. Depreciation is provided on
property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis from the
time they are available for use, so as to write oﬀ their costs over
their estimated useful economic lives taking into account any
expected residual values.
Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives 
and residual values of individual productive assets and adjusted
prospectively, if appropriate, taking account of commercial and
technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear.
The estimated lives assigned to property, plant and equipment are:
Buildings 10 – 40 years 
Leasehold improvements 5 years or life of lease if less than 
5 years 
Office equipment 2 – 6 years 
Land Not depreciated 
(j) Asset impairment
Assets with indeﬁnite useful lives are not subject to amortisation
and instead are tested for impairment on an annual basis and
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets subject 
to amortisation are tested for impairment when an event that
might aﬀect asset values has occurred. An impairment loss is
recognised to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be
recovered either by selling the asset or by the discounted future
earnings from operating the assets.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped 
at the lowest level for which there are separately identiﬁable
cash ﬂows (cash generating units, or CGUs). Where assets do not
generate independent cash ﬂows and their carrying value cannot
be attributed to a particular CGU, CGUs are grouped together at
the level at which these assets reside, and the carrying value of
this group of CGUs is compared to the recoverable amount of
that particular group. The recoverable amount is the higher 
of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and value in use.
If an impairment loss is recognised for a CGU, it is allocated 
to reduce the carrying amounts of the assets of the unit in 
the following order:
i) First, to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated
to the CGU; and
ii) Then, to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis 
of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU
If an asset’s fair value less costs to sell exceeds its carrying
amount before the impairment test of a CGU, then none of the
impairment loss arising on the impairment test is allocated to
that asset.
(k) Investments
The carrying value of the investments in subsidiary undertakings
in the ﬁnancial statements of the Company is based upon a
valuation at 31 March 2003. Under the transition rules of IFRS 1,
this carrying value is deemed to be cost and is subject to the
policy on asset impairment. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_51
Financial statements Notes
Any impairment would be charged to the income statement
account to the extent that it is not covered by amounts previously
credited to shareholders’ equity through the revaluation surplus.
(l) Leased assets
Rentals in respect of operating leases, under which substantially
all the beneﬁts and risks of ownership remain with the lessor, are
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
life of the lease.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases where substantially all the
beneﬁts and risks of ownership are transferred to the Group are
capitalised in property, plant and equipment at the present value
of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease term
and depreciated over the shorter of their useful economic lives 
or the lease term. The capital element of the future obligations
under the leases is included as a liability in the consolidated
balance sheets, classiﬁed as appropriate as a payable due within
or after one year. Lease payments are split between capital and
interest elements using the interest rate implicit in the lease.
Interest is charged to the income statement.
(m) Inventories
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Inventory comprises paper stocks.
(n) Directories in development
The cost of directories in development is recognised as a 
current intangible asset where the costs directly attributable 
to the development of the directory can be measured reliably.
When directories are launched on a non-paid basis the costs 
are expensed as incurred. The development costs mainly
comprise the direct costs of certain personnel dedicated to
developing adverts and creating the content for directories,
certain customer commitments in acquired businesses, artwork
and other directory production and development costs, including
appropriate and directly attributable overheads. The asset is
amortised to cost of sales on completion of delivery of the
relevant directory when the related revenue is recognised.
(o) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value. A provision
for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect 
all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The provision is calculated by estimating future cash ﬂows from
trade receivables on the basis of historical loss experience.
(p) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash in hand, bank deposits
repayable on demand, and other short-term highly liquid readily
convertible into cash investments with original maturities of
three months or less.
(q) Borrowings
All borrowings are initially stated at the fair value of consideration
received after deduction of issue costs. Borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortised cost. Issue costs are charged to the income
statement together with the coupon, as ﬁnance costs, on a
constant-yield basis over the term of the borrowings, or over a
shorter period where the lender can require earlier repayment.
(r) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares
or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from
the proceeds.
The shares held in an ESOP Trust for employees until issued are
presented as Treasury shares in the Group balance sheet. Where
the Trust or any Group company purchases the Company’s equity
share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, including
any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes),
is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued
or disposed.
(s) Employee beneﬁts
The Group expenses employee beneﬁts as employees render the
services that give rise to the beneﬁts in accordance with IAS 19
Employee Beneﬁts.
The Group currently operates a deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
scheme for its UK employees employed before 1 October 2001
and operates deﬁned contribution pension schemes for its UK
employees employed subsequent to 1 October 2001 and its US
employees. There are no pension schemes currently in place 
for Yell Publicidad employees.
All pension schemes are independent of the Group’s ﬁnances.
Actuarial valuations of the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme are carried
out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than
three years, the rates of contribution payable and the pension
cost being determined on the advice of the actuaries, having
regard to the results of these valuations. In any intervening
years, the actuaries review the continuing appropriateness 
of the contribution rates.
The balance sheet includes the surplus or deﬁcit in the deﬁned
beneﬁt scheme taking assets at their year-end market values 
and liabilities at their actuarially calculated values discounted 
at the year-end AA corporate bond interest rates. The cost of
beneﬁts accruing during the year in respect of current and past
service is charged against operating proﬁt. The expected return
on the schemes’ assets and the increase in the present value 
of the schemes’ liabilities arising from the passage of time are
included in other ﬁnance costs or income. Actuarial gains and
losses on pension schemes are recognised immediately in the
statement of recognised income and expense.
Payments to the Group’s deﬁned contribution schemes are
charged against proﬁt as incurred. 52_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009
Notes continued
1. Basis of preparation and consolidation,
accounting policies and critical accounting
estimates and judgements continued
(t) Employee share schemes
The fair value of employee share-based payments is calculated
using the Black-Scholes model. In accordance with IFRS 2 Share
Based Payments, the resulting cost is charged against income
over the vesting period of the awards. The value of the charge is
adjusted to reﬂect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
When the ESOP trust acquires and holds shares of the Company,
the Group presents them as a deduction (treasury shares) in
arriving at equity shareholders’ funds. We account for the
issuance of treasury shares on a ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out basis.
(u) Taxation
The charge (credit) for taxation is based on the proﬁt (loss) 
for the year and takes into account deferred taxation where
transactions or events give rise to temporary diﬀerences between
the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting
purposes. Provision is made in full for deferred tax liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against
which the beneﬁt can be realised.
Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid 
or recovered under the tax rates that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax 
is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
periods in which the temporary diﬀerences are expected to
reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
No provision is made for unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries or temporary diﬀerences relating to investments 
in subsidiaries where realisation of such diﬀerences can be
controlled and is not probable in the foreseeable future.
(v) Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and the fair value is
subsequently remeasured at the year end. The method of
recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the
nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain
derivatives as either:
• Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities 
or a ﬁrm commitment (fair value hedges).
• Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions 
(cash ﬂow hedges).
• Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
(net investment hedges).
We have not designated any derivatives as fair value hedges.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as fair value
hedges would be recorded in the income statement, together
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability
that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The eﬀective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives
that are designated and qualify as a cash ﬂow hedge is recognised
in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineﬀective portion is
recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts
accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in
the period when the hedged item aﬀects income (for instance,
when the forecast transaction that is hedged takes place).
Foreign currency borrowings are used as hedges for net
investments in foreign operations. Any gain or loss on foreign
currency borrowings used as a hedge is recognised in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity for hedges of net investments 
are recycled when the underlying investment is disposed of.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments
for speculative purposes. Changes in the fair value of any
derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting
would be recognised immediately in the income statement.
(w) Minority interests
Transactions with minority interests are accounted for as
transactions with equity owners of the Group. For purchases
from minority interests, the diﬀerence between any consideration
paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of the
net assets of the subsidiary is deducted from equity.
(x) Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid. Final
dividends are recognised when they are approved by shareholders.
(y) Contingent liabilities
Through the normal course of business, Yell is involved in 
legal disputes, the settlement of which may involve cost to 
the Group. These costs are accrued when payment is probable
and associated costs can be reliably estimated. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_53
Financial statements Notes
Critical accounting estimates and
judgements
In general, our accounting policies under IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union are consistent with those generally adopted
by others operating within the same industry in the UK.
In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, our
management has made its best estimates and judgements of
certain amounts included in the ﬁnancial statements, giving due
consideration to materiality. We regularly review these estimates
and update them when required. Actual results could diﬀer from
these estimates. Unless otherwise indicated, we do not believe
there is a great likelihood that materially diﬀerent amounts
would be reported related to the accounting policies described
below. We consider the following to be a description of the most
signiﬁcant estimates, which require our management to make
subjective and complex judgements, and matters that are
inherently uncertain.
(a) Acquisitions
When acquiring a business, we have to make judgements and
best estimates about the fair value allocation of the purchase
price. We seek appropriate competent and professional advice
before making any such allocations. We test the valuation of
goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. These tests require the use of estimates. See note 11.
(b) Allowance for doubtful debts
Receivables are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may
become uncollectable in the future. We continuously monitor
collections and payments from our customers and maintain a
provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical
experience and any speciﬁc customer collection issues that 
we have identiﬁed. We have demonstrated the ability to make
reasonable and reliable estimates of allowances for doubtful
accounts based on signiﬁcant historical experience. A sensitivity
analysis is presented on page 24.
(c) Economic lives of other non-current intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment
Other non-current intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment are long-lived assets that are amortised over their
useful lives. Useful lives are based on management’s estimates 
of the period over which the assets will generate revenue. The
values of property, plant, equipment and assets with indeﬁnite
lives are reviewed annually for impairment. Other non-current
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount
may not be recoverable and at the end of the ﬁrst full year
following acquisition. Historically, we have not reduced the value
of any assets as a result of the impairment analyses, nor have we
realised large gains or losses on disposals of other non-current
intangible assets or property, plant and equipment. A sensitivity
analysis is presented on page 24.
(d) Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment or whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts may not be recoverable and at the end of the ﬁrst full
year following acquisition. The carrying value of our operations
is compared to their estimated recoverable values to determine
whether goodwill is impaired. The recoverable value is estimated
from a discounted cash ﬂow model that relies on signiﬁcant key
assumptions, including after-tax cash ﬂows forecasted over an
extended period of years, terminal growth rates and discount
rates. We use published statistics or seek advice where possible
when determining the assumptions we use. Details of the
Group’s impairment reviews and sensitivities to changes in
assumptions are disclosed in note 11 on page 62.
(e) Estimated pension obligations
The determination of our obligation and expense for pensions 
is dependent on the selection of assumptions that are used by
our actuaries in calculating such amounts. Those assumptions
are described in note 23 and include, amongst others, the rate 
at which future pension payments are discounted to the balance
sheet date, inﬂation expectations, the expected long-term rate 
of return on plan assets and average expected increase in
compensation over and above inﬂation. Whilst we believe that
our assumptions are appropriate, signiﬁcant diﬀerences in our
actual experience or signiﬁcant changes in our assumptions can 
materially aﬀect the amount of our future pension obligations,
future valuation adjustments in the statement of total recognised
gains and losses and our future employee expenses.
We value the portfolio of assets held by the deﬁned beneﬁt
pension scheme in the UK at market value when calculating 
our net pension deﬁcit. Values will increase and decrease as
markets rise and fall. The trustees and management have an
agreed strategy to mitigate the risk of having insuﬃcient funds, 
if markets fall. See note 23.
(f) Tax beneﬁts and obligations
The determination of our obligation and expense for taxes requires
an interpretation of tax law. We seek appropriate competent
and professional tax advice before making any judgements on
tax matters. Whilst we believe that our judgements are prudent
and appropriate, signiﬁcant diﬀerences in our actual experience
may materially aﬀect our future tax charges. We recognise
deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing diﬀerences
where we have a taxable beneﬁt or obligation in the future 
as a result of past events. We record deferred tax assets to 
the extent that we believe they are more likely than not to 
be realised. Should we determine in the future that we would 
be able to realise deferred tax assets in excess of our recorded
amount or that our liabilities are diﬀerent to the amounts 
we recorded, then we would increase or decrease income 
as appropriate in the period such determination was made.
(g) Accrued costs of settling lawsuits in the US
The determination of our obligation and expense for the
exceptional lawsuits was based on management’s best 
estimates after taking into consideration appropriate advice 
from legal experts. See note 28. 54_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009

1. Basis of preparation and consolidation,
accounting policies and critical accounting
estimates and judgements continued
Standards, interpretations and 
amendments to published standards 
that are not yet eﬀective
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to
existing standards have been published that are mandatory for
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2009 or later
periods but which the Group has chosen not to adopt early. The
new standards that could be relevant to the Group’s operations
are as follows:
IFRIC 14, IAS 19 – Limit on deﬁned beneﬁt asset and minimum
funding requirements and their interaction
IFRIC 14 provides guidance on the amount of pension scheme
surpluses that companies can include as a deﬁned beneﬁt 
asset in their balance sheets and when a funding requirement,
including the UK scheme speciﬁc funding, may give rise to
additional liabilities. We do not believe that implementation 
of this standard and IFRIC will aﬀect our consolidated results 
or cash ﬂows.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation
IFRIC 16 provides guidance on identifying the foreign currency risks
that qualify as a hedged risk in the hedge of a net investment in
a foreign operation. We do not believe that implementation of
this IFRIC will aﬀect our consolidated results or cash ﬂows.
IFRS 3 Business combinations (revised) 
The standard continues to apply the acquisition method 
to business combinations, with some signiﬁcant changes. 
For example, all payments to purchase a business are to 
be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with some
contingent payments subsequently remeasured at fair value
through income. Goodwill may be calculated based on the
parent’s share of net assets or it may include goodwill related 
to the minority interest. All transaction costs will be expensed.
These changes will aﬀect how the Group reports acquisitions 
but will not be eﬀective until such time as it makes any. The
Group’s accounting policy on acquisitions will require a change
to reﬂect the standard.
Standards, interpretations and 
amendments to published standards 
that are not yet eﬀective and which 
the Group considers will not have any
application to how the Group reports
IAS 23 – Applies to the capitalisation of borrowing costs directly
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a
qualifying asset
IAS 27 – Reporting eﬀect of transactions with non-controlling
interests
IAS 32 & 1 – Amendments to treatment of puttable options 
and some instruments that impose an obligation to deliver 
to another party a pro rata share of net assets on liquidation
IFRIC 12 – Gives guidance on the accounting by operators for
public-to-private service concession arrangements
IFRIC 13 – Applies to all entities that issue award credits as part 
of a sales transaction, including awards that can be redeemed
for goods or services supplied by other parties
IFRIC 15 – Applies to the accounting for revenue and associated
expenses by entities that undertake the construction of real
estate directly or through subcontractors
IFRIC 17 – Gives guidance on how an entity should account 
for distributions of non-cash assets to its owners
IFRIC 18 – Applies to the accounting for transfers of items of
property, plant and equipment by entities that receive such
transfers from their customers
IFRS 1 and IAS 27 – Amendment to deﬁnition of cost method 
and allows ﬁrst-time adopters to use a deemed cost of either 
fair value or the carrying amount under previous accounting
practice to measure the initial cost of investments
IFRS 2 amended – Clariﬁes treatment of cancellations and the
deﬁnition of vesting conditions
IAS 1 (revised) – Amends the presentation of movements in 
non-owner changes in equity Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_55

2. Segmental analysis and management reporting
The Group is a publisher of classiﬁed advertising directories in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), Spain and Latin America
and revenue is principally derived from the sale of advertising in such publications. Our primary reporting segment is based on the
management structure of the Group, which also approximates the geographical location of where these entities operate. Segmental
information is provided below in respect of UK (Yell UK and Adworks businesses), US (Yellowbook) and Spain (Yell Publicidad, including
Latin America). The geographical analysis is stated on the basis of origin of operations, although it would not be diﬀerent had it been
stated on the basis of customer origin. The Group manages geographically its trading operations and working capital down to EBITDA
and centrally manages its group taxation and capital structure, including net equity and net debt.

8. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares
in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two classes of dilutive potential
ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the
ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Group’s Long-term Incentive Plan.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs), each of which comprises all
the operations based within a country.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on
value-in-use calculations. These calculations use after-tax cash ﬂow projections based on ﬁnancial plans approved by management
covering a ﬁve-year period in developed markets and longer in underdeveloped markets reﬂecting the need to develop brand awareness
and to increase market penetration. Cash ﬂows beyond the periods of the approved plans are extrapolated using the long-term growth
rates stated below. The carrying value of goodwill after impairments and the key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations were

The value-in-use calculations are sensitive to changes in the long-term growth rates and discount rates. The long-term growth rates
used are consistent with the forecasts of long-term national growth rates included in industry reports. The discount rates used are based
on estimated weighted average costs of capital in each country before tax and reﬂect speciﬁc risks relating to the relevant segments.
During the year ended 31 March 2009, impairment losses of £1,103.9 million, £120.1 million, £40.8 million and £7.5 million on goodwill
in relation to our operations in Spain, Chile, Argentina and Peru, respectively, were determined during our tests for impairment. There
was no impairment of goodwill in 2008. Financial plans for all our operations were reduced during the 2009 tests of impairment to
reﬂect the ever deepening economic recessions in Europe and the US and expectations for the recession to spread to Latin America.
This reduction was the main cause of the impairments in Spain and Chile. The goodwill in relation to Argentina would not have been
impaired had the discount rate applied to that operation not been adjusted to reﬂect speciﬁc risks in that country. The goodwill in
relation to Peru would not have been impaired had the terminal growth rate applied to that operation not been adjusted to reﬂect
the more cautious outlook we have taken in all jurisdictions. At 31 March 2009 the fair values of our operations in Spain, Chile,
Argentina and Peru equalled their carrying values and consequently any adverse change in a key assumption with all other
assumptions held unchanged would cause recognition of further impairment losses.
At 31 March 2009, the calculated recoverable value of the operations in the UK and US would have to decrease by 49% and 15%
before the associated goodwill would be impaired. Impairment in the US could occur if the terminal growth rates and annual growth
rates in the plan all fell by at least 1.1 percentage points or if the discount rate increased by at least 1.7 percentage points. Results in
the UK would have to be in signiﬁcant permanent decline before the associated goodwill would be impaired and any change in the
estimated UK weighted average costs of capital of the magnitude needed to cause impairment would be oﬀset by other factors. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_63

(a) The fair value of trade and other receivables, cash at bank and in hand, and trade and other payables approximated their carrying value due to the short
maturity of the instruments.
There are no material monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling, US dollars, euros and 
Latin American currencies (Chile, Peru and Argentina).
Movements in the fair values of derivative ﬁnancial instruments designated as cash ﬂow hedges (to the extent they are eﬀective) 
are recognised in equity and will be recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedged transactions are settled.
Borrowings in currencies other than pounds sterling are hedges of investments in foreign operations (net investment hedges).
Movements in the fair value of these ﬁnancial instruments (to the extent they are eﬀective) are recognised in equity. The fair value of
loans is split by currency as follows: GBP £676.8 million (2008 – £1,100.0 million); US dollars £1,097.1 million (2008 – £1,220.5 million);
Euro; £611.5 million (2008 – £815.8 million); total £2,385.4 million (2008 – £3,136.3 million). The cash ﬂow hedges are linked to the
interest on the external borrowings whose maturity proﬁles are shown below.
The ineﬀective portion of interest rate hedges and foreign exchange hedges recognised in the income statement for the year ended 
31 March 2009 amounted to £nil (2008 – £nil). There was no ineﬀectiveness to be recorded from net investment in foreign entity hedges.

Borrowing facilities and liquidity risk
We manage our liquidity requirements by the use of both short- and long-term cash ﬂow forecasts. The Group has maintained
committed banking facilities to mitigate any liquidity risk it may face. There were committed senior debt facilities at 31 March 2009
and 2008 of £400 million, of which £40.3 million had been drawn down at 31 March 2009 (2008 – £70.0 million). Details of related
debt covenants and the management of the risks associated with meeting those covenants are set out in our risk management
disclosures that begin on page 20.
The following table analyses the contractual undiscounted cash ﬂows payable (calculated using forward/spot interest rates); the
carrying values and the fair values of Group borrowings at the balance sheet date. The Group also has short-term receivables and
payables that arise in the normal course of business and these are not included in the following table. Any cash ﬂows based on
ﬂoating rate interest are based on interest rates prevailing at 31 March in the relevant year. All derivative amounts are shown gross,
although amounts are settled net wherever possible. The fair values of borrowings are based on clean market prices at year end or,
where these are not available, on the quoted prices of comparable debt issued by other companies.

(b) The critical terms of all the Group’s interest rate swaps precisely match the terms of the underlying ﬂoating rate debt obligations. The Group’s interest rate swaps
are designated as cash ﬂow hedges and accordingly amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income and cash ﬂow statements at the same time as the
interest is recognised and paid on the underlying hedged debt. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_71

17. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities
The Group’s approach to management of ﬁnancial risks together with sensitivity analysis is set out on pages 20 to 24.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging future ﬂoating interest rate movements on its term bank
debt. The Group has ﬁxed interest rates on around 97% of the interest rate exposure on the indebtedness under the senior credit
facilities using interest rate swaps over the period to September 2010 and around 50% thereafter to March 2011. The Group has also
entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge known cross border cash ﬂows early in the next ﬁnancial year.
The hedges give rise to the following balances reported on the balance sheets:

(a) The fair values of the derivative ﬁnancial instruments are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing
parties, other than in forced liquidation or sale.
(b) The gross notional amount of interest rate swaps was £14.6 billion ﬁxing rates on average for 170 days (2008 – £15.4 billion ﬁxing rates on average for 203 days)
and the gross notional amount of foreign exchange contracts was £33.4 million (2008 – £10.8 million).
The carrying value of the above derivative ﬁnancial instruments equals their fair value. Fair values are determined by using market
data and the use of established estimation techniques such as discounted cash ﬂow and option valuation models.
The maximum exposure to credit risk relating to derivative ﬁnancial instruments at the reporting date is the fair value of the
derivative assets in the balance sheet.
The Group has reviewed all its material contracts for embedded derivatives, for which separate accounting would be required, and
has concluded that there are no material embedded derivatives.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and generally have terms of between thirty days and ten months. Due to their short
maturities and the non-interest bearing nature of these ﬁnancial assets, the fair value of trade and other receivables approximates
their book value. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable mentioned
above. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large,
geographically diverse and unrelated. The Group does not hold any collateral as security. 72_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009

The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade receivables and accrued income are stated after deducting a provision of £205.4 million at 
31 March 2009 (2008 – £199.6 million) for doubtful debts and sales allowances. The carrying amount of the Company’s receivable from
group undertakings is stated after deducting a provision of £22.2 million at 31 March 2009 (2008 – £nil). A provision for uncollectible
trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according
to the original terms of the receivables. The provision is calculated by estimating future cash ﬂows from trade receivables on the 
basis of historical loss experience. A receivable is written oﬀ against the provision when it is believed to be entirely uncollectible. Any
monies recovered subsequent to write oﬀ are recorded as adjustments to the bad debt provision and considered in the local historical
loss experience.
The movements in the provision for doubtful debts were as follows for the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008:

The Company has no trade receivables.
Trade receivables can become impaired, generally when customers are in ﬁnancial distress, before being considered uncollectible.
Trade receivables are considered impaired only after completion of collection processes designed locally to collect monies from slow
payers or, if earlier, when amounts are more than one year past due. At 31 March 2009, the carrying value and estimated recoverable
amount of trade receivables past due and impaired was £1.1 million (2008 – £4.2 million), after deducting the related provision of
£77.3 million (2008 – £59.3 million) for doubtful debts. The ageing analysis of the £78.4 million (2008 – £63.4 million) gross trade
receivables past due and impaired is as follows:

The impaired gross receivable of £672.9 million in the Company is not considered to be past due. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_73
Financial statements Notes
At 31 March 2009, gross trade receivables of £264.4 million (2008 – £201.2 million) were past due but not impaired. The ageing
analysis of these gross trade receivables is as follows:
At 31 March

Over nine months past due 20.1 15.5
264.4 201.2
The credit quality of trade receivables past due but not impaired is assessed using a statistical approach to determine the historical
allowance rate for each ageing tranche. This allowance rate is then applied to the debt tranches at the end of the reporting period
and a provision for doubtful debts recognised. As at 31 March 2009, £95.0 million (2008 – £91.2 million) of the total provision for
doubtful debts related to trade receivables that are past due but not impaired.

Inventories comprise paper stocks of £14.9 million (2008 – £10.2 million) which are recognised in expense when books are completed.
The cost of paper recognised as expense and included in cost of sales amounted to £136.4 million (2008 – £136.8 million).

21. Loans, other borrowings and net debt
We manage the capital requirements of the Group by maintaining leverage of the Group within the terms of our debt Facility
Agreement. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• To safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and
beneﬁts for other stakeholders.
• To provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it 
in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust 
the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue 
new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.
Under the Articles of Association, the directors are required to ensure that the total of all amounts borrowed by group companies do
not exceed ﬁve times capital and reserves. This ratio is currently exceeded following the signiﬁcant goodwill impairment during the
year. Resolutions to authorise the exceeding of this restriction in the Articles will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Consistently with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the debt-to-proﬁt ratio. This ratio is calculated as
net debt ÷ proﬁt. Net debt is calculated as total debt (as shown in the balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted proﬁt 
is deﬁned by lending institutions in our Facilities Agreement.
The terms of the Facilities Agreement require the Group to maintain better than speciﬁed consolidated ﬁnancial ratios for net total debt
to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA as deﬁned in the Facilities Agreement, including a pro forma
adjustment to the EBITDA for acquisitions of less than one year) and EBITDA to net cash interest payable. These ﬁnancial ratios have
to be prepared for the preceding twelve-month period and reported to the lenders under the Facilities Agreement on a quarterly basis.
Details of these ratios and the management of the risks associated with meeting the requirements are set out in our risk management
disclosures that begin on page 20. 74_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009

Yell Pension Plan (YPP) – Deﬁned beneﬁt sections
There are three deﬁned beneﬁt sections of the YPP , which have been closed to new entrants since 1 October 2001. The scheme oﬀers
both pensions in retirement and death beneﬁts to members. The full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2008 updated to 31 March 2009
showed an obligation of £21.9 million. Pension beneﬁts are based on years of qualifying service and ﬁnal pensionable salary.

As the scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost per employee member will increase as the members of the scheme
approach retirement. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_77
Financial statements Notes
The level of contributions is based on the current service costs and the expected future cash ﬂows of the scheme. The Group is required
to agree its contributions to the plan with the trustees based on actuarial advice. Such agreement must be reached in a way which
complies with the UK Pensions Regulator’s ‘Scheme Speciﬁc Funding’ guidance. Any failure to agree would result in the intervention 
of the Pensions Regulator and, possibly, an imposed settlement. The Group made contributions for the twenty-one month period
ended 31 December 2008 at the agreed rate of 23.6% of pensionable earnings. Subsequent to 31 December 2008, the Group agreed
to increase the contribution rate to 29.8% of pensionable earnings (inclusive of expenses and life assurance premiums, but exclusive
of the Pension Protection Fund levy). Additionally, with eﬀect from 1 January 2009, the Group agreed to pay contributions totalling
£58 million, spread equally over ﬁfty-one monthly payments, to repair the deﬁcit of £47.6 million (plus interest) reported in the full
actuarial funding valuation at 5 April 2008. The next evaluation of future contribution rates will be after the next full funding
valuation, which is expected to have an eﬀective date of 5 April 2011.
Contributions of £16.5 million (2008 – £15.4 million), plus £2.8 million (2008 – £0.9 million) in respect of beneﬁt augmentations 
were made in the year. Plan participants may accept a reduction in their salary in return for non-contributory membership of the
Plan, the reduction being equal to the contributions otherwise payable. The Group makes contributions of a corresponding amount,
which have been included in the numbers above. In the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008, these amounted to £2.5 million (5.4%
of pensionable earnings) and £2.8 million (5.3% of pensionable earnings), respectively. Total contributions in ﬁnancial year 2010 are
expected to be around £36 million.
Valuation assumptions
The YPP net obligation at 31 March 2009, was based on the valuation at 5 April 2008 updated to 31 March 2009 and the net surplus
at 31 March 2008 was based on the valuation at 5 April 2005 updated to 31 March 2008. The updated valuations carried out by
professionally qualiﬁed independent actuaries used the following key assumptions:
At 31 March

Discount rate 6.7 6.7
Expected rate of return on assets 5.3 6.3
Salary increases 4.8 5.1
Pension increases 3.3 3.6
Inflation rate 3.3 3.6
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice from published statistics. The average life expectancy 
(in years) on retirement at age sixty of a member currently aged forty-ﬁve is as follows:
At 31 March
Years 2009 2008
Male 28.7 26.5
Female 30.3 29.4
The average life expectancy (in years) on retirement at age sixty of a member currently aged sixty is as follows:
At 31 March
Years 2009 2008
Male 27.0 25.5
Female 28.8 28.3
The assumptions used above may need to be adjusted in the future to take into account a full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2011. 
Any such changes could materially aﬀect the estimated liabilities of the scheme and future contribution rates. 78_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009

Assets
The YPP assets are held in separate trustee-administered funds that are invested in UK and overseas equities, property, debt securities
and inﬂation swaps.
The trustees of the scheme are required to act in the best interest of the scheme’s beneﬁciaries. The appointment of trustees to the
scheme is determined by the Group in accordance with the scheme’s trust documentation, as modiﬁed by UK statute. An independent
professional trustee and three other trustees are appointed by the Group. Three further trustees are elected by the active members.
Asset values will increase and decrease as markets rise and fall. The trustees and management have an agreed strategy to mitigate
the risk of having insuﬃcient funds if markets fall. The trustees annually match the low-risk asset portfolio against the cash outﬂows
for the following twelve years. Against longer-term cash payouts they match a combination of investments in inﬂation swaps to
mitigate inﬂation risk, and higher risk assets to get higher rates of growth. The trustees also work with management to ensure
suﬃcient assets will be available to settle obligations extending beyond the horizon of twelve years.
The trustees have set their asset allocation approach to split the portfolio into ‘pre-horizon’ and ‘post-horizon’ categories. The 
‘pre-horizon’ assets are all debt securities and at 31 March 2009 comprised around 25% (2008 – 20%) of the total assets. The 
‘post-horizon’ assets have allocation targets of 60% equities, 10% property and 30% inﬂation swaps.
The expected rates of return of each asset type in the YPP are set by reference to yields available on government bonds at the
measurement date and appropriate risk margins, and are stated net of expected administration expenses and the expected levy 
to the UK Pension Protection Fund. The assets and the annual expected rates of return were:

Liabilities
The present value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash ﬂows 
to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit method. The projected unit method is an accrued beneﬁts valuation method 
in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings. Changes in the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities

Present value of defined benefit liabilities at 31 March 296.2 294.9
The actuarial losses in the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008 were primarily the result of an increase in the estimated real interest
rate (the reference market rate to which the discount rate is tied, net of expected inﬂation interest in the market price of certain
government debt) during the year. In the year ended 31 March 2009, this was partially oﬀset by an increase in the estimated longevity
of members.
The accumulated beneﬁt obligation is an alternative actuarial measure of the present value of beneﬁts for service already rendered.
This measure diﬀers from the projected unit method in that it allows for deferred pension increases instead of future salary increases
and, therefore, measures the obligations as if the employees were no longer able to earn beneﬁts from future service. At 31 March
2009, the accumulated beneﬁt obligation was £271.2 million or £3.1 million less than scheme assets.
The proﬁle of expected undiscounted payments by the scheme for beneﬁts earned up to 31 March 2009 is as follows:
Payments in millions
The Group estimates that the average duration of these cash ﬂows, representing the weighted average term to payment of the
undiscounted beneﬁt payments, is 37 years.
The cost of settling all scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date by buying out beneﬁts with a suitable insurer will generally be
higher than the present value of scheme liabilities, because an insurer would expect to charge a premium for the risks that would 
be passed to them. The Group estimates that the amount required to settle the scheme’s liabilities with an insurance company at 
31 March 2009 would have been around £498 million, which is around £224 million more than the value of plan assets.

Sensitivity analysis
The present value of pension liabilities at 31 March 2009 was calculated on the basis that the real interest rate at the balance 
sheet date was 3.4%, which is the diﬀerence between the discount rate and expected inﬂation. The discount rate and expected
inﬂation are determined by reference to speciﬁc types of debt instruments being traded in the open market. Increasing or decreasing 
the assumed real interest rate to 3.5% or 3.3% per annum, respectively, would decrease or increase the present value of pension
liabilities by approximately £7 million. The eﬀect on the market value of assets cannot be estimated because the values of the
scheme’s investments do not always change in line with changes in real interest rates.
The present value of pension liabilities was determined on assumed life expectancies for men and women as set out in the
assumptions above. We estimate that an increase in life expectancy of one year for all members could have increased the present
value of pension liabilities by approximately £5 million.
The present value of pension liabilities was determined on the basis of a 1.5% expected average increase in salaries above inﬂation.
Increasing or decreasing the rate of assumed salary increases to 1.6% or 1.4% per annum, respectively, could have increased or
decreased the present value of pension liabilities by approximately £2 million.
Deﬁned contribution schemes
In addition to the deﬁned contribution Section Four and Section Five of the YPP , Yellowbook sponsors a 401(k) plan for the majority 
of Yellowbook employees in the US. The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and/or after-tax income 
in accordance with speciﬁed guidelines. Yellowbook matches a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. 
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of Yellowbook in an independently administered fund.
The pension cost in respect of these schemes represents contributions payable to the funds and amounted to £5.1 million in the 
year ended 31 March 2009 (2008 – £4.6 million) for the Yellowbook scheme, and £2.9 million (2008 – £2.5 million) for Section Four
and Section Five of the YPP . Outstanding contributions amounted to £1.0 million at 31 March 2009 (2008 – £nil). Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_81

Acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 2009
In the year ended 31 March 2009, the Yell Group acquired 100% of the Adworks businesses in the UK, US, Spain and India for 
£8.7 million in August 2008, and two in-ﬁll acquisitions in the US for a total of $2.3 million (£1.5 million). Details of the consolidated

All the acquisitions were purchased largely by drawing on the revolving credit facility and current cash ﬂows. The consolidated ﬁnancial
information of the Yell Group consolidates the ﬁnancial results of the Adworks businesses for the period from 16 August 2008 to 
31 March 2009. It is estimated that Group revenue to 31 March 2009 was increased by approximately £0.3 million, Group EBITDA 
was increased by approximately £6.7 million and proﬁt after taxation by approximately £0.5 million. Had the Adworks businesses
been owned for the whole period it is estimated that Group revenues to 31 March 2009 would have increased by approximately 
£0.5 million. Group EBITDA would have increased by approximately £10.2 million, and proﬁt after taxation would have increased 
by approximately £2.7 million.
In the US the activities of the in-ﬁll acquisitions have all been integrated into the parent company, Yellow Book Inc, and its results are
incorporated into the Group’s reported results. The timing of the distribution of the acquiree’s directories in March 2009 means that 
it is not possible to determine the exact contribution they made to the Group’s reported results nor what they would have contributed
if they had been owned for the entire period. However, it is estimated that Group revenues were increased by £6.6 million during 
the period of ownership and if the acquirees had been owned for the whole period that revenues would have been increased by the
same amount. Group EBITDA is estimated to have increased by £4.4 million during the period of ownership and would have increased
by the same amount for the whole year. Operating proﬁt of the acquirees would not have been materially diﬀerent to EBITDA and the
proﬁt after tax not less than £3.8 million during the period of ownership and for the whole year. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_85

The lawsuit ﬁled by Verizon was settled in October 2004. Yellowbook was later served with complaints ﬁled as class actions in ﬁve US
states and the District of Columbia. In these actions, the plaintiﬀs alleged violation of consumer protection legislation and placed reliance
on ﬁndings of the New York Court in the Verizon lawsuit. On 26 August 2005, the court in New Jersey approved a comprehensive
national settlement, with no admission of liability. The Yell Group fully accrued the $45 million as a prudent estimate of likely costs 
in the year ended 31 March 2005 arising from this class action. However, several appeals were subsequently lodged against the
approved settlement, all of which were resolved during the year ended 31 March 2008. The Group reassessed the likely costs of 
the settlement obligation and reversed $23.6 million (£11.8 million) of the originally accrued settlement obligation as an exceptional
credit through the income statement in the year ended 31 March 2008. The Group reversed a further $12.7 million (£8.9 million) of 
the obligation as an exceptional credit in the year ended 31 March 2009. At 31 March 2009, the remaining $5.0 million of accrued
settlement obligation represents the Group’s best estimate of amounts to be settled.
There are no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those referred above and those arising in the ordinary course of the
Group’s business.
No material losses are anticipated on liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business.

30. Employee share schemes
The Group has various stock option and other share plans for employees and directors. The plans have been accounted for in
accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments. IFRS 2 applies to equity-settled awards 
granted after 7 November 2002 not yet vested by 1 March 2005 and all cash-settled awards outstanding at 1 March 2005.
(a) The Yell Group Limited plans
In March 2002, the Yell Group introduced three stock option plans, the Yell Group Limited Employee Plan, the Yell Group Limited US
Employee Plan and the Yell Group Limited Senior Manager Incentive Plan. The plans were set up to provide employees with option
awards over shares that would become exercisable on an exit event (eg sale or quotation). The option life under these plans is ten
years from date of grant. On a Change of Control, options can be exercised for up to three months following the Change of Control,
exchanged for an equivalent option in the acquiring company, or cash-cancelled.
(b) The Yell Group plc Yellow Book (USA) West Management Share Option Scheme
In September 2002, the Yell Group introduced a stock option plan, the Yell Group plc Yellow Book (USA) West Management Share
Option Scheme for certain employees of the former McLeod directories. This plan provided employees with option awards for shares
that vest ratably on each anniversary of the grant date over a three-year period. The options could be exercised and sold on the later
of the vesting date or the date of an exit event. The option life under the plan is ﬁve years from date of grant. On Change of Control,
options are exercisable for up to six months from Change in Control or can be exchanged for an equivalent option in the acquiring
company.
(c) The Yell Group plc ShareSave Plan
The Yell Group plc ShareSave Plan (the ShareSave) was established in July 2003. Eligible employees who wish to participate must 
enter into a savings contract for a period of three or ﬁve years under which they will contribute payments of between £5 and 
£250 per month, and a bonus is added at the end of three, ﬁve or seven years. In conjunction with the savings contract, an eligible
employee is granted an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of Yell Group plc out of the repayment made under that contract at
the end of three, ﬁve or seven years. The exercise price of any option will not be manifestly less than 80% of the market value of the
ordinary shares at the date of grant. The ShareSave is HM Revenue and Customs approved. On Change of Control, options become
exercisable to the extent of savings accrued, for up to six months from Change of Control or can be exchanged for an equivalent
option in the acquiring company.
(d) The Yell Group plc Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Yell Group plc 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the US ESPP) was established in July 2003. Eligible employees are entitled 
to purchase ordinary shares at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the date the ordinary shares are
oﬀered and 85% of the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the date ending the oﬀer period when the ordinary shares are
purchased by the employee. All ordinary shares must be purchased through the savings accumulated during an oﬀer period through
payroll deductions. On an asset sale, merger or consolidation, options can be continued, exchanged for an equivalent option in the
acquiring company, cancelled (with the return of accumulated payroll deductions) or exercised.
(e) The Yell Group plc Share Incentive Plan
The Yell Group plc Share Incentive Plan was established in July 2003 and permits free, partnership, matching and dividend shares 
to be awarded to eligible employees. On a Change of Control, participants are entitled to direct the Trustee in respect of the oﬀer.
(f) The Yell Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme
The Yell Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme (the UK Option Scheme) was established in July 2003, and contains an unapproved
section and a section approved by HM Revenue and Customs. The price per ordinary share at which options will be exercised will be
not less than the market value of the ordinary shares at the date of grant. Options will normally be granted within a period of 42 days
commencing on the day after the date on which the Group releases its quarterly, half-yearly or ﬁnal results for any ﬁnancial period. 
In most circumstances an objective performance condition must be satisﬁed before an option can be exercised. Normally, options 
may only be exercised three years after their initial date of grant. The option life under this plan is ten years from the date of grant.
On Change of Control, options become exercisable for up to six months from Change of Control, subject to achievement of performance
conditions or can be exchanged for an equivalent option in the acquiring company.
(g) The Yell Group plc US Equity Incentive Plan
The Yell Group plc 2003 US Equity Incentive Plan (the US EIP) was established in July 2003. It allows the Company to issue both 
non-qualiﬁed and incentive stock options and ordinary shares. The Board has sole discretion to determine who may receive awards
under the USEIP and any performance conditions. The exercise price for incentive stock options will not be less than 100% of the 
fair market value of the ordinary shares on the date of grant. The option life under this plan is ten years from the date of grant. 
Stock awards may be made to oﬃcers or employees, and the purchase price, if any, is as established by the Company. On Change 
of Control, options become exercisable for up to six months from Change of Control and performance condition requirements fall
away. Alternatively, the option can be exchanged for an equivalent option in the acquiring company. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_89
Financial statements Notes
(h) The Capital Accumulation Plan
The Yell Group plc Capital Accumulation Plan (the CAP) was established in February 2004. It allows the Company to make awards 
of ordinary shares, which vest three years from the date of grant, to employees. There are no performance criteria attached to the
vesting of these shares, which are awarded to employees whom the Company wishes to retain as key talent within the organisation.
Awards are satisﬁed by purchasing existing shares on the open market rather than by issue of new shares. On Change of Control,
awards vest in full.
(i) The Long-term Incentive Plan
The Yell Group plc Long-term Incentive Plan (the LTIP) was established in July 2003 and is not intended to be approved by HM Revenue
and Customs. The Board has sole discretion to determine which executives are granted awards under the LTIP . Awards are granted 
in the form of performance shares and in most circumstances an objective performance condition must be satisﬁed before an award
vests. Normally, awards may only vest three years after their initial date of grant. For further information, see page 39. On Change of
Control, options become exercisable and performance condition requirements fall away but pro-rating for time applies. Options may
be exercised for such reasonable period as the Trustee may determine.
(j) Deferred Bonus Plan
The Yell Group plc Deferred Bonus Plan (the DBP) was established in November 2004. For any bonus awarded to executive directors 
a proportion of annual bonuses is subject to compulsory deferral into shares for a period of three years. The award of these shares 
is made under the Deferred Bonus Plan. There is no matching provided by the Company and the shares will be forfeited if the director
leaves the Company other than as a predetermined ‘good leaver’ . On Change of Control, nil cost options become exercisable for up 
to six months from Change of Control.

Notice of Annual General Meeting
This Notice of Annual General Meeting is important and requires
your immediate attention. If you have any doubt as to the 
action you should take, you are recommended to seek your own
personal ﬁnancial advice from your stockbroker, bank manager,
solicitor, accountant or other ﬁnancial adviser authorised under
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. If you have sold or
otherwise transferred all your ordinary shares in Yell Group plc,
please send this document, together with the accompanying
documents to the purchaser or transferee, or to the stockbroker,
bank or other agent through whom the sale or transfer was
eﬀected for transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
Notice is hereby given that the 2009 Annual General Meeting of
Yell Group plc (‘the Company’) will be held at Exchange House,
Primrose Street, London EC2A 2HS on Friday 24 July 2009 at
11.00am to consider the following resolutions:
Ordinary resolutions
Resolution 1
That the report of the directors and auditors, and the audited
accounts of the Company, for the year ended 31 March 2009 
be received and considered.
The directors are required by law to present to the shareholders
of the Company at a general meeting the report of the directors
and auditors, and the audited accounts of the Company, for the
year ended 31 March 2009. The report of the directors and the
audited accounts have been approved by the directors, and the
report of the auditors has been approved by the auditors, and 
a copy of each of these documents may be found in the Annual
Report of the Company starting at page 25.
Resolution 2
That the report on the remuneration of directors for the year
ended 31 March 2009 be approved.
Listed companies are required to include certain speciﬁed
information on the remuneration of their directors for each
ﬁnancial year in a report and to give their shareholders an
opportunity to approve such report. The report on the remuneration
of the directors of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2009
may be found in the Annual Report of the Company starting at
page 37.
Resolution 3
That John Condron be re-elected as a director.
Resolution 4
That John Davis be re-elected as a director.
Resolution 5
That John Coghlan be re-elected as a director.
Resolution 6
That Joachim Eberhardt be re-elected as a director.
Resolution 7
That Richard Hooper be re-elected as a director.
Resolution 8
That Tim Bunting be re-elected as a director.
Resolution 9
That Carlos Espinosa de los Monteros be elected as a director.
As a matter of best practice, all of the directors of the Company
believe that they should retire and submit themselves for re-
election at the 2009 Annual General Meeting. As Carlos Espinosa
de los Monteros is a new appointment, shareholder consent to
his election to the Board, is required at the 2009 Annual General
Meeting, the ﬁrst such meeting since his appointment. Biographical
details of the directors of the Company may be found in the
Annual Report of the Company starting at page 28.
Resolution 10
That PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be reappointed auditors of the
Company to hold oﬃce until the conclusion of the next general
meeting of the Company before which accounts are laid.
The auditors are responsible for examining the annual accounts
of the Company and forming an opinion as to whether they give
a true and fair view of its results and ﬁnancial position. It is a
requirement of law that the Company appoint auditors at each
meeting at which accounts are presented to its shareholders,
such appointment to continue until the next meeting at which
accounts are presented.
Resolution 11
That the directors be authorised to determine the remuneration
of the auditors.
This resolution gives the directors of the Company the authority
to determine the remuneration of the auditors for the audit work
to be carried out by them in the next ﬁnancial year. The amount of
the remuneration paid to the auditors for the next ﬁnancial year
will be disclosed in the next audited accounts of the Company.
Resolution 12
That the directors be generally and unconditionally authorised
under section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 to exercise all 
the powers of the Company to allot relevant securities (within
the meaning of section 80(2) of that Act) up to an aggregate
nominal amount of £2,544,526. This authority will expire at 
the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting. However,
before this authority expires, the Company may make an oﬀer
or agreement which would or might require relevant securities
to be allotted after the authority expires and the directors may
allot relevant securities under any such oﬀer or agreement as 
if the authority had not expired.
Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 provides that the directors
of a company cannot issue new shares in its capital without the
approval of its shareholders. Accordingly, the purpose of this
resolution is to give the directors of the Company authority to
issue new shares in the capital of the Company up to a maximum
nominal amount of £2,544,526 which is approximately equivalent
to 32.38% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as
at 3 June 2009.
This resolution will allow the directors of the Company ﬂexibility
to act in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders
by issuing new shares in appropriate circumstances. The directors
have no present plans to exercise this authority. 92_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009
Notice of Annual General Meeting continued
Resolution 13
That in accordance with sections 366 and 367 of the Companies
Act 2006 the Company and all companies that are its subsidiaries
at any time during the period for which this resolution has eﬀect
be authorised to:
a) make political donations to political parties or independent
election candidates (as such terms are deﬁned in the
Companies Act 2006), not exceeding £100,000 in aggregate;
b) make political donations to political organisations other than
political parties (as such terms are deﬁned in the Companies
Act 2006), not exceeding £100,000 in aggregate; and
c) incur political expenditure (as such term is deﬁned in the
Companies Act 2006), not exceeding £100,000 in aggregate,
during the period beginning on the date of this resolution 
and ending on the date falling twelve months after the passing
of this resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the Annual
General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2010, provided
that the maximum authorised amounts referred to in (a), (b)
and (c) may be comprised of one or more sums in diﬀerent
currencies which, for the purposes of calculating the said
amounts, shall be converted at such rate as the Board may 
in its absolute discretion determine to be appropriate.
Resolution 13 concerns Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006 which
came into force on 1 October 2007 and provides that political
donations made by a company to political parties, to other
political organisations and to independent election candidates or
political expenditure incurred by a company must be authorised
in advance by shareholders.
It is not the policy of the Company to make political donations 
of the type caught by these provisions and the directors have 
no intention of changing that policy. However, as a result of the
wide deﬁnitions in the Companies Act 2006, normal expenditure
(such as expenditure on organisations concerned with matters 
of public policy, law reform and representation of the business
community) and business activities (such as communicating 
with the Government and political parties at local, national and
European level) might be construed as political expenditure or 
as a donation to a political party or other political organisation
and fall within the restrictions of the Companies Act 2006.
This resolution does not purport to authorise any particular
donation or expenditure but is expressed in general terms as
required by the Companies Act 2006 and is intended to authorise
normal donations and expenditure. If passed, resolution 13 would
allow the Company and its subsidiaries to make donations to
political parties, other political organisations and independent
election candidates and to incur political expenditure (as deﬁned
in the Companies Act 2006) up to an aggregate limit of £100,000
during the period up to twelve months after the passing of the
resolution. This will allow the Company to continue to support
the community and put forward its views to wider business and
Government interests without running the risk of being in breach
of the law. Any political donation made or political expenditure
incurred which is in excess of £200 will be disclosed in the
Company’s Report and Accounts for next year, as required 
by the Companies Act 2006.
Resolution 14
That any and all infringements by the directors (prior to the
date of the passing of this resolution) of their duties to restrict
borrowings as set out in article 146 of the Company’s Articles of
Association, be and are hereby ratiﬁed and approved and that
any and all claims which the Company may have against any or
all of its directors (past, present and future) arising out of such
infringements be and are hereby released and waived. 
A technical issue has arisen in respect of the powers conferred
upon the Board by the Company’s Articles of Association to incur
borrowings on behalf of the Company. The Articles of Association
contain a borrowing restriction which, broadly speaking, requires
the directors to restrict the borrowings of the Group to ﬁve times
the Adjusted Capital and Reserves (as deﬁned in the Articles of
Association). As a result of the £1,272 million non-cash charge 
to impair Yell Publicidad goodwill, the Adjusted Capital and
Reserves of the Group as at 31 March 2009 are signiﬁcantly 
lower than the previous year. This impairment has, accordingly,
caused this borrowings limit to be exceeded.
This matter can be remedied by shareholders passing a
resolution to ratify this technical breach. 
Resolution 15
That, the directors of the Company be and are hereby
authorised and sanctioned, in accordance with article 146 of 
the Company’s Articles of Association, to exceed the restriction
on their powers to incur borrowings as set out in article 146,
provided that at any time the aggregate principal amount
outstanding of all moneys borrowed by the Group may not
exceed an amount equal to £4,920,000,000 (four thousand
nine hundred and twenty million pounds), provided that this
authority shall end at the conclusion of the 2011 Annual General
Meeting of the Company. For these purposes, moneys borrowed
shall be determined in accordance with Articles 147 to 154 of the
Company’s Articles of Association except that foreign currency
borrowings shall be translated into sterling using the rates of
£1=US$1.43280 and £1=€1.08130, being the relevant closing
exchange rates on 31 March 2009.
As mentioned in relation to Resolution 14 above, the Articles of
Association contain a requirement for the directors to restrict the
borrowings of the Group. This resolution is to sanction a relaxation
of the borrowing restriction contained in the Company’s Articles
of Association such that (notwithstanding this may exceed the
current restrictions in the Company’s Articles of Association) the
Group’s borrowings will, for the period set out in the resolution,
be restricted to a maximum of £4,920 million. 
Accordingly, the directors propose that, as permitted by the Articles
of Association, shareholders be asked to consent to the current
limit on borrowing being suspended until the conclusion of the
2011 Annual General Meeting of the Company. The intention 
of the suspension is to avoid the Company being in breach of 
the restriction on borrowings in its Articles of Association in the
future as a result of the circumstances described in Resolution 14.
It is not intended that the Group’s borrowings be increased
beyond the current facilities available to the Group.
Importance of vote
It is important that shareholders vote in favour of this resolution.
If the resolution is not passed, the Group may not have the
maximum ﬂexibility required to make further borrowings under
its Revolving Credit Facility for working capital purposes. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_93
Shareholder information Notice of AGM
Special resolutions
Resolution 16
That the directors be authorised under section 95 of the
Companies Act 1985 to allot equity securities (as deﬁned in
section 94 of that Act) for cash pursuant to the authority
conferred on them by resolution 12, or where such allotment
constitutes the allotment of equity securities by virtue of section
94(3A) of that Act, as if section 89(1) of that Act did not apply 
to any such allotment. This authority is limited to:
a) allotments connected to a rights issue, open oﬀer or 
other oﬀer of securities to holders of ordinary shares 
in the Company (excluding any ordinary shares held by 
the Company as treasury shares) where the rights of each 
such holder are, as nearly as may be, proportionate to the
number of ordinary shares held by such holder. The directors
may exclude certain shareholders, deal with fractions and
generally manage the rights issue as they think ﬁt; and
b) the allotment (other than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)
above) of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal 
value of £392,933.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual
General Meeting. However, before this authority expires, the
Company may make an oﬀer or agreement which would or
might require equity securities to be allotted after the authority
expires and the directors may allot securities under any such
oﬀer or agreement as if the authority had not expired.
Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 gives existing shareholders
in a company certain pre-emption rights with respect to allotments
of new shares. A company can only disapply these rights with 
the approval of its shareholders. Accordingly, the purpose of 
this resolution is to allow the directors of the Company to allot
ordinary shares in the Company for cash, or to transfer treasury
shares for cash, on a non-pre-emptive basis (a) in connection
with an oﬀer to existing shareholders on a pre-emptive basis and
(b) (other than in connection with a pre-emptive oﬀer to existing
shareholders) up to a maximum amount of £392,933 which is
equivalent to approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share
capital of the Company as at 3 June 2009 and is in line with the
recommended guidelines issued by institutional investor bodies.
Resolution 17
That the Company be generally and unconditionally authorised
to purchase its own fully-paid ordinary shares in the Company
by way of market purchases (within the meaning of section
163(3) of the Companies Act 1985) provided that:
a) the maximum number of ordinary shares in the Company
that the Company may purchase is 78,586,735;
b) the minimum price that the Company may pay for 
an ordinary share in the Company is 1.00 pence;
c) the maximum price which the Company may pay for an
ordinary share in the Company shall be the higher of:
i) an amount equivalent to 105% of the average of the
middle market quotations for an ordinary share in the
Company (as set out in the Daily Oﬃcial List published 
by London Stock Exchange) for the ﬁve business days
immediately before the day on which the Company
agrees to purchase ordinary shares in the Company; and
ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and
highest current independent bid on the London Stock
Exchange Trading System (SETS – the trading venue 
where the purchase is carried out); and
d) this authority will expire at the conclusion of the next 
Annual General Meeting. However, before this authority
expires, the Company may agree to purchase ordinary 
shares in the Company where the purchase will or may be
completed, either fully or partly, after the authority expires
and the Company may purchase such ordinary shares as if
the authority had not expired.
The directors consider that, in certain circumstances, it may be
appropriate and in the best interests of shareholders generally
for the Company to purchase its own shares. This resolution gives
authority for the Company to purchase up to 78,586,735 ordinary
shares which is approximately equivalent to 10% of the issued
share capital of the Company as at 3 June 2009. 
The directors have no present plans to exercise any authority
granted by this resolution in the future, but will keep the matter
under review and will only make purchases where, in the light 
of prevailing market conditions, they consider it will result in 
an increase in earnings per ordinary share in the Company 
and would be in the interests of shareholders generally.
The total number of options to subscribe for ordinary shares 
in the Company outstanding as at 3 June 2009 was 86,680,260.
This represents 11.03% of the issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company at that date. If the Company were to buy back 
the maximum number of shares permitted pursuant to the
passing of this resolution and cancel them, then the total
number of options to subscribe for shares in the Company
outstanding as at 3 June 2009 would represent 12.26% of 
the reduced issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares)
Regulations 2003 enable companies to retain any of their own
shares they have purchased as treasury shares with a view 
to their possible reissue at a later date, rather than cancelling
them as the law previously required. The Company will consider
holding any of its own shares that it purchases pursuant to 
this resolution as treasury shares, which will give the directors
ﬂexibility in the management of the capital base of the Company.
No dividends will be paid on treasury shares while held in treasury,
and no voting rights will attach to them. 94_Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009
Notice of Annual General Meeting continued
Resolution 18
That a general meeting of the Company, other than an 
Annual General Meeting, may be called on not less than 
14 clear days’ notice.
At the Company’s 2007 Annual General Meeting, new Articles 
of Association were adopted to include a provision allowing
general meetings of the Company to be called on the minimum
notice period provided for in the Companies Act 2006. For
general meetings other than annual general meetings the
minimum notice period is currently fourteen days. The provisions
of the Companies Act 2006 relating to meetings are due to 
be amended with eﬀect from August 2009, as a result of the 
UK implementation of the EU Shareholder Rights Directive. 
One of the amendments to be made will, in accordance with 
the Directive, increase the minimum notice period for listed
company general meetings to twenty-one days, but with an
ability for companies to reduce this period back to fourteen 
days (other than for annual general meetings) provided that 
two conditions are met. One of these conditions is that there is an
annual resolution of shareholders approving the reduction in the
minimum notice period from twenty-one days to fourteen days. 
The directors are therefore proposing resolution 18 as a special
resolution to approve fourteen days as the minimum period 
of notice for all general meetings of the Company other than
annual general meetings. The approval will be eﬀective until 
the next Annual General Meeting of the Company, when it is
intended that the approval be renewed.
Recommendation
Whilst the Board is of the opinion that Resolution 14 is in the
best interests of shareholders as a whole, it is not considered
appropriate that the directors make a recommendation other
than that you should vote upon this resolution. 
In addition and in view of their interest in its subject matter,
those directors who are also shareholders will not be voting 
on Resolution 14. 
Accordingly, the directors of the Company consider that (with the
exception of Resolution 14) all the resolutions to be considered
at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of its
shareholders as a whole and they recommend that you vote 
in favour of them. 
The attention of shareholders is particulary drawn to the
importance of voting in relation to Resolution 15 noted above.
Appointment of a proxy and voting
A member of the Company is entitled to appoint a proxy (who
need not be a member of the Company) to exercise all or any 
of his/her rights to attend and speak and vote at the Meeting. 
A member can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the
Meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the
rights attached to diﬀerent shares held by him/her. Appointing 
a proxy does not preclude you from attending the Meeting and
voting in person. If you attend the Meeting in person, your proxy
appointment will automatically be terminated.
A Form of Proxy/Form of Direction is enclosed for use in connection
with the Annual General Meeting, if desired. Notes on completing
the Form of Proxy/Form of Direction can be found on the relevant
form and should be read carefully before the form is completed.
• For ordinary shareholders – a Form of Proxy is enclosed.
• For participants in the Company’s all employee share ownership
plans – a Form of Direction to the trustee is enclosed.
These forms can be completed and posted to the Company’s
registrars, Equiniti, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West
Sussex BN99 6LU. To be valid, the completed forms must reach
the Company’s registrars not later than 11.00am on 22 July 2009.
Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities
Regulations 2001, the time by which a person must be entered
on the register of members to have the right to attend or vote 
at the Meeting and for determining the number of shares held is
6.00pm on 22 July 2009 (or, if the Meeting is adjourned, 6.00pm
on the date which is two days prior to the adjourned Meeting).
Entries on the register of members after that time will be
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or
to vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at the Meeting.
Electronic proxy voting
You may, if you wish, register the appointment of a proxy or
voting instructions for the meeting electronically by logging 
onto www.sharevote.co.uk. You will need to use a 27-digit
number made up of your Voting ID, Task ID and Shareholder
reference printed on your proxy form. Full details of the
procedure are given on the website. The proxy appointment
and/or voting instructions must be received by Equiniti not later
than 11.00am on 22 July 2009. Please note that any electronic
communication sent to the Registrars that is found to contain 
a computer virus will not be accepted. The use of the internet
service in connection with the Annual General Meeting is
governed by Equiniti’s conditions of use set out on the website,
www.sharevote.co.uk, and may be read by logging onto the site.
Crest voting
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so 
for the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 July 2009 
and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures
described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or
other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members
who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer 
to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will 
be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order
for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST
service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST
Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance
with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (‘EUI’) speciﬁcations and
must contain the information required for such instructions, 
as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless 
of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed
proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be
received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) by 11.00am on 22 July
2009. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the
time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message 
by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is
able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner
prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to
proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to
the appointee through other means. Yell Group plc Annual Report 2009_95
Shareholder information Notice of AGM
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors 
or voting service providers should note that EUI does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular
messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is 
the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, 
if the CREST member is a CREST Personal Member or sponsored
member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure
that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) 
such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular 
time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable,
their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the
Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001.
Voting on all resolutions at the Meeting will be conducted 
by way of a poll rather than a show of hands. This is a more
transparent method of voting as member votes are to be
counted according to the number of shares held. As soon as
practicable following the Meeting, the results of the voting at 
the Meeting, the numbers of proxy votes cast for and against
and the number of votes actively withheld in respect of each
resolution will be announced via a Regulatory Information
Service and also placed on the Company’s website.
Corporate representatives
In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the
meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the time of the
meeting so that:
i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of 
the Meeting as its corporate representative with instructions
to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of 
the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at
the Meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives
will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman
will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in
accordance with those directions; and
ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same
corporate shareholder attends the Meeting but the corporate
shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the Meeting
as its corporate representative, a designated corporate
representative will be nominated from those corporate
representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the
other corporate representatives will give voting directions 
to the designated corporate representative.
Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators 
on proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for
further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample
form of representation letter if the Chairman is being appointed
as described in (i) above.
Rights of nominated persons
Please note that if you are an indirect investor and have been
nominated to receive communication from the Company in
accordance with section 146 of the 2006 Act by a person who
holds shares on your behalf (the registered shareholder), you 
do not have the right to appoint a proxy. However, you may 
have a right under an agreement with the registered shareholder
to be appointed (or have somebody else appointed) as proxy.
Alternatively, if you do not have such a right, or do not wish to
exercise it, you may have a right under such an agreement to
give instructions to the registered shareholder as to the exercise
of such voting rights.
Total voting rights
As at 3 June 2009 (being the latest business day prior to the
publication of this Notice), the Company’s issued share capital
consists of 785,867,355 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each,
and the Company does not hold any shares in treasury. Therefore
the total voting rights in the Company are 785,867,355.
You may not use any electronic address provided in this Notice 
of Annual General Meeting to communicate with the Company
or Equiniti for any purposes other than those expressly stated.

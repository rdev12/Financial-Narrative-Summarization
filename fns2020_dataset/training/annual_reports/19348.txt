STRATEGIC REPORT CHAIRMAN’S
INTRODUCTION
OVERVIEW
I am delighted to present the Polypipe 
2015 Annual Report following another 
successful year for the business and all its 
stakeholders. We have delivered against 
all the expectations that were generated 
at the April 2014 IPO. Alan Thomson 
signed off as anticipated at the 2015 
AGM having chaired Polypipe during its 
prior ownership and transformation into 
a Public Company with his customary 
enthusiasm. The Board was therefore 
reconstituted in the way envisaged at the 
time of the IPO with myself as Chairman 
and Paul Dean as SID. We were pleased 
to be able to deliver an acquisition 
opportunity in Nuaire that perfectly fitted 
our strategic aspirations as well as being 
of an appropriate scale for this stage in 
the Group’s development. Cavendish 
Square Partners sold all of their residual 
shareholding (18% of the issued share 
capital following the IPO) and the Group 
entered the FTSE 250 Index on  
29 January 2016.
Co-incidental with all of the above, our 
performance continued to outpace the 
market and we invested heavily in our 
operations with the acquisitions of Nuaire 
and Surestop helping to reposition the 
Group towards its goal of designing and 
manufacturing more complex systems 
to meet the needs for sustainable 
construction.
RESULTS
Business performance throughout 
2015 has been very satisfactory with 
a 7.9% increase in revenues resulting 
from a good level of organic volume 
growth complemented by acquisitions. 
Underlying operating profit margins 
improved further to a record 15.4%. 
Underlying earnings per share increased 
by 20.9% to 19.47p and were supported 
by continued strong cash generation.
DIVIDEND
Despite significant investment in 
acquisitions this year we have maintained 
our dividend policy and I am pleased to 
recommend a final dividend of 5.5p per 
share making a total of 7.8p for the year 
ended 31 December 2015. 
STRATEGY
During 2015 the key objectives of the 
Board were:
 Capitalising upon opportunities to 
expand the business by selected 
acquisitions
 Growing our sales in the Middle East 
region
 Developing new products and 
engineered systems to serve the 
needs of our customers
 Implementing an effective succession 
plan in view of the impending 
retirement of our CFO
In addition to our ongoing initiatives, 
in 2016 our attention will be focussed 
upon:
 Developing our ventilation business 
while realising synergies in our 
integration of Nuaire into the Group
 Commencing manufacturing in the 
Middle East region
 Prioritising selected development and 
acquisition opportunities, whilst the 
Group rapidly reduces leverage 
 Launching a LTIP for senior managers 
to align their interests with those of 
shareholders
PEOPLE
Much of the success of the Company 
during 2015 should be attributed to 
the outstanding effort and commitment 
of our employees. I was particularly 
impressed with the execution of the 
Nuaire and Surestop acquisitions and 
how well the integration of these 
businesses into the Polypipe Group 
is being managed. I have also been 
able to spend time visiting sites and 
meeting employees including our 
Nuaire production facility in Caerphilly 
and our new training centre in Dubai. I 
believe that Polypipe will provide all our 
employees with the opportunities for an 
exciting career and that development of 
our people will support business growth 
for the long-term. 
During November 2015, we announced 
the planned retirement of Peter Shepherd 
as Chief Financial Officer following 
10 years service with the Group and 
the appointment of Martin Payne as 
his successor. Peter made an exceptional 
contribution to the Group and we wish 
him a long and happy retirement.
Previously the Group Finance Director at 
Norcros plc, Martin brings considerable 
industry experience to the role of Chief 
Financial Officer. The Board unanimously 
recommends his election as a director 
following his appointment in succession 
to Peter.
SUMMARY
In my first year as Chairman of the 
Board following the last Annual General 
Meeting, my impression is that the Group 
has a committed senior management 
team, a clear strategy and strong financial 
performance. Looking ahead, the Group 
is well positioned to take advantage of 
the forecast continuing recovery in its 
main UK market and the structural and 
legislative drivers for its products. Our 
recent acquisitions bolster our technical 
capability and I believe that in 2016 we 
will deliver further growth as a result of 
our investment in the areas of ventilation 
and water management solutions. I look 
forward to sharing our achievements in 
my report next year.

07 Good progress was made during 2015 
whilst the Group’s focus was to adapt 
to the changing dynamics in the UK 
construction market recovery, manage 
input cost volatility and availability of our 
prime polymers, and to deliver on our 
growth initiatives, both organically and 
through acquisition.
The strength of the recovery in the 
UK market was considerably more 
mixed than forecasts had projected. In 
particular, lack of strength in the recovery 
of residential repair, maintenance and 
improvement (RMI) activity became more 
evident as the year progressed.
The Group has progressively moved 
towards designing and manufacturing 
more complex systems that enable a 
greater level of specification from our 
customers seeking to meet the needs of 
sustainable construction. The acquisition 
of Nuaire in August 2015 is a significant 
step in that direction, substantially 
enhancing our technical capability in the 
increasingly important area of ventilation. 
Nuaire has an excellent track record and 
has continued to perform well under our 
ownership. We have been cautious not 
to destabilise either the Nuaire business 
or our existing ventilation business, whilst 
we undergo a staged integration process. 
Nuaire’s results are allocated between 
both Residential Piping Systems and 
Commercial and Infrastructure Piping 
Systems – UK in line with the market 
sectors they serve.
Surestop, acquired in January 2015 
also performed well and a considered 
integration programme has enabled an 
excellent level of sales growth as well 
as improved manufacturing margins by 
utilising components and capability from 
other parts of the Group.
Our immediate focus is on deleveraging 
following the Nuaire acquisition, and 
we expect net debt to EBITDA to reduce 
towards 2 times by the end of the 
2016 financial year due to the highly 
cash generative nature of our business. 
We have sufficient financial headroom 
to continue to develop investment 
opportunities and we continue to 
seek compelling “bolt on” acquisition 
opportunities. 
Despite a strong downward trajectory 
in crude oil prices, polymer prices have 
become disconnected from the primary 
feedstocks and displayed quite significant 
volatility during the year. Overall polymer 
prices were lower than during 2014 and 
the majority of this has been passed 
on to customers either in lower prices, 
discounts or as a result of not having 
price increases to cover other inflationary 
effects. Despite some availability concerns 
resulting from the polymer producers 
reducing output, the Group was able to 
source sufficient volumes to meet our 
customers’ demands.

Polypipe Group plc
08 In Residential Piping Systems our products 
and systems targeted at delivering carbon 
efficient solutions have performed well, 
primarily in the new build sector where a 
higher specification is increasingly required 
to meet more stringent regulation. We 
conducted a high profile marketing 
campaign for underfloor heating, 
including television advertising fronted by 
leading interior designer, Kelly Hoppen, 
who is a brand ambassador for Polypipe. 
The campaign drove a significant surge 
in traffic to our website stimulating 
consumer demand and increasing the 
number of registered installers.
In Commercial and Infrastructure Piping 
Systems, Government and legislative 
focus on flood alleviation continued 
to drive strong sales growth for our 
comprehensive range of engineered 
water management solutions. We 
delivered a number of significant projects 
during the year helping to design some 
innovative SUDS (sustainable urban 
drainage systems) including the use 
of our 3m diameter pipe as well as 
experiencing a steady increase in demand 
from smaller new build residential sites as 
they commenced development. During 
2015 the Group manufactured solutions 
for more than 700 different projects to 
prevent future flooding. Both our Nuaire 
and our Building Products division were 
recognized for innovative promotional 
campaigns by winning marketing industry 
awards.
We have continued to focus on new 
product development. During the 
period several new products were 
introduced, including an enhanced 
smartphone app based controls system 
for underfloor heating, new controls for 
ventilation, additions to our innovative 
radial ventilation duct system and a 
new surface and sub water treatment 
drainage system. Progressive introduction 
of new products has enabled the Group 
to win an increasing number of high 
profile project specifications and secure 
further penetration into the sectors 
of the construction industry that offer 
opportunities for us to add value. 
We are increasing our commitment to 
customer training. In Doncaster we are 
strengthening our customer training 
capability by enhancing our Northern 
area customer training facility. We 
formally opened our new customer 
training centre in Dubai during October 
2015 which enables us to train our 
customers and demonstrate our full 
capability across a comprehensive range 
of systems. 
Despite cautious sentiment in the Middle 
East region, the majority of construction 
activity we are involved with tends to 
be high profile, state sponsored projects 
which have continued to attract funding. 
Following recent years where flood 
risk has attracted more attention in 
this area, our efforts to help develop a 
specification for storm water attenuation 
with the relevant authorities has led to 
some promising initial orders which have 
been delivered from the UK. We are 
making good progress with our plans 
to manufacture water management 
attenuation cells in the Jebel Ali Free 
Zone in Dubai.
The Group continued to invest in its 
capability to reprocess plastic packaging. 
During the year approximately one 
third of our UK production was based 
on reprocessed polymer making a 
considerable contribution to the circular 
economy with Polypipe one of the 
largest recyclers of household plastic 
waste in the UK. Whilst the recent 
decline in virgin polymer prices has 
made this less financially attractive than 
previously, we are still delivering a good 
return on investment from our plastic 
waste reprocessing plant and believe 
our customers regard it as an important 
factor in their environmentally responsible 
sourcing strategies.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Residential Piping Systems
Sales to the residential sector were 
£182.6m all of which were in the UK and 
Ireland and represented 50% of Group 
revenues in 2015.
Private residential new build continued 
to be dominated by the national 
housebuilders, with activity levels of 
smaller builders remaining muted. The 
trend toward more building in the regions 
and less reliance on London seen in the 
second half of 2014 carried on through 
2015. Public sector housing starts fell 
8% during the year being impacted by 
budgetary concerns around the extension 
of the ‘right to buy’ scheme and changes 
to social housing rents announced by 
the new Government. Overall new build 
represented 38% of our residential 
revenues (23% of the UK Group) in 
2015.
A combination of factors appear to have 
led to private RMI activity growing less 
quickly than expected. The mortgage 
review tightened lending criteria and 
the targeting of government measures 
towards new builds appears to be 
suppressing what would normally be 
a higher level of second hand housing 
transactions at this stage of the recovery. 
Both levels of remortgaging and the 
number of housing transactions have 
traditionally been a primary driver 
for major residential project works 
that benefits Polypipe. Both of these 
indicators have remained relatively muted 
and well below long term averages.
Residential piping systems delivered an 
underlying operating profit of £32.8m, 
an increase of 15.5% over the prior year. 
Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2015
Polypipe Group plc
10 Commercial and Infrastructure 
Piping Systems – UK
Sales from our UK commercial and 
infrastructure businesses were £131.5m 
and represented 36% of overall Group 
revenues in 2015.
Demand from road and rail projects 
remained good although changes to the 
funding model for Highways England 
resulted in some slowing of activity 
for a period. Their published £15.2bn 
Road Investment strategy for capital 
enhancement and renewals between 
2015 and 2020 is expected to lead to a 
pick up in growth rates. 
Private commercial also performed well 
and the development of high rise multi 
occupancy buildings in London and more 
recently in other major cities provided 
good level of demand for our commercial 
systems, including the recently acquired 
Nuaire ranges.
Export revenues grew by 18% over 
2014, primarily from sales into the Gulf 
states. We have continued to expand 
our sales presence in the region and 
remain committed to developing further 
specification activity alongside our 
intention to commence manufacturing of 
water attenuation systems during 2016.
Volatile polymer costs had a negative 
impact on the plastics recycling industry. 
This resulted in a tightening of supply 
and combined with formulaic sales 
pricing mechanisms to our customers, 
squeezed operating margins as input 
costs of recyclate did not decline at the 
rate of virgin polymer prices.
Commercial and Infrastructure Piping 
Systems – UK delivered an underlying 
profit of £20.1m, an increase of 18.2% 
over the prior year. 
Commercial and Infrastructure 
Piping Systems – Europe
Sales from our continental European 
businesses were £50.4m and represented 
14% of overall Group revenues in 2015. 
Although when translated into sterling 
this is down 6.5% on prior year, in local 
currency revenues increased by 3.5%.
The market showed no real signs of 
improvement during the year, although 
our second half revenue performance 
improved, being 10.3% up in local 
currency terms against the same period 
in 2014. We have continued to focus on 
our improvement initiatives.
Underlying operating profits improved to 
£1.3m an increase of nearly 50% in local 
currency.
OUTLOOK
Whilst there remain political and 
economic uncertainties, underlying 
fundamentals across all sectors of the 
UK construction market remain positive 
with Government announcements and 
policy generally supportive of stimulating 
further housebuild, home ownership and 
improving the national infrastructure. 
In our main UK market, 2016 industry 
forecasts expect that construction activity 
will outpace GDP .
2016 has started well and we are 
encouraged by reports from the 
merchants of improvement in RMI spend 
in the early part of this year following the 
upturn in housing transactions during 
the second half of 2015. A supportive 
market, our focus on delivering our 
growth initiatives and a determination to 
remain agile, mean we look forward to 
2016 being a year of further progression.

12 CASE STUDY JOHN SWIFT BUILDING 
MANCHESTER
Polypipe designed and developed a new underfloor heating 
solution with enhanced acoustic properties for improved 
warmth and sound protection in a century old converted 
warehouse. Replacing the existing radiator system and creating 
much-needed warmth within this iconic building, the new 
underfloor heating system now provides even temperature 
levels, eliminating cold spots, lowering energy bills and creating 
a more flexible space. As a traditional early 20th century 
building with wooden floorboards and multiple tenants 
throughout the building, an additional factor was the need 
for high performance sound attenuation.  The Polypipe system 
delivers across all of these requirements and the occupants now 
enjoy a much-improved working environment. 
CASE STUDY UNITE STRATFORD ONE
Due to a lack of available external ground area, our two tiered 
Permavoid Podium Deck was specified for use across a major 
student accommodation project in East London. Working 
alongside main contractor Westfield Construction and M&E 
contractor Dimension Data Advanced Infrastructure, Polypipe 
designed and developed a rainwater attenuation system 
capable of managing the site’s drainage requirements in the 
event of a ‘1 in 100’ year + 30% storm event.

STRATEGIC REPORT OUR MARKETPLACE
UK CONSTRUCTION MARKET 
OUTPUT TRENDS
The signs of growth in the construction 
industry have continued to be positive 
despite a slowdown in activity during the 
third quarter of 2015; however whilst 
GDP for 2015 was 6.6% higher than 
at the pre-recession peak in 2008 Q1, 
UK economic recovery continues to be 
driven by growth in the services sector 
and activity in construction remains 4.1% 
below the pre-recession peak.
Our core UK market grew by 0.5% in 
2015 (correcting for the reclassification 
of ONS data in the Roads and Electricity 
sectors) underpinned by a rise in overall 
economic activity and growth of 3.2% 
is forecast for 2016. Construction 
output is expected to rise by more than 
16% between 2015 and 2019, driven 
especially by growth in the three largest 
construction sectors; private housing, 
commercial and infrastructure.
RESIDENTIAL
Private house building has grown 
considerably over the past two years, 
rising by 32.6% between 2013 and 2015. 
These increases were driven by growth 
in the wider UK economy in addition to 
government policies, including the Help 
to Buy equity loan scheme, that have 
been targeted specifically at the new 
build housing segment. Private housing 
starts in Great Britain were 5.0% higher 
than in 2014 and are forecast to rise by 
5.0% again in 2016 to 141,328, with 
major housebuilders continuing to signal 
their intention to increase units built 
over the next 12-18 months. Help to Buy 
accounts for one quarter of new build 
purchases and will sustain demand, plus, 
house prices continue to increase in most 
regions, especially in London and the 
South East, illustrating continued strong 
underlying, structural demand. 
A slowdown in mortgage lending, and 
consequently property transactions 
overall, in the second half of 2014 and 
early 2015 fed through to a slowdown 
in private housing repair, maintenance 
and improvement (RMI) activity during 
the second half of 2015 due to the time 
lag between housing transactions and 
consequent improvements works which 
tend to occur around 6-9 months after 
purchasing a property. Sector output in 
2015 was up by 2.0% compared to a 
year earlier and with property transactions 
forecast to increase in 2016 overall, 
private housing RMI output is forecast to 
rise by 3.0%. 
Public housing sector housing starts fell 
by 8% in 2015 and are expected to be 
adversely affected moving forward by 
a lack of funding available to housing 
associations due to the extension of the 
Right to Buy scheme and continued cuts 
to the social rental sector. As a result, 
public housing starts are forecast to 
fall a further 5% in 2016. The majority 
of activity in the public housing RMI 
sector is either basic repairs or essential 
maintenance on the existing public 
housing stock, which cannot be delayed 
for a significant period of time and this 
will continue to underpin activity in the 
sector together with the allocated funding 
to the Decent Homes programme in 
England. However public housing RMI 
work will be affected if the public housing 
stock is diminished through the extension 
of Right to Buy to housing association 
tenants and any subsequent sell-off 
of local authority properties. Output 
is forecast to be flat in 2016. The UK 
construction market represents Polypipe’s 
key market and we are therefore 
influenced by the level of activity within 
the sector.

14 CIVILS AND INFRASTRUCTURE
Infrastructure activity continues to see 
growth with roads and energy subsectors 
expected to be the key drivers, although 
activity is forecast to increase in all key 
sub-sectors; roads, rail, energy, water and 
sewerage. Output in the infrastructure 
sector grew 28.6% in 2015, and is forecast 
to grow a further 7.9% in 2016 and as work 
continues on major projects in the £411 
billion National Infrastructure Plan. (However, 
corrected for data reclassification in the 
Roads and Electricity sectors, our underlying 
addressable Infrastructure market declined 
by 2.5% in 2015, and is forecast to grow by 
5.0% in 2016).
Roads construction growth is forecast to 
continue, supported by increased capital 
investment following the creation of 
Highways England, which has confirmed 
a £15.2 billion Road Investment Strategy 
for capital enhancement and renewals 
between 2015 and 2020. In contrast 
local authorities who manage the 
majority of the existing road network 
remain financially constrained and will 
have a negative effect on on-going 
road maintenance programmes. The 
energy infrastructure market output 
grew in 2015, and even allowing for  
the inclusion of preparatory works for 
nuclear new build and decommissioning 
programmes, the underlying trend 
remains positive due to continued growth 
in infrastructure related to new build 
housing and work around national grid 
power connections in the near term. 
COMMERCIAL
The private commercial sector is forecast 
to enjoy growth from 2016 through 
to 2019 with new offices construction 
expected to be a primary driver of this 
growth, with increased activity in cities 
such as Birmingham and Manchester as 
well as growth in the London market. 
Despite the UK Government’s focus on 
austerity, public sector new construction 
is expected to avoid the worst of the cuts 
going forward, although the austerity 
programme will continue to leave local 
authorities financially constrained which 
will impact upon public repair and 
maintenance programmes.
OVERSEAS MARKETS 
Wider global growth prospects remain 
somewhat mixed and concerns have 
heightened over the past year regarding 
emerging markets in particular. The 
impact of the fall in oil prices has fed 
through to concerns regarding the 
Middle East markets, the effects of 
which are expected to be mitigated by 
the large sovereign wealth reserves that 
can be leveraged to sustain government 
investment programmes.
Alongside the majority of other major EU 
economies the French market saw little 
growth in 2015. Into 2016 however, with 
the overall combination of quantitative 
easing and a fall in commodities prices, 
the outlook for construction activity 
in the Eurozone is anticipated to be 
relatively more positive.

BALANCED SALES SPLIT
We have a balanced mix of residential and commercial, civils and infrastructure business. 
Spread over the UK market and selected niches in mainland Europe and the Middle 
East we cover both new build and Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (RMI) projects 
where in many instances legacy building materials are being replaced by plastics. 
This balance provides us with a sound basis for our future development. We seek to 
make the most of our long-term relationships with contractors and specifiers across all 
the relevant sectors, and we benefit from our wide brand recognition and reputation for 
excellence, innovation and extensive range of systems and solutions.
STRATEGIC REPORT Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com
15 OUR STRATEGY
Our ongoing strategy is 
to leverage our strengths 
to grow ahead of the 
market, meeting the 
increasingly complex 
needs of the residential, 
civils & infrastructure and 
commercial sectors of 
the modern construction 
market. In addition, we 
target market sectors 
where enhanced growth 
can be achieved including 
the substitution of legacy 
materials by plastics and 
sectors where legislation 
aimed at increasing the 
sustainability of the built 
environment is impacting.
With 20,000 product lines, more than 
100 product systems, well-invested 
manufacturing facilities, a transport 
fleet numbering in excess of 150 vehicles 
and more than 470 people in sales 
and technical support, we have an 
enviable reputation amongst installers, 
contractors, stockists and specifiers.
1
  BENEFITING FROM MARKET RECOVERY 
AND LEVERAGING BRAND POSITION
Our strong financial performance, combined with our key strategic objectives, 
means we are in an excellent position to capitalise on growth in the UK 
construction market. Our goal of focusing on core markets, targeting growth 
opportunities and driving efficiency has left us with industry-leading margins. 
We already operate at a highly successful level in a market with relatively high 
barriers to entry, meaning that other companies seeking to compete with us 
would have to invest on a significant scale. This, compounded by both our 
status as the most recognised brand in the UK plastic pipe sector and our highly 
developed operational infrastructure puts us in a unique position. We are now 
ideally placed to leverage our brand position and long-term relationships with 
contractors and specifiers, generating further “pull-through” sales volumes for 
our stockists. 
2
  CONTINUED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
FOR SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION AND 
SUBSTITUTION OF LEGACY MATERIALS 
Society today recognises the twin global challenges of managing water and 
carbon reduction in the built environment, which is why we will continue our 
long-term investment in our Water Management and Carbon Efficient Solutions, 
with systems that meet increasingly complex legislative requirements. We will 
continue to invest in key development programmes to grow ahead of the 
overall market. Our strategy of addressing the water management and carbon 
efficient sectors is complemented by our drive towards material substitution. 
The ongoing, long-term industry trend for the substitution of legacy building 
materials such as copper, steel, concrete and clay with plastic represents a 
significant opportunity. Our businesses are positioned to take advantage of this 
trend across a range of product markets.

17 OUR SUSTAINABLE JOURNEY
Plastics are now widely recognised as the material of 
choice for piping systems throughout the construction 
industry and this means more and more legacy materials 
such as concrete, clay, cast iron and copper are being 
replaced by modern, sustainable engineered solutions.
SUSTAINABLE INPUTS
All of our raw materials whether prime 
or recycled polymers are sourced to a 
strict sustainable policy and this ensures 
all suppliers meet the highest standards. 
With ISO 9001 Quality Management and 
ISO 14001 Environmental Management 
accreditation, we only manufacture with 
the very best materials.
SUSTAINABLE PROCESSES
Our commitment to the environment 
means we don’t just recycle our in 
process material waste; we monitor 
every process from reducing power 
consumption by the metering of power 
lines and management of water usage.
SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS
Plastic pipes are light in weight, reducing 
fuel consumption in transportation, 
lowering health and safety risks onsite, 
and they can be recycled at ‘end of  
the life’.
SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS
Our products are not only recyclable, 
but in their everyday use, they also 
save energy, reduce CO
2
 emissions and 
manage water as a valuable resource. 
Systems such as our underfloor heating, 
mechanical ventilation with heat recovery 
and geocellular solutions provide the 
most comprehensive range available in 
the UK to meet these requirements.
THE OUTCOME
All of these products and solutions help 
to create a sustainable Built Environment 
across residential, commercial, civils 
and infrastructure markets for future 
generations.

LUXURY APARTMENTS
Polypipe recently acquired Nuaire, which won the contract  
to deliver a range of Heat Recovery Ventilation Systems to  
235 luxury residential apartments in Central London.
Energy-efficient low emissivity glass allows high levels of 
light into the apartments where the heat is trapped and air 
is warmed. To address the overheating issue, the consultants 
needed a much higher ventilation rate. To solve this, Nuaire’s 
design team engineered a system to provide the optimal 
ventilation rate, combined with a high performance acoustic 
enclosure for sound protection. This met both the  
extra power and sound levels required by the consultant.
CASE STUDY  
ELEPHANT & CASTLE, SOUTH LONDON
Polypipe’s involvement in the new £1.5bn regeneration 
project at Elephant & Castle relied on the coordinated 
expertise and resource from across Polypipe’s Building 
Products, Terrain and Civils’ operations. 
Working together with Lendlease, Polypipe received a unique 
specification comprising a wide range of innovative product 
and carbon efficient solutions, including Domus ventilation 
ducting to work alongside the Nuaire MVHR units. For 
drainage, Permavoid cells and Permafoam irrigation systems 
were used. As well as Terrain Fuze HDPE Drainage, which 
were supplied as prefabricated stacks. Polypipe also supplied 
its acoustic underfloor heating system, replacing the need for 
screeds to level the floor – improving both carbon efficiency 
and speed of construction.

CHIEF FINANCIAL
OFFICER’S REPORT
Group revenue growth of 7.9% included 
revenue growth from our UK operations 
of 10.6%, which included the benefit 
of acquisitions, and adverse currency 
translation impacting the reported 
revenue of our Mainland European 
businesses, which at constant exchange 
rates grew revenue by 3.5%. Reported 
revenue growth from our UK operations 
was adversely impacted by polymer cost 
deflation passed onto our customers. 
Eliminating the impact of price deflation, 
our UK operations’ revenue growth in 
volume terms, excluding acquisitions, 
of c.4% continued to outpace growth 
in UK construction. Based on ONS data 
for 2015 we estimate UK construction 
growth to be c.0.5% adjusting for 
anomalies relevant to our business in 
the ONS reported growth rates for the 
“Roads” and “Electricity” sub-sectors 
within the reported “Infrastructure” 
growth number. 
The Group underlying operating profit 
margin improved to a record 15.4% 
(2014: 14.2%) due largely to the 
operational gearing benefit from the 
additional sales volumes. The adverse 
currency translation impact, whilst 
significant in revenue terms, had little 
impact on earnings.
NON-UNDERLYING ITEMS
Non-underlying items related almost 
entirely to costs associated with the 
acquisitions during 2015 and the IPO in 
2014. In 2015 they included non-cash 
charges of £4.7m in respect of goodwill 
amortisation (£3.0m) and unamortised 
debt issue costs written off (£1.7m).

businesses (including costs) during the 
year. 
At 31 December 2015 liquidity headroom 
(cash and undrawn committed banking 
facilities) was substantial and improved to 
£104.1m (2014: £83.1m). Our immediate 
focus is on deleveraging following 
the Nuaire acquisition and we expect 
net debt to EBITDA to reduce towards 
approximately 2 times EBITDA by the end 
of the 2016 financial year due to the high 
cash generative nature of our business. 
This headroom enables us to continue to 
develop our acquisition pipeline and we

(excluding non-underlying items) after 
capital expenditure was strong showing 
an increase of 15.2% during the year 
to £55.3m (2014: £48.0m) and this was 
after absorbing a 27.8% increase in 
capital expenditure to £19.3m (128% of 
depreciation). The cash conversion rate, 
a key measure of operating cashflow 
performance, remained in excess of 
100% of underlying profit.
Capital expenditure in 2015 increased by 
£4.2m to £19.3m, much of the increase 
related to investment in equipment for a 
new manufacturing facility in the Middle 
East to produce water management 
products. Capital expenditure in 2016 is 
expected to remain ahead of depreciation 
as we continue to seek to expand our 
product range and improve our operating 
efficiency.
Net working capital at 31 December 
2015 of negative £2.3m compared with 
negative £4.4m at 31 December 2014. 
This decrease in negative working capital 
of £2.1m during 2015 comprised:

25 REFINANCING
In August 2015 the Group cancelled its 
existing £120m term loan and £40m 
Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”) and 
entered into a new five year term £300m 
RCF to finance the acquisition of Nuaire. 
At 31 December 2015 £217.5m of the 
new RCF was drawn down. 
The Group is subject to two financial 
covenants, at 31 December 2015 there 
was significant headroom:
Covenant:

Interest 
cover* >4:1 7.6:1
Leverage** <3.5:1 2.5:1
* EBIT:Net finance costs excluding debt issuance cost 
amortisation
** EBITDA:Net debt
FINANCE COSTS
Net underlying finance charges for the 
year of £6.2m were £2.5m lower than 
the prior year, despite higher year end 
net debt from acquisition financing, 
due to the full year benefit in 2015 of 
refinancing the 9.5% £150m Senior 
Secured Notes in April 2014 with bank 
loans at a significantly lower finance cost 
and improved terms of our new revolving 
credit facility from August 2015.
Interest is payable on the new RCF 
at LIBOR plus an interest rate margin 
ranging from 1.25% to 2.75%. The 
interest rate margin at 31 December 
2015 was 2.25%.
In order to reduce exposure to future 
increases in interest rates the Group has 
entered into interest rate swaps at fixed 
rates ranging between 1.735% and 
2.21% (excluding margin) with notional 
amounts hedged ranging from £60.0m 
to £91.7m over the period of the interest 
rate swaps. 
The unrealised mark to market 
adjustment on these forward interest 
rate swaps at 31 December 2015 was 
£2.1m negative (2014: £2.4m negative), 
the movement in the mark to market 
adjustment during the year of £0.3m 
is included in the Group Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. 
Non-underlying finance costs of £1.7m 
in 2015 related to the write off of 
unamortised issue costs incurred on our 
former and now refinanced term loan 
and RCF.
TAXATION
Underlying taxation:
As noted in last year’s Annual Report, 
the underlying tax rate (underlying tax 
: underlying profit before tax) for 2015 
was expected to be close to the UK 
standard tax rate as the last of the benefit 
from brought forward non-trading losses 
was recognised in 2014. The underlying 
tax rate in 2015 was 19.2% (2014: 
14.4%), slightly below the UK standard 
tax rate of 20.25% largely due to the 
benefit of patent box relief. The impact 
of our mainland European operations on 
the Group’s tax charge is not significant.
Taxation on non-underlying items:
The non-underlying taxation credit of 
£1.8m in 2015 included £1.0m relating 
to prior year items. Adjusting for the prior 
year items in 2015, the relatively low tax 
credit on non-underlying items in both 
years was because there was no taxation 
relief on the acquisition costs incurred 
in 2015 and limited taxation relief was 
available on listing costs in 2014. 
EXCHANGE RATES
The Group is exposed to movements 
in exchange rates when translating 
the results of its mainland European 
operations from Euros to Sterling. Sterling 
appreciated further against the Euro 
during 2015 with the average exchange 
rate used for translation purposes moving 
from £1:€1.25 in 2014 to £1:€1.38 in 
2015. The impact of this was £5.4m 
negative on revenue with no significant 
impact on operating profit.
Forward currency derivative contracts are 
classified as held for trading. There was 
an unrealised loss of £0.1m (included in 
financial liabilities) on these derivative 
contracts at 31 December 2015 (2014: 
£0.2m loss) resulting in an income 
statement credit of £0.1m during the 
year.

Polypipe Group plc
26 EARNINGS PER SHARE
2015 2014
Pence per share:
Basic 17.11 6.96
Adjusted 19.47 16.11
The impact of dilution is not significant
The movement in basic EPS is distorted 
by significant non-underlying items 
during both 2015 and 2014.
Adjusted EPS, which removes the impact 
of non-underlying items, improved 
by 21% in 2015 due to the improved 
operating result and reduced finance 
costs offset by an increase in the 
underlying tax rate as explained above.
DIVIDEND
The final dividend of 5.5 pence is being 
recommended for payment on 1 June 
2016 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 29 April 2016. 
The ex dividend date will be 28 April 
2016.
Our dividend policy is to pay a minimum 
of 40% of the Group’s annual underlying 
profit after tax. The Directors intend 
that the Group will pay the total annual 
dividend in two tranches, an interim 
dividend and a final dividend, to be 
announced at the time of announcement 
of the interim and preliminary results 
respectively in the approximate 
proportions of one-third and two-thirds, 
respectively. The Group may revise its 
dividend policy from time to time.
PENSIONS
The Group does not have any defined 
benefit pension schemes and only 
has defined contribution pension 
arrangements in place. Pension costs 
for the year amounted to £1.7m (2014: 
£1.3m).
ACQUISITIONS
On 30 January 2015 the Group acquired 
100% of the share capital of Surestop 
Limited, a company which manufactures 
and supplies a range of patented water 
mains switch-off devices. The cash 
consideration of £6.0m included payment 
of £0.8m for net cash at completion. 
Surestop has contributed revenue of 
£2.1m and £0.8m operating profit to 
the Group’s result for 2015. If Surestop 
had been acquired on 1 January 2015 
the Group’s results for the tax year would 
have shown revenue of £353.1m and 
underlying operating profit of £54.2m.
On 18 August 2015 the Group acquired 
100% of the share capital of Nu-Oval 
Acquisitions 1 Limited (“Nuaire”), a 
leading provider of ventilation systems. 
The cash consideration of £149.2m 
included a payout of £4.9m for net cash 
at completion. Nuaire has contributed 
post acquisition revenue of £21.9m and 
£3.2m operating profit to the Group’s 
result for 2015. If Nuaire had been 
acquired on 1 January 2015 the Group’s 
results for the tax year would have shown 
revenue of £395.4m and underlying 
operating profit of £62.9m. Nuaire’s 
results are allocated between Residential 
Piping Systems and Commercial and 
Infrastructure Piping Systems – UK in line 
with the market sectors they serve.
FORWARD LOOKING 
STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this full year report 
are forward looking. Although the Group 
believes that the expectations reflected 
in these forward looking statements are 
reasonable, we can give no assurance 
that these expectations will prove to have 
been correct. Because these statements 
contain risks and uncertainties, actual 
results may differ materially from those 
expressed or implied by these forward 
looking statements. We undertake no 
obligation to update any forward looking 
statements, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise.

27 FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING RISK
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Group maintains an effective risk management system. It determines the Group’s 
approach to risk, its policies and the procedures that are implemented to mitigate exposure to risk.
PROCESS
The Board continually assesses and monitors the key risks in the business and Polypipe has developed a risk management 
framework to identify, report, and manage its principal risks and uncertainties. This includes the recording of all principal risks and 
uncertainties on a Group Risk Register and a Group Risk Profile which are both updated at least every 6 months. Risks are fully 
analysed, allocated owners, scored for both impact and probability to determine the exposure to the business, which should be 
prioritised, and what mitigation is required.
External risks include economic conditions, the weather, government action, policies and regulation, raw material prices and 
Information Systems disruption. Internal risks include dependencies on key customers and retention of key personnel.
The Board seeks to mitigate the businesses exposure to strategic, financial and operational risk, both external and internal. The 
effectiveness of key mitigating controls are continually monitored and subjected to periodic testing by the Group Financial Controller. 
The table below highlights the principal risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on the Group’s performance and 
prospects and the mitigating activities which are aimed at reducing the impact or likelihood of a major risk materialising. These risks 
have all been considered by the Board when developing the Group’s Viability Statement. The Board does recognise however that it 
will not always be possible to eliminate these risks entirely. 
Risk Potential Impact Mitigations
Raw material prices
The Group is exposed to volatile raw 
material prices, particularly polymers, 
due to fluctuations in the market 
price of crude oil and other petroleum 
feedstocks, exchange rate movements, 
and changes to suppliers’ manufacturing 
capacity.
Any increase in the market price of crude 
oil and other petroleum feedstocks, 
exchange rate movements, and changes 
to suppliers’ manufacturing capacity 
could have a direct impact on the prices 
the Group pays for raw materials which 
could adversely affect its operating 
margins and cash flow. 
The Group seeks to pass on raw material 
price increases to its customers wherever 
possible. There is usually at least a three 
month time period from notification of 
the raw material price increase before 
selling prices can be actioned in the 
market. Competitors of the Group are 
likely to experience similar levels of 
polymer cost increases.
Business Disruption
The Group’s manufacturing and 
distribution operations could be 
subjected to disruption due to factors 
including incidents such as fire, failure 
of equipment, power outages, strikes, 
or unexpected or prolonged periods of 
severe weather.
Incidents such as fires, failure of 
equipment, power outages, strikes or 
unexpected severe weather (due to 
flooding, snow or high winds) could 
result in the temporary cessation in 
activity or disruption at one of the 
production facilities impeding the 
Group’s ability to deliver its products 
to its customers, adversely affecting its 
financial results. 
In addition, prolonged periods of severe 
weather could result in a slowdown in 
site construction activity reducing the 
demand for the Group’s products and 
adversely affecting its financial results. 
The Group has developed business 
continuity, crisis response, and disaster 
recovery plans.
The Group has the ability to transfer 
some of its production to alternative sites 
and could also subcontract out some of 
its tooling to reduce any potential loss in 
production capacity.
The Group maintains a significant 
amount of insurance to cover business 
interruption and damage to property 
from such events.
Independent insurer inspections take 
place across all sites to assess potential 
hazards and business interruption risks.
The Group carries out regular 
maintenance to minimise the risk of 
equipment failure.

28 Risk Potential Impact Mitigations
Reliance on key customers
Some of the Group’s businesses are 
dependent on key customers in highly 
competitive markets.
Failure to manage relationships with key 
customers, whilst continuing to provide 
high quality products delivered on time 
in full, and developing new innovative 
products could lead to a loss of business 
affecting the financial results of the 
Group.
The Group’s strategic objective is to 
broaden its customer base wherever 
possible.
The Group focuses on delivering 
exceptional customer service and 
maintains strong relationships with major 
customers through direct engagement at 
all levels.
The Group maintains customer service 
matrices which are continually tracked 
and monitored and intervention made 
where required.
The Group closely manages its pricing, 
rebates, and commercial terms with its 
customers to ensure that they remain 
competitive.
The Group continually seeks to innovate 
and develop its product lines to ensure 
its products are to the standard our 
customers expect.
Recruitment and Retention of Key Personnel
The Group is dependent on the 
continued employment and performance 
of our Executive Management Team and 
other key skilled personnel.
Loss of any key personnel without 
adequate and timely replacement could 
disrupt business operations and the 
Group’s ability to implement and deliver 
its growth strategy.
The Group has a formal succession plan 
in place ensuring progression through 
the Group. 
The Group aims to provide competitive 
remuneration packages and incentive 
schemes to retain and motivate key 
personnel.
Economic Conditions
The Group is dependent on the level of 
activity in the construction industry and 
is therefore susceptible to any changes in 
its cyclical economic conditions.
Lower levels of activity within the 
construction industry could reduce 
sales and production volumes adversely 
affecting the Group’s financial results.
The Group closely monitors trends in the 
industry, invests in market research and 
is an active member of the Construction 
Products Association. The Group uses 
Construction Products Association and 
Euroconstruct forecasts in its budgeting 
process.
The Group closely manages its demand 
forecasts and costs through weekly 
operational review meetings. 
STRATEGIC REPORT Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com
29 Risk Potential Impact Mitigations
Government Action and Policy
The Group is in part dependent on 
Government action and policies relating 
to public and private investment and 
is therefore susceptible to changes in 
Government spending priorities.
Significant downward trends in 
Government spending on public and 
private investment arising from economic 
uncertainty and ongoing austerity 
policies could have an adverse impact on 
the construction industry which could 
impact on sales and production volumes 
affecting the Group’s financial results.
The Group’s strategy is to have its 
operations structured so that it has a 
balanced exposure to the residential, 
commercial and infrastructure 
construction sectors so as to reduce the 
impact of any adverse government action 
or policy on any one of the construction 
sectors.
The Group closely monitors trends in the 
industry, invests in market research and 
is an active member of the Construction 
Products Association.
The Group closely manages its demand 
forecasts and costs through weekly 
operational review meetings.
Government regulations and standards relating to the manufacture and use of building materials
The Group is subject to the requirements 
of UK and European environmental and 
occupational safety and health laws and 
regulations, including obligations to 
investigate and clean up environmental 
contamination on or from properties. 
Failure of the Group to comply with 
changes to environmental regulations 
and other obligations relating to 
environmental matters could result in 
the Group being liable for fines, require 
modification to operations, increase 
manufacturing and delivery costs, 
and could result in the suspension or 
termination of necessary operational 
permits, thereby impacting the Group’s 
financial results.
The Group has a formal Health, Safety & 
Environmental policy, and procedures are 
in place to monitor compliance with the 
policy.
The Group performs internal 
environmental audits and is subjected 
to external environmental audits on a 
periodic basis.
The Group performs weekly and monthly 
reporting on key Health, Safety & 
Environmental matters which require the 
attention of the Polypipe Board.
Product Liability
The Group manufactures products that 
are potentially vital to the safe operation 
of its customers’ products or processes. 
These are often incorporated into the 
fabric of a building or dwelling, or buried 
in the ground as part of an infrastructure 
system and in each case, it would be 
difficult to access, repair, recall or replace 
such products.
A product failure or recall could result 
in a liability claim for personal injury or 
other damage leading to substantial 
money settlements, damage to the 
Group’s brand reputation, costs 
and expenses and diversion of key 
management’s attention from the 
operation of the Group, which could all 
affect the Group’s financial results.
The Group operates comprehensive 
quality assurance systems and procedures 
at each site. 
Wherever required, the Group obtains 
certifications over its products to the 
relevant national and European standards 
including Kitemarks, BBAs, WRCs and 
WRACs. 
The Group maintains product liability 
insurance to cover third party claims 
arising from potential product failures.

Information Systems
The Group is dependent on the 
continued efficient operation of its 
Information Systems and is therefore 
vulnerable to potential failures due to 
power losses, telecommunication failures, 
or from an external security breach due 
to the increasing levels of sophisticated 
cyber-crime now threatening businesses.
Disruption or failure of the Information 
Systems could affect the Group’s ability 
to conduct its ongoing operations which 
could affect the Group’s financial results.
The Group contracts with a third party to 
provide business continuity arrangements 
for wholesale or partial recovery of the 
key servers and applications which are 
used within the UK businesses. These 
continuity plans are subject to periodic 
testing. 
Local back up processes are performed 
on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. 
Firewalls are in place to protect against 
potential viruses and any off site access 
to the Group’s servers is through a secure 
Virtual Private Network.
The Group continually invests in its 
maintenance and upgrades of the 
Information Systems. All upgrades are 
carefully planned and actively managed 
by senior personnel to minimise potential 
business disruption.
Acquisitions
The management of acquisitions activity 
and their integration play a part in 
delivering the Group’s growth strategy 
and there is a risk that any acquisitions 
may not perform as expected.
Ineffective management of acquisitions 
could impact on the Group’s ability to 
fully implement and deliver its growth 
strategy.
Full due diligence is carried out before 
any acquisition is made.
The Group seeks contractual assurances 
from the sellers to mitigate against any 
identified issues or risks.
Formal Board level approvals are 
required in accordance with the Group’s 
delegation of authority structure for any 
acquisitive activity.
The progress of any integration is closely 
monitored at Board and executive team 
level.

RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES
Risk Potential Impact Mitigations
Financial Risk Management
The Group’s operations expose it to a 
variety of financial risks that include the 
effects of:
Price Risk (considered in raw material 
prices above)
The Group has in place financial risk 
management procedures that seek to 
limit the adverse effects of the financial 
risks as follows:
Foreign Exchange Risk – The risk that 
the fair value of a financial instrument or 
future cash flows will fluctuate because 
of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The Group’s risk relates primarily to its 
operating activities where the revenue 
or expense is denominated in a currency 
other than the functional currency of the 
entity undertaking the transaction.
Foreign Exchange Risk – Exchange 
rate fluctuations may adversely affect the 
Group’s results.
Foreign exchange risk – The Group 
enters into forward currency contracts 
for the purchase and sale of foreign 
currencies in order to manage its 
exposure to fluctuations in currency rates 
primarily in respect of US Dollar and 
Euros. It is not possible for the Group to 
mitigate exchange rate differences which 
impact the translation of its overseas 
subsidiaries’ results and net assets as all 
of the Group’s long term borrowings are 
Sterling denominated.
Credit Risk – The risk that a 
counterparty of the Group will not 
be able to meet its obligations under 
a financial instrument or customer 
contract. The Group is exposed to credit 
risk from its trading activities (primarily 
from trade receivables) and from its 
financing activities, including deposits 
with banks. 
Credit Risk – The failure of a 
counterparty to meet their financial 
obligations could lead to a financial loss 
for the Group.
Credit risk – Customer credit risk is 
managed by each subsidiary subject 
to the Group’s established policy, 
procedures and control relating to 
customer credit risk management. Credit 
quality of the customer is assessed based 
on an extensive credit rating scorecard 
and individual credit limits are defined 
in accordance with this assessment. 
Outstanding customer receivables are 
regularly monitored and any shipments 
to major export customers are generally 
covered by letters of credit or credit 
insurance.
Where the Group perceives there to be a 
significant credit exposure it will take out 
credit insurance or obtain an irrevocable 
letter of credit prior to any transaction. 
Credit risk arising from cash deposits 
with banks are managed by the Group’s 
finance department. Investments of 
surplus funds are made only with banks 
that have as a minimum a single A credit 
rating.

Liquidity Risk – The risk that the Group 
will not be able to meet its financial 
obligations as they fall due.
Liquidity Risk – Insufficient funds could 
result in the Group not being able to 
fund its operations.
Liquidity risk – The Group’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure that 
it will always have sufficient liquidity to 
meet its liabilities when due, under both 
normal and stressed conditions, without 
incurring unacceptable losses or risking 
damage to the Group’s reputation.
Interest rate cash flow risk – The risk 
that interest rates could rise impacting on 
the Group’s borrowings.
Interest rate cash flow risk – Increases 
to interest rates could result in significant 
additional interest rate payments being 
required on any borrowings. 
Interest rate cash flow risk – To reduce 
the Group’s exposure to future increases 
in interest rates, the Group has entered 
into interest rate swaps from variable to 
fixed interest rates.

33 POLICY
Polypipe’s policy is to enhance 
shareholder value whilst ensuring we 
provide a safe working environment 
and continually seeking to minimise the 
impact of our operations and products on 
the environment.
The Board considers that operating 
efficiently with high quality standards 
includes promoting high standards of 
health and safety and helping to protect 
the environment.
This section of the strategic report 
sets out our approach to corporate 
responsibility and includes regulatory 
information on carbon emissions, 
employee diversity and our policies in 
relation to the recruitment and retention 
of our employees.
EMPLOYMENT
Our vision for our businesses and 
employees is to have a culture of 
customer focussed continuous 
improvement, driven by teamwork, 
effective communication and personal 
development. Our core values are hard 
work, honesty, trust and integrity and 
maintaining a working environment 
based on mutual respect.
Polypipe is committed to providing the 
appropriate skills and technical training 
which allows employees to operate 
effectively and safely in their roles and 
deliver excellent customer service. As part 
of our ongoing commitment to customer 
service excellence, a further 60 employees

training during the year. The Polypipe 
Terrain and Building Products business 
units also achieved the “Investors in 
People” accreditation in 2015.
Polypipe has consistently provided 
apprenticeships to the communities 
around our businesses by supporting 
enthusiastic, highly motivated people 
who are keen to learn a trade. We 
have an outstanding record of retaining 
apprentices in ongoing, long term, full 
time employment, indeed many of our 
management team started with the 
business as apprentices. We consider it 
an essential part of finding and retaining 
people with the sector specific skills that 
we need.
During 2015 we had 34 apprentices 
employed in our businesses in the UK. 
The majority of our apprenticeships are 
electrical, mechanical and tool-making 
trades but we have also introduced a 
limited number of apprenticeships in 
other disciplines.
Underlining our commitment to 
advanced manufacturing engineering, 
we continue to place apprentices at the 
new Advanced Manufacturing Research 
Centre at the University of Sheffield, 
a state-of-the-art centre which offers 
the very best in practical and academic 
training. In support of our engineering 
focus we continue to work closely with 
Cogent, sector skills council to the 
Science Industry, supporting ongoing 
development of industry specific 
apprenticeship frameworks for the future.
The Group involves employees through 
formal and informal systems of 
communication and consultation. Each 
of our main operating sites have display 
boards which set out our continuous 
improvement strategy and include KPI’s 
updated each month on relevant areas 
to the strategy such as health and safety 
performance, products and process 
improvement initiatives and customer 
satisfaction performance.
Whilst the Group does not have a specific 
human rights policy, people are treated 
in line with internationally proclaimed 
human rights principles.
The Group gives every consideration to 
applicants for employment regardless 
of their sex, sexual orientation, religion, 
colour, race, nationality, marital status or 
disability having regard for their aptitude 
and ability to adequately carry out the 
job whilst maintaining a safe working 
environment. Where employees become 
disabled, the Group endeavours to 
employ them provided there are duties 
they can perform, bearing in mind their 
handicap or disability.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
The Group aims to continuously improve 
the quality and safety of the working 
environment for all employees. The 
Group has a published Health, Safety 
and Environment Policy which sets out 
the overriding principles of health and 
safety for all employees. The business 
units operate to externally accredited ISO/
OHSAS standards.
Achievement of annual Health and 
Safety targets set for each business 
is directly linked to the remuneration 
of the executive directors and certain 
senior managers as explained in the 
Remuneration Committee Report.
Health and Safety achievements in 
the year included:
 RoSPA Gold Award. The Group 
achieved RoSPA gold award for 
exceptional performance and 
dedicated support for health and 
safety within the organisation.
 Polypipe’s tool making and repair 
business, Mason Pinder, achieved 
2,500 days without a lost time 
accident. This was an outstanding 
achievement and a significant 
milestone which everyone at 
Mason Pinder can be proud of. This 
achievement resulted in a donation 
to Cancer Research of £870, which 
means the total amount donated 
across the UK Group was £2,400 
under the ‘Charity Award for Safety 
and Health (CASH)’.

THE ENVIRONMENT AND 
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
We aim to minimise the lasting impact 
of our operations on the environment, 
and sustainability is a key feature of 
our products and their impact on the 
environment. See pages 18 to 23 
for further details of our sustainable 
solutions for the environment.
Our modern and efficient injection 
moulding and extrusion operations use 
significant amounts of electricity. We 
monitor very closely our electricity usage, 
even at a machine level, and take a 
proactive approach to improve energy 
efficiency. During 2015 our energy 
usage increased by 5.2% in line with the 
increase in tonnage throughput.
The Group collects electricity and 
natural gas usage information from 
each operation on a monthly basis. The 
Department for Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs (DEFRA) published national 
carbon conversion factors which were 
then used to calculate the total tonnage 
of CO
2
e produced.
The financial control consolidation 
approach has been used to report our 
greenhouse gas emissions data. This 
method aligns with the reporting scope 
in the financial statements. All entities 
and facilities under financial control are 
included within the disclosure. Emissions 
<1% of the Group’s total CO
2
e relating 
to fugitive emissions and owned vehicles 
are not material and are excluded. As 
such there are no material omissions from 
this disclosure.
Scope 1 emissions in the year amounted 
to 14,030t CO2e (2014 : 13,602t CO2e). 
The intensity ratio amounted to 0.10 
(2014 : 0.11) . Scope 1 emissions are 
direct emissions resulting from fuel usage 
and the operation of facilities.
Scope 2 emissions in the year amounted 
to 36,567t CO
2
e (2014 : 37,219t CO
2
e). 
The intensity ratio amounted to 0.25 
(2014: 0.30). Scope 2 emissions are 
indirect energy emissions resulting from 
purchased electricity, heat, steam or 
cooling for own use.
The sum of both Scope 1 and Scope 
2 emissions in the year amounted to 
50,597t CO
2
e (2014 : 50,821t CO
2
e). The 
combined intensity ratio amounted to 
0.35 (2014 : 0.41).
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR 
CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS
Suppliers are key to our business and 
we endeavour to build long term 
relationships with them based on trust. 
We will seek to extend our supplier base 
if risks of under capacity or resilience 
arise in our supply chain. Polypipe has 
no significant suppliers who are wholly 
dependent on the Group’s business. 
Suppliers are paid in line with contractual 
obligations.
We stay close to our existing and 
potential customers and distributors and 
strive to meet their needs. Our businesses 
are focussed on achieving market leading 
delivery service levels for our customers 
and to respond quickly to their emerging 
requirements.
POLYPIPE AND THE LOCAL 
COMMUNITY
Each operation is aware of its role 
within its local community. Wherever 
possible they seek to recruit locally and 
retain a skilled local workforce. They 
are encouraged to build relationships 
with local community organisations and 
to support charitable initiatives. These 
activities range from the organisation 
of our Annual Charity Sailing Regatta 
in which over 700 people from our 
customers and associates participated, a 
number of charity cycle events through 
to quiz nights and cake sales. Our 
employees raised over £26,000 for 
worthwhile causes during the year from 
these activities.
Charitable donations by Group 
companies during the year were £19,000 
(2014 : £11,000).
ANTI-BRIBERY AND 
CORRUPTION POLICY
The Group seeks to prohibit all forms of 
bribery and corruption within its business 
and complies with the requirements of all 
applicable Bribery and Corruption Laws.
The Group requires all relevant employees 
and agents to confirm each year that 
they remain in compliance with the 
Group’s Anti-Bribery Policy.
This Strategic Report has been approved 
by the Board of Directors.

I am pleased to present the Company’s 
Corporate Governance report for the year 
ended 31 December 2015.
This year has seen several role changes 
within the Board, I became Chairman 
following the Annual General Meeting 
on 27 May 2015 and I am delighted 
that Paul Dean agreed to take on the 
position of Senior Independent Director. 
At the end of the year, we also reassessed 
Mark Hammond’s independence and 
as a Board agreed that he is now 
independent. Details of our re-evaluation 
are given on page 43. I am confident 
that we have a strong and diverse Board 
in place, with the necessary motivation, 
experience and skills to support the 
Company with any future challenges. 
We held an internal review of our Board’s 
performance this year and continue to 
keep the composition of the Board under 
close review.
The following report explains the 
main features of the Company’s 
governance structure to enable a greater 
understanding of how the principles 
and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“UK Code”) have 
been applied and to provide insight into 
how the Board and management team 
run the business for the benefit of the 
Shareholders.
I am pleased with the progress we have 
made in respect of governance this year, 
but at the same time recognise that we 
cannot be complacent. I will continue 
to work with the Board to ensure 
continuous improvements are made in 
this important area and a compliance 
culture is embedded across the Group, 
reflecting the standard of behaviours and 
decision making expected of us. In the 
following pages, we explain in greater 
detail our approach to governance – 
how the Board and its Committees have 
fulfilled their governance responsibilities 
during the year to ensure that robust 
governance practices are embedded 
across the group. As always, we 
welcome questions or comments from 
shareholders either via our website  
www.polypipe.com or in person at the 
Annual General Meeting.

INTRODUCTION  
FROM THE CHAIRMAN
Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2015
Polypipe Group plc
40 COMPLIANCE WITH UK 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
CODE
This report which is available on the 
Company’s website explains key features 
of the Company’s governance structure 
to provide a greater understanding 
of how the main principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2014 
(“Code”) published in September 2014 
by the Financial Reporting Council 
(“FRC”), have been applied and to areas 
of focus during the year. The Code can 
be found on the FRC’s Website:  
www.frc.org.uk
The report also includes items required 
by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. 
The Board has ultimate responsibility for 
the approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts. It has considered the content 
and confirmed that the Annual Report 
and Accounts taken as a whole are 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the necessary information for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy.
In accordance with the Listing Rules 
of the UK Listing Authority, the Board 
confirms that throughout the year ended 
31 December 2015 and as at the date of 
this report, the Company has complied 
with the main principles and with the 
exceptions noted below:
 The code recommends that the senior 
independent director should attend 
sufficient meetings with a range of 
major shareholders to listen to their 
views in order to help develop a 
balanced understanding of the issues 
and concerns of major shareholders 
(code E.1.1.). During the year Ron 
Marsh, Paul Dean and Moni Mannings 
have offered to meet with the 
Company’s major shareholders. Two 
shareholders accepted the invitation 
to meet with Ron Marsh and no 
shareholders accepted the invitation 
to meet with Paul Dean and Moni 
Mannings. The Board believes that 
there were appropriate mechanisms in 
place during the year for the Board to 
understand the views of Shareholders 
and to communicate with them on 
matters including governance, strategy 
and performance.
Initially the Company did comply with the 
following provisions; however, upon Alan 
Thomson’s retirement and Ron Marsh’s 
appointment as Chairman on 27 May 
2015, the Company ceased to comply 
with the provisions identified below, 
although, the Company did continue to 
have two independent Non-Executives.
 Code B.1.2. – The code recommends 
that at least half the board, excluding 
the chairman, should comprise 
independent non-executive directors 
and that a smaller company should 
have at least two independent non-
executive directors.
 Code B.2.1. – The code recommends 
that there should be a nomination 
committee which should lead the 
process for board appointments and 
make recommendations to the board 
regarding appointments and which 
comprises a majority of independent 
non-executive directors.

OUR GOVERNANCE Subsequently on 21 December 2015 
the Nominations Committee and 
Board reassessed Mark Hammond’s 
independence and agreed that he was 
an independent non-executive director, 
accordingly the Company is once more 
in compliance with the higher provision 
requirements of a FTSE 250 company.
HOW THE BOARD WORKS
The Board and its Committees
The Board is responsible for the 
leadership and direction of the Group 
and is ultimately responsible to the 
Company’s Shareholders for the Group’s 
long-term success. The Board takes the 
lead in areas such as strategy, financial 
policy and making sure we maintain 
a sound system of internal control. By 
delegating authority to its Committees, 
the Board directs and reviews the Group’s 
operations within an agreed framework 
of controls, allowing risk to be assessed 
and managed within agreed parameters.
The Board has established a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for its 
approval and has delegated other 
specific responsibilities to its principal 
committees: the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees. These 
are clearly defined within the terms of 
reference of the respective committees. 
The schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board includes the consideration and 
approval of:
 Strategy and overall management and 
leadership of the Group;
 Financial items – including the 
Group’s annual budget, dividend 
policy, annual and half yearly 
accounts, accounting policies, and 
monetary limits;
 Risk management system and internal 
controls;
 Contracts with third parties not in the 
ordinary course of business:
 Legal, administration and pension 
arrangements;
 The Group’s corporate governance 
arrangements,
 The application of the Company’s 
share options schemes as 
recommended by the Remuneration 
Committee,
 D&O insurance coverage and the 
commencement or settlement of any 
litigation;
 Communications with Shareholders 
and the issue of Shareholder circulars;
 Board and senior management 
appointments and arrangements; and
 Authorising conflicts of interest where 
permitted by the Company’s articles 
of association.
The Board has also delegated to the 
Chief Executive Officer the responsibility 
for implementing the Group’s business 
model and for the day-to-day operational 
management of the group. The Chief 
Executive Officer is supported in carrying 
out his responsibilities by the Chief 
Financial Officer and the operations’ 
board.
The Board has direct access to the 
Company Secretary and may take 
independent professional advice in the 
furtherance of their duties if necessary.
Board Composition, Qualification 
and Experience
At the year end, the Board is made 
up of the independent Non-Executive 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and 
three Non-Executive Directors. The 
previous independent non-executive 
Chairman, Alan Thomson, was 
considered to be independent from the 
beginning of the period until he retired 
from the Board on 27 May 2015. Details 
of the individual Directors can be found 
on pages 38 to 39. The Non-Executive 
Directors were appointed for the diversity 
of their backgrounds as well as their 
personal attributes and experience. 
The current Board members bring a 
wide range of skills and experience to 
the Board and all actively contribute in 
discussion.
In accordance with B.1.1 the Nomination 
Committee and the Board have 
considered the independence of each of 
the Non-Executive Directors.  As in the 
previous year, the Board considered that 
the following Directors were deemed to 
be independent throughout the period:
1. Ron Marsh 
2. Paul Dean 
3. Moni Mannings

Polypipe Group plc
42 The Nomination Committee also re-considered Mark Hammond’s independence following the final disposal of Cavendish Square 
Partners Limited Partnership’s (“Cavendish”) shareholding. The Nomination Committee noted that the UK Code provision B.1.1. 
recommends that a director not be considered independent if he meets any of the following:
UK Code provision B.1.1. Criteria Committee’s findings
Has been an employee of the company or group within the last 
five years.
He has never been an employee of the Company.
Has, or has had within the last three years, a material business 
relationship with the company either directly, or as a partner, 
shareholder, director or senior employee of a body that has such 
a relationship with the company.
He has not been involved in any material business relationship.
Has received or receives additional remuneration from the 
company apart from a director’s fee, participates in the 
company’s share option or a performance related pay scheme, 
or is a member of the company’s pension scheme.
Whilst Mark Hammond was appointed by Cavendish his director 
fee was paid directly to them. Subsequently this has been 
amended and he is paid directly his directors fee. He has not 
received any additional remuneration. He has never participated 
in the company’s share options, performance related pay 
scheme or pension.
Has close family ties with any of the company’s advisers, 
directors or senior employees.
He has no close family ties with the company’s advisors directors 
or senior employees.
Holds cross-directorships or has significant links with other 
directors through involvement in other companies or bodies.
Mark Hammond does not hold any cross directorships or 
significant links with the other directors directly or indirectly.
Represents a significant shareholder. Since 8 October 2015 neither Mark Hammond nor Cavendish 
hold shares in the company.
Has served on the board for more than nine years from  
the date of their first election.
Mark Hammond was appointed to the Board on 16 April 2014.
The Nomination Committee also 
confirmed that Mark Hammond provides 
effective oversight and challenge 
of Management. In addition, the 
Company has discussed with several 
major shareholders the value that Mr 
Hammond brings to the company and 
his role and they agree it is appropriate 
for Mark Hammond to be considered an 
independent non-executive director by 
the Company.
For the above reasons the Board, on 
the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee (with Mark Hammond absent 
from both meetings’ discussions), have 
determined that Mark Hammond is an 
Independent Non-Executive Director.
In accordance with UK Code provision 
B.7.1, at the 2016 AGM, the Board is 
proposing that all of the Directors will 
be subject to annual re-election with the 
following exception. On 23 November 
2015, the current Chief Financial Officer 
Peter Shepherd expressed his desire to 
retire from the Company and the Board. 
The Company announced that Martin 
Payne will succeed Peter Shepherd as 
Chief Financial Officer on a date yet to 
be determined and that Martin will be 
put forward to be elected as a member 
of Polypipe’s Board at the forthcoming 
AGM.
Role of the Chairman and  
Chief Executive
The roles and responsibilities of the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive are 
separate and clearly defined.
It is the Chairman’s duty to provide 
overall leadership and governance 
of the Board. In performing this role, 
the Chairman sets the Board agenda, 
ensures that adequate time is available 
for discussion of all agenda items and 
promotes a culture of openness and 
debate at Board meetings. The Chairman 
is also responsible for ensuring that the 
Directors have an understanding of the 
views of major Shareholders.
The Chief Executive is responsible for 
management of the Group’s business, 
consistent with the strategy and 
commercial objectives agreed by the 
Board. He leads the Group Executive 
team in effecting decisions of the Board 
and its Committees and is responsible 
for the maintenance and protection 
of the reputation of the Group. The 
Chief Executive is also responsible for 
promoting the conduct of the affairs of 
the Group with the highest standards 
of integrity, probity and corporate 
governance.

43
OUR GOVERNANCE Interaction between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive
As noted above, the role of the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive are separate with 
a distinct division of responsibilities. The 
partnership between Ron Marsh and 
David Hall is based on mutual trust and 
facilitated by regular contact between 
them. The separation of authority 
enhances independent oversight of the 
executive management by the Board and 
helps to ensure that no one individual on 
the Board has unfettered authority.
Role of the Senior Independent 
Director
As a result of Ron Marsh’s succession to 
Chairman of the Board at the last Annual 
General Meeting on 27 May 2015 and 
recommendation from the Nomination 
Committee, the Board appointed Paul 
Dean as Senior Independent Director 
(“SID”). Paul Dean is available to 
Shareholders if they have concerns that 
cannot be addressed through normal 
channels. The role of the SID is to act as 
a sounding board for the Chairman and 
an intermediary for the other Directors 
when necessary. The SID is also available 
to chair the Board in the absence of the 
Chairman. Whilst there were no requests 
from Shareholders or Directors for access 
to the SID during the year, the role of 
the SID is considered to be an important 
check and balance in the Group’s 
governance structure.
Appointment and Tenure
The Non-Executive Directors serve on 
the basis of letters of appointment 
which are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office. The letters 
of appointment set out the expected 
time commitment of the Non-Executive 
Directors who, on appointment, 
undertake that they have sufficient time 
to meet what is expected of them. There 
is no fixed expiry date although typically 
a Non-Executive Director is expected to 
serve two three year terms but may be 
invited to serve a third three year term. 
There is no notice period in their letters 
of appointment.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts 
are also available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office. The notice 
period for the Executive Directors is 
twelve months.
Directors’ Induction and Training / 
Professional Development
The Chairman, with the support of the 
Company Secretary, is responsible for the 
induction of new Directors and ongoing 
development of all Directors. No new 
directors joined the Board in 2015.
As the internal and external business 
environment changes, it is important 
to ensure the Directors’ skills and 
knowledge are refreshed and updated 
regularly. During the period, the 
Company’s auditors held a session with 
Directors on refreshing their knowledge 
of their obligations in terms of the going 
concern statement and the content of 
the disclosures to be made under the 
viability statement. The members of the 
Remuneration Committee also attended 
a session on remuneration practices and 
use of benchmarks for assessing the 
performance of senior executives.
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
Each Director has a duty under the 
Companies Act 2006 to avoid a situation 
where he or she may have a direct or 
indirect interest that conflicts with the 
interests of the Company. The Company 
has robust procedures in place to identify, 
authorise and manage such conflicts 
of interest and these procedures have 
operated effectively during the year.
All potential conflicts approved by 
the Board are recorded in an Interests 
Register which is maintained by the 
Company Secretary and reviewed by the 
Board on a regular basis. Directors have a 
continuing duty to update the Board with 
any changes to their conflicts of interest.
Directors’ Indemnity and Insurance
Details of the Directors’ indemnity 
arrangements can be found on pages 63 
of the Directors’ report.
Internal Controls and Risk 
Management
The Board is responsible for determining 
the nature and extent of the significant 
risks it is willing to take in achieving its 
strategic objectives. It is also responsible 
for maintaining sound risk and internal 
control systems in accordance with 
section C.2.3 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and confirms that:
 there is an on-going process for 
identifying, evaluating, and managing 
the principal risks faced by the Group
 the systems have been in place for 
the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts
 they are regularly reviewed by the 
Board
 the systems accord with the FRC 
guidance on risk management, 
internal control and related financial 
and business reporting.
The effectiveness of these systems is also 
reviewed through the work of the Audit 
Committee described on pages 51 to 53.
The key risks which the Board has 
focused on this year together with their 
potential impact and mitigating actions 
are set out in the Risk Management 
report on pages 28 to 33.
The Company has a Risk Management 
Framework which adopts a top down 
and a bottom up view of the key risks 
which involves both the downward 
cascade and upward escalation of risks 
between Group and the Business Units. 
It comprises a risk register template, a 
risk profile template and assessment 
guidelines to be used by both the Group 
and Business Units when considering 
risk. It also includes a detailed approach 
to formally recording and independently 
assessing Group level risks.
CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2015
Polypipe Group plc
44 The Board has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls and risk management and is 
satisfied that it complies with Principle 
C.2. of the UK Code.
FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS 
REPORTING PROCESS
The Board recognises its duty to ensure 
that the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the performance, strategy 
and business model of the company.  
In addition to the annual report the 
company also ensures that other price-
sensitive reports and other information 
are published externally.
The Group has a thorough assurance 
process in place in respect of the 
preparation, verification and approval of 
periodic financial reports which is set out 
in the Report of the Audit Committee on 
pages 51 to 53.
This process includes:
 the involvement of qualified, 
professional employees with an 
appropriate level of experience (both 
in group finance and throughout the 
Polypipe Group businesses);
 formal sign-offs from appropriate 
business unit senior executives;
 comprehensive review and, where 
appropriate, challenge from 
appropriate group senior executives 
and executive directors;
 a transparent process to ensure full 
disclosure of information to the 
external auditors;
 oversight by the group’s Audit 
Committee, involving (amongst other 
duties):
 — a detailed review of key financial 
reporting judgements which have 
been discussed by Management;
 — review and, where appropriate, 
challenge on matters including:
 the consistency of, and 
any changes to, significant 
accounting policies and 
practices during the year;
 significant adjustments 
resulting from an external 
audit;
 the viability statement 
assumptions; and
 the going concern 
assumption.
The above process provides comfort 
to the Board that the annual report 
and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable.
BOARD MEETINGS
The Board met regularly during the year, holding 9 Board meetings and a number of other meetings and teleconferences to discuss 
and review progress on issues affecting the Group throughout the year. A number of Board Committee meetings were also held 
during the year. Details of attendance at Board and Committee meetings are shown in the table below.

OUR GOVERNANCE CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
As the table demonstrates, every effort 
is made to ensure that all Directors, 
where possible, attend scheduled Board 
meetings. However, in the event that a 
Director is unable to attend a meeting, 
they are nevertheless provided with the 
meeting papers and information relating 
to the meeting and are able to discuss 
the issues arising with the Chairman and 
other directors.
Senior management from across the 
Group, and advisers, attend some of the 
meetings for discussion of specific items 
in greater depth.
In order to provide the Board with greater 
visibility of the Group’s operations and 
to provide further opportunities to meet 
senior management, the Board intends to 
visit at least one of the Group’s business 
unit locations each year. Such visits allow 
the Board to gain a deeper understanding 
of local market dynamics and to assess 
management performance and potential. 
During the year, the Board visited the 
Group’s operations in Aylesford and 
Caerphilly, which is the site of the newly 
acquired business of the Group, Nuaire.
In November 2015, the Board held its 
Strategy Day, where it spent a full day 
with senior management to discuss 
current performance of the Group and 
the Strategic Plan. Members of senior 
management presented to the Board the 
operational and financial performance 
of each business in detail and explained 
the growth prospects of each market 
segment in the UK and abroad.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Company currently operates three 
Board committees: the Audit Committee, 
the Remuneration Committee and the 
Nominations Committee. The role and 
responsibilities of each Board Committee 
are set out in formal Terms of Reference. 
These Terms of Reference are available  
on the Company’s website at  
www.polypipe.com
The Board Committees make 
recommendations to the Board as they 
see fit.
BOARD EVALUATION AND 
EFFECTIVENESS
In accordance with Code Provision B.6.1 
- 6.3, the Board and its Committees 
underwent their internal evaluation 
conducted by the Company Secretary 
under the guidance of the Chairman and 
the Senior Independent Director. The 
Company Secretary distributed a tailored, 
high level questionnaire for the Directors 
completion. The questionnaire was 
structured to provide Directors with an 
opportunity to express their views about:
1.  The performance of the Board and its 
Committees, including how Directors 
work together as a whole.
2.  The balance of skills, independence 
and knowledge of the Directors.
3.  Director self-assessment and training 
needs.
In addition, the Chairman discussed with 
each Director their performance and the 
Senior Independent Director lead the 
assessment of the Chairman’s leadership.
A report on the findings of the 
performance evaluation was prepared by 
the Company Secretary and presented to 
the Board in November 2015. The results 
of the evaluation indicated that the Board 
is working harmoniously and that there 
are no significant concerns among the 
present Directors about its effectiveness 
to exercise their duties. Notwithstanding 
the above, the Directors recognised 
the need to continuously improve and 
evolve their behaviour. Going forward 
the following actions were agreed as a 
result of the exercise and these will be 
progressed over the coming year. These 
included:
 That the Non-Executives be given 
more detail of the company’s 
succession planning of the senior 
management;
 That the board has greater 
understanding of diversity within the 
business.
In addition, the Board plans to undertake 
an externally facilitated assessment 
process in 2016 to enable full review of 
the skills and attributes of its Directors 
in compliance with provision B.6 of the 
Code.
The Board considered each of the 
Directors to be effective and to 
demonstrate commitment to his or 
her role. It was acknowledged that the 
objective of the Board in supporting 
the executive team to improve the 
performance of the Group and promote 
the interest of the Shareholders and 
stakeholders had been achieved and 
it would continue to constructively 
challenge the executive team.

OUR GOVERNANCE MAIN ACTIVITIES DURING  
THE YEAR
During the year under review and as 
advised previously, the Nomination 
Committee considered the appointment 
of a new Chairman ahead of 
Alan Thomson’s departure. It also 
deliberated the appointment of a Senior 
Independent Director (‘SID’). After careful 
consideration, the Committee agreed 
that Paul Dean possessed the necessary 
skills, knowledge and experience and 
recommended to the Board that he be 
appointed as the Company’s SID effective 
from 27 May 2015. 
Following Cavendish Square Partners’ sale 
of the remaining shares in October 2015, 
the Nomination Committee evaluated 
Mark Hammond’s independence. 
After careful review and reflection the 
Committee agreed that Mark Hammond 
was independent (as explained on page 
43 of the Corporate Governance report) 
and recommend to the Board that Mark 
Hammond be considered independent 
within the UK Code requirements. 
I, Paul Dean and Mark Hammond did  
not participate in the Nomination 
Committee discussions in respect of 
being appointed Chairman, SID and 
independence respectively.
The Committee has also led the 
recruitment of the Chief Financial Officer, 
I am delighted to present the report of 
the Nomination Committee for 2015. As 
you will know, there have been a number 
of role changes within the Board during 
the course of the year which has kept the 
Committee active. I will be available at 
the AGM to answer any questions about 
the work of the Committee.
COMMITTEE COMPOSITION
Thoughout the year the Committee 
has comprised the Chairman, all of the 
Non Executive Directors and the Chief 
Executive Officer. Accordingly there were 
six members initially however, following 
Alan Thomson’s departure, there are now 
five. The Committee is chaired by the 
Board Chairman except when considering 
his own re-election.
Following Alan Thomson’s departure the 
Company ceased to be in compliance 
with provision B2.1. because a majority 
of the members were not independent 
as I became chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer and Mark Hammond 
were not considered independent. 
However, following the sale of the 
shares by Cavendish Square Partners 
the Committee have re-evaluated if 
Mark Hammond is independent and 
has subsequently determined that he 
is an independent director as explained 
on page 66 of Directors report. There 
have been no further changes in the 
membership of the Committee since the 
year end.
The members of the Committee and 
details of their attendance at Committee 
meetings are set out on page 45. 
Biographies of each member are 
shown on pages 38 to 39. Under the 
Committee’s Terms of Reference the 
Committee will normally meet not less 
than twice a year and at such other times 
as the Chairman shall require. After each 
Committee meeting, the Chairman reports 
to the Board on the main items discussed.
ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee’s main 
responsibilities are to evaluate the 
structure, size and composition (including 
the skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity) required of the Board and the 
Committees; to give full consideration 
to succession planning of Directors and 
other senior executives and to assist with 
the selection process of new Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors including

INTRODUCTION FROM THE CHAIR  
OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2015
Polypipe Group plc
48 details of which are given under section 
below – Appointment of Chief Financial 
Officer.
As stated in the Corporate Governance 
report, all of the Company’s Directors 
will retire and each will offer themselves 
for election at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) in accordance 
with the 2014 UK Corporate Governance 
Code Provision B.7.1. In proposing their 
re-election, the Chairman confirms 
that the Nominations Committee has 
considered the formal performance 
evaluation in respect of those Directors 
seeking re-election and the contribution 
and commitment of the Directors that 
are required to offer themselves for re-
election. He has confirmed to the Board 
that their performance and commitment 
is such that the Company should support 
their re-election.
In respect of Peter Shepherd’s retirement 
as a member of the Board, it is expected 
that Martin Payne will be appointed to 
the Board as Chief Financial Officer at the 
forthcoming AGM. 
No Director was able to vote in respect of 
their own re-election when consideration 
was given to director re-election at the 
AGM.
Information on the Directors’ service 
agreements, shareholdings and share 
options of the Company is set out in the 
Directors’ remuneration report on pages 
55 to 61. 
APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF 
FINANCIAL OFFICER
The Committee has an established 
formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new 
directors and senior executives with due 
regard to diversity. It is our belief that 
having executives and non-executives 
on the Board that are diverse in age, 
experience, nationality or gender provides 
significant benefits to the organisation.
Prior to making an appointment, the 
Committee evaluates the balance of 
skills, knowledge and expertise required 
of the new recruit and of the diversity 
required on the Board. Having completed 
this assessment, the Committee prepared 
a description of the role and capabilities 
required, with a view to appointing the 
most suitable candidate. The Committee 
uses open advertising or the services of 
external recruitment agencies to facilitate 
the search and considers candidates 
on merit, and against objective criteria 
ensuring that appointees have sufficient 
time to devote to the position in the light 
of their other significant commitments 
and their having no conflicts of interest.
The Committee engaged executive 
recruitment firm Zygos, to identify 
potential candidates for the role of Chief 
Financial Officer. Zygos has no connection 
with the Company. A long list of possible 
applicants were drawn up, David Hall 
and Paul Dean reviewed the potential 
candidates CVs before identifying a 
shortlist of candidates. The first round 
of interviews was held by Mr Hall. The 
second round of interviews was held by 
Mr Hall and Mr Dean. In the final round 
of interviews, the selected candidates 
were interviewed by the Chairman, Paul 
Dean and Moni Mannings. All Committee 
members independently identified 
Martin Payne as the preferred candidate 
having the necessary attributes and skills 
required of a Chief Financial Officer and 
the Committee recommended to the 
Board the appointment of Martin Payne 
as Peter Shepherd’s successor.
SUCCESSION PLANNING
In addition to the appointments referred 
to above a key activity of the Committee 
is to keep under review the Company’s 
succession plans for members of the 
Board and senior managers over the 
short, medium and long term to ensure 
the Board and senior management 
remains appropriately balanced between 
new and innovative thinking and longer 
term stability.
Board appointment criteria are considered 
automatically as part of the Committee’s 
approval of succession planning. The 
Committee believes that limited tenure 
of the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors and their subsequent enforced 
retirement as directors is not always 
appropriate, and matters of Director 
tenure are viewed on a case by case 
basis. However, currently all the Non-
Executive Directors and the Chairman 
have been appointed for less than 6 years 
as identified in provision B.2.3. of the UK 
Code.
The Committee supports diversity, 
accepting the advantages that come 
from having diverse viewpoints and the 
influence in decision making. It is the aim 
of the Committee to always consider the 
benefits that arise from a diverse Board 
when making board appointments. The 
Committee does not judge it appropriate 
to introduce a quota system to enhance 
diversity in all of its forms to the 
Board. The Company’s recruitment and 
appointment strategy is based on the 
merits of the candidates. Currently one of 
the six directors is female. 
Details of diversity within our workforce, 
including at Board and Executive 
management level can be found on 
page 34.
TENURE OF NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS
Appointments to the Board are made 
for an initial term of three years and are 
ordinarily limited to three consecutive 
terms in office subject to annual re-
election by the shareholders at the AGM.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
PRIORITIES FOR 2016
During the forthcoming year the 
Committee will be focusing on the 
succession planning of the senior 
Executives taking into account the 
challenges and opportunities facing the 
Group and the future skills and expertise 
needed by the business.

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP 
AND MEETINGS
The Committee is appointed by the 
Board and comprises three Non-Executive 
Directors. All Committee members are 
considered independent (Mark Hammond 
was re-evaluated as independent by the 
Board on 21 December 2015). 
In accordance with the requirements of 
provision C.3.1. of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, Paul Dean is 
designated as the Committee member 
with recent and relevant financial 
experience. All other members of the 
Committee are deemed to have the 
necessary ability and experience to 
understand the financial statements. 
The Committee discharges its 
responsibilities through a series of 
scheduled formal meetings during 
the year. Each meeting has a formal 
agenda which is linked to the events 
in the financial calendar of the Group. 
Attendees at each of the meetings are 
the Committee members as well as, by 
invitation, the Chief Financial Officer, 
the Group Financial Controller, and 
the external auditor, EY. The Company 
Secretary is also Secretary to the Audit 
Committee.
The Committee held four formal 
meetings during the year. In line with 
best practice, the Committee twice 
met with the EY Audit Partner without 
management being present. 
GOVERNANCE
The effectiveness of the Committee was 
considered as part of the Board and 
Committee evaluation detailed on page 
46. At its meeting in November 2015, 
the Committee considered the contents 
of the review and concluded that the 
evaluation had found the Committee to 
operate effectively and provide robust 
challenge to the business.
MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE 
COMMITTEE DURING THE 
YEAR
As part of the process of working with 
the Board to carry out its responsibilities 
and to maximise effectiveness, meetings 
of the Committee normally take place 
prior to the Board meetings.
At these meetings the Committee 
focused on the following areas:
Financial Reporting
During the year, Audit Committee 
meetings were held prior to the Board 
meetings to approve the Group’s 
interim and annual financial statement 
announcements and to consider the 
financial reporting judgements made by 
the management. These considerations 
are made through review of the 
accounting papers and financial reports 
prepared by management and reports 
prepared by the Group’s external Auditor.
The Committee also reported to the 
Board that it considered that, taken as 
a whole, the 2015 Annual Report was 
fair, balanced and understandable and 
included the necessary information to 
assess the performance and strategy of 
the Group.
Significant areas of judgements
The significant judgements reviewed by 
the Committee in respect of the year 
under review were as follows:
 Provisions for customer rebates 
– The Committee considered the 
subjectivity and recognition of 
customer rebate liabilities at the 
interim and year end; 
REPORT OF THE  
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com

OUR GOVERNANCE  Goodwill impairment – The 
Committee considered a detailed 
report prepared by management 
setting out the assumptions used 
in determining whether goodwill 
required impairment for any of 
the Business Units. This included 
a review of the discount rate and 
growth factors used to calculate the 
discounted cash flow calculation, 
the sensitivity analysis applied, and 
the projected future cash flows used 
to support the carrying value of the 
goodwill; and
 Intangible asset valuation and fair 
value adjustments – The Committee 
considered a detailed report prepared 
by management setting out the 
assumptions used in determining the 
valuation of identifiable intangible 
assets and considered any fair value 
adjustments to tangible assets 
made following the acquisitions of 
Nuaire and Surestop. This included 
a review of the nature of intangible 
assets identified, the valuation 
methodologies applied, the discount 
rates, growth factors and economic 
life used to calculate the discounted 
cash flow calculations, and the 
projected future cash flows used to 
support their values.
Internal control, internal audit and 
risk management
The Committee has reviewed and 
approved the scope of the rolling internal 
audit work programme in relation to the 
Group’s internal controls and procedures 
at each of the four meetings held during 
the year. 
The Committee reviews and challenges 
the results and reports from the internal 
audit work programme and the adequacy 
of managements responses and 
resolution. 
The Group’s risk assessment process 
including how significant financial risks 
are managed and mitigated is a key area 
of focus for the Committee. During the 
year under review, the Committee has 
monitored and reviewed the Group’s 
risk management development which 
has included a review of the results 
of Polypipe Group’s self-assessment 
against the FRC Guidance relating to 
Risk Management and the results of an 
external review by Ernst & Young who 
carried out the FPP review as part of 
the IPO process. The Committee further 
considered a presentation by the Group’s 
Information Systems Director relating to 
the IT security systems which the business 
has in place to protect itself against 
potential cyber security and other IT risks 
and disaster recovery procedures.
Other activities
Other activities undertaken by the 
Committee during the year included the 
following:
 Considered the external audit plan 
and agreed the audit fee;
 Considered the viability statement 
and going concern assumption;
 Reviewed the insurance policies in 
place to protect the Group;
 Reviewed the Committee’s 
performance, effectiveness and 
constitution; and
 Recommended the Audit Committee 
Report for approval by the Board.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
Appointment
The Committee carefully considers the 
reappointment of the Auditor each year 
prior to making their recommendation 
to the Shareholders. As part of this 
process, the Committee considers 
the independence of the Auditor, the 
effectiveness of the external audit 
process, its remuneration, and the 
terms of engagement. The Committee 
agreed the audit fee. Having reviewed 
the performance of EY in 2015, the 
Committee has decided to recommend to 
the Board that EY should be reappointed 
for the 2016 audit and a resolution to 
this effect will be put to the 2016 AGM. 
In accordance with current professional 
standards, the external Auditor is 
required to change the lead partner 
every five years in order to protect 
auditor independence and objectivity. 
EY were awarded the external audit in 
2012 following a competitive tendering 
process and therefore no rotation of the 
lead partner is required until 2017. In 
accordance with the recent changes to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
CMA order and EU Audit Directive, it is 
the Group’s intention to put the audit 
out to tender at least every ten years. 
Accordingly the company will comply 
with the CMA order. 
Independence
The independence of the external 
Auditor has been confirmed by EY in 
November 2015 and March 2016 at 
the Audit Committee meetings. The 
Committee considered EY’s presentation 
on auditor independence and confirmed 
that it considered the Auditor to be 
independent.
REPORT OF THE  
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2015
Polypipe Group plc
52 Non-audit services 
The Group’s non-audit services policy 
excludes the external Auditor from 
performing non-audit services (with 
the exception of performing interim 
reviews, and local overseas filings of 
less than £10k). This further increases 
auditor objectivity and independence. 
Any significant non-audit services will 
be awarded via a competitive tender 
process. 
There were two exceptions to this 
policy during 2015 where the External 
Auditor performed non-audit services. 
The Auditors performed a review of 
compliance with the 2014 Corporate 
Governance Code and also an adequacy 
of working capital review for a 
shareholder circular relating to the Nuaire 
acquisition. The circular was subsequently 
not required as the transaction fell 
outside the stock market criteria for such 
circulars. The amount paid to EY for these 
non-audit services amounted to £38,000. 
The Audit Committee considered EY 
were best placed to provide these 
non-audit services and the level of fees 
involved would not compromise their 
independence.
Effectiveness of the external audit 
process
The Committee adopted a formal 
process for reviewing the effectiveness 
of EY during the year under review. This 
process included the following:
 An assessment of the engagement 
partner and the audit team;
 A review of the audit approach, 
scope, determination of significant 
risk areas and materiality;
 The execution of the audit;
 Interaction with management and 
communication with and support to 
the Committee;
 The quality of any recommendation 
points; and
 A review of independence, objectivity 
and scepticism.
After considering the above matters, the 
Committee considered that the audit had 
been effective and recommended to the 
Board that EY be reappointed as external 
Auditor to the Group.
FRAUD, WHISTLE-BLOWING 
AND THE BRIBERY ACT
The Committee monitors any reported 
incidents under its whistle-blowing policy. 
This policy is included in the Employee 
Handbook and sets out the procedure for 
employees to raise legitimate concerns 
about any wrongdoing in financial 
reporting or other matters such as: 
 Something that could be unlawful; 
 A miscarriage of justice; 
 A danger to the health and safety of 
any individual;
 Damage to the environment; or
 Improper conduct. 
There were no concerns raised up to 
Group level which required the attention 
of the Committee during the year.
The Committee also reviews the Group’s 
procedure for detecting fraud and the 
systems and controls in place to prevent 
a breach of anti-bribery legislation. The 
Group Finance Manual sets out the 
procedures to which employees must 
adhere and is aimed at reducing the risk 
of fraud from occurring. The Group is 
committed to a zero-tolerance position 
with regard to bribery. Those employees 
which the Group considers more likely to 
be exposed to potential breaches of its 
Group policy and statutory obligations 
under the UK Bribery Act have been 
provided with relevant guidance on 
compliance with their obligations. 
The Group maintains a record of 
all employees who have received 
this guidance and requests annual 
confirmations from each individual 
stating that they have complied with the 
Group’s anti-bribery policies.

OUR GOVERNANCE DEAR SHAREHOLDER

54 UNAUDITED INFORMATION
IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2016
This section provides an overview of how the Committee is proposing to implement our remuneration policy in 2016 for the 
current Executive Directors. The remuneration arrangements for the new CFO will be finalised ahead of him joining the Company 
later in 2016. Those arrangements will be consistent with our existing remuneration policy and will be fully disclosed in next year’s 
Remuneration Report.
Base salary
As described in the Statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, a standard annual salary review has been carried 
out by the Committee. The Committee approved a 2.5% increase in Executive Director salaries effective from 1 January 2016. This 
increase is consistent with the average salary increase awarded to the Company’s UK workforce for 2016.

Pension and benefits
The Executive Directors will receive a Company contribution worth 20% of salary to the Group Pension Plan / a personal pension 
scheme and / or as a cash allowance. They will also receive a standard package of other benefits consistent with those received in 
2015.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus plan for 2016 will be broadly consistent with the bonus plan operated in 2015. Key features of the plan for  
2016 are: 
 There will be a maximum bonus opportunity of 125% of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO.
 25% of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan. These shares will be released half 
after two years post grant and half after three years post grant.
 In the event that a material misstatement or miscalculation subsequently comes to light which resulted in an overpayment 
under the annual bonus plan or if evidence comes to light of material misconduct by an individual or if evidence emerges of 
a material health and safety breach, then the Committee has the flexibility to withhold the value of shares granted under the 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan and/or to require repayment of an appropriate portion of the annual bonus cash award in respect of 
the relevant bonus year.
The annual bonus for 2016 for Executive Directors will be determined as detailed below:  
As a percentage of maximum bonus opportunity
As a percentage of maximum bonus opportunity  
Measure CEO CFO
Group EBIT 70% 70%
Working capital 20% 20%

The targets for these performance measures in relation to the financial year 2016 are deemed to be commercially sensitive. 
However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s remuneration report 
to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time. 
LTIP
As explained in the Statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, the current CFO will not receive a LTIP award in 
2016 owing to his planned retirement later in the year. The Remuneration Committee has not yet determined the details of the LTIP 
awards to be granted in 2016 to the current CEO and to the incoming CFO although any such awards will be consistent with our 
shareholder approved Policy Report and will be extended to include senior managers. Full details of the awards will be disclosed 
both in the Stock Exchange announcement released at the time of grant and in next year’s Remuneration Report.

report.

Since 16 April 2014, the Company was and remains listed on the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange. Whilst the 
Group operates predominately in the UK, it does have subsidiaries in France, Italy and the UAE.
STRATEGIC REPORT
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Company to present a fair review of the development and performance of the Group’s 
business during the financial year and the position of the business at the end of that year. This review is contained within the 
Strategic report on pages 16 to 17. The principal activities of the group are described in the Strategic report on pages 14 to 15.

VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C2.2 of the 2014 revision of the Code, the Directors have assessed the prospect of the Group over a 
longer period than 12 months required by the ‘Going Concern’ provision. The Board conducted this review for a period of three 
years as the Group’s Strategic Review covers a three-year period.
During 2015, the Board carried out an assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. In its assessment of the viability of the Group, the Directors have 
considered each of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties detailed on pages 28 to 33 of the annual report. The Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully, having taken into account the current economic 
outlook. Accordingly, the Board believes that, taking into account the Group’s current position, and subject to the principal risks 
faced by the business, the Group will be able to continue in operation and to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the period up to 
31 December 2018 being the period considered under the Group’s current three-year strategic plan.
GOING CONCERN STATEMENT
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue its 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this report. Accordingly, 
the Board continues to adopt and consider appropriate the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
DIRECTORS

REPORT
RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT
The Relationship Deed dated 11 April 2014 between Cavendish Square Partners (General Partner) Limited (“Cavendish”)(in its 
capacity as general partner to Cavendish Square Partners Limited Partnership) and the Company provides that Cavendish had the 
right to nominate one person to be its Representative Director on the Board until the later of 12 months from Admission or when 
Cavendish ceased to hold an interest, either direct or indirect, of 20% or more of the aggregate voting rights in the Company from 
time to time.
Cavendish shareholding dropped below 20% in May 2014 and subsequently Cavendish made further disposals in December 2014 
and October 2015 and now has no share interest in the Company. Accordingly, the relationship agreement terminated on 16 April 
2015, being the 12 month anniversary of the Company’s admission to the London Stock Exchange.
The Company is therefore no longer required under Listing Rule 9.8.4 (14), to provide details of the Relationship agreement.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Risks of material 
misstatement
Revenue recognition and recognition of customer rebates
Acquisition accounting
Audit scope We performed an audit of the complete financial information of all components of the Group.
The components where we performed full audit procedures accounted for 100% of Profit before tax 
excluding non-underlying items other than intangibles amortisation and profit on sale of fixed assets, 100% 
of Revenue and 100% of Total assets.
Materiality Overall Group materiality of £2.3m (2014: £1.8m) which represents 5% (2014: 5%) of Profit before tax 
excluding non-underlying items other than intangibles amortisation and profit on sale of fixed assets.
 
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team.  In addressing these risks, we have 
performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we 
do not express any opinion on these individual areas.

Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2015
Polypipe Group plc Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the 
Audit Committee
Rebates and revenue recognition
The timing of revenue recognition is 
relevant to the reported performance of 
the Group as a whole and also to the 
completeness of rebate expense and 
related year end liabilities as discussed 
below.  There is opportunity to misstate 
the recording of revenue between 
periods in order to influence reported 
results. 
Furthermore, as described in note 3 
to the Group financial statements, the 
Group’s pricing structure includes rebate 
arrangements with customers.  Some of 
these arrangements involve estimation 
when determining the amount to be 
recognised as an expense in the year 
and a liability at the year end.  This is in 
particular relevant to rebates payable to 
end users who are not direct customers 
of the Group but who buy Polypipe 
products from the Group’s customers.
Refer also to page 51 (Audit Committee 
Report).
We tested the accuracy of revenue cut 
off around the year end.  Our work 
comprised the agreement of sales 
transactions from either side of the year 
end to supporting documentation, and 
performing trend analysis of daily sales 
in the period prior to the year end.  
In respect of rebates we understood the 
procedures and controls in place over 
the rebates process.  
We tested the accuracy and 
appropriateness of rebate provision 
calculations by agreeing amounts 
recognised to terms of agreements and 
other supporting documents.
We also compared year end customer 
rebate provisions and rebate costs in 
the year, to prior year amounts and 
expectations.  
We compared a sample of rebate 
payments made in the year with 
amounts provided as at 31 December 
2014 which, together with a review 
of ageing, gave us assurance over 
the accuracy of amounts previously 
provided.  
We challenged the completeness of 
amounts recognised by reference to the 
Group’s revenues in the year.  
We have concluded that revenue is 
appropriately recognised in the correct 
accounting period and found no 
evidence of management bias.
We have concluded that the customer 
rebates expense and liability are 
appropriately recognised and that 
amounts estimated are within an 
acceptable range.
71
OUR FINANCIALS Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to the 
Audit Committee
Accounting for acquisitions
During the year the Group made two 
business acquisitions.  
The accounting for acquisitions, 
including the allocation of the purchase 
price and the recognition of intangible 
assets and goodwill is required to be 
performed in accordance with IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’.  This involves 
judgement and is a subjective area.
Specifically the valuation of intangible 
assets requires the identification of the 
specific intangible assets acquired, the 
estimation of future cash flows and the 
selection of appropriate discount rates 
to be used for discounting.
The identification of intangible assets 
results in an equivalent reduction in 
the amount recognised as goodwill, 
and the intangible assets give rise to an 
amortisation charge that, in accordance 
with the Group’s policy, is disclosed 
separately in the income statement as a 
non-underlying item.
The amounts recognised as intangible 
assets were £94.3m of goodwill and 
£52.1m of other intangible assets.
Refer also to page 52 (Audit Committee 
Report), Accounting Policies 2.4 and 
2.10, and Notes 3.3, 16 and 17 of the 
Group financial statements.
We obtained and read the share 
purchase agreements relating to 
acquisitions in the year, and vouched 
the consideration paid to supporting 
documentation.
We verified that the allocation of the 
purchase price and the recognition of 
intangible assets was in accordance with 
IFRS 3.
We ensured that only post acquisition 
results had been included in the Group 
income statement for the year.
We confirmed that the necessary 
disclosures had been made in the 
financial statements, and considered 
the impact of acquisitions in the year on 
segmental disclosures.
We vouched significant acquisition 
costs to supporting documentation 
and ensured that they had been 
appropriately expensed.
We have concluded that accounting for 
acquisitions has been performed in line 
with IFRS 3 and that the acquisitions 
have been appropriately disclosed.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF POLYPIPE GROUP plc
72
Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2015
Polypipe Group plc In the prior year, our auditor’s report included a risk of material misstatement in relation to deferred taxation.  In the current year, 
this is no longer included as the amount of any unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of non-trading losses is no longer 
considered material to the financial statements.
THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
TAILORING THE SCOPE
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 
for each entity within the Group.  Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  We 
take into account factors such as size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and the effectiveness of group-wide controls when 
assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the eleven reporting components of the Group, we selected all 
eleven components (2014: all nine components) covering entities within the UK, France and Italy, which represent the principal 
business units within the Group.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of all eleven components selected (“full scope components”).  
Therefore for the current year, the full scope components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2014: 
100%) of the Group’s Profit before tax excluding non-underlying items other than intangibles amortisation, 100% (2014: 100%) of 
the Group’s Revenue and 100% (2014: 100%) of the Group’s Total assets. 
The new business units acquired during 2015 are both included within the full scope components this year.
INVOLVEMENT WITH COMPONENT TEAMS 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each 
of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network 
firms operating under our instruction. Of the eleven full scope components, audit procedures were performed on nine of these 
directly by the primary audit team, which was responsible for all UK locations. For the two full scope components where the work 
was performed by component auditors, in France and Italy, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to 
determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
During the current year’s audit cycle, a visit was undertaken by the primary audit team to the component team in France. This 
visit involved discussing the audit approach with the component team and any issues arising from their work, meeting with local 
management, attending the closing meeting and reviewing key audit working papers on risk areas.  The primary team interacted 
regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers and were 
responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process.  This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group 
level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on 
the audit and in forming our audit opinion.  
MATERIALITY
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of 
our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.3 million (2014: £1.8 million), which is 5% (2014: 5%) of Profit Before Tax 
excluding non-underlying items other than intangibles amortisation and profit on sale of fixed assets.  We believe that Profit Before 
Tax excluding non-underlying items other than intangibles amortisation and profit on sale of fixed assets provides us with the most 
relevant measure of Group profitability.

Adjustments
Materiality
• Reported Proﬁt Before Tax − £41.5m
• Acquisition costs − increase basis by £2.0m 
• Exceptional ﬁnance costs − increase basis by £1.7m
• Adjusted Proﬁt Before Tax excluding non-underlying items other than 
intangibles amortisation and proﬁt on sale of ﬁxed assets − £45.2m 
• Materiality of £2.3m (5% of Adjusted Proﬁt Before Tax excluding 
non-underlying items other than intangibles amortisation and proﬁt on 
sale of ﬁxed assets)
PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.  It is set at an amount to reduce to 
an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements 
exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement 
was that performance materiality was 75% (2014: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £1.7m (2014: £1.4m).  We have set 
performance materiality at this percentage due to the past history of misstatements indicating a lower risk of misstatement in the 
financial statements. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based 
on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that 
component.  In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £0.3m to £1.7m (2014: £0.2m 
to £1.2m).
REPORTING THRESHOLD
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.1m (2014: 
£0.1m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.  
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statements set out on pages 67 and 112, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

GROUP CASH FLOW STATEMENT

OUR FINANCIALS Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com 1. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue by the 
Board of Directors on the 31 March 2016 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Peter Shepherd.
Polypipe Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The principal activity of 
the Group is the manufacture of plastic pipe systems for the building and construction market.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated historical financial information for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material 
respects to all the periods presented. 
2.1 Basis of preparation and statement of compliance with IFRS’s
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
endorsed by the European Union regulations as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended  
31 December 2015 and also in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. 
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2015.
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments that 
have been measured at fair value. The financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling and all values are rounded to the 
nearest million (£m) unless otherwise indicated.
During the year the Group has amended its income statement presentation to present exceptional and other non-cash items, 
and the related tax impact, on the face of the income statement using a columnar format rather than on a single line basis as 
used in prior years. The Directors consider it appropriate to amend the income statement presentation in this way to facilitate 
a more meaningful comparison with prior and future periods.
2.2 Going concern
The Directors, having considered all relevant risk factors, believe the Group has adequate financial resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
annual report and accounts.
2.3 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 
2015. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
 Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)
 Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and
 The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to 
one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the 
subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group 
gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
82
Annual Report and Accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2015
Polypipe Group plc 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line 
with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to 
transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
The Group holds 100% of the equity and controls 100% of the voting rights in all subsidiaries. Therefore the treatment of 
Non-Controlling Interests or any other non-voting right factors in respect of control is not relevant.
2.4 Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is the total of the 
consideration transferred, measured at acquisition fair value. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in 
administration expenses.
Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from 
goodwill.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the vendor will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, is 
recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent 
consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
2.5 Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration 
transferred over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business 
combination. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses (see 2.11).
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss 
on disposal of the unit, or of an operation within it. 
2.6 Foreign currency translation 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling, which is also the parent company’s functional 
currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of 
each entity are measured in that functional currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities at their respective functional currency rates 
prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of 
exchange at the reporting date. All differences arising on settlement or translation are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates 
as at the dates of the initial transactions. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Pounds Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
reporting date. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing. The resulting exchange differences 
are recognised in other comprehensive income.
2.7 Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can 
be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, value 
added tax and other sales taxes. The following criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
83
OUR FINANCIALS Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been passed to the buyer (when 
the goods are delivered). The amount is recognised net of any discounts or rebates payable, which are accrued at the point at 
which the goods are delivered. As explained in note 3.2, rebates can be complex in nature and involve estimation.
Interest income
Interest is recognised as interest accrues on cash balances using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to its net 
carrying amount.
2.8 Taxes
Current Income Tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from  
or paid to the taxation authorities based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance  
sheet date.
Deferred Income Tax
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
 where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;
 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future; and 
 deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. 
For deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, it must additionally be probable that the 
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred income 
taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date.
Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other 
comprehensive income. Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or 
charged directly to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.

for the year ended 31 December 2015
Polypipe Group plc 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.9 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses if any. Cost 
comprises the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes 
costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on the cost less residual value of property, plant and equipment, and is on a straight-line basis over its 
expected useful life as follows:
Freehold land Nil
Freehold buildings Over expected economic life not exceeding 50 years
Plant and other equipment 4 to 10 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful 
lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each financial year end and where adjustments are required 
these are made prospectively.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or 
where no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. 
2.10 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are initially measured at cost. Intangible assets arising on business combinations are 
initially measured at fair value. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost or fair value less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised 
development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the income statement in the year in which the 
expenditure is incurred. 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on 
a straight line basis over their useful economic life and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the 
intangible asset may be impaired. 
Amortisation of intangible assets is provided over the following expected useful lives:
Patents and Brand names ten years
Customer relationships five years
Customer order book up to one year
Research and Development costs 
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on individual projects are recognised as an intangible 
asset when the Group can demonstrate: 
 The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale
 Its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset 
 How the asset will generate future economic benefits
 The availability of resources to complete the asset
 The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development
At the reporting date no development costs have met the above criteria. 
85
OUR FINANCIALS Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.11 Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there are any indicators that an asset may be impaired. 
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of 
the asset’s recoverable amount in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. The recoverable amount of an asset 
or cash-generating unit (CGU) is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and it is determined for an 
individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or 
groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired 
and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no 
such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation 
multiples or other available fair value indicators.
The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and industry forecast calculations which are prepared 
separately for each of the Group’s cash-generating units to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and 
industry forecast calculations are generally covering a period of 4 years. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is 
calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the 
impaired asset.
The following assets have specific characteristics for impairment testing: 
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually (as at 31 December) and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
be impaired. 
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU to which the goodwill relates. For 
the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units. Each unit or group of units 
to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes and is not larger than an operating segment before aggregation. Where the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income. 
Impairment losses related to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. 
2.12 Leasing
The classification of leases as finance or operating leases requires the Group to determine, based on an evaluation of the 
terms and conditions, whether it retains or acquires the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these assets and 
accordingly whether the lease requires an asset and liability to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases and rentals payable are charged in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the 
lease term.

Polypipe Group plc 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
2.13 Financial instruments
(i) Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39: Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement (‘IAS 39’) are classified 
as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-
sale financial assets or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group 
determines the classification of financial assets at initial recognition.
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs, except in the case of financial 
assets recorded at fair value through profit and loss. 
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and trade and other 
receivables.
Subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification. The Group does not hold any held to maturity 
investments or available for sale financial assets.
Financial assets at fair value through profit of loss 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading. Financial assets are classified as 
held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. This category includes derivative financial 
instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by 
IAS 39.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognised in finance revenue or finance expense in the income statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. After initial measurement, such assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included in finance 
income in the income statement. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the income statement in finance costs.
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised 
when: 
 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired 
 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group 
has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. 
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value 
and recoverable amount. Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost. 
A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant 
financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original 
terms of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debts 
are derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
87
OUR FINANCIALS Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
ii) Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and 
borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines 
the classification of financial liabilities at initial recognition. The Group has trade and other payables, loans classified as loans 
and borrowings and derivative financial instruments. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case 
of loans and borrowings, plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows:
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as 
effective hedging instruments. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in profit or loss.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in 
finance revenue and finance cost.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
A liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. 
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or 
fees incurred are recognised in the income statement.
iii) Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet if, and only if, there is 
a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to 
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
iv) Fair values
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the 
principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions.
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at the reporting date is determined by reference to 
quoted market prices or dealer price quotations, without any deduction for transaction costs. 
For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. 
Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions; reference to the current fair value of another 
instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. 
An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in Note 28.

v) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts, to manage 
the financial risks arising from the business activities and the financing of those activities. The Group does not use derivative 
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date. 
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 
39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement are recognised immediately in the income statement. A derivative is 
presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months 
and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
vi) Hedge accounting
The Group maintains documentation of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument at the 
inception of a hedging transaction together with the risk management objective and the strategy underlying the designated 
hedge. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an 
ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flow of the hedged items.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net 
investment hedges.
Note 28 sets out the details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.
The Group does not currently have any designated fair value hedges or net investment hedges.
Cash flow hedge
Cash flow hedging matches the cash flows of hedged items against the corresponding cash flow of the derivative. The 
effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the hedged item is 
accounted for in accordance with the policy for that financial instrument. Any ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income 
statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity 
is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
2.14 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to 
its present location and condition, as follows:
 Raw materials – purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis
 Work in progress and finished goods – cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads based on a normal 
level of activity, excluding borrowing costs
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and 
disposal.
2.15 Cash and short term deposits
Cash and short term deposits consist of cash at bank and in hand.

2.16 Pensions
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan. Contributions payable in the year are charged to the income 
statement. The assets are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. Differences 
between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the 
balance sheet. 
2.17 Non-underlying items
The Group presents amortisation of intangible assets, profit on sale of property, plant and equipment and non-recurring 
operating costs, financing charges and taxation in respect of acquisitions and listing as a public company as non-underlying 
items on the face of the income statement. These are items of income and expense which, because of the nature and 
expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand 
better the elements of financial performance in the year. This is to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better 
trends in financial performance.
The tax effect of the above is also included.
2.18 Share-based payments
In the case of equity-settled schemes, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The value of the options is measured using the Black-Scholes 
model, taking into account the terms and conditions (including market and non-vesting conditions) upon which the options 
were granted. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected 
to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based 
on the number of options that eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for 
equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting 
irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or 
service conditions are satisfied.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings  
per share.
2.19 Treasury shares
The Group holds own shares for the granting of Group shares to employees and Directors. These treasury shares are 
recognised at cost and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the income 
statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. No dividends are earned on 
these shares. The shares are ignored for the purposes of calculating the Group’s EPS.

Polypipe Group plc 3. JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the reporting date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses 
during the year. However the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
The following judgements and estimates have the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements:
3.1 Impairment of non-financial assets
In accordance with IFRS, the Group considers whether there are any indicators of impairment of assets. Where indicators of 
impairment are identified, the Group tests the asset for impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually (as at  
31 December) and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. 
The Group’s impairment test for goodwill is based on a value in use calculation. The value in use calculation is based on 
a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget/forecast for the next four years and do not 
include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the 
performance of the asset or the cash-generating unit being tested. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount 
rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for 
extrapolation purposes. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash-generating 
units are further explained in Note 16.
3.2 Recognition of customer rebates
The Group’s pricing structure involves rebate arrangements with several of its direct and indirect customers. These can be 
complex in nature and involve estimation in determining the required level of provision for rebate liabilities.
3.3 Measurement of intangible assets
The measurement of intangible assets other than goodwill on a business combination involves the estimation of future 
cashflows and other inputs relevant to the valuation model being applied. Acquisitions are disclosed in Note 17.
4. STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE
Standards which have been adopted in the year
There were no new standards and interpretations adopted in the year that have a material impact. 
Standards issued but not yet effective
The following standards and interpretations have an effective date after the date of these financial statements but the Group 
has not early adopted them and plans to adopt them from the effective dates adopted by EU. This listing of standards and 
interpretations issued are those that the Group reasonably expect to have an impact on disclosures, financial position or 
performance when applied at a future date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective.

IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of the internal financial information reported to the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). The Group’s CODM is deemed to be the Board of Directors, who are primarily 
responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The Group has three reporting segments - Residential Piping Systems (all UK by origin) and Commercial and Infrastructure 
Piping Systems (UK) and Commercial and Infrastructure (Mainland Europe). The reporting segments are organised based on 
the nature of the end markets served. There are no significant judgements in aggregating operating segments to arrive at the 
reporting segments.

(b) Reconciliation of the total tax charge

2015
£m
2014

The effective rate for the full year is 17.8% (2014: 17.8%). If the impact of non-underlying costs is excluded, the underlying 
tax rate would be 19.2% (2014: 14.4%).

 The increase in the deferred tax liability during the year of £9.1m relates to businesses acquired as shown in Note 17.
The Group offsets tax assets and liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and 
current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax 
authority.
(d) Change in Corporation Tax rate 
The Chancellor has announced that the main UK corporation tax rate will be reduced from the current rate of 20% which was 
applied from 1 April 2015, to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020. The reduction in the corporation tax rate 
to 18% was included within the Finance (No 2) Act 2015 that was substantively enacted in October 2015.
Deferred taxation is measured at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary timing differences 
are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax has therefore been provided at 18%.
(e) Unrecognised tax losses 
A deferred tax asset of £1.0m (2014: £1.3m) in respect of surplus non-trading losses has not been recognised at 31 December 
2015 as its recovery is uncertain.

The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included 
as a liability in these financial statements.
14.  EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE 
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of 
the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. The diluted earnings per share 
amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that 
would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Underlying earnings per share is based on the result for the year after taxation, excluding the impact of non-underlying items, 
of £38.8m (2014: £32.2m). The Directors consider that this measure gives a better and more consistent indication of the 
Group’s underlying performance.

Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Impairment testing of goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to a number of cash-
generating units. These represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management 
purposes.
Carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each of the cash-generating units:
Cash-generating unit

Terrain 31.4 31.4
Civils 36.0 36.0
Nuaire 91.3 –
Others 24.5 21.5
329.3 235.0
Impairment tests on the carrying values of goodwill are performed by analysing the carrying value allocated to each cash-
generating unit against its value in use. Value in use is calculated for each cash-generating unit as the net present value of 
that unit’s discounted future cash flows. These cash flows are based on budget cash flow information for a period of one year, 
construction industry forecasts of growth for the following three years and growth of between 2 to 3% thereafter.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10.7% (2014: 10.7%) has been applied in determining the recoverable amounts of cash-generating 
units. The discount rate is estimated based on the Group’s risk adjusted cost of capital.

Polypipe Group plc 16. INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
The Group has applied sensitivities to assess whether any reasonable possible changes in assumptions could cause an 
impairment that would be material to these consolidated financial statements. In the case of Polypipe France’s goodwill of 
£9.6m, included in “others”, this would be fully impaired if the revenue growth rate assumption from 2016 onwards of 
between 2.5% and 3.6%, which is based on Euroconstruct and OECD forecasts, proved to be optimistic and revenue growth 
of 0.9% was achieved. Polypipe France’s goodwill would also be fully impaired if the assumed revenue growth rates were 
achieved but the contribution margin fell by 180bps due to competitive pressures. Goodwill would also be impaired through a 
combination of these sensitivities.
17. ACQUISITIONS
Surestop
On 30 January 2015 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Surestop Limited, a company which manufactures and 
supplies a range of patented water mains switch-off devices. The cash consideration of £6.0 million included a payment of

Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate capital structure to 
support its business objectives and maximise shareholder value. The Group regards shareholders’ equity and net debt as its 
capital. The Group’s net debt is defined as cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and derivative financial assets and 
liabilities.
At the year end the Group had bank debt of £217.5m (2014: £120m), an undrawn committed revolving credit facility of 
£82.5m (2014: £40.0m) and cash of £21.6m (2014: £43.1m). A key objective of the Group is to maintain sufficient liquidity 
(cash and committed bank facilities) in order to meet its cash commitments including interest payments due on that debt. 
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 
2014.

SAYE
SAYE options were granted to eligible employees on 8 September 2014 at an exercise price of £1.99, a 20% discount to the 
average share price over the three days preceding the offer. Participating employees can exercise their options to purchase the 
shares acquired through their savings plans at the option price after three years. These options have an exercise date of 2017 
to 2018.
LTIP
The Company operates the LTIP under which certain senior executives could receive a performance based amount of Polypipe 
shares up to a maximum of 50% of base salary. Vesting of the awards is based on the growth in the Group’s operating profit 
over three years. LTIP’s were awarded to two senior executives below Board level on 8 September 2014. These options have an 
exercise date of 2017 to 2024.
These equity-settled, share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the 
grant date of the equity-settled, share-based payments is expensed to the income statement on a straight line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimates of share that will eventually vest. The charge is then credited back to reserves. 
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate for the effects of non transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Bank Loans
The bank loan which is a revolving credit facility is secured and expires in full in August 2020. Interest is payable on the bank 
loan at LIBOR plus an interest margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.75% which is dependent on the Group’s leverage (net debt to 
EBITDA) and reduces as the Group’s leverage reduces. The interest margin at the 31 December 2015 was 2.25%.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had available, subject to covenant headroom, £82.5m (2014: £40m) of undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at 31 December 2015. 
£10m of the £300m revolving credit facility will be reviewed at 31 December 2016 and the revolving credit facility will be 
reduced by £10m if the leverage ratio (EBITDA: Net Debt) at 31 December 2016 is greater than or equal to 2.25:1. The facility 
will also reduce by £10m each year, regardless of leverage, at 31 December 2017, 2018 and 2019, the remainder is available 
until August 2020.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its bank loan which, if breached, would result in the bank loan 
becoming immediately repayable. These covenants specify certain maximum limits in terms of net debt as a multiple of 
EBITDA and interest cover. At the year end the Group was not in breach of any bank covenants. The covenant position as at 
31 December 2015 was as follows:
Covenant 
Covenant

Interest cover (EBIT:Net finance costs excluding debt issuance cost amortisation) >4 : 1 7.6 : 1
Leverage (EBITDA:Net debt) <3.5 : 1 2.5 : 1
The interest cover covenant remains at 4:1 throughout the duration of the revolving credit facility. The leverage covenant 
reduces to 3.25:1 at 31 December 2016 and further reduces to 3.0:1 at 30 September 2017 and remains at that level to 
August 2020.

Polypipe Group plc 28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these 
financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has trade and other receivables and cash that are derived 
directly from its operations. 
The Group is exposed to interest rate, foreign currency, credit and liquidity risk.
The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks which are summarised on the following page.
Interest rate risk
The interest rate on the Group’s £300m Revolving Credit Facility is variable, being payable at LIBOR plus a margin. To reduce 
the Group’s exposure to future increases in interest rates the Group has entered into interest rate swaps for the following 
notional amounts, with interest payable at a fixed rate return dependant on the swap of either 2.21% or 1.735% (2014: 
2.21%) (excluding margin):

Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument or future cash flows will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to 
the Group’s operating activities where the revenue or expense is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
of the entity undertaking the transaction.
The Group enters into forward currency contracts for the purchase and sale of foreign currencies in order to manage its 
exposure to fluctuations in currency rates primarily in respect of US Dollar and Euro receipts.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 10% change in the Euro exchange rate versus Pounds Sterling, the 
presentational currency of the Group used for translation purposes, on the net assets and consolidated net income of the 
Group. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

OUR FINANCIALS Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com 28. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES CONTINUED
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for trade receivables) and 
from its financing activities, including deposits with banks.
Trade receivables
Customer credit risk is managed by each subsidiary subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating 
to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of the customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard 
and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly 
monitored and any shipments to major export customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit 
insurance. 
The requirement for impairment is analysed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. Additionally, a large 
number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The calculation 
is based on actually incurred historical data. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of 
each class of financial assets as disclosed in Note 20.
The Group does not hold collateral as security. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables 
as low. At 31 December 2015, 79.4% (2014: 74.5%) of net trade receivables were covered by credit insurance which is 
subject to the normal policy deductibles.
Financial instruments and cash deposits
The Group maintains strong liquidity through cash balances and deposits (£21.6m at 31 December 2015) and its undrawn 
£82.5m committed revolving credit facility which matures in August 2020.
Credit risk from balances with banks is managed by the Group’s finance department. Investments of surplus funds are  
made only with banks that have as a minimum a single A credit rating. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for  
the components of the balance sheet at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 is the carrying amounts as illustrated  
in Note 21. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when 
due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s 
reputation. The Group had cash and cash equivalents of £21.6m on 31 December 2015, £82.5m of undrawn and committed 
credit facilities and no debt maturities within twelve months.

The fair value of the interest rate swap was determined by reference to market values.
Forward currency exchange contracts fair value was determined using quoted forward exchange rates matching the maturities 
of the contracts. 
Fair value hierarchy 
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation 
technique:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either 
directly or indirectly; and
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorder fair value that are not based on 
observable market data.
The fair values disclosed above all relate to items categorised as Level 2.
There have been no transfers in any direction in the period.

OUR FINANCIALS Stock Code: PLP polypipe.com NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
1. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The parent company financial statements of Polypipe Group plc (the “Company”) for the year ended 31 December 2015 were 
authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 31 March 2016 and the balance sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by 
Peter Shepherd. 
Polypipe Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The principal activity of the 
Company is that of a holding company. 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the historical financial information for the year ended  
31 December 2015 are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied in all material respects to all 
the periods presented following adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European 
Union regulations. 
Basis of preparation and statement of compliance with IFRSs
The Company’ s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed 
by the European Union regulations as they apply to the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2015 
and also in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company prepared its financial statements in 
accordance with UK generally accepted accounting practice (UK GAAP). These financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2015 are the first the Company has prepared in accordance with IFRS. Due to the nature of the Company there 
are no differences between UK GAAP and IFRS and on that basis no transition note has been prepared.
These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling and all values are rounded to one decimal place of a million (£m) unless otherwise indicated. No income statement or 
statement of comprehensive income is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
The results of Polypipe Group plc are included in the consolidated financial statements of Polypipe Group plc.
Going concern
The Directors, having considered all relevant risk factors, believe the group has adequate financial resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at historical cost less any applicable provision for impairment. 
Treasury Shares
The Company holds own shares for the granting of Group shares to employees and Directors. These treasury shares are 
presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity. No gain or loss is recognised on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments. There are no dividends earned on these shares.
Share-based payment transactions
In the case of equity-settled schemes, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The value of the options is measured using the Black-Scholes 
model, taking into account the terms and conditions (including market and non-vesting conditions) upon which the options 
were granted. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected 
to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based 
on the number of options that eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for 
equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting 
irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or 
service conditions are satisfied.
The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings 
are recognised by the Company in its individual financial statements. In particular, the Company records an increase in its 
investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.

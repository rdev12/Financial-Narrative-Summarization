1  Comparative figures for 2010 have been revised 
to reflect the elimination of intragroup trading 
more accurately and to re-apportion head 
office overheads previously included in the 
results of the discontinued Oil Services division. 04 Company Overview
Chairman’s statement
Jamie Pike
The trading environment in the US  
and UK Building Products markets 
during 2011 proved to be as challenging 
as expected. However the continued 
focus of the Group on self help 
measures enabled further progress  
to be made as the Group moves 
towards recovery in its end markets.
Results from continuing operations
Total sales of Building Products in the year of £230.4 
million decreased by 8.8 per cent from the prior year 
(2010: £252.5 million). In constant currency terms, total 
sales decreased in the year by 7.6 per cent.
Despite our success in passing on pound for pound input 
cost increases, the lower volumes sold by the Building 
Products division in 2011 impacted both gross and 
operating margins. The Group’s gross profit margin 
decreased to 31.5 per cent from 32.9 per cent in 2010. 
Underlying operating profit decreased by 14.1 per cent to 
£22.4 million (2010: £26.1 million). Underlying earnings per 
share from continuing operations increased by 3 per cent 
to 9.04 pence (2010: 8.78 pence). 
During the year the Group refinanced its banking facilities 
into a new £110 million multicurrency term loan and a 
£30 million multicurrency working capital facility. This 
successful early refinancing of facilities gives Lupus a 
sound financial platform until March 2016 and provides 
the Group with more favourable terms, reduced costs and 
significantly enhanced flexibility. As at 31 December 2011, 
the Group’s underlying net debt was £91.2 million 
(2010: £94.7 million).
Board
There were no changes to the Board during the year.  
In accordance with best practice, the Board has agreed 
that each Director will voluntarily offer themselves for 
re-election at each Annual General Meeting that they are 
not required to retire from office. Accordingly, James 
Brotherton, Jamie Pike, Louis Eperjesi, Les Tench and 
Martin Towers will voluntarily offer themselves for 
re-election at the 2012 Annual General Meeting. 
Dividends
The Group’s enhanced financial position following the 
disposal of Gall Thomson enables the Board to recommend 
a final dividend of 3.5 pence per share (2010: 2.0p per 
share), an increase of 75 per cent and covered 2.6 times by 
underlying earnings per share from continuing operations. 
The final dividend will absorb approximately £4.5 million of 
cash resources and is expected to be paid following the 
Annual General Meeting scheduled for 25 May 2012.
The increased dividend is a sign of our confidence in the 
Group’s improved financial position and prospects. Going 
forward, the Board intends to continue a progressive 
dividend policy taking into account the Group’s leverage, 
earnings growth potential and future expansion plans.
The Board has reviewed the Group’s dividend policy in 
the light of the Group’s altered profitability and cash flow 
characteristics. Going forward, the Board intends to target 
dividend cover of between 2.0–2.5x underlying EPS 
through the cycle.
The Group intends to resume interim dividend payments 
during 2012.
 
Overview
The disposal of Gall Thomson upon favourable terms marks 
the completion of the refocusing of Lupus as a supplier of 
components to the door and window industry worldwide. 
The Group now has significant financial flexibility to achieve 
its strategic goals and to accelerate the development of the 
Building Products division.
We believe that the Building Products division will continue 
to outperform its key markets in 2012 and beyond due to 
the Group’s relative financial strength following the disposal 
of Gall Thomson. Market conditions, however, remain 
challenging across all our markets.
In North America we are pleased with the new facility in 
Atlanta, Georgia as it comes on stream and the integration 
of Overland Products into the Group. 05

Outlook
We believe that the Group will continue to outperform its 
key markets in 2012 and beyond due in part to the Group’s 
relative financial strength following the disposal of Gall 
Thomson.
During the course of 2012 the Group intends to change  
its name and branding to reflect the focus of Lupus as a 
supplier of components to the door and window industry 
worldwide. A resolution to permit the Board to make this 
change will be proposed at the AGM and we will keep 
shareholders informed of progress in this regard.
The Board believes the Group is now well positioned 
for the future.

Lockguard and High  
Security Handle
The Lockguard and High Security 
Handles have been developed 
specifically to address the security 
risks associated with snapping of 
euro profile cylinders. Suitable for 
upgrading security on new and 
existing doors the High Security 
Handle meets the new TS 007 testing 
standard as a two star product. 
The handle shields the cylinder 
behind the backplate, giving access 
only to the key slot and, when used 
with ERA’s Kitemarked anti bump 
cylinder, the door lock is protected 
against all forms of cylinder attack, 
and accumulates the TS 007 three 
stars. The High Security Handle is 
manufactured from forged 
aluminium for strength and the 
curvature of the backplate gives 
increased resistance against mole 
grip attacks on the door. 06

Business Review
Building Products
1
The Building Products division comprises the Group’s door 
and window hardware and seals operations. The division’s 
businesses are market leaders and operate across the 
Americas, the UK, Europe and Australasia. In 2011, trading 
in our Building Products businesses declined as markets 
continued to be difficult. 
While Building Products sales have decreased in 2011 
compared to the prior year, they have stayed relatively flat 
(+2%) compared to 2009. However operating profit in 2011  
is up 22% on the level achieved in 2009 as operating profit 
margins have been maintained closer to the level achieved  
in 2010, which is significantly above the margin achieved  
in 2009.
During the year, we completed an organisational 
restructuring of our Building Products division outside of 
North America with separate MD divisional roles created 
for the UK and Ireland business and the International 
business. External hires have been appointed to these 
key management roles and this reorganisation and 
strengthening of our divisional management team will 
enable us to provide increased focus to each region and 
facilitate expansion into new products and geographies. 
During 2011 we remained focused on maintaining tight 
controls over costs in all our businesses. Headcount at 31 
December 2011 in the Building Products division of 1,880 
was lower than the prior year (2010: 1,956) as we flexed 
labour where necessary and permitted limited selective 
hiring of permanent personnel only where merited by 
business activity levels. Raw material prices of steel and oil 
derivative products increased during the first half of the 
financial year but ameliorated during the second half. We 
continued to adopt a structured and disciplined approach 
to increases to our cost base, ensuring that we multisource 
product wherever possible and remain diligent in passing 
permanent cost increases on to customers.
US Building Products
1
Amesbury, our North American Building Products business, 
had an encouraging start to the financial year, however saw 
demand soften across the remainder of 2011 as US window 
shipments fell year on year. Quoting levels across Amesbury 
increased in the fourth quarter as customers continue to 
look at consolidating their supply base and consider new 
product development opportunities.

We remain positive about the long-term prospects for 
Amesbury and in 2011 continued to invest in the North 
American business. Towards the year end we started the 
fit out of our new extrusion plant in Atlanta which came 
on stream in February 2012 and, in December 2011, 
we announced the US$15 million acquisition of Overland 
which adds a number of complementary stamping 
products to the Amesbury offering.
We have started a significant programme of investment 
in IT systems in Amesbury that will move all our North 
American businesses onto a common platform, 
streamlining reporting and improving our customer and 
supplier interface. Over the next three years we expect 
to invest approximately US$5 million in this programme.
New products launched into the American market in 2011 
included our initial casement winder offering, microbial 
pile, intumescent seals, as well as numerous bespoke 
products developed for individual customers.
Novaseal 
The top two seals in the picture 
above are Novaseals, which are 
timber window weatherseals.  
These seals are designed to be  
cost effective, high performance 
weatherseals that are simple and  
fast to insert. Combining the 
benefits and performance of 
urethane foam with the design 
functionality of extrusions, along 
with a supple TPE lip for ease of 
insertion, the result is a seal with 
excellent memory and very low 
compression force. 
Moaf seal
The bottom seal in the picture above 
is a Moaf window seal. Moaf seals 
combine improved compression 
compared to EPDM, excellent 
durability, maximum flexibility and 
do not require a labour intensive 
fitting process. Combining a variety 
of QLON profiles with a number of 
extruded bases we have a wide 
range of options to suit all rebate 
sizes and seal gaps. These seals are 
now fitted in over 30 million 
windows worldwide.

Business Review
Chief Executive Officer’s review 
continued
In the UK and Ireland, grouphomesafe’s smaller portfolio 
businesses – Balance, Ventrolla and Linear – each exhibited 
very strong growth and continued to take market share, 
with our differentiated product offering partially offsetting 
weaker demand from larger customers such as window 
fabricators and social housing contractors. 
The distribution sector held up well during the year as 
consumers continued to undertake small scale repair 
projects, however, the OEM sector saw marked declines 
as homeowners appeared reluctant to commit to larger 
scale refurbishment projects. The social housing sector 
continued to contract as Housing Associations and Local 
Authorities reduced expenditure. 
There were significant movements in input costs during 
the year with increases coming through in the first half 
which eased in the second half. We successfully continued 
our policy of passing on cost increases as they occurred  
in order to defend margins. Despite input cost volatility  
and continued losses incurred within our composite  
doors business, the underlying operating margin  
for grouphomesafe improved slightly in the year  
as we successfully flexed our cost base.
Our composite door business had another difficult year 
with further declines in its key social housing markets, 
and remained loss making across the year as a whole. The 
business had some initial success in the year in selling direct 
to the trade and retail composite door markets and will look 
to develop this route to market further in 2012 following the 
introduction of our online door configurator. In 2011, 
further actions were taken to reduce the cost base, 
streamline manufacturing processes and review the 
operational footprint. 
During the period we continued the development 
of “grouphomesafe” as the umbrella brand for our UK 
Building Products business and maintained our focus 
on improving our customer service within the UK market, 
as we seek to differentiate ourselves from the competition 
by setting industry leading standards for delivery on time 
and in full.
New products launched into the UK and Ireland market in 
2011 included a door offering from Ventrolla, a range of 
suited hardware and a biometric lock offering from ERA 
and an intumescent seal from Schlegel.
International Building Products
1,2
Our International Building Products division, which goes to 
market under the Schlegel brand, has seen sales decrease 
in 2011 compared with the corresponding period last year.
Northern and Eastern European markets remained strong 
and demonstrated growth year on year, however Southern 
European markets remained subdued. Our Brazilian 
business continued to gain market share and position. 
In Australasia, the year started slowly following the various 
natural disasters in the region but showed some signs 
of improvement towards the year end. Profitability in the 
division was affected by a combination of operational 
gearing and product mix.
The new management structure we have put in place for 
the International division enables us to provide increased 
focus to the division and should facilitate expansion into 
new products, applications and geographies.
Discontinued operations – Oil and gas services

In 2011 our Oil and gas services division comprised  
the Gall Thomson and Klaw businesses. Gall Thomson 
Environmental is the world’s leading supplier of marine 
breakaway couplings (“MBCs”) and, through its KLAW 
subsidiary, is a supplier of industrial couplings including 
quick release and breakaway couplings.

Challenger Plus Hinge
The Challenger Plus hinge builds on 
the principles of the tried and tested 
Challenger, which has become the 
industry standard door hinge. 
Incorporating increased adjustability 
and a reduction of components, the 
Challenger Plus provides superior 
fitting tolerances and reduced 
fabrication time. Additionally, the 
unique lift off feature allows for 
simple one person installation of 
door sets. 
Suitable for PAS 24 specifications, 
the Challenger Plus is available in  
an extensive range of finishes. 
Outlook
2012 has started with sales and orders broadly in line  
with 2011, which is encouraging considering the relatively 
strong start we saw last year. However our view is that our 
end markets will remain relatively subdued across this year 
as a whole as market conditions remain challenging across 
all our geographies.
In 2012 the consensus view is for UK and Irish markets to 
show further decline compared with 2011, reflecting lower 
consumer spending on RMI and continued downward 
pressure on social housing budgets. In North America we 
expect markets to be broadly flat across the year and in 
Continental Europe we believe markets overall will be 
slightly down with Southern European markets remaining 
difficult. In Australasian markets we expect to see a return 
to growth this year and continued development in South 
American markets.
We continue to see opportunities for profitable investment 
that distinguish us from the competition across all of our 
businesses, as evidenced by the acquisition of Overland 
Products in December 2011, and will continue to deploy 
capital selectively where we believe it will enhance 
shareholder value.

Chief Financial Officer’s review
James Brotherton
Net finance costs decreased by 
20.2 per cent to £9.7 million  
(2010: £12.1 million), reflecting  
a combination of lower levels of 
absolute debt and the beneficial 
impact of the 2011 refinancing  
on margins payable. Net cash  
interest paid of £6.7 million (2010: 
£9.3 million) was 27.9 per cent  
lower than that paid in 2010.
Results from continuing operations 
For the year ended 31 December 2011, compared with the 
prior year, the Group generated the following results from

million decreased by 8.8 per cent from the prior year 
(2010: £252.5 million). In constant currency terms, total 
sales decreased in the year by 7.6 per cent 
Margins
Despite our success in passing on pound for pound input 
cost increases, the lower volumes sold by the Building 
Products division in 2011 impacted both gross and 
operating margins. The Group’s gross profit margin 
decreased to 31.5 per cent from 32.9 per cent in 2010. 
The underlying operating margin for the Group decreased 
from 10.3 per cent in 2010 to 9.7 per cent in 2011. 
Profits
Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation were £27.7 million (2010: £32.5 million). 
Underlying operating profit decreased by 14.1 per cent to 
£22.4 million (2010: £26.1 million). On a constant currency 
basis this represents a decrease of 12.8 per cent over the 
prior year. 
Underlying administrative expenses decreased by £6.8 
million or 12.0 per cent to £50.1 million (2010: £56.9 
million). Administration costs included lower freight, 
commission and management incentive costs associated 
with the subdued levels of activity.
Net finance costs decreased by 20.2 per cent to £9.7 
million (2010: £12.1 million), reflecting a combination of 
lower levels of absolute debt and the beneficial impact of 
the 2011 refinancing on margins payable. Amortisation of 
borrowing costs increased from £2.3 million to £3.1 million 
reflecting the write off of £2.9 million of costs associated 
with the 2009 bank facility. Net cash interest paid of £6.7 
million (2010: £9.3 million) was 27.9 per cent lower than 
that paid in 2010.
Underlying profit before taxation from continuing 
operations was £0.5 million lower at £16.3 million (2010: 
£16.8 million) with the improved interest position partially 
offsetting the decline in Underlying operating profit.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share from continuing operations 
increased by 3 per cent to 9.04 pence (2010: 8.78 pence). 
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations 
increased from 1.15 pence in 2010 to 6.23 pence. 
 
Exceptional costs
Exceptional costs of £0.8 million (2010: £0.4 million) were 
incurred during the period, principally in connection with 
the further restructuring of the UK composite doors 
business and the reorganisation of the Building Products 
division outside of North America. 11

Constant Force Window Balance
The Constant Force window balance 
offers many technical and cost 
benefits to our customers. Because 
of its coil design, the typical constant 
force balance will cover the window 
height spectrum which only leaves 
the weight of the window to be 
matched with the coil weight. 
Amesbury provides the widest coil 
weight range in the industry, ranging 
from 3.5 lbs. up to 40 lbs., which 
helps to keep the customer’s stock 
keeping unit (“SKU”) count very low, 
thereby minimising inventory costs 
and maximising stock turns for our 
customers. Amesbury’s patented 
“Hammerhead” coil tail design 
further reduces the SKU count as the 
user is able to connect up to 4 of the 
same size coils in a row to achieve 
heavier weight ranges. By contrast 
the only solution our competitors 
can offer is to provide 4 different 
coils each with a different length, 
thereby increasing the customer’s 
stock holding costs and complicating 
their assembly process. 
Taxation
There was a net tax credit in the year amounting to £6.8 
million in respect of continuing operations (2010: charge 
of £0.3 million). Exceptional tax credit adjustments in 
respect of prior periods of £5.0 million arose in 2011 from 
the clarification with the tax authorities of the tax treatment 
of provisions, principally those made at the time of the 
acquisitions in 2006 and 2007. 
Excluding the effect of the change in tax rates on deferred 
tax and the adjustments in respect of prior periods, the 
Underlying tax rate on the Underlying profit before taxation 
of continuing operations was 28 per cent (2010: 32 per 
cent). The Underlying tax rate decreased during 2011 due 
mainly to the corporation tax rate reductions in the 
United Kingdom. 
The Underlying cash tax rate in the year was 11 per cent 
(2010: 14 per cent) and is lower than the Underlying tax rate 
due to historic losses utilised and tax deductible goodwill. 
The Underlying cash tax rate is expected to trend towards 
the Underlying tax rate over the coming years.
Financial position
During the year the Group continued to focus on the  
tight management of working capital, operational cash 
generation and the reduction of net debt. 
Working capital
We have continued our focus on tight management  
of working capital. Some investment in inventory was 
required during the year, in part a consequence of the  
high levels of trading that we saw at the end of 2010  
which depressed year end inventory levels. 
During the year a number of our customers ceased 
trading, however vigilant management of customer credit 
risks throughout the year, starting at the point of sale, 
meant that bad debts written off amounted to only 0.3 per 
cent of sales (2010: 0.1 per cent). During the year we were 
successful in extending credit terms over the purchase of 
certain products which in turn benefited our payables 
position with no adverse affect on our supplier base. 12 Business Review
We continue to promote the financial strength of the 
Group to the credit insurers of our major suppliers in order 
to optimise the credit terms that we receive from our 
supplier base and to work closely with our customer base 
to ensure we understand their balance sheet position and 
creditworthiness.
Cash flow
For the Group as a whole, net cash inflow from operating 
activities of £30.7 million was approximately 15 per cent 
lower than the prior year (2010: £36.3 million) principally 
due to lower levels of operating profit combined with some 
incremental investment in working capital in the year. 
Capital expenditure increased by 32 per cent to £4.4 
million (2010: £3.3 million) which meant that operational 
cashflow fell to £28.2 million (2010: £35.3 million).
Operational cash flow from continuing operations was 
approximately £19.0 million (2010: £28.7 million) and 
Operating Cash Conversion from continuing operations 
was approximately 84.8 per cent (2010: 110.0 per cent). 
This is lower than our through the cycle target which 
remains at 100 per cent. Over the past three years the 
Group has averaged operating cash conversion from 
continuing operations of 115 per cent.
Net debt position
As at 31 December 2011, the Group’s Underlying net debt 
was £91.2 million (2010: £94.7 million). This figure is stated 
after the payment of approximately US$15 million to 
acquire Overland, as announced on 23 December 2011. 
On a pro forma basis the Group’s Underlying net debt 
following the disposal of Gall Thomson at 31 December 
2011 would have been approximately £23 million.
Average Underlying net debt during the year was £91.8 
million (2010: £113.9 million). Under the IFRS definition, 
which reduces debt by unamortised bank fees, net debt  
at the year end was £88.8 million (2010: £91.7 million).
Banking and covenants
During the year the Group refinanced its banking facilities 
into a new £110 million multicurrency term loan and a £30 
million multicurrency working capital facility. This successful 
early refinancing of facilities gives Lupus a sound financial 
platform until March 2016 and provides the Group with 
more favourable terms, reduced costs and significantly 
enhanced flexibility.

The Group’s key banking performance metric is leverage, 
calculated as the proportion of Underlying net debt to 
adjusted EBITDA. On a pro forma basis, following the 
disposal of Gall Thomson, the Group’s leverage at the year 
end would have been approximately 0.7x, measured on the 
same basis as the banking covenants.
Following the disposal and related permanent debt 
repayments of approximately £30 million the Group’s 
facilities reduce to a multicurrency term loan of 
approximately £80 million and a £30 million multicurrency 
working capital facility.
Defined benefit pension and post-retirement 
benefit schemes
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension scheme and 
post-retirement healthcare benefit scheme is operated in 
the US. The pension scheme is closed to new entrants and 
post-retirement healthcare benefit contributions are capped.
At 31 December 2011, the defined benefit obligation  
for all Group pension and post-retirement healthcare 
benefit schemes was £21.8 million (2010: £18.9 million) 
and the schemes had plan assets of £12.1 million (2010: 
£11.6 million), resulting in an increased net deficit on  
the schemes of £9.7 million (2010: £7.2 million).
Cash contributions made to the schemes in the year were 
£1.2 million (2010: £0.8 million).
Property
During the year we have continued to examine our 
manufacturing footprint as we seek to develop centres 
of excellence that give us sufficient flexibility to manage 
current demand levels but allow us the potential to respond 
quickly to changes in the market environment if required.
In North America we completed the first stage of 
rationalisation of operations at Sioux Falls, South Dakota; 
combining our door and window hardware facilities onto  
a single site. We retain the freehold of the vacant site and 
are exploring options for divestiture. We signed a five year 
lease on our new Atlanta extrusion facility and took on an 
additional 20,000 sq. ft. at our leasehold facility in Juarez, 
Mexico as we continue to develop our near shoring 
strategy for the North American market.
In the UK we extended our lease at EWS Wolverhampton 
for a further five years to March 2020 and assigned the 
lease on Unit B, one of the two remaining surplus 
properties at Peterlee, County Durham. 
During the year the Group utilised aggregate property 
provisions of £1.3 million and released further property 
provisions of £1.2 million principally in connection with 
the exit from Unit B at Peterlee. 
Since the year end we have successfully assigned the lease 
on Unit A at Peterlee and have been released from all 
remaining obligations in connection with the Peterlee site.

Statements
This will result in a release to the income statement in 2012 
of around £1.9 million of provisions, which will increase 
2012 profit after tax by approximately £1.4 million.
The exit of the two Peterlee properties will save the Group 
in excess of £3.0 million in cash costs of rent, rates, utilities 
and services over the six years to March 2018.
Discontinued operations
The results of Gall Thomson are presented in aggregate as 
discontinued and are disclosed as a one line item on the 
face of the consolidated income statement. Transaction-
related costs (including legal and accountancy costs and 
adviser fees) of approximately £2 million will be charged 
against the profit on sale of discontinued operations in the 
2012 financial statements.
The disposal of Gall Thomson for £75 million was 
announced on 13 March 2012 and will lead to an 
accounting profit on disposal of approximately £53 million, 
which will be recognised in the 2012 financial statements.
2012 guidance
Following the disposal of Gall Thomson, the Group will have 
very different operating characteristics in 2012 and beyond.
The increased operational gearing of the Group will lead 
to greater volatility in the income statement depending on 
whether volumes increase or decrease. The Group will 
continue to explore routes to make the cost base more 
flexible in line with changes in sales volumes.
As a predominantly northern hemisphere Building Products 
company, the Group would expect to turn cash positive in 
September each year and to generate substantially all of its 
surplus cash in the last six weeks of the financial year.
Capital expenditure in 2012 is expected to be between 
£5 million and £6 million, reflecting increased investment 
in new product development and the announced 
investment in Amesbury IT systems.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk Description Mitigation
Market conditions
The overall growth and demand for 
the Group’s products is subject to the 
usual drivers of construction activity 
(ie general economic conditions, 
interest rates, business/consumer 
confidence levels, unemployment, 
population growth etc.). This demand 
can be unpredictable and the Group 
has a low visibility of future orders 
from its customers. During any 
economic downturn customers and 
competitors may apply pressure to 
prices and this pressure can lead to 
lasting changes in terms of pricing 
policies, delivery capabilities and 
market expectations.
Reductions in the Group’s net debt 
and the negotiation of new banking 
facilities, committed until March 2016, 
have strengthened the Group’s ability 
to withstand future downturns in its 
markets. The geographic spread of our 
business and our ability to flex our cost 
base helps to mitigate some of this risk. 
Management prepares regular 
forecasts and reviews that focus on 
remedial action plans required to 
deliver the desired performance during 
the balance of the year. Continuing to 
monitor and measure our commercial 
performance enables us to offer 
industry leading customer service 
which improves customer retention 
and wins new customers. Planned 
investment in ERP systems will 
enhance management visibility of 
operational performance and drive 
continuous improvement in customer 
service, product availability and 
product quality.
Risk Description Mitigation
Competitors
The Group may face significant 
competition, both actual and 
potential, including competition from 
global competitors which have large 
capital resources, in the provision of 
similar goods and services to those 
which are provided by the Group. 
Competition in the industry is based 
upon: range and quality products 
offered, geographical reach, 
reputation and client relationships. 
Aggressive pricing from our 
competitors could cause a reduction 
in our revenues and margins.
Some of our markets are relatively 
concentrated with two or three key 
players, while others are highly 
fragmented and offer significant 
opportunities for consolidation and 
penetration. Furthermore the 
Directors believe that, in view of its 
range of products, focus on setting 
industry leading standards for delivery 
on time and in full, geographical 
spread, strategic focus and reputation, 
the Group can compete effectively 
with its competitors. We aim to 
minimise the impact of aggressive 
pricing by competitors through a 
low cost manufacturing strategy 
supported by our programmes of 
continuous process improvements 
and building long-term relationships 
with our customers based on value, 
quality, service and added value 
technical support.
Risk Description Mitigation
Loss of major 
customers
The success of the Group will, to 
some extent, be dependent on 
the continuation of satisfactory 
commercial relationships with 
the major customers of the Group.
The Group aims to build long-term 
relationships with our customers 
based on value, quality, service and 
added value technical support. The 
Group has a well diversified customer 
base. The top ten customers account 
for less than 25% of total Group sales. 15

Risk Description Mitigation
Raw material  
costs and supply 
chain failures
The raw materials used in the Group’s 
businesses include commodities that 
experience price volatility (such as oil 
derivatives, steel, aluminium and zinc) 
caused by changes in supply and 
demand, and commodity market 
fluctuations. The Group’s ability to 
deliver according to market demands 
depends in large part on obtaining 
timely and adequate supplies of 
components and raw materials on 
competitive terms. Failure by any of 
the Group’s suppliers could 
significantly limit the Group’s sales 
and increase its costs.
The Group is developing a strategic 
sourcing and procurement capability 
which will enhance our knowledge of 
raw material price risks and our risk 
management approach. The Group 
aims to minimise these risks through 
strong long-term relationships with 
suppliers, economies of purchasing, 
multiple suppliers and inventory 
management. In addition the Group 
will seek to increase the price of its 
products or apply surcharges to its 
customers to recover unavoidable 
input cost increases.
Risk Description Mitigation
Key executives  
and personnel
The Group’s future success is 
substantially dependent on the 
continued services and performance 
of its Executive Directors and senior 
management and its ability to 
continue to attract and retain highly 
skilled and qualified personnel.
The Remuneration Committee 
maintains a remuneration policy that 
aims to attract, motivate and retain  
key personnel for the Group. This 
incorporates a significant element of 
performance related remuneration to 
align executive interests with those of 
shareholders. Key elements of this are 
the Lupus Capital Long Term Incentive 
Plan and the Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan. Remuneration packages are 
reviewed and externally benchmarked 
on a regular basis. The Group also 
maintains a strong culture of 
accountability, empowerment and 
personal development throughout  
its business units.
Risk Description Mitigation
Financial risks
The Group operates on a global  
basis and is therefore exposed to 
transactional and translational foreign 
exchange risk against Sterling. The 
Group is also exposed to interest rate 
risks, liquidity and credit risks.
The Group denominates some  
of its debt in foreign currency to 
match some of its exposure to the 
translational balance sheet risks 
associated with overseas subsidiaries. 
Ancillary bank facilities are available 
to manage some of the foreign 
exchange transactional risks and 
interest rate exposure through the 
use of derivative financial instruments. 
The Group maintains adequate cash 
balances and credit facilities based 
on forecasts of expected cash flow. 
Further information on these risks is 
given in note 21 to the Group’s 
financial statements. 16 Business Review
The Company, being traded on AIM, is not required 
to comply with the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code. Nevertheless, the Directors 
acknowledge the importance of corporate social 
responsibility reporting and have chosen to make  
the following voluntary disclosures:
Lupus considers that minimising its impact on the 
environment, and ensuring that it has a positive interaction 
with its employees and the local communities it has a 
presence in, to be important factors in its success.
Health and safety
The Board is committed to providing a clean, healthy  
and safe working environment and accepts collective 
responsibility for health and safety management. The 
Board considers this to make good business sense and 
regards it as a duty owed to its stakeholders. The Chief 
Executive is the Board member responsible for the Group’s 
Health and Safety performance and through the divisional 
management, the operational management of each 
individual operating unit is responsible for their own health 
and safety performance. Standards for health and safety 
vary widely across the countries where the Group 
operates. As a minimum, the standards adopted are those 
required by law but the policy is to seek to exceed these 
where there is a demonstrable benefit.
The profile of the importance of safe working practices  
has been increased throughout the Group, with details  
of accidents, potentially serious hazards and remedial  
or preventative measures taken being shared between  
all sites. A Health and Safety Report is made by the Chief 
Executive Officer to the Board at each of its meetings.
It is essential that all employees are made aware of the 
importance to the Group of health and safety issues and 
ensure that the working environment is as safe as practical. 
Local management are tasked with creating a Health and 
Safety management system which:
• 	 identifies and assesses risks;
• 	 takes actions to reduce risks;
• 	 develops safe working practices; and
• 	 emphasises training and development.
As part of this management system each location is 
internally audited, corrective actions are identified and 
a plan is put in place to address deficiencies raised.

Green initiatives at  
Amesbury
During 2011, Amesbury continued to affirm its  
position as an industry leader in carbon footprint 
reduction initiatives.
The statistics below reflect Amesbury’s commitment to 
becoming a more environmentally conscious business.
Recycled and reused in production:
• 	 206,132 lbs. of recycled corrugated cardboard.
• 	 14,551 lbs. of recycled paper.
• 	 815,710 lbs. of repelletised plastics.
• 	 454,152 lbs. of die drool.
Recycled (not in landfills):
• 	 1,284,347 lbs. of polypropylene.
• 	 59,525 lbs. of polyethylene.
• 	 202,781 lbs. of steel.
• 	 3,704 lbs. of stainless steel.
• 	 3,704 lbs. of brass.
Through its recycling efforts, Amesbury has made 
significant strides in reducing energy consumption and 
harmful gas emissions. Through source reduction and 
reuse, Amesbury has reduced its greenhouse gas 
emissions by 998 metric tons, saved 1,676,000 kilowatts 
in energy, reduced its annual water consumption by 
23,675 metric tons, and achieved landfill savings of 
50.41 metric tons. This has the same effect on the 
environment as removing 328 cars from the road each 
year, reducing electricity and water consumption by the 
equivalent of 132 households’ annual usage, and saving 
7,435 shipping container spaces each year.  17

Statements
The Group requires that the causes of all accidents, 
dangerous incidents and near-miss situations are promptly 
and thoroughly investigated. A range of investigatory 
procedures are used to achieve this with the intended 
purpose of avoiding or reducing the risk of repetition.
Operations representing over 49 per cent of the value of 
total Group sales in 2011 have achieved accreditation for 
OHSAS 18001 (Health and Safety) or for OSHA SHARP (the 
Safety & Health Achievement Recognition Program run by 
the Occupational Safety & Health Administration of the 
United States Department of Labor (“OSHA SHARP”)). Most 
of the other operations in the Group have programmes in 
place with the objective of achieving accreditation.
Ethics
The Group aims to act responsibly and with integrity, 
respecting the laws and regulations of all the countries 
within which it operates as well as internationally accepted 
standards of responsible business conduct. The Group 
requires high standards of professional and ethical conduct 
from all employees and Directors. Every business within 
the Group is expected to operate with policies and 
procedures which are consistent with the Group’s values 
and standards. In all dealings, all employees and other 
persons acting on behalf of the Group are expected to: 
• 	 engage in honest and ethical conduct, including the 
avoidance and reporting of any conflicts of interest;
• 	 maintain effective procedures to prevent confidential 
information being misused or used for personal gain;
• 	 advance the legitimate interests of the Group, having 
regard to the Group’s values and standards;
• 	 comply with all applicable laws and regulations in every 
country in which the Group operates, focusing in 
particular on avoiding bribery, corruption and fraud;
• 	 maintain a healthy and safe working environment for 
employees to work in;
• 	 treat customers fairly, openly and honestly;
• 	 be intolerant of discrimination or harassment of any kind;
• 	 maintain high standards of integrity in business 
relationships with suppliers; and
• 	 encourage the use of those suppliers who operate with 
values and standards equivalent to those of the Group.
Employees
Training and development
Employees are provided with training in order to give  
them the necessary skills to perform their duties and 
where appropriate to develop those skills and progress 
their career. The Group invests in a range of development 
activities including NVQs and apprenticeship schemes 
and supports other professional and technical training.
Customers and suppliers
The Group seeks to be honest and fair in its relationships 
with customers and suppliers, to provide customers with 
standards of product and service that have been agreed 
and to pay suppliers and sub-contractors on agreed terms. 
It is Group policy to maintain accreditation to the quality 
management standard ISO 9001 and encourage operating 
units to gain accreditation to any specific standards 
required by the markets served. Currently operating  
units with 87 per cent of the Group’s turnover have  
ISO 9001 accreditation.
Community
The Board encourages and supports initiatives by 
operating units to engage with their local community. 
Operating units and their staff participate in a variety of 
local activities including projects with local schools and 
charity events. The Group policy on donations is to 
support local educational and charitable causes, and in 
particular those where employees and their families are 
involved in the fundraising.
The environment
The Board recognises its responsibilities as a 
manufacturing concern to continue to reduce the 
environmental impact of its factories. In addition the 
Group aims to develop and supply products to help 
customers meet their own environmental objectives and 
the demands of their customers and of government.
The most significant areas of environmental impact 
associated with the Group’s operations are energy 
consumption, waste to landfill, the use of outer packaging 
and transport.
• 	 Process development: the Group seeks through internal 
developments and investment to reduce the resource 
consumption of manufacturing sites. The reuse of waste 
is encouraged across the Group.
• 	 Energy consumption: the Group continues to invest 
in energy efficiency measures such as lighting and 
improved heating and cooling systems.
• 	 Waste to landfill: the Group acts to minimise the amount 
of waste sent to landfill by selling for recycling any waste 
that cannot be used internally.
• 	 Outer packaging and transport: the Group minimises 
the use of outer packaging where appropriate and 
encourages the use of returnable outer packaging 
formats. The Group reduces the environmental impact 
of transport through vehicle efficiency measures such  
as improved load fill, reductions in empty running and 
route optimisation.
In developing new products, the Group aims to minimise 
the environmental impact and maximise energy efficiency 
and the potential for recycling, while continuing to meet 
the performance and customer requirements. The 
increasing dangers from climate change and rising fuel 
costs are making the specification of thermally efficient 
products imperative. The Group monitors developments in 
alternative materials and production processes which may 
reduce the environmental impact of its products.
The Group is committed to the introduction of 
environmental management systems such as ISO 14001. 
Currently five of the Group’s manufacturing sites have 
achieved accreditation to the environmental management 
systems standard ISO 14001. 18 Corporate Governance

The Group profit for the year after taxation amounted to £15,483,000 (2010: £7,047,000). 
The 2010 final dividend of 2.0 pence per ordinary share was paid in the financial year ended 31 December 2011 and 
amounted to £2,596,000 (2010: £nil). The Board is recommending a final dividend of 3.5 pence per ordinary share

The Board 
The names and biographical details of all the current Directors are set out on page 19. There were no changes to the 
Board and all the current Directors served throughout the period.
Except for their shareholdings, the Non-executive Directors are entirely independent. There were no contracts subsisting 
during or at the end of the year in which a Director was or is materially interested. The Company maintains a policy of 
insurance against Directors’ and officers’ liabilities. 
A description of the Board’s method of operation, its work during the year and that of its Committees, is given in the

Re-election of Directors 
In accordance with best practice, the Board has agreed that each Director will voluntarily offer themselves for re-election at 
each Annual General Meeting that they are not required to retire from office. Accordingly, Mr Pike, Mr Eperjesi, Mr Brotherton, 
Mr Tench and Mr Towers will voluntarily offer themselves for re-election at the 2012 Annual General Meeting. 
Acquisition
On 20 December 2012 the Group acquired Overland Products Company, Inc (“Overland”) for consideration of 
approximately US$15 million. Overland supplies an extensive range of stampings for a wide range of applications, mainly 
in the fenestration market, and is a long-standing partner and supplier to the Group’s US Building Products division, 
Amesbury. Overland is based in Fremont, Nebraska and in the year ended 31 December 2010 generated sales in excess  
of US$10 million.
Post-balance sheet events
Disposal
On 13 March 2012, Lupus Capital plc entered into an unconditional agreement to sell the Group’s Oil Services division, 
Gall Thomson, to Copper Bidco Limited, a company controlled by Phoenix Equity Partners for a total cash consideration 
of approximately £75 million, subject to certain post-completion adjustments relating to the amounts of cash and net 
working capital held in the Gall Thomson Group at the date of disposal. 
Onerous lease
On 2 March 2012, the Group concluded an agreement with a third party to assign the lease and exit Unit A, the remaining 
property on the Peterlee site. This will result in savings of £2.1 million in cash costs of rent, rates, utilities and services over 
the next six years to March 2018, and the release to the income statement in 2012 of around £1.9 million of provisions, 
which will increase profit after tax by £1.4 million.

Purchase of the Company’s own shares 
A resolution concerning the purchase of the Company’s own shares was approved at the AGM on 27 May 2011 and 
172,000 shares were purchased by the Company during the year ended 31 December 2011. 
It is expected that the requirements of the Lupus Long Term Incentive Plan may be met by the purchase of shares in the 
market. Although these requirements are not imminent, the Directors believe that the Company should obtain an 
authority for this purpose. They therefore propose resolution 13 to obtain authority to make market purchases up to the 
date of the AGM in 2013. The authority will be limited to 14.99% of voting shares in issue (that is, excluding shares held in 
Treasury). Resolution 13 is proposed as a special resolution, in accordance with best practice. 
Directors’ remuneration 
The Company, being traded on AIM, is not required to comply with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 or 
the disclosure provisions of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 2006 and the UKLA Listing Rules. Nevertheless, the Company 
has chosen to present a report on Directors’ remuneration on pages 27 to 33. The Directors have also determined, on a 
voluntary basis, that this report should be submitted to shareholders for their approval. This is resolution 10 in the Notice 
of Meeting.
Allotment of shares 
Shareholders passed resolutions to authorise the Directors to allot shares and, within certain limitations, to do so free 
from pre-emption rights at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 May 2011. 
The Directors’ authority to allot shares does not expire until 1 July 2016, whereas the disapplication of pre-emption rights 
is only effective until the conclusion of the Company’s 2012 AGM. The Directors believe that the Company’s proceedings 
will be more transparent if they seek renewed authority to allot at the same time as they seek authority to disapply 
pre-emption rights. 
Therefore, the Notice of Meeting includes resolution 11, which will authorise the Directors to allot shares (subject to 
specified limits) until 1 July 2017, and resolution 12, a special resolution, which will authorise the Directors to disapply 
pre-emption rights (in certain circumstances and subject to specified limits) until the conclusion of the Company’s 
2013 AGM. 
Substantial shareholders 
In addition to the holdings of the Directors described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, at the latest practicable date 
before publication of this report the Company had been notified of, or had identified, the following direct or indirect 
interests comprising 3% or more of its voting share capital (the issued share capital less shares held by the Company in 
Treasury):

Financial risk management 
A statement on the financial risk management objectives, policies and other matters in relation to the use of financial 
instruments is set out in note 21 in the notes to the Group financial statements. 
Safety, health and the environment 
The Board recognises that the highest standards in safety, health and environmental issues are an essential part of sound 
business practice. The Board is committed to improving the impact on the environment from any of its operations and to 
incorporating the principles of sustainable development. A full description of the Group’s policies with respect to health 
and safety and the environment are given in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report on pages 16 and 17. 
 
Employees 
The Group’s excellent performance would not be possible without employees of the highest calibre with the motivation 
to perform to their full potential. The Group operates on a decentralised structure, reflecting the organisation of the 
Group. This underscores our belief that localised teams, operating under common principles, are best equipped to deal 
with the varying cultures, operating structures and geographic locations that exist in the Group. 
Each operating entity in the Group is encouraged to implement comprehensive employment policies designed to attract, 
retain and motivate the highest quality of staff and to determine ways in which their knowledge and skills can best 
contribute towards the success of the business. 
We are committed to ensuring that all our employees are treated equally, regardless of gender, colour, nationality, ethnic 
origin, race, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or religion. We are committed to regular communication and 
consultation with our employees and we encourage employee involvement in our performance. Each company in the 
Group endeavours to provide equality of opportunity in recruiting, training, promoting and developing the careers of 
disabled people. 
Going concern 
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budget and cash flow forecasts. On the basis of this review, and in the light of 
the current financial position and the existing borrowing facilities, the Board believes it is appropriate to continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the Annual report and accounts, as stated in the Directors’ responsibilities statement 
on page 26.

Statements
The Company, being traded on AIM, is not required to comply with the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code. 
Nevertheless, the Directors acknowledge the importance of the Principles set out in the Corporate Governance Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council, and have put in place a framework for corporate governance which they 
believe is appropriate for the Company. They have chosen to make the following voluntary disclosures: 
The Board 
Board composition 
The Board comprises two Executive and three Non-executive Directors and the names and biographical details of all the 
current Directors are set out on page 19. All the current Directors served throughout the year ended 31 December 2011 
and there were no changes to the Board.
Both Mr Eperjesi and Mr Brotherton are engaged exclusively on the Company’s business and have no outside interests 
that conflict with their responsibilities to the Company. Except for their shareholdings, all Non-executive Directors are 
independent. 
How the Board operates 
The Board meets regularly and is responsible for the overall leadership, strategy, development and control of the Group 
in order to achieve its objectives for continued earnings growth and to enhance shareholder value. The Board sets the 
Group’s strategic aims, ensures that the necessary financial and human resources are in place for the Group to meet its 
objectives, reviews management performance and ensures that high ethical standards of behaviour are followed. The 
Board also ensures that there is an effective system of controls to safeguard the Company’s assets and to enable risks  
to be properly assessed and managed. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for it and this includes key matters such as approval 
of the Group’s objectives, strategic plans, annual budgets, financial reporting, risk assessment and internal controls, 
monitoring operating and financial performance, capital and legal structure, material capital investments, material 
contracts and transactions, communication with shareholders, Board membership and appointments, Directors’ 
remuneration and contracts, corporate governance, Group policies, and delegation of responsibilities. Matters not 
specifically reserved for the Board are delegated to management. 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely information. The Company 
Secretary distributes briefing papers to all Directors in advance of Board meetings. All Directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that 
applicable rules and regulations are complied with. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
for the Board as a whole. In addition, procedures are in place to enable the Directors to obtain independent professional 
advice in the furtherance of their duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.

Re-election of Directors 
All Directors are subject to re-election by the shareholders at Annual General Meetings at a maximum interval of three 
years. The Articles of Association provide that Directors appointed by the Board will be subject to re-election at the first 
AGM thereafter. In accordance with best practice, the Board has agreed that each Director will voluntarily offer themselves 
for re-election at each Annual General Meeting that they are not required to retire from office.
Remuneration 
A report on Directors’ remuneration is included on pages 27 to 33. 
Board Committees 
The Board has formed an Audit and Corporate Governance Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nominations 
Committee, each comprised of all the Non-executive Directors. The existence of the Committees ensures that time is 
allocated on a formal basis to consider relevant issues. Terms of reference for the Board and each of the Board 
Committees were reviewed and refreshed during the year and are available for inspection on the Group website.
Audit and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Audit and Corporate Governance Committee is made up of the Non-executive Directors and meets at least three 
times a year. The Executive Directors also attend certain meetings of the Committee. The Committee considers the 
appointment and fees of the external auditors and discusses the scope of the audit and its findings. The Committee is also 
responsible for monitoring compliance with accounting and legal requirements and for reviewing the annual and interim 
financial statements. This Committee was chaired by Mr Towers and met three times during 2011. 
The Audit Committee also reviews any non-audit services provided by the auditors. Such services have been, and are, 
limited to the provision of transaction support services, some tax compliance work and tax advice. The Committee is 
satisfied that the provision of such services does not in any way prejudice the objectivity and independence of the 
auditors. Professional firms other than the auditors also provide tax compliance work and tax advice. 
The work of the Committee during the year included consideration of the following matters:
• 	 The annual financial statements and the preliminary results announcement for the year ended 31 December 2010 
before their submission to the Board for approval, including consideration of the Group on a going concern basis.
• 	 The interim financial statements and interim results announcement for the six months ended 30 June 2011.
• 	 Areas of significance in the preparation of the financial statements, including exceptional items, impairment reviews, 
tax provisions.
• 	 Reports from the external auditors on the annual and interim financial statements, the approval of the audit plan and  
fee proposal for the 2011 year end audit.
• 	 Developments in accounting standards and the Group’s responses.
• 	 The internal control environment and risk management systems and the Group’s statement on internal control systems, 
prior to endorsement by the Board.
• 	 Revisions to treasury policies and compliance with risk limits.
• 	 Material legal developments.
• 	 Whistleblowing systems in place within the Group and material whistleblowing reports.
• 	 The effectiveness of the external auditors, completion of the audit tender process and the recommendation to the 
Board of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the external auditors.
• 	 The policy on auditor independence and non-audit services, and consideration of the nature, scope and 
appropriateness of non-audit services supplied by the external auditors.
• 	 Its terms of reference and effectiveness.
Audit tender 
The Group’s external audit has been carried out since 2004 by Grant Thornton UK LLP and, following a review of all 
external advisory appointments, the Audit Committee determined that it was an appropriate time in October 2011 to invite 
proposals for the external audit of the Group for the year ending 31 December 2012. Four audit firms, including Grant 
Thornton UK LLP were invited to participate in the audit tender process. At the conclusion of this process in December 
2011 the Audit Committee made a recommendation to the Board to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to be the 
Group’s external auditors for the year ended 31 December 2012 and the Board approved this decision. Accordingly  
Grant Thornton UK LLP will resign as the Group’s auditors before the 2012 AGM.

Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee considers and approves the remuneration and benefits of the Directors. The Committee 
also determines the remuneration of the members of the Executive Management Committee of the Company and the 
Company Secretary and of the service providers contracted to perform executive functions for the Group as well as 
long-term share incentive and share option schemes for all employees. 
The membership and work of the Committee during the year ended 31 December 2011 is described in detail in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 27 to 33. 
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee identifies and nominates candidates for the office of Director of the Company. It meets as 
and when required and is chaired by Mr Pike, except that Mr Pike would not chair the Committee or attend it if it were to 
consider the appointment of a successor Chairman. 
Internal control 
The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Group’s system of internal controls and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of those controls. The Board, including the Executive Directors, reviews the internal control framework  
on an ongoing basis. 
Procedures have been developed to safeguard assets against unauthorised use or disposition of assets and to maintain 
proper accounting records to provide reliable financial information both for internal use and for publication. In accordance 
with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control, the procedures are regularly reviewed in the light of an 
ongoing process to identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks faced by the Company. The process has been in 
place for the full year under review and up to the date of the approval of the Annual report and Financial statements.  
The procedures are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Relations with shareholders 
Communications with shareholders are given high priority and there is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders. 
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes their 
participation. Details of resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting can be found in the Directors’ Report. 
The Company has set up a website www.lupuscapital.co.uk which shareholders, investors and other interested parties 
may access. The website permits users to download copies of published financial reports, press releases and Stock 
Exchange announcements. 
Going concern
In order to satisfy themselves that the Group has adequate resources for the future, the Board reviewed the Group’s 
committed funding and liquidity positions, its ability to generate cash from trading activities and its ability to raise external 
funding in the future. The operational performance, as described in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 10 to 13, 
the future plans for the Group and the risks facing the Group, described on page 14 and 15, were also reviewed.
In performing their reviews, the Board acknowledged the current level of uncertainty in the financial markets and has 
considered various sensitivity analyses when assessing the forecast funding and headroom requirements of the Group.
Consequently, based on the reviews outlined above, the Board concluded that both the Group as a whole and Lupus 
Capital plc have adequate resources to meet their operational needs for the foreseeable future, and that it remains 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 26 Corporate Governance
Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the European Union and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
laws). Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• 	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• 	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• 	 state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• 	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
In so far as each of the Directors is aware:
• 	 there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• 	 the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Remuneration report letter
Dear Shareholder
I would like to share with you a summary of the Company’s remuneration policy and practice over the last year.
Salaries
Below inflation salary increases of 2.5 per cent and 2.0 per cent were awarded to the Executive Directors at the start of 
the 2011 and 2012 financial years respectively, consistent with the approach taken across the Group. 
Annual Bonus Scheme and Deferred Share Bonus Plan
In difficult markets the Company performed creditably during the year, particularly when compared to its closest 
competitors. The bonuses awarded to the Executive Directors for 2011 averaged 22 per cent of the maximum bonus 
opportunity of 100 per cent of bonusable salary, reflecting the highly stretching performance targets that were set by  
the Committee at the start of the financial year. Under the terms of the Group’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan, 50 per cent  
of the awards made to the Executive Directors are made in the form of shares deferred for three years.
During the year the Group’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan was extended to include the Group’s top managers below Board 
level who will be required to defer 25 per cent of their 2011 and 2012 bonuses into shares for a period of three years. This 
focuses the plan on the senior management who are best positioned to drive the Company’s performance and aligns 
their annual incentive arrangements with the creation of long-term shareholder value.
The terms and conditions of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan were amended during the year following changes to 
legislation concerning disguised remuneration.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders in 2010 and a first tranche of awards covering the 
financial years 2011 to 2013 was made in December of that year. During 2011 a second tranche of awards covering the 
same financial years was made to executive directors and senior managers. Cumulative EPS targets under this second 
tranche were increased from those contained in the first tranche of awards.
Following the disposal of Gall Thomson, the Committee intends to review the existing EPS targets set for the awards 
already made in 2010 and 2011.
The Committee has continued its practice of reviewing and discussing with the Group’s principal shareholders the 
proposed metrics and associated targets in advance of grants made under the LTIP Plan. 
Shareholding guidelines
The Executive Directors continue to maintain a high level of personal share ownership in accordance with the Company’s 
shareholding guidelines and have agreed to retain at least half of all shares vesting (net of taxes) under the Company’s 
various share schemes until such time as the target personal share ownership is achieved.
Conclusion
The outlook for 2012 remains challenging in terms of the Group’s end markets, but our remuneration policy and 
framework provide a balanced platform to incentivise, motivate, retain and reward our leadership team.

The Remuneration Report is presented to shareholders by the Board and sets out the remuneration policy and details of 
the remuneration of each Director. The report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006 (the “Act”) and the AIM Rules for Companies as issued by the London Stock Exchange. 
A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 25 May 2012. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises all Non-executive Directors of the Company. The Executive 
Directors may, by invitation, attend meetings and provide advice to the Committee, except when their own remuneration 
is discussed. During 2011 the Committee was chaired by Mr Tench and met four times. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for:
• 	 setting, reviewing and recommending to the Board for approval the Company’s overall remuneration policy 
and strategy;
• 	 determining and reviewing the terms of appointment and the remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors 
of the Company and the Chairman;
• 	 determining and reviewing the terms of appointment and the remuneration arrangements of the members of the 
Executive Management Committee of the Company; and
• 	 approving the rules, and launch, of any Company share, share option or cash-based incentive plan, and the grant, 
award, allocation or issue of shares, share options or payments under any such plan. 
During the year Kepler Associates were engaged by the Committee to provide it with independent remuneration advice. 
Kepler Associates did not provide any other services to the Company other than remuneration advice. 
Remuneration policy 
Executive Directors 
The Remuneration Committee considers the need to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior 
management in determining appropriate remuneration policies and packages. It also takes into account the internal pay 
and benefits practice and employment conditions both within the Group as a whole and within the particular national 
context. External comparisons examine equivalent roles in similar companies taking into account their size, business 
complexity, international scope and relative performance. Consideration is also given to the risks arising from market 
comparisons and inappropriate performance criteria. 
Remuneration 
The current remuneration package for the Executive Directors comprises fixed and variable components. The variable 
components are the performance related incentive arrangements referred to in detail below.
Executive Directors’ remuneration 2011
Target assumes that bonus of 50 per cent of base salary is earned and that 25 per cent of the Lupus shares awarded under 
the LTIP in respect of 2011, based on a market value of £1.12 at 31 December 2011, vest. Stretch assumes that bonus of 
100 per cent of base salary is earned and that 100 per cent of the Lupus shares awarded under the LTIP in respect of 2011, 
based on a market value of £1.12, vest.

The key components of the remuneration of Executive Directors are set out below: 
Salary 
Salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee, although not necessarily increased. This review takes into 
account an individual’s responsibilities, abilities, experience, performance, market competitiveness and pay and conditions 
in the relevant countries across the Group as described above. 
During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed Executive Director salaries and determined that, with effect from 
1 January 2012, Louis Eperjesi and James Brotherton’s annual salaries (comprising base salary plus an allowance in lieu of 
pension and benefits) would be increased by 2% to £313,650 and £209,100 respectively. 
Performance related remuneration 
Annual bonus 
The annual bonus framework for Executive Directors for 2011 is as follows: 
• 	 Target and maximum annual bonus opportunities of 50 per cent and 100 per cent (respectively) of base salary, 70 per 
cent based on the underlying group profit before tax and 30 per cent based on free cash flow. 
• 	 50 per cent of bonus amounts will be converted into ordinary shares in the capital of the Company under the terms 
of the recently introduced Deferred Share Bonus Plan and released after three years. 
Based on the performance for 2011 against the underlying Group profit before tax and the free cash flow targets set, the 
Committee determined that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have each achieved a bonus level 
of 22.2% of their respective base salaries, 50% of which will be paid in cash in March 2012 and 50% will be awarded in the 
form of nil-cost options deferred for three years under the terms of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan. 
Under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, 50% of Executive Director bonuses that would otherwise have been payable will 
be delivered in the form of either conditional share awards or nil-cost options, to strengthen alignment with shareholders’ 
interests. These awards will normally be released (together with dividend equivalents in cash or shares) after three years. 
Other key employees are also required to defer a proportion of their bonuses pursuant to the Deferred Share Bonus Plan.

The LTIP provides for the grant of: (i) performance shares (or nil-cost options); and/or (ii) fair-market value options, 
vesting on the satisfaction of stretching performance criteria over three years (subject to individual and overall limits). 
The Remuneration Committee currently intends that long-term incentive awards will be in the form of nil-cost options; 
however, the Remuneration Committee retains the flexibility to consider other forms of award (such as fair-market value 
options) for future cycles as it is mindful that alternative forms of award remain prevalent in some of the geographies  
(eg the US) in which the Company competes for senior executive management. 
On 6 July 2011 the Remuneration Committee granted nil or nominal cost options over 699,000 ordinary shares in the 
Company to around 16 senior managers, executives and Executive Directors (“2011 Awards”). In addition, the Remuneration 
Committee intends to make awards under the LTIP in the period following the announcement of the Company’s full-year 
results (“2012 Awards”). 
Performance criteria 
The vesting of LTIP awards are subject to stretching performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee at the start 
of each performance period. 2010 Awards and 2011 Awards will vest, together with dividends foregone, based on three-
year cumulative underlying earnings per share (“EPS”) for the financial years 2011 to 2013. 
The Remuneration Committee adopts a robust process to setting what it feels are stretching, but achievable, annual and 
long-term incentive performance targets. Performance targets are calibrated to be equivalent to at least ‘upper quartile’ 
performance for awards to vest in full and take account of a number of reference points which reflect internal and 
external expectations, including: the latest internal forecasts, broker forecasts for sector comparators, EPS performance 
zones used in comparator long-term incentives, straight-line profit growth consistent with median and upper quartile 
returns over the next three to five years and broker forecast data for the Company. 
Underlying EPS is the performance measure that determines vesting of 2010 and 2011 LTIP awards as underlying EPS 
is well-aligned with shareholder interests, provides good line-of-sight and is well understood. The Remuneration 
Committee is committed to reviewing the possibility of introducing additional performance measures such as total 
shareholder return (“TSR”) or cash flow (as well as the continuing appropriateness of underlying EPS) in advance of 
each LTIP cycle. 
Additionally, for awards to vest on underlying EPS, the Remuneration Committee must satisfy itself that the 
recorded underlying EPS is a genuine reflection of the underlying business performance of the Company over the 
performance period.  30 Corporate Governance
Performance criteria: 2010 Awards 
The performance criteria for vesting of 2010 Awards is a three-year cumulative underlying EPS 2011-13 performance 
range of 38p to 47p. In summary, if over the three financial years 2011 to 2013, cumulative underlying EPS is less than or 
equal to 38p, no 2010 Awards will vest; 25 per cent of 2010 Awards will vest for cumulative underlying EPS of 38p, rising 
on a straight-line basis to full vesting for cumulative underlying EPS of 47p or higher. 
Performance criteria: 2011 Awards 
The performance criteria for vesting of 2011 Awards is a three-year cumulative underlying EPS 2011-13 performance range 
of 41p to 50p. In summary, if over the three financial years 2011 to 2013, cumulative underlying EPS is less than or equal to 
41p, no 2011 Awards will vest; 25 per cent of 2011 Awards will vest for cumulative underlying EPS of 41p, rising on a 
straight-line basis to full vesting for cumulative underlying EPS of 50p or higher. 
Review of performance criteria
The Remuneration Committee intends to review the existing performance criteria for both the 2010 Awards and the 2011 
Awards, following the material disposal of the Group’s Oil Services division on 13 March 2012.
Dilution limit 
Generally, it is the intention that LTIP awards will be satisfied through the transfer of existing shares by the Company’s 
employees’ benefit trust unless the Remuneration Committee, in its discretion, feels that a new issue of shares would be 
more appropriate. In the event that LTIP awards are satisfied through new issue shares, the Company will operate within 
the Association of British Insurers’ (“ABI”) guideline dilution limit of 10 per cent in 10 years for all share based incentive 
schemes (excluding awards to the former executive chairman granted in 2004 and 2008). Expected dilution should not 
exceed the 10 per cent dilution limit, even if the awards made to the former Executive Chairman are taken into account. 
The Remuneration Committee has the flexibility to operate outside the ABI guideline of 5 per cent in 10 years dilution limit 
for discretionary share based incentive schemes to accommodate LTIP awards for a broader employee population. In 
managing dilution, the Company will nevertheless be mindful of the 5 per cent in 10 years guideline and will be prudent 
in managing the flow rates, keeping shareholders informed of actual and anticipated dilution levels over time. The 2010 
and 2011 LTIP awards are likely to be satisfied through the transfer of existing shares rather than the issue of new shares. 
Assuming that all performance targets are met in full, the Remuneration Committee currently envisages that a maximum 
of 575,000 of the 2,112,000 shares subject to the 2010 Awards and the 2011 Awards (approximately 27%) will be satisfied 
through new issue shares to ensure that local trusts, tax and securities laws are complied with in certain overseas 
jurisdiction. 
Shareholding guidelines 
The Remuneration Committee has also adopted shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors. Executive Directors will 
be expected to retain at least half of the shares vesting (net of taxes) under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan or the LTIP until 
such time as a total personal shareholding equivalent to 100 per cent of base salary has been achieved. The table below 
sets out the individual requirement and level of shareholding achieved for each Executive Director at 31 December 2011:

Notes to Directors’ minimum shareholding table above:
1 Base salary as at 31 December 2011.
2 Based on the closing price of a Lupus Capital plc ordinary share of £1.12 on 31 December 2011.
Awards to Executive Directors 
The number of shares awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP for the 2011 Awards are as follows:
2011
Awards
Louis Eperjesi 200,000
James Brotherton 150,000
The 2011 Awards are granted over a fixed number of shares to mitigate the impact of share price volatility and strengthen 
alignment of executive interests with those of shareholders over the period to grant. The Committee intends to adopt the 
more usual methodology of granting LTIP awards by reference to a percentage of base salary from 2012 onwards and 
accordingly from 2012, LTIP awards of performance shares or nil-cost options will be restricted to a maximum of 100 per 
cent of base salary.

Senior executives below the Executive Directors 
The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Executive Directors who are 
members of the Executive Management Committee is consistent with that for the Executive Directors. These senior 
executives all have a significant portion of their reward package linked to performance. They all qualify for an annual 
bonus, and are eligible for awards under the LTIP, and their financial targets are the same as, or cascaded from, the targets 
for the Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee reviews and approves the individual remuneration packages 
for the Executive Management Committee members and the Company Secretary in accordance with the overriding 
objectives of the Group’s remuneration policy. Their individual performance is reviewed and their increases in base salary, 
annual bonus payments and any LTIP awards are subject to approval by the Remuneration Committee each year. Other 
senior employees below Executive Management Committee level are generally treated consistently with the Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive Management Committee, with the exception that they may participate in local 
discretionary annual cash bonus plans.

Non-executive Directors’ fees and Chairman fees
Non-executive Directors 
The Chairman of the Board and the Executive Directors determine the remuneration of Non-executive Directors. 
Non-executive Director fees are reviewed (from time to time) in light of the commitment and level of involvement that 
Non-executive Directors are required to devote to the activities of the Board and its Committees, market practice, and 
surveys by Keipler Associates. Non-executive Directors do not participate in any bonus or share based incentive schemes. 
During the year, the fees of the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors were reviewed. With effect from 1 June 2011 
the basic fees of the Non-executive Chairman were increased from £90,000 to £100,000 per year and the basic fees paid 
to the other Non-executive Directors were increased from £30,000 to £35,000 per year. In addition the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, Mr Tench, was paid a fee of £5,000 per year and the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Mr 
Towers, was paid a fee of £5,000 per year all with effect from 1 June 2011.
During 2011 Martin Towers agreed with the Company to have all his fees paid directly into his personal pension plan, 
which amounted to £36,000.

Notes to the financial statements
1. Basis of preparation and accounting policies
The Group’s principal activities are the manufacture, supply and distribution of building products. Lupus Capital plc is the 
Group’s ultimate parent company and it is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales at the address shown on 
page 81.
The Group’s shares are admitted to trading on AIM, a market of the London Stock Exchange.
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the principal accounting policies adopted 
by the Group as set out in note 2 and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations (“IFRIC”) as adopted for use in the European Union (“EU”), and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The following standards have been amended or became effective during the year. The Group’s consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with these changes where relevant:
• 	 IAS 24 (Revised), Related party disclosures – introducing revised definitions of related parties.
• 	 IAS 32 (Amendment), Financial instruments: presentation – changes in the classification of certain qualifying financial 
instruments from financial liabilities to equity instruments.
• 	 IFRIC 14 (Amendment) – Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement.
• 	 IFRIC 19 – Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will have 
sufficient funds to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historic cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain 
financial instruments. The measurement basis and significant accounting policies are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements consolidate the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (note 29) drawn up to 31 December 
each year. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared as of the same reporting date as the parent, using 
consistent accounting policies.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control over financial and operating policies is transferred  
to the Group and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of a business combination is 
measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of any assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, 
including contingent liabilities, and equity instruments issued by the Group which includes the fair value of any asset or 
liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The identifiable 
assets and liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of  
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, including those of an 
intangible and tangible nature, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but are considered an impairment indicator of the underlying asset transferred. 
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted 
by the Group.
Recent accounting developments
During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with effective dates after  
the date of these financial statements that have not yet been adopted by the Company:
• 	 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements, on other comprehensive income (effective 1 July 2012).
• 	 Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes (effective 1 January 2012).
• 	 IAS 19 (Revised) Employee benefits (effective 1 January 2013).
• 	 IAS 27 (Revised) Separate financial statements (effective 1 January 2013).
• 	 IAS 28 (Revised) Associates and joint ventures (effective 1 January 2013).
• 	 Amendments to IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRS on hyperinflation and fixed dates (effective 1 July 2011).
• 	 Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures on derecognition (effective 1 July 2011).
• 	 IFRS 9 Financial instruments (effective 1 January 2013). 40 Financial Statements
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
• 	 IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements (effective 1 January 2013).
• 	 IFRS 11 Joint arrangements (effective 1 January 2013).
• 	 IFRS 12 Disclosures of interest in other entities (effective 1 January 2013).
• 	 IFRS 13 Fair value measurement (effective 1 January 2013).
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the 
Group’s reported results.
Principal accounting policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting policies requires the Directors 
to make judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of 
contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported income and expense during the reporting periods.
Although the judgements and assumptions are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, 
actual results may differ from these estimates.
The accounting policies set out below have been used to prepare the financial statements.
Goodwill
Goodwill, being the difference between the fair value of consideration paid for new interests in Group companies and  
the fair value of the Group’s share of their net identifiable assets and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition, is 
capitalised. Goodwill represents consideration paid by the Group in anticipation of future economic benefits from  
assets that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.
Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an impairment review on an annual basis or more frequently when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate it might be impaired. Any impairment is charged to the income statement in the period 
in which it arises.
Intangible assets
On acquisition of Group companies, the Group recognises any separately identifiable intangible assets separately from 
goodwill, initially measuring the intangible assets at fair value.
Purchased intangible assets acquired through a business combination, including purchased brands, customer 
relationships, trademarks and licences, are capitalised at fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful economic lives as follows:
• 	 Acquired brands – 5 years to indefinite.
• 	 Customer relationships – 9 to 16 years.
• 	 Trade marks and licenses – 3 to 4 years.
The Group capitalises acquired computer software at cost. Computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis over 
its estimated useful life, up to three years. The carrying value of intangible assets with a finite life is reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets
Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to cash-generating units (equivalent to the reported operating 
segments). The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for 
impairment annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. 
Goodwill that has been impaired previously cannot be reversed at a later date.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment 
when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss.
Where purchased intangible assets are considered by the Board of Directors to have an indefinite life, they are not 
amortised but are subject to an impairment review on an annual basis or more frequently if necessary. Intangible assets 
not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
An impairment review is performed by comparing the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment, intangible 
asset or cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated with its recoverable amount, being the higher of  
the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The fair value less costs to sell is the amount that could be obtained on 
disposal of the asset. The value in use is determined by discounting, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset, the expected future cash flows 
resulting from its continued use, including those on final disposal. Impairment losses are recognised in the income 
statement immediately. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. Considerable management judgement 
is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows. Accordingly, actual cash flows could vary considerably from 
forecast cash flows. Impairment reversals are permitted to property, plant and equipment or intangible assets (but not 
goodwill) to the extent that the new carrying value does not exceed the amount it would have been if no impairment  
loss been previously recognised.
Segment reporting
The Group’s operations are divided into two product segments, Oil Services and Building Products, which is consistent 
with the segments identified in internal reports which are reviewed by the chief operating decision makers, defined as  
the Board of Directors. A product segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in providing a group of related 
products and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of the other segments. IFRS 8 also requires 
disclosure of information on geographical areas with the Group’s system of internal reporting to key operating decision 
makers serving as a starting point.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefit will flow to the Group and the revenue can 
be reliably measured. Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods provided to customers during the year in the 
normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. As such revenue from the sale of 
goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually 
on dispatch of the goods.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand as well as short-term highly liquid investments such as 
money market instruments and bank deposits readily convertible into cash.
Interest bearing bank loans and borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and borrowings are recorded initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. 
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is provided on all assets 
except freehold land at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line 
basis over its expected useful life, at the following annual rates:
Freehold land and buildings
Freehold land Not depreciated
Freehold buildings 2% to 5%
Plant and machinery 7.5% to 33%
Motor vehicles 20% to 25%
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and 
method of depreciation are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes cost of materials determined on a 
purchase cost basis, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of 
activity on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices, less further costs expected to 
be incurred to completion and disposal. 42 Financial Statements
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Leases
Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated 
as a finance lease. Assets held under finance leases and similar contracts which confer the rights and obligations similar to 
those attached to owned assets are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value or, if lower, the present value 
of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the 
lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
reflected in the income statement.
Assets held under finance lease are depreciated over the lower of the useful lives and the term of the lease.
All other leases are treated as operating leases, and rentals payable are charged to the income statement account on  
a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial 
statements, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in Pounds Sterling which is the functional 
currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In individual companies, transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are taken to the income statement, with the exception of 
differences on foreign currency borrowings that form part of a net investment in a foreign entity. These are taken directly 
to equity, other than any ineffective element, until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised  
in the consolidated income statement.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling 
at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated into Sterling at the 
average rates throughout the year.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets of Group companies, together with differences 
arising from the translation of the net results at average or actual rates to the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet 
date, are taken to other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative translation differences 
recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation are recognised in the income 
statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
• 	 the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event;
• 	 it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
• 	 a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation  
at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is 
measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those 
cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in the income statement within 
net finance costs.
Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments. A restructuring 
provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its 
main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures 
arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not 
associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations under local sale of goods legislation are recognised at the date of 
sale of the relevant products, at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligation.

Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group operates a defined contribution pension and two defined benefit schemes.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit schemes is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial 
valuation method. The operating and financing costs of the pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the 
period in which they arise and are recognised separately. The costs of past service benefit enhancements, settlements 
and curtailments are also recognised in the period in which they arise. The past service cost is recognised as an expense 
on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. If the benefits are already vested 
immediately following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, past service costs are recognised immediately. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The net surplus or deficit is presented with the other net assets on the balance sheet. The related deferred tax is shown 
with the other deferred tax balances.
The defined benefit assets and liabilities comprise the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the past service 
cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The 
value of any assets is restricted to the sum of any past service costs not yet recognised and the present value of any 
economic benefit available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.
Contributions to the defined contribution scheme are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, 
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable 
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s 
equity holders.
Financial assets, liabilities and derivatives
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument and are generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, 
sold, cancelled or expires.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost, 
using the effective interest rate method, less appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Trade payables 
are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the writedown is determined 
as the difference between the carrying amount and present value of estimated future cash flows.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered 
into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as 
liabilities when fair value is negative.
For those instruments designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is 
documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction,  
the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges  
are expected at inception to be highly effective.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either a cash flow hedge, where exposures to variability in cash flows 
attributable to either a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or highly probable purchase are 
hedged; or hedges of net investments in foreign operations (net investment hedges), where exposures to changes  
in fair value or future cash flows of the investment are hedged. 44 Financial Statements
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
In relation to cash flow hedges (forward foreign currency contracts) to hedge either highly probable anticipated purchases 
or firm commitments which meet the conditions for special hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income  
and the ineffective portion is recognised in net profit or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, then,  
at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that were previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the 
asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in other comprehensive income 
are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit  
and loss, for example when the future sale actually occurs.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken 
directly to net profit or loss for the year.
Investments in foreign operations
A foreign currency exposure arises from net investments in Group entities whose functional currency differs from the 
Group’s presentation currency. The Group uses foreign currency loans to hedge foreign currency risk. This translation risk 
does not give rise to a cash flow exposure. Its impact only arises from the translation of the net investment in the Group’s 
presentation currency.
Deferred taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable 
profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of 
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit 
and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred income tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit or loss nor the accounting profit.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
dates and that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged 
or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Exceptional items
Where certain income or expense items recorded in the period are material by their size or incidence, the Group reflects 
such items as exceptional items within a separate line on the income statement, except for those exceptional items that 
relate to net finance costs and tax.
Separate presentation of exceptional items provides an improved understanding of the elements of financial performance 
in the year so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance.

Share based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled share based remuneration scheme for certain employees under which the entity 
receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments (share options) of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in 
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its 
estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, with any changes in estimate recognised in the income 
statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of awards granted under LTIP is measured using  
a probability model to predict EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and 
share premium when the options are exercised.
Non-GAAP measure accounting policy
The Directors believe that the “underlying” profit and earnings per share measures provide additional useful information  
to shareholders on the underlying performance of the business. These measures are consistent with how business 
performance is measured internally. The adjusted profit before tax measure is not recognised under IFRS and may not be 
comparable with “underlying” profit measures used by other companies. The adjustments made to reported profit before 
tax are to include the following:
• 	 Exceptional income and charges – these are largely one-off in nature and therefore create volatility in reported 
earnings.
• 	 Amortisation of intangible items and borrowing costs because of their non-cash nature and expected infrequency  
of the events giving rise to them.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following areas represent the key judgements made by management in order to facilitate the preparation of the 
Group’s financial statements:
Taxation
The Group is subject to taxation in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is required in determining the world wide provision 
for income taxes as there are transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
Impairment reviews and discount rates
The Group tests intangible assets and goodwill for impairment in accordance with the stated accounting policy. The value 
in use calculations requires the use of estimates of future growth and assessment of appropriate discount rates.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are expense or income items recorded in a period which have been determined by management as 
being material by their size or incidence and are presented separately within the results of the Group. The determination 
of which items are disclosed as exceptional will affect the presentation of profit measures including EBITA and adjusted 
earnings per share, and requires a degree of judgement. Details regarding exceptional items reported during the year are 
set out in note 4.
Non-current assets (disposal groups) held for sale
Non-current assets and all assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and 
fair value less costs to sell. 46 Financial Statements
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Non-current assets and all assets and liabilities, or disposal groups, are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will 
be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is met only when a sale is 
highly probable, the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and management is 
committed to the sale which is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date 
of classification.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions. The key 
assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have  
a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
There are a number of assumptions management have considered in performing impairment reviews of goodwill and 
intangible assets. In determining whether goodwill is impaired an estimation of value in use of the cash-generating units 
to which goodwill has been allocated has been prepared. The value in use calculation requires the Directors to estimate 
the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate 
present value (note 11).
Provisions
Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material (note 18).
Valuation of financial instruments at fair value
Management makes a number of assumptions with regards to the models used to value financial instruments at their 
fair value at year end. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative financial 
instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument 
(note 20).
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
On acquisition of Group companies, the Group recognises any separately identifiable intangible assets from goodwill, 
initially measuring each group of intangible assets at fair value. Groups of intangible assets will include purchased brands, 
customer relationships, trademarks and licences. The determination of fair value requires the Directors to estimate the 
useful economic life of each asset and the future cash flows expected to arise from each asset and to apply a suitable 
discount rate (note 12).
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for excess, obsolete or slow-
moving items. Net realisable value is based on current assessments of future demand, market conditions and new product 
development initiatives. Should demand for the Group’s products decline further during the next financial year as a result 
of the current economic downturn, additional allowances may be necessary in respect of excess or slow-moving items 
(note 14).
Defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit schemes
The benefit obligation is calculated using a number of assumptions including future salary increases, increases to pension 
benefits, mortality rates and, in the case of post-employment medical benefits, the expected rate of increase in medical 
costs. The present value of the benefit obligation is calculated by discounting the benefit obligation using market yields 
on high-quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date. The plan assets consist largely of listed securities and their  
fair values are subject to fluctuation in response to changes in market conditions. Effects of changes in the actuarial 
assumptions underlying the benefit obligation, effects of changes in the discount rate applicable to the benefit obligation 
and effects of differences between the expected and actual return on the plan assets are classified as actuarial gains and 
losses and are recognised directly in equity. Further actuarial gains and losses will be recognised during the next financial 
year. An analysis of the assumptions that will be used by management to determine the cost of defined benefit plans that 
will be recognised in the income statement in the next financial year is presented in note 22.
Deferred tax assets
Estimation is required of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences but, where deductible temporary differences 
exist, management’s judgement is required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the 
availability of future taxable profits. It is possible that the deferred tax assets actually recoverable may differ from the 
amounts recognised if actual taxable profits differ from management’s estimates (note 8).

3. Segmental analysis
Product analysis
The following tables present Group revenue and profit and certain assets and liability information regarding the  
Group’s product segments, which have been generated using Group accounting policies, with no differences  
of measurement applied.
Comparative figures for 2010 have been revised to reflect the elimination of intragroup trading more accurately and  
to re-apportion head office overheads previously included in the results of the discontinued Oil Services division.

The standard rate of Corporation tax in the UK changed from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011. Accordingly, the 
Group’s UK profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 26.5% (2010: 28%). The tax rate of 25% was 
substantively enacted in July 2011, and UK deferred tax assets and liabilities have been provided at this rate. 52 Financial Statements
8. Taxation continued
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Exceptional adjustments in respect of prior periods arose from the clarification with the tax authorities of the tax 
treatment of provisions, mainly those originally made at the time of the Schlegel acquisition in 2006 and the LSS 
acquisition in 2007.

Transfer of assets of disposal group classified as held for sale (80) –
  (9,216) (15,715)
(d) Factors that may affect future tax charges
There are estimated tax losses of £13,745,000 (2010: £9,980,000) within the Group, comprising capital losses of 
£7,348,000 and trading losses of £6,397,000. As the future use of these losses is uncertain, in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policy only a portion of these losses have been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
The amounts of deferred tax not recognised are as follows:
 
2011
£’000
2010
£’000
Tax losses (846) (785)
Capital losses (1,837) (2,057)
  (2,683) (2,842)
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £32.9 million (2010: £29.9 million) relating to the 
unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries. As a result of UK legislation, which largely exempts from UK tax the overseas 
dividends received, the temporary differences arising on unremitted profits are unlikely to lead to additional UK corporate 
taxes. Furthermore, although the remittance to the UK of those earnings could still result in a tax liability, arising as a result 
of withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate, such jurisdictions provide 
currently for zero dividend withholding tax in their tax agreements with the UK.
9. Discontinued operations
During 2011, the Group determined to dispose of its Oil Services business, comprising Gall Thomson and its subsidiaries, 
and undertook a process to identify preferred bidders which was completed in December 2011 (see note 31).
On 13 March 2012, the Group completed this sale. These activities have been presented as discontinued as they satisfy the 
definition of discontinued operations as defined by IFRS 5, as the disposal was highly probable at 31 December 2011. 54 Financial Statements

10. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Impairment tests for goodwill
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might 
be impaired.
CGUs are defined as the Group’s reported operating segments, namely Building Products and Oil Services, which are 
consistent with the product segments reported in the segment analysis in note 3. In 2010, the Group reported three CGUs 
(LSS, Schlegel and Gall Thomson) then defined as the three groups of businesses acquired that each generated goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. Value in use is determined by 
discounting the future pre-tax cash flows generated from the continuing use of the CGU, using a pre-tax discount rate.
Cash flow projections are derived from financial plans approved by the Board and cover a three year period. They reflect 
management’s expectations of revenue growth, operating cost and margin for each CGU based on past experience. Cash 
flows beyond the first three years have been extrapolated using revenue growth rates of 3.0% for Building Products and 
3.5% for Oil Services. After the five year forecast period, no further growth in revenue and profit has been assumed based 
on a prudent view of long-term growth rates.
Discount rates are estimated using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risk profiles of the CGUs.

Sensitivity analysis was calculated on the basis of lowering the forecast earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and 
amortisation (“EBITDA”) by a constant percentage each year from year one onwards in perpetuity until the excess of value 
in use over the carrying value of the CGU’s assets was reduced to zero. EBITDA would need to decrease by 25 percentage 
points for each year from year one onwards in perpetuity before any impairment would arise in respect of the CGU with 
the lowest impairment headroom.

Property related
Property provisions relate to provisions for onerous leases of £7,936,000, and leasehold dilapidations of £1,987,000,  
and are expected to be utilised by 2018.
For onerous leases, the Group has provided for the rental payments due over the remaining term of existing operating 
lease contracts where a period of vacancy is ongoing. The provision has been calculated after taking into account both 
the periods over which properties are likely to remain vacant and any likely sub-lease income on a property-by-property 
basis. The provision covers potential transfer of economic benefit over the full range of current lease commitments 
disclosed in note 28.
The provision for leasehold dilapidations relates to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties to their 
original state of repair. The transfer of economic benefits will occur at the end of the leases set out in note 28.
Restructuring
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs at restructured/closed business units and are 
expected to be utilised by the end of 2013.
Warranty
The warranty provision is calculated based on historical experience of the ultimate cost of settling product warranty 
claims and potential claims. Warranty provisions are expected to be utilised by the end of 2017.
Other
Other provisions comprise taxation and inventory-related provisions, expected to be utilised by 2013 and 2018 respectively. 62 Financial Statements

The full fair value of the hedging derivatives are classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the 
hedged instrument is more than 12 months and, as a current asset or liability, if the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
Fair value measurements are based on quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2011 were £95.7 million 
(2010: £120.5 million).
During the year £1,228,000 (2010: £564,000) was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and £8,000

Fair value measurement
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
• 	 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
• 	 Level 2:  Other techniques for which all inputs which have significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable 
either directly or indirectly.
• 	 Level 3:  Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value which are not based  
on observable market data.
Derivatives shown at fair value in the balance sheet have been valued by reference to level 2 techniques described above.
Net investment hedges
The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge the value of its foreign currency denominated net assets 
due to movements in foreign exchange rates. The value of the net investment hedge was £78,518,000 at 31 December 
2011 (2010: £74,483,000). This hedge is considered highly effective, and no ineffective portion has been recognised in 
profit or loss.
21. Financial instruments: risk profile
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital structure to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern. The capital structure 
of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents (note 16), borrowings (note 19) and equity attributable to the 
shareholders of the parent as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Financial management
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases and hire purchase contracts, and cash 
and short-term deposits. The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables 
that arise directly from its operations. No trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each financial instrument risk and they are summarised below.
Liquidity and credit risk
The Group maintains sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate 
amount of credit facilities. Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity on the basis of expected cash 
flow. The Group manages liquidity risk by the pooling of cash resources and depositing funds available for investment in 
approved financial instruments with financial institutions. Counterparty risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents is 
managed by only investing in banks and financial instruments with independently assessed credit ratings of at least A-2 
as published by Standard and Poor’s. Individual risk limits are assessed by management based on the external ratings. 
Management does not expect any losses from the non-performance of these counterparties.
Credit risk is also attributable to the Group’s exposure to trade receivables due from customers.
Management assesses the credit quality of customers taking into account their financial position, past experience and 
other factors. In order to mitigate credit risk the Group utilises credit insurance in those areas of its operations where such 
insurance is available. In areas where such insurance is not available, management monitors the utilisation of credit limits 
by customers, identified either individually or by group, and incorporates this information in credit risk controls. There are 
no significant concentrations of credit risk due to the diverse nature of the Group’s client base.
Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet 
date, as summarised below:

Interest rate sensitivity
The impact of a 50 basis point movement in floating interest rates on borrowings would have a circa £0.6 million impact 
on profits. This impact would be reduced by the tax effect on such a change.

21. Financial instruments: risk profile continued
Interest rate risk of financial assets
The Board periodically reviews any exposure the Group may have to interest rate fluctuations. The weighted average 
interest rate received on deposited funds was 1.82% during the year (2010: 2.15%).
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, 
primarily with respect to the US Dollar, the Euro, the Renminbi and the Australian Dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from 
future commercial and financing transactions, recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the 
Group’s functional currency and net investments in overseas entities.
The Group has a number of overseas subsidiaries, whose net assets are subject to currency translation risk. The Group 
borrows in local currencies as appropriate to minimise the impact of this risk on the balance sheet.
Closing rates: 2011 2010
US Dollars 1.5453 1.5471
Euros 1.1933 1.1675
Average rates:    
US Dollars 1.6040 1.5463
Euros 1.1523 1.1661
Foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity
The Group receives approximately 42% of its revenues and incurs approximately 43% of its costs in US Dollars. The Group 
is therefore sensitive to movements in US Dollars against British Pounds. Each 6% movement in the US Dollars to British 
Pounds exchange rate has circa £0.7 million impact on operating profits and equity. Offsetting this will be reductions to 
US Dollars interest and US tax liabilities. This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
The Group receives approximately 10% of its revenues and incurs approximately 13% of its costs in Euros. Each 3% 
movement in the Euro to British Pounds exchange rate has a circa £0.1 million impact on operating profits. Offsetting this 
will be reductions to Euro interest and Euro tax liabilities. This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, 
remain constant.
The movements in exchange rates are considered to be indicative of the historic average movements in exchange rates.
The impact of movements in other exchange rates is immaterial.

22. Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans
22.1 Defined contribution pension schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held externally to the 
Group in separate trustee administered funds. The costs of the Group’s defined contribution pension schemes are 
charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due. The Group had unpaid pension contributions of £nil 
(2010: £38,000) included within employee benefit liabilities.
22.2 Defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit schemes
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension scheme and post-retirement healthcare scheme is operated in the USA. 
An actuarial valuation was last performed as at 31 December 2011. When revalued, scheme assets are included at market 
value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the net periodic benefit cost; these liabilities are 
discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term. Surpluses are 
only included to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from 
the schemes.
The current service cost and any past service costs are included in the income statement within operating expenses and 
the expected return on the schemes’ assets, net of the impact of the unwinding of the discount on scheme liabilities, is 
included within other finance income and costs. Actuarial gains and losses, including differences between the expected 
and actual return on scheme assets, are recognised, net of the related deferred tax, in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
The pension scheme is closed to new entrants; as a result the service costs to the Group will rise in future years. The 
expected level of contributions to the defined benefit scheme and post-retirement healthcare scheme in the year to 
December 2012 is £1,314,000 (2011: £1,266,000).
Other defined benefit pension schemes had net liabilities of £nil (2010: £230,000).

benefit schemes:

In 2011, the Group operated the 2008 Share Option Scheme and the LTIP. All options over the 1,413,000 shares awarded 
under the 2008 Share Option Scheme lapsed on 23 March 2011. The nil cost options awarded under the LTIP were  
valued using a probability model to predict EPS levels. The charge to the income statement in 2011 was £172,000  
(2010: £63,000).

LTIP
Conditional, annual awards of shares are granted under the LTIP to certain executive directors and senior managers at  
the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Provided the participant remains an employee of the Group and the 
performance conditions are met, awards will vest three years after the date of the grant at no cost to the employee. The 
percentage of shares that will actually vest is dependent upon the Group’s earnings per share growth over a three year 
measurement period ending 31 December 2013. Further information on the LTIP and the performance conditions is  
given in the Remuneration Report.
The fair value of the awards granted under the LTIP and the assumptions used in the calculation of the share based

25. Acquisition of subsidiary
On 20 December 2011, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Overland Products Company, Inc, 
obtaining control of Overland Products Company, Inc. Overland Products Company, Inc is based in Fremont, Nebraska 
and supplies an extensive range of stampings for a wide range of applications, mainly for the fenestration market, which 
provides the Group with access to new markets and customers.

Cash 10,280
The fair value of the financial assets includes trade and other receivables with a fair value of £447,000 and a gross 
contractual value of £479,000. The best estimate at the acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not recoverable 
is £32,000.
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of £282,000 for professional fees paid for due diligence, other general 
professional fees and legal advice. These costs have been included in exceptional costs in the Group’s consolidated 
income statement.
Had the acquisition of Overland Products Company, Inc been completed on the first day of the financial year, an 
additional £6.6 million of revenue and £1.0 million of profit before taxation would have been contributed to the Group.
Fair values remain provisional in relation to this acquisition and the Group will complete this review in 2012.  
Any adjustment to the carrying value is unlikely to be significant to the individual acquisition.
The estimated value of intangibles, including goodwill, deductible for tax purposes is $13,037,000.

31. Post-balance sheet events
Disposal
On 13 March 2012, Lupus Capital plc entered into an unconditional agreement to sell the Group’s Oil Services division, 
Gall Thomson, to Copper Bidco Limited, a company controlled by Phoenix Equity Partners for a total cash consideration 
of approximately £75 million, subject to certain post-completion adjustments relating to the amounts of cash and net 
working capital held in the Gall Thomson Group at the date of disposal. 
Approximately £30 million of the disposal proceeds will be applied in permanent pay down of the Group’s debt facilities, 
offsetting future scheduled repayments. Approximately £2 million of the disposal proceeds will be spent on fees and 
expenses relating to the disposal. The disposal will lead to an accounting profit on disposal of approximately £53 million 
which will be recognised in the 2012 Financial Statements. 
The cash consideration payable for Gall Thomson represents an exit multiple of 3.9x Gall Thomson’s 2011 sales and 7.4x 
2011 EBITDA. The Board believes that the valuation placed on Gall Thomson recognises the high quality of the Oil Service 
businesses and that, following the disposal, Lupus’s focus of resources on the Building Products division will be in the best 
interest of Lupus shareholders as a whole. 
Onerous lease
On 2 March 2012, the Group concluded an agreement with a third party to assign the lease and exit Unit A, the remaining 
property on the Peterlee site. This will result in savings of £2.1 million in cash costs of rent, rates, utilities and services over 
the next six years to March 2018 and the release to the income statement in 2012 of £1.9 million of provisions, which will 
increase profit after tax by approximately £1.4 million. 74 Financial Statements
Independent auditor’s report to the members of  
Lupus Capital plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Lupus Capital plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 
which comprise the parent company balance sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted  
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as  
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APB’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
• 	 give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011;
• 	 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• 	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
• 	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• 	 the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• 	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• 	 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1. Accounting policies
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will have 
sufficient funds to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
As the Group forecasts that it will be able to meet its debt facility interest and repayment obligations in 2011 and that 
trading will be at least flat in comparison to 2010, the Group has assumed that the going concern basis of preparation of 
these financial statements is appropriate.
Accounting convention
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. As permitted by 
that Act, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards (UK GAAP).
The separate financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention. All other accounting policies 
remain unchanged from those used in the last annual accounts.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any permanent diminution of value.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade debtors are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated recoverable amounts.
Trade creditors are stated at their nominal amount.
Borrowings
Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred, 
on an accruals basis, to the Company profit and loss account using the effective interest rate method.
Share based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share based Payments. The Company issues equity-settled  
share based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the  
date of grant.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in 
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its 
estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest, with any changes in estimate recognised in the income 
statement, with a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of awards granted under LTIP is measured using  
a probability model to predict EPS levels.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and 
share premium when the options are exercised.
2. Profit attributable to the shareholders of the Company
The Company is an investment holding company. It receives dividend income from subsidiaries and bank interest. It pays 
loan interest to a subsidiary. Almost all administrative expenses are paid by the Company’s subsidiary, Lupus Capital 
Management Limited, including the whole amount of relevant auditor’s remuneration and operating lease costs.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and 
loss account for the year. The Company reported profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2011 of £1,360,000 
(2010: £8,677,000). 77

11. Post-balance sheet events
On 13 March 2012, Lupus Capital plc entered into an unconditional agreement to sell the Group’s Oil Services division, 
Gall Thomson, to Copper Bidco Limited, a company controlled by Phoenix Equity Partners for a total cash consideration 
of approximately £75 million, subject to certain post-completion adjustments relating to the amounts of cash and net 
working capital held in the Gall Thomson Group at the date of disposal. 
Approximately £30 million of the disposal proceeds will be applied in permanent pay down of the Group’s debt facilities, 
offsetting future scheduled repayments. Approximately £2 million of the disposal proceeds will be spent on fees and 
expenses relating to the disposal. The disposal will lead to an accounting profit on disposal of approximately £53 million 
which will be recognised in the 2012 Financial Statements. 
The cash consideration payable for Gall Thomson represents an exit multiple of 3.9x Gall Thomson’s 2011 sales and 7.4x 
2011 EBITDA. The Board believes that the valuation placed on Gall Thomson recognises the high quality of the Oil Service 
businesses and that, following the disposal, Lupus’s focus of resources on the Building Products Division will be in the best 
interest of Lupus shareholders as a whole.

NOTES 
Website address 
1. Information regarding the meeting is available from www.lupuscapital.co.uk.
Entitlement to attend and vote 
2. Only those holders of ordinary shares registered on the Company’s register of members at 6:00 pm on 23 May 2012; or, if this meeting is adjourned, at 6:00 pm 
on the day two days prior to the adjourned meeting, shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting. 
Appointment of Proxies 
3. Members entitled to attend, speak and vote at the meeting (in accordance with Note 2 above) are entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and 
vote in their place. If you wish to appoint a proxy please use the Form of Proxy enclosed with this document or follow the instructions at note 7 below if you wish 
to appoint a proxy through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service. In the case of joint members, only one need sign the Form of Proxy. The vote of the 
senior joint member will be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint members. For this purpose, seniority will be determined by the order in 
which the names of the members appear in the register of members in respect of the joint shareholding. The completion and return of the Form of Proxy will not 
stop you attending and voting in person at the meeting should you wish to do so. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. You may appoint more than 
one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by you. If you choose to appoint multiple proxies 
use a separate copy of this form (which you may photocopy) for each proxy, and indicate after the proxy’s name the number of shares in relation to which they 
are authorised to act (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of ordinary shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of 
multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and returned in the same envelope. 
4. You can appoint the Chairman of the Meeting, or any other person, as your proxy. If you wish to appoint someone other than the Chairman, cross out the words 
“the Chairman of the Meeting” on the Form of Proxy and insert the full name of your appointee. 
5. You can instruct your proxy how to vote on each resolution by ticking the “For” and “Against” boxes as appropriate (or entering the number of shares which you 
are entitled to vote). If you wish to abstain from voting on any resolution please tick the box which is marked “Vote Withheld”. It should be noted that a vote 
withheld is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes “For” and “Against” a resolution. If you do not indicate on the 
Form of Proxy how your proxy should vote, he/she can exercise his/her discretion as to whether, and if how so how, he/she votes on each resolution, as he/she 
will do in respect of any other business (including amendments to resolutions) which may properly be conducted at the meeting. 
A company incorporated in England and Wales or Northern Ireland should execute the Form of Proxy under its common seal or otherwise in accordance with 
Section 44 of the Companies Act 2006 or by signature on its behalf by a duly authorised officer or attorney whose power of attorney or other authority should be 
enclosed with the Form of Proxy.  82 Financial Statements
Appointment of Proxy using Hard Copy Form 
6. The Form of Proxy and any power of attorney (or a notarially certified copy or office copy thereof ) under which it is executed must be received by Capita 
Registrars, PXS, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU at 10.30 am on 23 May 2012 in respect of the meeting. 
 Any Forms of Proxy received before such time will be deemed to have been received at such time. In the case of an adjournment, the Form of Proxy must be 
received by Capita Registrars no later than 48 hours before the rescheduled meeting. 
On completing the Form of Proxy, sign it and return it to Capita Registrars at the address shown on the reverse of the Form of Proxy. As postage has been 
pre-paid no stamp is required. You may, if you prefer, return the Form of Proxy in a sealed envelope to the address shown above. 
Appointment of Proxies through CREST 
7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting to be held on the 
above date and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored 
members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will 
be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be 
properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as 
described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a 
previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the Company’s agent (ID: RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of 
proxy appointments specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied 
to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed 
by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointees through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy 
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has 
appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a 
message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or 
voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. 
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. 
All messages relating to the appointment of a proxy or an instruction to a previously appointed proxy, which are to be transmitted through CREST, must be 
lodged at 10.30 am on 23 May 2012 in respect of the meeting. Any such messages received before such time will be deemed to have been received at such time. 
In the case of an adjournment, all messages must be lodged with Capita Registrars no later than 48 hours before the rescheduled meeting. 
Termination of proxy appointments 
8. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company. Please send a signed hard copy notice clearly stating your intention to revoke your 
proxy appointment to Capita Registrars, PXS, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU. 
In the case of a member which is a company, the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or otherwise in accordance with section 44 of the 
Companies Act 2006 or by signature on its behalf by an officer or attorney whose power of attorney or other authority should be included with the revocation notice. 
If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time specified in note 2 above then, subject to the paragraph directly 
below, your proxy will remain valid. 
If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in respect of the same ordinary shares, the appointment received last before the latest time for receipt of 
proxies will take precedence. 
Completion of a Form of Proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting in person. If you have appointed a proxy and attend the meeting in person, 
your proxy appointment will be automatically terminated. 
Issued Shares and total voting rights 
9. The total number of shares in issue in the Company is 137,287,481 ordinary shares of 5p each. Of these 7,446,683 are held in Treasury. Therefore the total number 
of ordinary shares with voting rights is 129,840,798. On a vote by a show of hands, every holder of ordinary shares who (being an individual) is present by a 
person, by proxy or (being a corporation) is present by a duly authorised representative, not being himself a member, shall have one vote. On a poll every holder 
of ordinary shares who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share held by him.

The Dividend Reinvestment Plan
The Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“the Plan”) is a convenient and easy way to build up your shareholding by using your cash 
dividends to buy more shares in the Company.
 
Benefits of participation
• 	 Increase your ordinary shareholding over the long-term at competitive dealing commission rates (generally lower than 
available through retail brokers).
• 	 Compounding effect of increasing holding and dividend payments.
• 	 Plan Provider is authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority.
• 	 An alternative for overseas shareholders who may have difficulty cashing British Pound dividend cheques due to high 
bank charges (subject to you having the minimum Cash Dividend amount and living in a country that permits you to 
participate in the Plan, please see the website www.capitashareportal.com for the detailed conditions).
Features
• 	 Purchase additional shares in the Company using your cash dividend.
• 	 On the dividend payment date, we instruct a broker to buy shares in the market at the prevailing market price. You will 
therefore not know the share price when you sign up to the Plan.
• 	 The commission is 1% of the purchase price of the shares with a minimum of £2.50. This is exclusive of stamp duty 
reserve tax at 0.5% of the deal value if applicable. Costs are deducted at source before the new shares are purchased. 
Due to the minimum charge, the Plan may not be cost effective for all participants.
• 	 You will receive a tax voucher, share certificate and transaction advice following the reinvestment of your dividend.
• 	 You may withdraw from the Plan at any time.
• 	 The value of the shares, and any income from them, can go down as well as up.
How to apply
For information on the detailed conditions of the Plan and how to apply, please call the Capita IRG Trustees Ltd Helpline 
on: 0871 664 0381 (calls to this number cost 10p per minute plus any network extras, lines are open from 09:00 am to 
5:30 pm Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays) or if calling from overseas: +44 20 8639 3402.

Form of Proxy
NOTES
1. A member of the Company entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting 
is also entitled to appoint a proxy or proxies to attend, speak and vote instead of him.  
A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Meeting, provided that 
each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares 
held by that member. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. Appointment 
of a proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting in person at  
the Meeting.
2. If you so desire you may delete the words “chairman of the meeting” and insert the 
name of your own choice of proxy, who need not be a member of the Company. 
Please initial such alteration. If the proxy is being appointed in relation to less than 
your full voting entitlement, please enter in the box marked “*” next to the name of the 
proxy you are appointing the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised 
to act as your proxy. If left blank your proxy will be deemed to be authorised in respect 
of your full voting entitlement (or if this proxy form has been issued in respect of a 
designated account for a shareholder, the full voting entitlement for that designated 
account).
3. The proxy form must be lodged at the Company’s UK Registration Agent, Capita 
Registrars (Proxies), The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU, 
not less than 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting. In default the proxy 
cannot be treated as valid. 
4. Alternatively, in the case of CREST members, voting may be effected by using the 
CREST electronic proxy appointment service. CREST members who wish to utilise the 
CREST service may do so by following the procedures described in the CREST 
manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider, should refer to their 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider, who will be able to take the appropriate 
action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to 
be valid, the appropriate CREST message must be transmitted so as to be received by 
the Company’s agent, Capita Registrars (whose CREST ID is RA10) by the specified 
latest time for receipt of proxy appointments. For this purpose, the time of receipt will 
be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by 
the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve the 
message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed. 
5. A corporation must execute the proxy under its common seal or under the hand of an 
officer or attorney duly authorised. 
6. If this proxy form is executed under a power of attorney or other authority, such 
power of attorney or other authority or a notarially certified copy thereof must be 
lodged with the Registrars with the proxy form. 
7. In the case of joint holders the vote of the senior shall be accepted to the exclusion of 
the other joint holders, seniority being determined by the order in which the names 
stand in the register in respect of the joint holding.
8. You can instruct your proxy how to vote on each resolution by ticking the “For”  
and “Against” boxes as appropriate (or entering the number of shares which you are 
entitled to vote). If you wish to abstain from voting on any resolution please tick the 
box which is marked “Vote Withheld”. It should be noted that a vote withheld is not  
a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes  
“For” and “Against” a resolution. If you do not indicate on the Form of Proxy how your 
proxy should vote, he/she can exercise his/her discretion as to whether, and if how  
so how, he/she votes on each resolution, as he/she will do in respect of any other 
business (including amendments to resolutions) which may properly be conducted  
at the meeting. 88 Financial Statements  Lupus Capital Annual report & accounts 2011

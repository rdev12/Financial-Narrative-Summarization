OUR STRENGTH LIES IN DEVELOPING OUR BRANDS TO PROVIDE

The 2002 acquisition of Reemtsma gave us a number of excellent
brands including West and Davidoff that significantly extended our
international reach. These brands complement our world leadership
positions in other tobacco products with Drum roll your own tobacco
and Rizla rolling papers. We have a proven track record of successfully
integrating our acquisitions and rapidly generating
enhanced returns to create sustainable
shareholder value.
ACQUISITIONS
ITG 10 IN MAY 2002, we completed the acquisition of Reemtsma which was a step
change in the strategic evolution of our business, transforming us into the
world’s fourth largest international tobacco company.
The inherent profit potential continues to be realised with synergies of
some £150 million delivered in 2003, increasing to a full year benefit
of around £210 million in 2004.
ITG 11 ITG 12
Our track record of organic growth and strategic acquisitions has taken us from a strong UK base to become the world’s fourth
largest international tobacco company with our products sold in over 130 countries.We have increased and internationalised
our cigarette portfolio, we are the world’s leading manufacturer of roll your own tobacco and rolling papers, and we have seen
our volumes grow from 42 billion cigarette equivalents in 1997 to over 220 billion cigarette equivalents today.
Our performance in 2003 maintains an unbroken track record of strong earnings and dividend growth, and clearly
demonstrates our consistent ability to create sustainable shareholder value.
2003 PERFORMANCE
In the first full year of the enlarged business, adjusted operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items was up
44 per cent on 2002 to over £1.1 billion, with turnover excluding duty also up 44 per cent to £3.2 billion. Operating profit,
after amortisation and exceptional items, was up 46 per cent to £881 million (2002: £603 million). These results reflect
organic growth trends across many of our key markets, together with the delivery of some £150 million synergies generated
following the Reemtsma acquisition, and a full year’s contribution from that business.
The adjusted profit on ordinary activities before tax was up 40 per cent to £898 million (2002: £642 million), after charging
£237 million net interest (2002: £147 million).The interest charge includes the full year effect of financing the Reemtsma
acquisition.
This performance has delivered basic earnings per share of 58.1 pence (2002: 41.0 pence) and adjusted earnings per share of
90.0 pence, an increase of 32 per cent on 2002.
DIVIDEND
Your Directors are recommending a final dividend of 30.0 pence per share, making a total dividend for the year of
42.0 pence.This represents an increase of 9.0 pence per share, or 27 per cent on the total 2002 dividend.
The dividend will be paid on 20 February 2004 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 23 January 2004.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
In a year of transformation
for Imperial Tobacco,
following the step change in the scale
and potential of the business resulting
from the acquisition of Reemtsma in
2002, I am very pleased to be reporting
yet another excellent set of results.

CONSISTENT STRATEGY DELIVERING CONTINUED GROWTH
Imperial Tobacco’s strategy remains to create sustainable shareholder value by growing its international operations, both
organically and through acquisitions, while continuing to strengthen its position in the core markets of the UK and Germany.
The consistent application of this strategy has delivered compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share of 18 per cent
and in dividends per share of 15 per cent since Listing in 1996.
We are in an excellent position to continue this successful strategy. We have enhanced our international potential by
strengthening our positions in existing markets and developing new markets, giving us more opportunity to exploit our
comprehensive international portfolio of tobacco products.While focused on profitable sales growth, we remain committed
to generating cost savings across all aspects of the business. In addition, we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions which
meet our rigorous strategic and financial criteria.

SENIOR MANAGEMENT
Recognising the transformation in the scale of the business, I am delighted to welcome David Cresswell as Manufacturing
Director, Frank Rogerson as Corporate Affairs Director and Bruce Davidson as Sales and Marketing Director to the Board.
The Sales and Marketing operation has subsequently been reorganised into seven areas of operation:Western Europe, Central
Europe, Eastern Europe,Africa and the Middle East,Asia Pacific,Australasia and Global Duty Free/Travel Retail.
Further strengthening the management overview of the strategic direction and operations of the Group, the senior management
steering group, the Chief Executive’s Committee, was expanded in June to include Alison Cooper, Director of Finance and
Planning and Kathryn Brown, Group Human Resources Director, who join the Executive Directors on the Committee.
Ludger Staby resigned from his position as a Non-Executive Director of the Company and from the Supervisory Board of
Reemtsma.The Board also accepted the resignation of Manfred Häussler, Sales and Marketing Director, from the PLC Board
and as Speaker of the Vorstand, Reemtsma Germany’s Board of Directors.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
The Board takes its obligations as a responsible corporate citizen seriously and is committed to high standards of corporate
governance ensuring this is reflected across all aspects of the business.
Governments around the world are pursuing in varying degrees the further regulation of tobacco products.We continue to
manage these challenges and seek to engage with governments to find workable, practical solutions to changing regulations.
In particular, in the UK, we were pleased to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with HM Customs & Excise in July
2003, formalising jointly developed protocols to combat the smuggling of tobacco products. We have also supplied
information to the Office of Fair Trading in relation to certain of its enquiries into the operations of the UK tobacco supply
chain. Investigations by the German authorities into Reemtsma trading practices which relate to a period prior to
acquisition, are ongoing.We continue to co-operate fully with the authorities in their investigations, which in some instances
could last several years.
The operating environment section on pages 30 to 33 in this report reviews our progress in meeting the expectations of a
wide range of stakeholders and a more detailed review of our activities will be published on our website in December 2003:
www.imperial-tobacco.com
OUTLOOK
It has been a year of transformation and strong profit delivery, following the acquisition of Reemtsma in May 2002.The two
businesses have proved to be an excellent fit, providing a much stronger platform for future growth and enhanced
profitability. This inherent growth potential continues to be realised with synergies of some £150 million delivered in 2003,
rising to a full year delivery of around £210 million in 2004, ahead of the £170 million forecast at the time of the
acquisition.
The search to improve profitability throughout the business continues and the ongoing review of manufacturing capacity,
together with other initiatives, will generate further cost savings on an ongoing basis. These cost savings will not only support
margin improvements, but will release funds for investment in brands and markets, driving forward the sustained profit
development of the business.
As we move into the next phase of our development, we are seeing the transfer of skills, experience and best practice across
the Group. It is testimony to the strength and commitment of all our employees that, in a year of such significant change,
we have delivered yet another strong set of results.
While external regulatory, economic and political pressures will continue, I believe we have never been better placed to
continue to create long-term value for our shareholders.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
GROUP OPERATING PERFORMANCE
2003 was another year of excellent progress for the Group, with the
strong results reflecting organic growth in the underlying business, the
synergies delivered through the successful integration of the Reemtsma
acquisition and a full year’s contribution from that business.
Group turnover, excluding duty , grew by 44 per cent to £3,200 million and
adjusted operating profit before amortisation and exceptional items also
increased by 44 per cent to £1,135 million. Operating profit after
amortisation and exceptional items was up 46 per cent to £881 million
(2002: £603 million). The 2003 results also include delivery of the synergies
of some £150 million; £35 million from production and purchasing
efficiencies, £70 million from sales and marketing and £45 million from
corporate and regional overheads. Of the 2003 synergies, £105 million was
delivered in the second half, implying a full year benefit of around
£210 million in 2004.The number of employees of the enlarged Group has
reduced by around 1,500 from the announcement of the acquisition in
March 2002.
The Group adjusted operating margin increased significantly to
35.5 per cent from the proforma margin highlighted at the time of the
Reemtsma acquisition of 29 per cent. This reflects the benefits of the
rapid reorganisation and integration activities, complemented by some
good trading performances and productivity improvements.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
UK operating profit in the year increased to £406 million from
£390 million in 2002 and margins were up to 53.4 per cent
(2002: 51 per cent).These increases reflect share growth, the benefits of
manufacturer’s price increases and a reduced cost base, partly offset by
downtrading effects.
Operating profit in Germany rose to £228 million in 2003 from
£67 million in 2002.This result incorporates a full year of Reemtsma
results, a positive overall trading performance, synergy benefits and a
favourable euro exchange gain of approximately £20 million. In addition,
a reduced cost base compared to that applied in the previous Reemtsma
business helped the significant uplift in operating margins to
35.3 per cent in the year, compared to a proforma margin for the
enlarged Group of 23 per cent.
In the Rest of Western Europe, operating profit in the year grew to
£307 million from £217 million in 2002.These results reflect strong
underlying trading together with the first full year of Reemtsma results
and the synergy benefits from the combination, with local cost savings
being partly offset by an additional central overhead allocation. In
addition, a favourable euro exchange gain of approximately £30 million
further enhanced reported profit. Operating margins improved to
47.1 per cent compared with 43.8 per cent in 2002.
In the Rest of the World, operating profit in the year increased to
£194 million from £115 million in 2002.This increase incorporates a full
year of Reemtsma results and reflects some encouraging performances
despite challenging conditions in certain markets, notably those impacted
by SARS, political unrest and the conflict in the Middle East. The
expected synergies have been achieved, but these have been partly offset
by currency losses of approximately £27 million. Operating margins
nevertheless have shown a good improvement to 17 per cent in the year
from the proforma margins of 15 per cent for the enlarged Group.
SUSTAINED PROFIT GROWTH 1997 – 2003
INTEREST
The increase in the Group’s interest charge for the year to £237 million,
up from £147 million before the exceptional finance charge of
£33 million in 2002, was mainly as a result of the full year’s cost of
financing the Reemtsma acquisition. Additionally, the strengthening of
the euro increased the interest charge on the euro portfolio of debt by
£14 million, offset by lower interest rates on the floating element of debt
and cheaper bank facilities following the refinancing during the year.
This resulted in an all-in cost of debt in 2003 of 6.1 per cent
(2002: 6.1 per cent); excluding fees the cost of core debt was 5.6 per cent
(2002: 5.7 per cent). Interest cover before amortisation and exceptional
items was 4.8 times (2002: 5.4 times).
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Group adjusted profit before tax increased by 40 per cent to £898 million.
Of this increase, exchange rate movements have contributed a net
£9 million. Reported profit before tax, after amortisation and exceptional
items was £656 million (2002: £423 million).
In the year, profit before tax was increased by an exceptional gain of
£12 million on the sale of the Dublin factory site. Other disposals,
including the fermentation and printing plant at Lahr, the Caritas
wholesale business and Liberty cigars in Germany, had no material effect
on the reported results.The £81 million provision brought forward in
respect of the integration of Reemstma was fully utilised and further costs
associated with synergies of £42 million were charged in the year. In
addition, £5 million was provided in respect of the closure of the Meppel
factory in The Netherlands, and a further £4 million in respect of the
final element of the October 2001 restructuring.
Profit was also enhanced by £7 million in respect of overpaid VAT,
following a recent court case won by Sinclair Collis Limited concerning
the VAT treatment of vending machines.
Reported profit before tax was also subject to an increased amortisation
charge of £203 million (2002: £83 million).
TAXATION
The tax charge for the year was £232 million, representing an effective tax
rate of 27.1 per cent (2002: 27.7 per cent) on profit before non-deductible
amortisation.The tax rate on reported profit before tax was 35.4 per cent.
The Group continued to benefit from lower tax rates applied to certain
overseas subsidiaries and we expect this benefit to remain.

EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS
In 2003, the Group has delivered basic earnings per share of 58.1 pence
(2002: 41.0 pence) and adjusted earnings per share of 90.0 pence
(2002: 68.4 pence), an increase of 32 per cent .The proposed final dividend
for 2003 is 30.0 pence per share, bringing the total dividend for the year
to 42.0 pence per share, a 27 per cent increase.This is consistent with the
Group’s dividend policy of growing dividends broadly in line with
earnings, but allowing for the cash impact of restructuring in the year.
Total shareholder return since our Listing in 1996 was 294 per cent
(2002: 290 per cent) at the end of September 2003, compared with
an overall return of 26 per cent (2002: 8 per cent) from the FTSE
All-Share Index.
We have consistently delivered adjusted earnings and dividend growth, with
compound returns of 18 per cent and 15 per cent respectively since 1996.
FINANCING AND LIQUIDITY
During the year, the Group refinanced the remaining portion of the
Reemtsma acquisition bank facilities with a syndicated facility, signed in
December 2002, of j2.4 billion committed facilities and £400 million
uncommitted facilities.
The weakening of sterling, principally against the euro during the year, has
adversely affected our reported net debt at the year end by £400 million
compared to the previous year. At the year end, net debt including the
deferred consideration for the remaining 9.99 per cent of the Reemtsma
acquisition was £4.1 billion (2002: £3.7 billion), of which 16.5 per cent
was denominated in sterling, 82.8 per cent in euros and 0.7 per cent in
other currencies. At the year end, 76.7 per cent of gross debt
(2002: 85.1 per cent) was fixed by way of interest rate derivatives.
CASH FLOW
The Group consistently converts a high level of adjusted operating profit
into operating cash flow after net capital expenditure, with an average
conversion rate since 1997 of 87 per cent.
In 2003, there were two working capital timing differences and cash
outflows associated with the utilisation of the integration provision which
affected the headline cash conversion rate.Adjusting for these factors, the
underlying cash conversion rate was 100 per cent.
The working capital timing differences arose principally from the profile
of periodic UK VAT settlements and the impact of higher debtors as a
result of the timing of the manufacturer’s price increases in the UK.
In 2003, these factors, combined with a significant exchange translation
movement on net debt of £400 million, have resulted in an increase in
closing net debt to £4.1 billion as at 30 September 2003.

UNITED KINGDOM
The United Kingdom continues to make a significant
contribution to the performance of the Group generating 36 per cent of
adjusted operating profit in 2003.
The UK Government announcement in October 2002 of increased
duty-paid indicative levels for EU travellers, from 800 cigarettes to 3,200,
prompted an initial decline in the size of the UK duty-paid market.
However, the market stabilised towards the end of the year, and we
estimate the UK duty-paid cigarette market averaged 54 billion cigarettes
in the year to September 2003 (2002: 56 billion) with a roll your own
tobacco market of 2,800 tonnes (2002: 2,800 tonnes).
We had another successful year in the UK, with our branded cigarette
market share continuing to grow from an average of 42.9 per cent in
2002 to 44 per cent in 2003, further extending our market leadership.
Lambert & Butler, the top selling UK cigarette brand family, grew market
share to 16.2 per cent in September 2003. Richmond continued to
strengthen and remains the second largest selling brand family in the UK
with market share consistently growing in the four years since its launch
to 12.2 per cent in September 2003. In the premium sector, Embassy has
delivered another robust performance, closing the year with market share
of 3.9 per cent.
In our second year of distributing the Marlboro brand family on behalf of
Philip Morris, we have increased retail distribution such that its market
share reached 7.5 per cent in September 2003.
Our strong position in the roll your own tobacco market was maintained
with a market share of over 64 per cent, with Golden Virginia retaining
clear leadership of the category. Drum and Drum Gold,now available in
new resealable pouches, strengthened their positions to 15.8 per cent
market share at the end of the year.
Rizla continued to hold over three-quarters of the rolling papers market
and in September, we announced the introduction of Rizla Silver,a
premium ultra-fine rolling paper. Our cigar range, including Classic,
Panama and King Edward Coronets, had a good year with market share
growing to 38.6 per cent of the small cigar sector.
In light of UK legislation, which significantly restricted tobacco
advertising and sponsorship, we have strengthened our brand availability
and visibility at the point-of-sale. Our focus has been on developing a
leading position in the supply of merchandising display furniture to retail
outlets.We have over 33,000 units installed in the various retail channels
in the UK.
In July 2003, Imperial T obacco was voted ‘Supplier of the Y ear’ by retailers
from the convenience sector, beating more than 60 leading branded
grocery and drinks manufacturers.
In the UK, our key integration actions are now complete, with the
closure of the former Reemtsma company offices. Manufacturing of a
range of private label products has been transferred to the UK, sales of
which have not been included in the Group’s market share.
The size of the market will continue to be a key factor affecting our UK
profit delivery. In the context of moderate market decline, we see
opportunities to improve profits further through effective management of
the brand portfolio and cost efficiencies.We will continue to transfer
expertise gained through our extensive UK operations to other similar
markets, such as those in the Rest of Western Europe, ensuring that we
share and build best practice and skills across the Group.

GERMANY
Germany, the largest market in Western Europe, generated
significant profits for the Group, accounting for 20 per cent of adjusted
operating profit in the financial year.
Following an excise duty increase in January 2003, the German market
has seen an increasing search for value with consumers switching from
cigarettes to other tobacco products, mainly in the roll your own and
make your own sector.This market sector grew by 9 per cent to 24 billion
cigarette equivalents, while the factory made cigarette market has
declined by around 6 billion to 138 billion cigarettes.This decline has
predominantly affected branded cigarettes, which decreased by around
5 per cent to 116 billion cigarettes, while private label cigarettes have
increased slightly to 22 billion, 15.9 per cent of the market.
Subsequent to the excise duty increase of one euro cent per cigarette in
January 2003, the German Government announced further significant
increases in tobacco tax on 8 May 2003, to finance the restructuring of
the German health system. On 7 November 2003, the Federal Council
Bundesrat decided to invoke a conciliation procedure to review the
Government’s tax proposals including the amounts, structure and timing
of the increases. A final decision is expected by mid-December.
Our branded share of the total market, including other tobacco products,
increased in 2003 to 21.4 per cent, up from 21.1 per cent in 2002.We are
market leaders in the growing other tobacco products sector, where our
market share has increased from 23 per cent in 2002 to 33.5 per cent in
2003. Our cigarette market share has declined slightly to 19.6 per cent in
2003 from 20.3 per cent in 2002, mainly due to consumers switching
between cigarettes and other tobacco products.
During the financial year, the West brand franchise, including other
tobacco products, strengthened its position in Germany with an increase
in market share to 11 per cent in 2003, while West retained its position as
the second largest selling cigarette brand in Germany. West Singles, an
innovative make your own product launched in November 2001, has
made a significant contribution to this success.
The premium brand family Davidoff strengthened its position by
increasing market share to an average of 1.1 per cent in 2003.The range
was extended through the launch of Davidoff Ultra in November 2002
and Davidoff Slims in September 2003. R1 maintained its market
leadership in the ultra light sector, with a market share of 1.8 per cent and
Peter Stuyvesant performed robustly at 2.2 per cent of market in 2003.
The Cabinet brand family, our best selling brand in the former East
Germany, performed solidly with a market share of around 8 per cent in
this region and was complemented by JPS Red, introduced in February
2003, further strengthening our position in this region.
By successfully integrating the three German sales forces following the
acquisition, we have realised significant synergies and improved our cost
base.The refocusing of the sales force has ensured we are well placed to
optimise our distribution in the convenience and supermarket sectors,
where market share for other tobacco products has grown to more than
33 per cent. In addition, the former Reemtsma headquarters in Hamburg
was sold in October 2003, and will close no later than June 2004.
In an environment of regular tax increases, we expect to see increasing
market segmentation with downtrading in cigarettes and migration to
other tobacco products.With our market leadership position in other
tobacco products, complemented by cigarette portfolio opportunities and
cost efficient operations, we continue to be well positioned to benefit
from the changing market dynamics.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Our branded share of the total market,
including other tobacco products, increased in 2003 to
21.4 per cent, up from 21.1 per cent in 2002.

REST OF WESTERN EUROPE
The Rest of Western Europe has again delivered a
strong performance. Good domestic results in a number of markets were
enhanced by benefits from increased indicative levels available to UK
travellers within the EU.
In France, a significant tax increase in January 2003 has led to a market
decline of 7.6 per cent between January and September 2003. In spite of
the adverse external environment, we have succeeded in achieving
improved margins in cigarettes, and in May 2003, West was launched in
France, achieving widespread national distribution. In addition, we have
grown our roll your own tobacco market share to 30 per cent, driven by
the successful performance of Interval, averaging 13.5 per cent in the year.
Our business in Southern Europe has made significant progress. Our
greater focus on Italy has resulted in a strong performance for the
combined portfolio assisted by the launch of Route 66 and benefiting
from improved distribution and trade marketing structures.Volume and
market share have increased in Spain, up to 4.2 per cent in September
2003 (2002: 3.7 per cent), and in Greece a record 6.9 per cent market
share in 2003 was driven by the performance of Davidoff.
In Belgium and Luxembourg, we have grown Interval and Route 66
while our key domestic brand Bastos performed robustly. Distribution
agreements with Altadis in Belgium and Luxembourg were terminated in
July 2003.
In the face of overall cigarette market decline in Ireland, we have
succeeded in growing market share, achieving 31.5 per cent in 2003
(2002: 31 per cent). In The Netherlands, despite some adverse trends in
the roll your own tobacco market, Drum was stable at 24 per cent market
share and Van Nelle grew to 25.5 per cent in September 2003. In the
growing cigarette market, our share has increased to 2.7 per cent
(2002: 2.4 per cent), supported by good performances from Davidoff
and West.
After a strong start to the year, sales in the important registered mobile
operator sector, which includes cross-channel ferries, Eurotunnel shops
and French and Spanish airports, have been tempered in some outlets by
the impact of French domestic price increases in January 2003.
During the year, the integration of Reemtsma has delivered substantial
infrastructure savings and improved supply chain efficiencies throughout
the region, following a programme of distributor rationalisation.
Rising taxes in a number of markets will encourage cross border
shopping within the EU. The next few years will be challenging but we
believe we are well placed to meet these challenges.We are looking to
benefit from the strength of the enlarged brand portfolio, by leveraging
existing market positions and infrastructure, and continuing our focused
approach to marketing expenditure.

REST OF THE WORLD
Central and Eastern Europe, Australasia, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, Global Duty Free
The Rest of the World remains a strong volume generator
for the Group accounting for 50 per cent of volumes with improving
profitability.
Our strategy for Central and Eastern Europe continues to be focused
on strengthening our international strategic brands, particularly Davidoff
and West, and expanding our presence in key markets while seeking to
improve profitability.
In Poland, historically high tobacco tax increases have led to an overall
tobacco market decline and an erosion of industry margins. In July 2003,
prices were increased but the market continues to be highly competitive.
Against this background, the increase in our market share from
17.9 per cent to 19.3 per cent was driven by growth in Mocne and West
and the launch of Route 66.
Our total sales volumes in the Ukraine exceeded last year, due to the strong
development of Prima and R1, with R1 growing by 30 per cent since launch.
We also increased prices in the Ukraine, delivering improved margins.
We continued to grow market share in Russia for the third consecutive
year, rising to 5.1 per cent in September 2003.This was driven by the
continuing development of Davidoff, West and R1, supported by the
successfully established brand Maxim Classic. Davidoff shipment volumes
grew by 24 per cent during the period, and the brand has gained strength
from the increased demand for Davidoff Slims. In the highly competitive
environment of the low and mid-priced segment, Maxim was launched in
a round-cornered pack in April 2003, and has been well received.
In a year characterised by an increasingly competitive environment in
Australia, cigarette volumes grew and share was broadly held at just
under 18 per cent on the back of improvements driven by Superkings and
Peter Stuyvesant. Roll your own tobacco volumes have also grown and
our share has reached 62.4 per cent (2002: 61.4 per cent) through the
exceptional performance of the Champion brand.
In Asia Pacific, the world economic slowdown has adversely affected
most Asian economies and the SARS outbreak especially impacted
Taiwan, China, Singapore and Hong Kong.
In Taiwan, these factors and a general destocking across the market have
led to a decline in total market volumes from 42 billion to 39 billion
cigarettes. Consequently, our volumes and market share have been under
pressure, particularly due to our premium portfolio bias. In the last few
months of the financial year we have seen a recovery in volumes, and
market share appears to be stabilising, closing the year at 11.2 per cent
(2002: 13 per cent).The implementation of a new sales and distribution
organisation should further assist recovery.
Our businesses in Vietnam and Laos continue to perform beyond
expectations. Bastos enjoyed strong growth in Vietnam with an increase in
volume of over 30 per cent during the year, taking our share to 8.6 per cent
(2002: 8 per cent). In Laos our volumes have more than doubled over the
past year.
In China, our co-operation with the State Tobacco Monopoly
Administration and the negotiations with the Yuxi Hongta Group,
resulted in the signing of a formal contract for local production and
distribution. Production of West is expected to start in December 2003.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
We see many growth opportunities for the Group in the
Rest of the World. We will continue to concentrate on growing our volumes
and profitability in existing markets, looking for opportunities in new markets and
making focused investments where we see long-term potential.

In the Middle East,growth continues to be driven by the excellent
performance of Davidoff across the region, including the key markets of
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Lebanon.
In Africa, the political situation in the Ivory Coast appears to have
stabilised and sales volumes are currently around two-thirds of their
pre-crisis levels. Both Burkina Faso and Senegal have performed well
during the year with improved volumes and market shares, and the West
launch into the Senegalese market has made encouraging progress.There
has been an excellent performance in Madagascar which has returned to
pre-conflict levels of profitability and Nigeria has made good progress in
the year with volumes up 15 per cent on last year.
In the Global Duty Free business, significant progress has been made
with the enhanced portfolio, with over 180 new product listings; prices
have increased and distributor arrangements rationalised.
The key UK duty-free market continues to perform well in both volume
and share terms. Market share has grown to 38.3 per cent in 2003
(2002: 33.8 per cent), securing our leading position.
The conflict in the Middle East along with the outbreak of SARS has had
an adverse effect on the number of travellers this year, which has
particularly impacted upon duty-free market volumes in Asia where
Davidoff has a strong brand presence.
We see many growth opportunities for the Group in the Rest of the W orld,
although the region is inherently more volatile than other regions in which
we operate.We will continue to concentrate on growing our volumes and
profitability in existing markets, looking for opportunities in new markets
and making focused investments where we see long-term potential. ITG 28
MANUFACTURING
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
The integration of manufacturing throughout the combined
Group has been a major feature of the year. Productivity has increased by
8 per cent over the year and unit costs have been reduced by 6 per cent
compared to 2002.This performance would have been further improved
had conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, along with the SARS outbreak
not adversely affected operations. In addition in the EU, factories were
managing packaging changes resulting from the EU Product Directive.
Despite these factors, manufacturing contributed significantly to the overall
synergy delivery of the Group.
Simplification and rationalisation of product portfolios and packaging
continue to be areas of focus, while maintaining our reputation as a flexible
supplier of innovative and high quality products. In addition, we
rationalised our supplier base, realising purchasing economies of scale.We
also concentrated on the important area of business quality, particularly in
applying common quality standards and measures, and have obtained ISO
accreditations across a number of factories. The programme of Stock
Keeping Unit reductions has been slow so far, mainly due to the demands
of the new EU health warning requirements, and we plan to accelerate our
work in the coming months.
As part of the integration we have disposed of the fermentation and
printing facilities at Lahr. Additionally, we recently announced closures in
Meppel (roll your own tobacco packing facility), Cambodia (cigarette
factory) and Avonmouth (distribution centre). The activities formerly
conducted at these sites are being integrated into other existing facilities
with no adverse effect on operations.
At key locations around the world, we have invested in state-of-the-art
equipment, further improving our efficiency and competitiveness.
Capacity is being significantly increased in Russia to meet the market
demand for our products. In Dublin, the new making and packing facility
has been progressed during the year and will come on-stream in the first
half of 2004.We have obtained a manufacturing licence to produce in
Turkey and our greenfield site facility near Izmir will be operational in
early 2005.
In June, we simplified the structure of our manufacturing operations into
three regions covering the Group’s global operations. Each region has
responsibility for all products including cigarettes, roll your own and pipe
tobaccos, cigars, filters, tubes and rolling paper products. Within each
region, ‘leading factories’ have been identified to provide supporting
activities to local satellite factories. Benefits will arise by avoiding service
and support duplication.
We have now established a consistent benchmarking system across our
factories and are looking to develop this further, extending productivity
and efficiency measures to the Group’s supply chain, logistics and
distribution activities.
Moving towards a consistently measured production capability across the
Group gives us significant opportunity to review and balance our total
supply chain activity, while retaining the flexibility to react quickly to
changing market conditions.This is an area from which we expect to gain
significant benefit over the coming years.
The future still holds considerable opportunities for further
standardisation and capacity optimisation across the Group’s product
range.We will continue to focus on these opportunities, investing where
appropriate, while keeping a tight control of costs. ITG 29 ITG 30
We recognise that to build a sustainable profitable business, we need to
ensure high standards of corporate responsibility across all aspects of our
business.We have grown rapidly during recent years, both organically and
through substantial acquisitions of businesses operating in widely different
markets.This has created new opportunities and challenges as we build
the profitability and sustainability of the business.
A team focused solely on corporate responsibility has been established and
tasked with embedding our corporate responsibility principles and practices
into the Group’s executive management processes and across the business.
An external review was completed during 2003, and a strategy for
stakeholder engagement and dialogue is being introduced to ensure
stakeholders’ views can be better understood and incorporated into
management decision-making as appropriate.
We take our obligation to act as a responsible corporate citizen seriously
and are committed to our wider stakeholders and to supporting the local
communities in which we operate.A more detailed review of the Group’s
corporate responsibility activities is to be published on our website
(www.imperial-tobacco.com) in December 2003.
EMPLOYEES
The health, safety and general welfare of all employees is a high priority.
We believe that fundamental to our business success is the way in which
we encourage and reward openness, innovation and good performance
among our employees at all levels.
The Group has an equal opportunities policy, which recognises and
rewards ability and performance.
We aim to promote good working relationships with employees and with
their representatives through trade unions, works councils and other
organisations. Where business changes may impact employment in a
particular location, we aim to reconcile the needs of the business with
those of employees, ensuring those that are affected are treated fairly.
Mechanisms are put in place to inform and consult with employees and
their representatives.The local community and other stakeholders may be
involved if the changes are significant.
The Group encourages employees to share in the financial success of the
Company, through Sharesave, Share Matching and Long-Term Incentive
Plans (where permitted by statute), which were extended to 27 countries
in 2003.
PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
The Group believes no one should regard cigarettes as safe.We would
welcome further discussion with government authorities to agree
objective criteria and predictive tests by which they could judge whether
future products offered a potentially reduced risk. Under the terms of the
EU Directive 2001/37/EC, we provided the national authorities within
the EU with information on the ingredients used in our tobacco products.
Through the UK T obacco Manufacturers’Association, we have continued
to work with the UK Department of Health on the analysis of 44 smoke
constituents in 25 cigarette brands, representing around 60 per cent of the
UK market.The study shows a strong relationship between almost all of
the smoke constituents and the tar and carbon monoxide (CO) levels in
the brands studied.This study calls into question the value of measuring
smoke constituents other than tar, nicotine and CO routinely. Details of
the study may be found at www.the-tma.org.uk
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, SAFETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
We continue to place a high priority on occupational health, safety and the
environment (OHS&E), setting standards that go beyond basic compliance.
The key issues identified in the 2002 OHS&E report remain our priority
and progress will be outlined in more detail in the corporate responsibility
review which will be published on our website in December 2003:
www .imperial-tobacco.com
The introduction of the ISO 14001 environmental management system
to all manufacturing sites is on schedule and a total of seven sites have
now gained certification.
This progress is reflected in a 27 per cent increase in our score in the UK
Business in the Environment Index 2002, raising our ranking from 144
to 75. Future scores may show a dip in performance until acquired sites
are fully integrated.
A climate change strategy for the Group has been developed following
the Carbon Disclosure Project involving the Global 500 companies.
A review of air-conditioning plants is underway, and vehicles with lower
carbon emissions have been selected in revised fleet management
contracts.The renewable energy contract in the UK has resulted in a
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of around 28,000 tonnes in the
year. Independent energy audits in the EU, Central and Eastern Europe
and our main African factories have been conducted this year and
identified additional potential energy savings.
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT ITG 31
Around 60 per cent of non-hazardous solid waste produced by sites in the
Group able to report data was recycled. Less than 0.3 per cent of the total
was classed as hazardous, as defined in local regulations.
The Group has commissioned a biodiversity impact assessment across all
operations. In Madagascar, plans for the operation to be self-sufficient in
wood in 2007 remain on target and native hardwood is being planted in
addition to fast-growing eucalyptus. Improved curing barns are being
introduced which will be more sustainable and fuel-efficient.
SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY INVESTMENT
We purchase over 95 per cent of our tobacco from leaf suppliers and grow
the remainder, primarily in Madagascar.We are a significant employer in
Madagascar, both directly and indirectly. Employees have benefited from
the Group securing electricity and food supplies, as well as making
contributions towards local healthcare provision.
In 2003, we extended the Social Responsibility in Tobacco Production
programme across all our operations to ensure high standards for the
cultivation and purchase of tobacco leaf. The programme covers
integrated crop management, tobacco processing and socio-economic
issues. It involves self-assessment, continual improvement and verification
visits on an intended three-year cycle.
The Board has decided that the Group will be guided on human rights
issues by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
guidelines for multinational enterprises, and a programme of social audit
and performance improvement has been established.
As a matter of policy, the Group does not employ children and our
supplier policy promotes compliance with international standards on
child labour.We are an active member of the Eliminating Child Labour
in Tobacco Foundation (www.endchildlabour.org).
The Group has long supported community activities in the geographical
areas of its operations and, in 2003, our total charitable donations were
£575,000.
We support and encourage employees to participate in community
activities and to raise money for charitable causes, and in many cases we
match the money raised.We also match donations made by employees
under the Give As Y ou Earn scheme, administered through the Charities
Aid Foundation.
TOBACCO INDUSTRY ISSUES
Regulatory pressures on the industry have continued in 2003.
In May 2003, the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention
on Tobacco Control (FCTC) was adopted at the 56th World Health
Assembly.We agree with several aspects of the Convention, most notably
the need to prevent youth smoking and the urgent need to stamp out
both smuggling and counterfeiting of tobacco products. However, the
FCTC also includes measures more appropriately dealt with by other
relevant authorities, and some that we believe are inappropriate. The
Convention needs to be ratified by 40 countries before it comes into
effect, 90 days after the fortieth country has done so.
In 2001, the EU passed a Directive on the manufacture, presentation and
sale of tobacco products. Imperial Tobacco, together with British
American Tobacco, challenged it on the grounds that it violated several
principles of European law. In December 2002, the European Court of
Justice ruled that the Directive was valid.
The Directive has now been transposed into national regulations in all
Member States. Several EU accession countries are also starting to
implement the Directive prior to their accession in May 2004. By actively
sharing best practice and information across the Group, we are seeking to
ensure we are in a strong position to meet these regulations.
The most visible requirements of the Directive are the larger health
warnings required for all tobacco products and the removal of descriptors
such as ‘light’ and ‘mild’. In September 2003, the EU Commission
adopted a Decision which outlines the use of pictorial health warnings
that may replace the warnings on the back of the pack, should a Member
State choose to require them. It is unlikely that the precise details of the
warnings will be known until September 2004.
The Directive also required manufacturers and importers to submit
details of all ingredients used in tobacco products to each Member State,
along with any available toxicological data. In December 2002, we
submitted ingredient information and toxicological data in all Member
States, even in the absence of national regulations.The format in which
the ingredient information was submitted has been accepted by most
Member States. ITG 32
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
However, The Netherlands has rejected this format, and required the
submission and publication of the detailed recipes of all tobacco products
sold in the Dutch market. The Group believes that the Tobacco
(Lists of Ingredients) Regulation 2003, which provides for publication of
ingredients and formulae of tobacco products, goes beyond what is
allowed by the EU Directive on which the Dutch regulation is based.
Like any company, we have concerns about revealing unique product
formulae and, together with other leading tobacco manufacturers, we
began legal procedures in September 2003. Belgium has also expressed
concerns about the format of the ingredients information but as yet there
has been no similar action.
In December 2002, the Council of EU Health Ministers adopted a
Recommendation on the prevention of smoking and on initiatives to
improve tobacco control (2003/54/EC). The Recommendation is
non-binding to the Member States and includes restrictions on vending
machines, a ban on packs of less than 19 cigarettes and the prohibition of
promotional items bearing tobacco brand names.
The EU also passed a new Advertising and Sponsorship Directive in May
2003.Whilst the new Directive is narrower in scope than its predecessor,
which was annulled by the European Court of Justice in October 2000, we
believe it contains several flaws. Germany recognised this and voted against
it, and is now challenging the Directive in the European Court of Justice.
In the UK, the Advertising & Sponsorship Act came into force in February
2003.All advertising is now prohibited except at the point-of-sale, which
may also be severely restricted if the draft regulations notified to the
European Commission come into force. Sponsorship is also banned but
there is an exemption for world events such as Formula 1 and the Embassy
W orld Snooker Championships until July 2005, in line with the dates set by
the EU Advertising Directive.
In Ireland, the Office of Tobacco Control has been established and the
draft Public Health (Tobacco) Bill has been notified to the EU
Commission.The Bill prohibits cigarette packs containing less than 20
cigarettes and the display of tobacco products at the point-of-sale.The
Irish Government also intends to introduce a ban on smoking in public
places from early February 2004.There is considerable opposition to this
ban from the hospitality sector concerned at its effect on trade.
The debate on smoking in public places continues in many countries. T o
date, the UK Government has indicated that it prefers to proceed with
voluntary restrictions on smoking, working with the hospitality industry
rather than introducing legislation.
We remain committed to continuing to work constructively with
individual governments and other regulatory bodies to ensure the sensible
and proportionate regulation of tobacco products.
TAXATION
We have seen the announcement of a number of significant tax increases
across Western Europe during 2003, particularly in France, The
Netherlands and Belgium, with the most notable being proposed in
Germany. On 7 November 2003, the Federal Council Bundesrat decided
to invoke a conciliation procedure to review the Government’s tax
proposals including the amounts, structure and timing of the increases.
A final decision is expected in mid-December.We remain concerned that
continued tax increases will fuel the level of illegal cross-border trade.
The fall in the smuggling of Imperial T obacco’s brands back into the UK
has been significant and encouraging. An investigation by the German
authorities into Reemtsma trading practices, which relates to a period
prior to the acquisition, is ongoing. In July 2003, we signed a
Memorandum of Understanding with HM Customs & Excise in the UK,
formalising the adoption of jointly developed protocols to combat the
smuggling and counterfeiting of tobacco products. We continue our
dialogue with governments in other markets to explore opportunities for
the possible extension of protocols.
TOBACCO RELATED LITIGATION
The one legal action in England and Wales, in which Imperial Tobacco
was involved, has been dismissed.
In Scotland, Imperial Tobacco is currently involved in 11 separate cases,
where individual claimants are seeking damages for alleged smoking-related
health effects.Of these cases,nine have been stayed.In one of the other cases,
commenced by Alfred McT ear in 1993, the trial started on 7 October 2003
and is scheduled to last until March 2004. In the other case, the claimant is
representing himself and there has been no activity since July 2001. ITG 33
In the Republic of Ireland, the number of active individual claims against
Imperial Tobacco currently stands at 45. Statements of claims have been
served in 42 of these cases. Since 1997, 351 claims against Imperial
T obacco and other tobacco companies have been dismissed, discontinued
or confirmed as not proceeding. No trial dates have been set in any of the
claims against Imperial Tobacco.
In The Netherlands, Imperial T obacco has received claim letters on behalf
of 44 individuals, although 15 of those individuals have now withdrawn.
Other tobacco companies have received similar letters. Testimony has
been taken from a majority of the claimants at preliminary hearings but
no actual proceedings have been commenced against Imperial T obacco or
any of its subsidiaries in The Netherlands.
In Germany, one individual claimant had served proceedings on Imperial
Tobacco. On 14 November 2003, the German court rejected this claim
as being without merit.
In Poland, one individual claimant has served proceedings on Imperial
Tobacco. There have been several preliminary hearings with further
hearings anticipated during 2004.
In Australia, an individual claimant has served proceedings on seven
tobacco companies including Imperial T obacco. A statement of claim has
been served.
To date, no judgment has been entered against Imperial Tobacco and no
action has been settled in favour of a claimant in any tobacco-related
litigation involving Imperial Tobacco or any of its subsidiaries. Imperial
Tobacco has been advised by its lawyers that it has meritorious defences
to the legal proceedings in which individuals are seeking damages for
alleged smoking-related health effects and to threatened actions of a
similar nature.
We take our obligation to act as a responsible corporate
citizen seriously. We are committed to our wider stakeholders and to
supporting the local communities in which we operate. ITG 34

By order of the Board
R.C. HANNAFORD, Company Secretary
17 November 2003
ITG 38 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC remains committed to the highest standards of corporate governance, which it sees as a cornerstone
in managing the business affairs of the Group and a fundamental part of discharging its stewardship responsibilities. Accordingly, throughout the
year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report, it has complied with the best practice governance provisions as set out
in Section 1 of Part 2 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code).
In addition it is addressing actively those few issues where it does not yet fully meet the recent further governance provisions of the New
Combined Code (the New Code), which will formally apply to the Group only after 1 October 2004.
Corporate governance compliance
The Board recognises it is accountable to the Group’s shareholders for the Group’s standard of governance and this statement, together with
the Remuneration Report, seeks to demonstrate how the principles of good governance, advocated by the Code, are applied in practice within
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC.
During the course of the financial year there has been significant and continuing change in the way the Group manages its activities, arising
principally from the acquisition and integration of Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH (Reemtsma) in May 2002. Notwithstanding this change
in the scale, geographic spread and management cultures, the Board has continued to keep under review the Group’s whole system of internal
control, encompassing not just financial but also operational controls, compliance and risk management.
Across the Group, formal procedures, blended with well established and embedded internal controls have been developed further over the
course of the current year. These measures, together with continuing regular, formal reporting to the Audit Committee, have ensured the
maintenance of a strong procedural framework for the ongoing identification, evaluation and management of the significant areas of risk to
achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives.
Prior to the acquisition of Reemtsma, an extensive due diligence review covering financial, operational, legal and environmental matters was
performed which led us to believe that the Company was well controlled and managed. Further high level reviews of procedures to identify any
requirements necessary to align more closely Reemtsma’s policies and procedures with the Group’s standards of corporate governance have
since been undertaken such that the Board is satisfied that appropriate internal controls are now in place across the whole Group.
During January 2003 German authorities conducted a significant search of certain Group premises, including Reemtsma’s headquarters in
Hamburg, as part of wide-ranging investigations into alleged foreign trading and related violations by Reemtsma during a period prior to its
acquisition by the Group. As a result of their enquiries, a number of Reemtsma employees were named in search orders. A Board Committee
under the Chairmanship of Mr A G L Alexander was established to monitor on a regular basis the progress and conduct of the investigations and
the Group’s responses, on behalf of the Board. From its review of the current operations of the Reemtsma businesses, the Committee is satisfied
that, since the acquisition, the Group has not been involved in any activities of a nature similar to those alleged by the authorities. We continue
to cooperate fully with the authorities.
Whilst the Group can confirm that no charges have been brought against these employees or Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH in relation
to these investigations, since they could take several years to be concluded, the Board, in the interests of good corporate governance, required
that the named employees be suspended on full pay for the duration of the investigations.
In the light of this, Mr M A Häussler, Sales & Marketing Director for the Group, one of the named employees, also tendered his resignation as a
Director of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC and from his position as Speaker of the Vorstand, the Board of Directors of Reemtsma
Cigarettenfabriken GmbH.
Given that it could not be excluded that the investigations might eventually bring about a conflict of interest between Imperial Tobacco Group
and Mr L W Staby, a Non-Executive Director of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC and formerly Chief Executive of Tchibo, the company from whom
the Group acquired Reemtsma, the Board thought it appropriate that he step down and accordingly accepted his resignation in July 2003.
During the course of the year, more detailed business reviews of the Group’s operations, performed as part of the Group Compliance Function’s
normal programme, identified certain relatively minor weaknesses and failures in systems of control at the location level. From the resulting
investigations into these matters, it has been concluded that neither individually nor collectively did they have a material impact on the results or
performance of the Group for the year.
ITG 39 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board and Board Committees
The Board of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, which meets at least five times a year, currently comprises six Non-Executive Directors and five
Executive Directors, with a clear separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive to ensure an appropriate balance of power and authority.
Mr A G L Alexander is Vice Chairman and the recognised senior independent Non-Executive Director to whom any concerns can be conveyed.
All of the Non-Executive Directors, in the opinion of the Board, are independent of management and free from any business or other relationship
that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. During the year, and prior to their resignations, it should be noted
that Mr M A Häussler and Mr L W Staby were excluded from those parts of Board and Board Committees’ meetings at which the progress of
the German investigations was reviewed.
During the year Dr F A Rogerson was appointed to the Board as Corporate Affairs Director to reflect the importance of the fierce regulatory
environment in which the Group now operates, while Mr D Cresswell’s appointment as Manufacturing Director underlines the significance of the
Group’s worldwide manufacturing and supply chain network and the risks and opportunities arising. Both appointments were effective from
1 June 2003.
At the same time, to further formalise and enhance the process of control and management of the larger and more complex Group, the Chief
Executive’s Committee comprising the then Executive Directors and certain senior executives, including the Managing Director International, the
Director of Finance and Planning and Group Human Resources Director, was formed. This is not only providing strong support to the Executive
Directors but will also assist in the process of succession planning within the Group’s enlarged pool of management talent.
Further to this, at the end of September it was announced that Mr B C Davidson would join the Board as Sales & Marketing Director, with
responsibility for the Group’s global sales and marketing activities across Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Australasia. This
appointment was effective from 1 October 2003.
Directors’ biographies, appearing on page 34, demonstrate a detailed knowledge of the tobacco industry together with a range of business and
financial experience, vital to the management of an expanding international company.
The full Board manages overall control of the Group’s affairs by the schedule of matters reserved for its decision. These include responsibility for
the Group’s commercial strategy, the approval of financial statements, major acquisitions and disposals, authority levels for expenditure, treasury
and risk management policies and succession plans for senior executives. It also has procedures in place to allow Directors to seek both
independent professional advice, at the Company’s expense, and the advice and services of the Company Secretary in order to fulfil their duties.
All Directors are equally accountable under the law for the proper stewardship of the Group’s affairs, with the Non-Executive Directors having a
particular responsibility for ensuring strategies proposed for the development of the business are critically reviewed. This ensures they act in the
best long term interest of shareholders, take account of the wider community of interests represented by employees, customers and suppliers
and that social, environmental and ethical issues are fully integrated into the Group’s risk assessment processes.
The Board regularly reviews the strategy and operating results of the business, as well as approving annual budgets and medium-term plans.
Actual results of the Group are reviewed at each Board meeting, with monthly reports, including detailed commentary and analysis, being
provided in the intervening periods. This ensures the Board is supplied with information on the progress of the business in a timely manner.
Within the framework of the Chief Executive’s Committee, the Board delegates day-to-day and business control matters to the Chief Executive
and Executive Directors who, with the executive management, are responsible for implementing Group policy and monitoring the detailed
performance of all aspects of the business, including post event reviews of major projects. They have full power to act subject to the reserved
powers and sanctioning limits laid down by the Board and the Group’s standards and policy guidelines.
The Non-Executive Directors also play a leading role in corporate accountability and governance through their membership of the Remuneration
Committee, the Nominations Committee and the Audit Committee. The membership and remit of each Committee is considered below.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, consisting exclusively of Non-Executive Directors, Mr D C Bonham, Mr S Huismans and Dr P H Jungels, meets
at least twice a year under the chairmanship of Mr I J G Napier. It is responsible for setting salaries, incentives and other benefit arrangements
of the Executive Directors and senior management, and overseeing the Group’s employee share schemes. Members of the Remuneration
Committee do not participate in decisions concerning their own remuneration.
The Chief Executive attends by invitation to respond to questions raised by the Committee. However, he is specifically excluded from any matter
concerning the details of his own remuneration.
ITG 40 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Since Listing in 1996, all increases in the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors have been taken in the form of the Company’s shares, with
the exception of the Chairman and Vice Chairman, where the requirement to reinvest fee increases net of tax was waived, following their
increases in October 2002, given their continuing high level of investment in the Group. With the increase in fees of other Non-Executive
Directors from 1 October 2003 from £35,000 to £40,000, it has been agreed that the salary threshold after which their fees are required to
be reinvested in shares of the Group be increased from £25,000 to £30,000.
The Remuneration Report, which outlines remuneration strategy and policy and includes full details of Directors’ emoluments, has been approved
by the Board and appears in this year’s Annual Report and Accounts on page 45.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprising all the Non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive with Mr D C Bonham as chairman, meets when
necessary to formulate succession plans and recommendations to the Board for the appointment of Directors. New Directors appointed by the
Board must submit themselves for re-election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment. Thereafter all Directors,
in accordance with the Code, are subject to re-election at least every three years. The training needs in respect of new appointments to the
Board are assessed and arrangements put in place, as appropriate.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, consisting exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors, Mr A G L Alexander and Mr I J G Napier, met under the
chairmanship of Mr S P Duffy, three times during the year. All of its members were qualified accountants, or have held senior finance positions
in publicly quoted companies, and are therefore well qualified to discharge the responsibilities that Audit Committee membership entails. After
the year end Dr P H Jungels was invited to join the Committee to replace Mr L W Staby who resigned during the year. The Committee’s terms
of reference cover the points recommended by the Code. Its duties include monitoring internal control throughout the Group, approving the
Group’s accounting policies and reviewing the interim and annual financial statements before submission to the full Board. It is also intended, in
line with the New Code, that the Committee formally reviews all statements containing financial information and in particular, the requirement to
review Form 20-F, prior to Board approval, is to be incorporated into the Committee’s annual programme.
The Committee also reviews and approves the scope and content of the risk assessment and compliance programme implemented by the
Control and Compliance function and, as part of the annual assessment of the need for a formal internal audit function, critically reviews the
resource allocated to this activity. The Finance Director, other financial management and the Group’s compliance manager attend by invitation.
The Group’s Auditors also attend each meeting and have direct access to the Committee without the presence of any Executive Director, or
manager, providing a direct line of communication between the Auditors and Non-Executive Directors. An opportunity for the Group’s compliance
manager to meet formally with the Committee at least annually, without management being present, is also being arranged to meet the New Code
requirements.
The Group has always maintained a policy of strict separation between the auditing and consultancy functions of its external Auditors. However
at the beginning of this financial year, in order to continue to meet best practice in the light of new regulations and legislation, the Group
strengthened this policy with the introduction of a formal Auditor Independence policy document. This provides clear definitions of services that
the external Auditors may and may not provide such that their independence and objectivity is not impaired, as well as establishing a formal
authorisation process, including the tendering and preapproval by the Audit Committee for allowable non-audit work that they may perform. The
Audit Committee has also carried out six-monthly reviews of the remuneration received by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for non-audit work, with
the aim of seeking to balance objectivity, value for money and compliance with this policy. The fees for non-audit work have arisen principally as
a result of tax advisory work associated with reorganisation of legal entities within the Group following the acquisition of Reemtsma, together with
some due diligence activity. The outcome of the reviews was that no conflict of interest exists between PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP audit and
non-audit work, and that this was the most cost effective way of conducting the Group’s business. In other situations, proposed assignments are
subject to independent tendering and decisions taken on the basis of competence and cost effectiveness.
Internal control
The Board acknowledges responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control. The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board, reviews the
effectiveness of the system in accordance with the guidance set out in “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code” (the
Turnbull guidance) from information and regular reports provided by management, the internally independent compliance function and external
Auditors. However, given the size and complexity of the Group’s operations, such a system can provide only reasonable and not absolute
assurance of meeting internal control objectives, by managing rather than eliminating risk.
The Board, either directly, or through the Audit Committee which regularly reports its findings for consideration by the Board, has reviewed the
effectiveness of the key procedures which have been established to provide internal control and confirms that an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks has operated throughout the year.
ITG 41 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The following key features have operated to provide reassurance of both the reliability of information and the safeguarding of assets:
• Risk assessment:
• The Group clearly sets out its strategic objectives as part of its medium-term planning process. These objectives are then incorporated
as part of the budgeting and planning cycle and are supported by the use of both financial and non-financial key performance
indicators.
•A detailed assessment of strategic risks is undertaken by the Executive Directors as part of the medium-term planning, annual
budgeting and the monthly reporting and forecasting cycles.
• All areas of the business are required to undertake a risk profiling exercise to review formally their principal areas of risk so that all major
risks are reviewed at all levels across the Group. This formal system is based on the annual submission of risk assessment reviews
from each business unit for the measurement and assessment of risk areas, together with the controls embedded in the business
processes to mitigate such risks. This review is ongoing throughout all the business operations of the Group, to ensure there continues
to be clear and consistent procedures for monitoring, updating and implementing appropriate controls to minimise the risk exposure
so identified.
• The Audit Committee has delegated responsibility for considering Group-wide operational, financial and compliance risks on a regular
basis. Regular reporting by the Control and Compliance function supports the Audit Committee and the Board in assessing the
effectiveness of internal controls at each business unit, through a programme of regular reviews. In this way, it seeks to minimise the
risks identified and satisfies itself that the levels of retained risk are acceptable to the Group.
• Control environment and control activities:
• The Group consists of a number of manufacturing and trading operations each with its own management and control structures which
satisfy the Group’s accounting policies and local control responsibilities.
• The Board continues to review the organisational structure to ensure that clearly defined lines of responsibility, delegation of authority
and segregation of duties, with staff of the necessary calibre to fulfil their allotted roles, remain in place. These procedures for delegated
authority ensure that decisions, significant either because of the value or the impact on other parts of the Group, are taken at an
appropriate level. The full Board has formally adopted a schedule of matters of a strategic, financial, operational or compliance nature
which are required to be brought to it for decision.
• Imperial Tobacco Group has a framework of policies and procedures laid down by the Board and personnel are required to comply
with these procedures. Reemtsma also had a similar framework of procedures to which its employees were required to comply. Since
the acquisition, these existing policies and procedures which cover key issues such as authorisation levels, segregation of duties, an
international marketing code, ethical compliance matters and legislation, physical and data security as well as regulatory, governance,
and health, safety and environmental issues, are being integrated. A consolidated framework of policies and procedures is being issued
with consistent communication being cascaded down throughout the enlarged Group by the end of 2003.
• The Group has an established and consistent methodology for identifying and ranking business risks and has implemented appropriate
strategies to deal with each significant risk that has been identified. These strategies include not only internal controls but other
approaches, such as insurance and dual sourcing of supplies.
This methodology is reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure it continues to reflect accurately the relevant risks and takes into account
necessary movements in the Group’s risk profile consequent upon changes in the business operations.
• There are well-defined procedures for appraisal, approval, control and review of capital and strategic expenditure including
acquisitions.
• The Group’s treasury function operates within the defined policy designed to control the Group’s financing arrangements and to
minimise its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks through specialised treasury instruments.
ITG 42 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
• Information and communication:
• Operating companies are required to produce detailed operating budgets prior to the start of each financial year, which are reviewed
for robustness and realism.
•A comprehensive system of budgetary controls, including monthly and regular periodic performance reviews for each business unit,
are in place to ensure that major variances are promptly and thoroughly investigated. These reviews are conducted at a detailed level
within each business unit and at a high level by the Executive Directors.
• On a monthly basis, the achievement of business objectives, both financial and non-financial, is assessed using a range of key
performance indicators. These indicators are reviewed to ensure that they remain relevant and reliable.
• Monitoring:
•A range of procedures is used to review the risk profile and monitor the effective application of internal control in the Group. These
include self assessment of controls and annual certification of compliance with the Group’s financial and operational procedures
(including compliance with environmental, health and safety and business conduct standards) by both the managing director or senior
executive and the senior finance manager of each business unit and function, together with independent reviews by the Control and
Compliance function.
• The Control and Compliance function’s responsibilities include reporting to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of internal control
systems, focusing on those areas with the greatest perceived risk to the Group. This compliance programme is currently being
developed further to review controls across key areas of risk annually to meet new US compliance legislation.
• Follow-up procedures ensure there is an appropriate response to recommendations for any enhancement to risk controls identified by
reviews from the Control and Compliance function.
The Audit Committee confirms it has reviewed and reported to the Board on the system of internal control for the year ended 30 September
2003. Through the procedural and reporting framework for monitoring business risks and controls, as set out above, and review of the Group’s
financial statements, it is satisfied there is sufficient information to enable it to review the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control.
Going concern
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to meet its operational needs for the foreseeable future and accordingly they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Pension fund
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC’s main pension fund, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, is not controlled by the Board, but by Trustees, consisting
of five nominees from the Company, one member chosen by employees and two by current and deferred pensioners. The Trustees look after the
assets of the pension fund, which are held separately from those of the Company and are managed by independent fund managers. The pension
scheme funds can only be used in accordance with its rules and for no other purpose.
Communication with shareholders
Communication with all shareholders is given a high priority and a number of methods are used to promote greater understanding and dialogue
with investment audiences.
The Group’s Annual Review, a summary financial statement, provides shareholders with the material information concerning Imperial Tobacco
Group in a form more readily assimilated than the full Annual Report and Accounts. Shareholders can also request the full report and Form 20-F.
At the half year an Interim Report is published. All of these documents are available on-line through the Imperial Tobacco website
(www.imperial-tobacco.com), together with all announcements, investor presentations and share price information.
During the year shareholders are kept informed of the progress of the Group through trading statements and other announcements of significant
developments that are released through the London Stock Exchange and other news services. There is regular dialogue with institutional
shareholders and participation in sector conferences. This is being extended to ensure Non-Executive Directors on appointment also meet with
major shareholders and that the Senior Non-Executive Director attends regular meetings with major investors.
Additionally, there is an opportunity at the Annual General Meeting for individual shareholders to question the Chairman and the chairmen of the
Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees. It is the Company’s practice to make arrangements to send the Report and Accounts to
shareholders at least 20 working days prior to the Annual General Meeting. The Company indicates the level of proxy votes lodged in respect of
each resolution proposed at its Annual General Meeting following each vote on a show of hands. Details of abstentions are also disclosed.
ITG 43 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group at the balance sheet date and of the profit or loss and the cash flows of the Group for that period.
The Directors consider that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently. They also confirm that reasonable judgements
and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2003 and that applicable Accounting
Standards have been followed.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose, with reasonable accuracy, at any time the financial position
of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group, and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Information published on the Internet is accessible
in many countries with different legal requirements. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of Auditors’ responsibilities
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC’s Registered Auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are responsible for forming an independent opinion on the
financial statements of the Group as presented by the Directors, and for reporting their opinion to shareholders. Their report is set out on page 57.
By order of the Board

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee, in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (“the
Regulations”) which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors’ remuneration, and to meet the relevant requirements
of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. In particular, it describes how the Board has applied the principles of good governance relating
to directors’ remuneration set out in the Combined Code.
The Regulations require the Auditors to report to the Company’s shareholders on the “audited information” within the Directors’ Remuneration
Report (“the Report”) and to state whether in their opinion, that part of the Report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985 (as amended by the Regulations). Their opinion is set out on page 57 and those aspects of the Report which have been subject to audit
have been clearly marked.
Remuneration Committee
The Board considers itself ultimately responsible for the framework and cost of executive remuneration, but has delegated responsibility for
determining the remuneration levels and conditions of service for Executive Directors of the Company and Group senior executives to the
Remuneration Committee. The Committee’s approach is fully consistent with the Group’s overall philosophy that all employees should be
competitively rewarded to attract and retain their valued skills in the business, as well as supporting corporate strategy, by directly aligning
executive management with the Group’s strategic business goals.
The Remuneration Committee is comprised exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company who have no personal financial
interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. The members of the Committee throughout the year were:
Mr I J G Napier (chairman);
Mr D C Bonham;
Mr S Huismans;
Dr P H Jungels.
The Chief Executive attends by invitation to respond to questions raised by the Committee. However, he is specifically excluded from any matter
concerning the details of his own remuneration.
The Committee sets the remuneration package for each senior executive after taking advice principally from external sources including
remuneration consultants, Towers Perrin and Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow, who were appointed by the Committee. Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow
were appointed during the year to review the Group’s principles and practices against corporate governance best practice. Executive
remuneration surveys published by Monks Partnership and William M Mercer are also used to assist in the benchmarking process. Mr G Davis,
Chief Executive, Mr R C Hannaford, Company Secretary (who acts as Secretary to the Committee) and Mr D P Cuthbert, Group Compensation
and Benefits Manager, also provide internal support and advice.
The Committee, which operates under clear written terms of reference, confirms formally that its constitution and operation comply with the principles
set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and has applied the principles in Section 1 of that Code throughout the year.
Remuneration strategy
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC operates in an increasingly competitive, international environment. For the Group to continue to compete
successfully it is essential that the level of remuneration and benefits offered achieves the objectives of attracting, developing, retaining and
motivating the necessary high quality pool of talented employees, at all levels, across the Group. The Group therefore sets out to provide
competitive remuneration to all its employees, appropriate to the business environment in those countries in which it operates.
As the Group continues to develop internationally and integrate acquisitions, it is having increasing regard to the need to relocate employees
from country to country as the requirements of the business dictate, and develop its remuneration arrangements accordingly. The remuneration
strategy is therefore designed, not only to align with the Group’s fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and equity, but also to support
the Group’s corporate strategy, as a significant contributor to its competitive advantage. A cohesive reward structure across the Group - with a
timely pay review process, consistently applied to all employees and well communicated to ensure each element of the package is understood
with links to corporate performance recognised - is seen as critical in ensuring all employees can associate with and “buy into” the attainment of
the Group’s strategic goals.
The Group also seeks to align the interests of shareholders and employees at all levels by giving employees opportunities and encouragement
to build up a shareholding in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC. Through a series of share plan initiatives, under the UK Sharesave Scheme, the
International Sharesave Plan and Share Matching arrangements, the majority of eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries have been
offered participation in equity-based plans with a significant number taking advantage of the invitations.
Executive remuneration policy
The remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior executives, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, is intended to attract
and retain high quality executives, induce loyalty and motivate them to achieve a high level of corporate performance in line with the best interests
of shareholders, while not being excessive. The package is also in line with the Group’s overall policy on pay and benefits and, as the Group
extends its business internationally, it takes account of market practices outside the UK where the scope of a particular executive’s role warrants
this approach. ITG 46
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Executive remuneration policy (continued)
The ongoing policy combines short-term and long-term rewards, including performance-related elements that take into account individual,
business unit and corporate performance. The main components are base salary, an annual cash bonus, a Share Matching Scheme (SMS), a
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and pension benefits, with a significant weighting towards performance-related variable reward elements. In the
current year base salary typically represented around a third of total remuneration, for those Directors who served throughout the year, with annual
bonus and awards vesting under SMS and LTIP schemes making up around two-thirds of total pay. This policy is set to provide base salary at
the median level of its comparator group, while providing the Directors with the capacity to earn upper quartile total cash compensation on a
superior performance basis.
Percentage of Total Remuneration
Note: Mr D Cresswell and Dr F A Rogerson were appointed during the year, after vesting of their SMS and LTIP awards in January 2003.
In order to continue to meet corporate governance best practice, for the financial year to September 2004 more stringent performance criteria
will be applied to the performance-related elements as detailed in the LTIP section on page 50 which forms part of this policy statement. In
addition, it is proposed that, in advance of the expiry of authority for the Group’s existing share schemes, a comprehensive review of executive
remuneration will be undertaken during 2004 and, where appropriate, shareholder approval sought at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
Base salary
Base salary is reviewed annually and is determined by reference to individual responsibilities, performance and external market data. Therefore it
is set within a range around the market median for similar sized, publicly quoted companies to reflect the experience, responsibility, effectiveness
and market value of the executive. The comparator group of companies chosen is the FTSE 50 excluding companies in the Financial and
Pharmaceutical sectors. Base salary is the only element of the package used to determine pensionable earnings.
Annual cash bonus
For each financial year to September 2003, Executive Directors could earn annual bonuses up to a maximum of two-thirds base salary, by
reference to performance against financial targets determined by the Committee.
During the period under review, bonus targets related principally to the achievement of Group profit objectives. Performance in the year has
resulted in bonuses as detailed in the table on page 49 being awarded. A cash bonus was also earned by other senior executives for achieving
performance targets for the year to 30 September 2003.
For the year to 30 September 2004, bonus performance criteria will again relate to Group profit growth, however the specific targets are not
disclosed since they are considered to be commercially confidential. To align the Executive Directors bonuses more closely to market levels, the
potential maximum bonus has been increased from 66
2
/3 per cent to 100 per cent for the Chief Executive and Finance Director and 75 per cent
for other Executive Directors. However, attainment of these increased bonus levels is subject to achievement of stretching, incremental profit-
based performance criteria.
Under the Share Matching Scheme, Executive Directors and management may elect to invest any proportion up to a maximum of 100 per cent
of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trust. Provided that the shares lodged
are left in the Trust for three years the participant will receive the original shares plus additional shares equal in number to the original shares. In
respect of investments made by Executive Directors under the SMS from their bonus payable in December 2003, a performance criterion will
now be applied to the matched shares such that matching will only occur if the Group has achieved an average of 3 per cent real increase in
EPS per annum over the three year retention period, being an indicator of sustained ongoing profit delivery. It will be based upon the same
protocol as that applying to the Long-Term Incentive Plan. There will be no opportunity to re-test if this performance criterion is not met.
Benefits
The principal taxable benefits for Executive Directors are the provision of cars and health insurance, but in the case of Mr M A Häussler also
included relocation costs associated with his move to the UK.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Remuneration from other Non-Executive Directorships
The Company recognises that external non-executive directorships are beneficial for both the Executive Director concerned and the Company.
Executive Directors are permitted, at the discretion of the Board, to retain any fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorships.
Any serving Executive Director is restricted to one external non-executive directorship and may not serve as chairman of a FTSE 100 company.
During the year Mr G Davis was appointed to the Board of Wolseley plc and currently receives fees of £33,000 per annum.
Executive Directors Service contracts
It is the Group’s policy to appoint Executive Directors under service agreements terminable by either party giving 52 weeks notice, as shown in
the table below.
There are no predetermined provisions for compensation on termination within Executive Directors’ service agreements. However, the Group is
unequivocally against rewards for failure and generally believes that severance arrangements should be restricted to basic pay and consequential
payments such as earned bonus and pension accrual. Nevertheless, the circumstances of the termination and the individual’s duty and
opportunity to mitigate loss would be taken into account.
Under the rules of the LTIP and Share Matching Scheme outstanding awards vest on termination on a time-related pro-rata basis. If, however,
the termination is by resignation or dismissal for misconduct, the full award lapses.

Before Mr Häussler’s resignation as a Director, the Remuneration Committee had exceptionally agreed that the requisite notice period at the
commencement of his appointment was 104 weeks. This was reducing at the rate of two weeks per calendar month until such time as the
notice period reached 52 weeks. The initial longer notice period on first appointment was deemed essential to retain his services, which
involved him in international relocation and foregoing the five-year fixed term contract he enjoyed within the Reemtsma Group of companies.
The arrangement matched the notice period arrangements granted to Imperial Tobacco Group PLC’s Directors upon Listing in 1996.
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company. However, the terms of their appointments are reviewed annually
and upon them reaching 65 years of age. These terms were reviewed for all Non-Executive Directors and confirmed on 3 February 2003 and in
respect of Mr A G L Alexander again on 2 May 2003 following his 65th birthday. Under the terms of the Articles of Association of the Company
Non-Executive Directors stand for reappointment at the first Annual General Meeting following appointment, are subject to triennial
reappointment by shareholders and retire at the Annual General Meeting following their reaching 70 years of age. There are no provisions in their
letters of appointment regarding notice periods or compensation on early termination. Although there is no current maximum term of appointment
for Non-Executive Directors, the Board is currently considering adopting the best practice provisions outlined in the Higgs Report.
Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole with regard to market practice within the restrictions contained in the
Articles of Association. The Non-Executive Directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration. They receive no other material
pay or benefits (with the exception of reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with their Directorship of the Company and provision
of administration support including the use of Company offices by the Chairman and Vice Chairman) and do not participate in the Company’s
share schemes, bonus schemes or incentive plans and are not eligible for pension scheme membership.
To align further the interest of the Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders it was agreed that a proportion of their fees be applied,
after tax, to purchase shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC. These shares are to be held by a nominee during the term of each Non-Executive
Directorship. Exceptionally in respect of Mr D C Bonham and Mr A G L Alexander, this provision has been waived due to their substantial
shareholdings detailed on page 50.
Mr S Huismans is, and Mr L W Staby was, until his resignation, a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which they
received additional remuneration.
Remuneration arrangements for former Directors
Following his retirement in May 2000, Mr S T Painter entered into a consultancy agreement with Imperial Tobacco Limited, the Group’s principal
operating company. The agreement, as amended in October 2001, runs for four years to June 2004. Under the terms of the agreement he
provides consultancy services as required and receives fees at a day rate of £1,000 with a minimum fee based on 100 days services for each
12 month period ending on 30 June. Mr S T Painter is also entitled to reimbursement for the use of his car. ITG 48
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Remuneration arrangements for former Directors (continued)
Mr S T Painter is also a member of Supervisory Boards within the Reemtsma Group for which he receives additional remuneration.
Following the acceptance by the Board, on 9 July 2003, of the resignation of Mr L W Staby, it was agreed that his remuneration continue until
the expiry of this term of office on 1 February 2004.
Similarly the Company has agreed that remuneration attributable to his duties on the Supervisory Board of Reemtsma companies will continue
to be paid on a similar basis.
On 14 January 2003, following the successful attainment of LTIP performance criterion, Mrs S Inston, the widow of Mr C A C Inston, was granted
shares under the Company’s LTIP.
Subsequent to his resignation as a Director of the Company with effect from 9 July 2003, Mr M A Häussler remains an employee receiving his
full contractual remuneration.

Apart from the dividend reinvestment in respect of the PEPs of Mr S P Duffy there have been no changes in these holdings since 30 September 2003.
Executive share retention
To ensure the interests of management remain aligned with those of shareholders, Executive Directors and senior executives are required to meet
minimum shareholding guidelines by building a stake in the Group to a current minimum value broadly equivalent to twice their base salary. At a
more junior level, executives are expected to invest at a level equivalent to their base salary. These levels will be reviewed as part of the
remuneration review planned for 2004.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Each year since demerger in 1996, annual awards, worth 75 per cent of basic salary, have been made to Executive Directors under the LTIP. The
awards, which vest three years after grant, are subject to the satisfaction of an applicable performance criterion, as set out below, over a three-
year performance period. It is anticipated that a further conditional award worth 75 per cent of basic salary will be made during November 2003.
The performance criterion, imposed on awards made under the LTIP up to and including December 1999, was based on a sliding scale
depending on total shareholder return (TSR) achieved over the period of the award. No vesting of the award occurred unless the Company’s
total shareholder return exceeds that of 50 per cent of the companies constituting the FTSE 100 Index. At this performance threshold 30 per
cent of the provisional award vested. If the return exceeds 80 per cent of the Index, the award vested in full. Between these thresholds the award
vested on a straight-line basis. The TSR calculations use share prices averaged over a month to determine initial and closing prices rather than
those ruling on a single day. It is also assumed that the cash flow of dividend payments is recognised on the date the shares are declared “ex-
dividend”. This method is considered to give a fairer and less volatile result since improved performance has to be sustained for several weeks
before it effectively impacts on the TSR calculations. The TSR calculations themselves have been performed independently by Alithos Limited
(appointed by the Company but who perform no other services for the Group) and were approved by the Remuneration Committee. The final
award which was based on the TSR performance criterion, vested in January 2003. On vesting a participant is granted a “nil cost” option to
acquire the relevant number of shares. The option may be exercised at any time up to the seventh anniversary of its date of grant.
The Committee recognises that it is never easy to set meaningful long-term performance targets in a rapidly changing business environment and
in the context of volatile stock markets. The Committee therefore regularly reviews the appropriateness of the performance conditions under the
LTIP to ensure they remain demanding, yet realistic, and effectively incentivise participants to perform at the highest level. In December 2000, in
consultation with Towers Perrin, it was decided that total shareholder return no longer represented the most appropriate performance criterion
for measuring future performance.
For the December 2000 and future awards, the Committee replaced total shareholder return with earnings per share (EPS) growth as the new
performance criterion. This was seen as enhancing the incentive effect of the Plan by focusing on the financial performance of the business, over
which Directors and executives have power to influence, rather than linking awards to a volatile share price unduly influenced by short-term sector
sentiment. The Committee nevertheless retains absolute discretion to ensure that the EPS performance criterion fully reflects the underlying
performance of the Group before any awards vest, including maintenance of long-term return on capital employed. ITG 51
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) (continued)
Awards vest on a sliding scale depending on average growth in basic EPS based on an agreed protocol to allow appropriate adjustments for
amortisation, exceptional and extraordinary items. The adjustments are confirmed by the Auditors after adjusting for inflation over the period of
the award. No vesting occurs unless the Company’s average real EPS growth is positive. Full vesting occurs if real EPS growth is equal to or
exceeds 10 per cent. Between these two points the award vests on a straight-line basis. In order to ensure that performance criterion remains
challenging for the proposed award, in 2003 and for future awards vesting will only occur if the average real EPS growth exceeds 3 per cent per
annum. The upper threshold of 10 per cent real EPS growth will remain unchanged.
There is no opportunity to retest if the performance criterion is not achieved.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Executive Directors’ conditional share awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (continued)
During the year, the December 1999 – December 2002 award vested in full. The total shareholder return over the period exceeded that of all
the FTSE 100 companies, thereby exceeding the performance of the bottom 80 of the FTSE 100 Index, the threshold at which the award
maximised.
In respect of the November 2000 – November 2003 award, based on earnings per share to the end of the financial year, 100 per cent of the
award will vest on 27 November 2003. For illustrative purposes only, the share price on 13 November 2003, being the latest practicable date
prior to publication, was £10.085 valuing the awards as follows:
Award vesting
no. of shares Award vesting
Award lapsing over which illustrative
no. of shares options granted value £’000
G Davis – 61,871 624
R Dyrbus – 38,214 385
D Cresswell – 12,131 122
F A Rogerson – 12,939 130
The value of any awards vesting could vary significantly from the above due to share price movements.
The Remuneration Committee regards the November 2001 – November 2004 and the November 2002 – November 2005 awards to be too distant
from maturity to be included in the value projected above. However, in respect of these awards, earnings per share have grown by more than
10 per cent in real terms in the financial year and therefore, if this performance is maintained over the relevant performance periods both awards
would vest in full. Evidence of the Group’s sustained performance on a TSR basis when compared with the FTSE 100 Index is set out below.
Total return indices – Imperial Tobacco and FTSE 100
The FTSE 100 Index is seen to provide the most appropriate and most widely recognised index for benchmarking the corporate performance of
the Company which is a constituent of that index.
Share Matching Scheme (SMS)
Centenary Scheme
To encourage employees to acquire and retain a shareholding, and to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company
(of Great Britain and Ireland) Limited, all employees of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the
date of the centenary, were invited to purchase up to £3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares and lodge them with the
Employee Benefit Trust. Provided these shares are left in the Trust, the lodged shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20 per cent for
one year’s retention to a maximum of 100 per cent if they are retained for five years.
Annual Scheme
As detailed under “Annual cash bonus” on page 46, the Scheme also allows Executive Directors and most of the Group’s management to take
their bonus in shares, which are matched 1:1 over a three-year period.
The Executive Directors’ rights to shares arising under both SMS schemes are set out on page 53.

During the year, annual bonuses earned in 1998/99 and lodged under the Scheme for a three-year period matured in January 2003, providing
matched shares for participants on a 1:1 basis.
In respect of annual bonuses earned in 2001/2002, the Executive Directors elected to take the majority of their bonus in the form of Imperial
Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trust under the Scheme. These will be matched with additional shares,
equal in number to the original shares, provided they are left in the Trust for three years. These additional shares are shown within contingent
rights above.
In respect of Directors holding office at the year-end, there have been no further changes since 30 September 2003.
The Company’s middle market share price at the close of business on 30 September 2003 was £9.81and the range of the middle market price
during the year was £9.09 to £11.10. ITG 54
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Share options
The Company does not operate an executive share option scheme. However, Executive Directors are eligible to participate in Imperial Tobacco
Group PLC’s savings-related Sharesave Scheme. Under this Scheme, options are granted at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the closing
middle market price on the day prior to invitation, to participants who have contracted to save up to £250 per month over a period of three or
five years.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Employee Benefit Trust
The Imperial Tobacco Group Employee and Executive Benefit Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust have
been established to acquire ordinary shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to
shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the share matching and performance-related share awards. As potential
beneficiaries of the Employee and Executive Benefit Trust, each of the Executive Directors is deemed to have a contingent interest in the 801,838
ordinary shares of the Company held by that Trust at 30 September 2003.
The Company’s policy has always been, and continues to be, to satisfy all awards under its share schemes from market purchased shares through
the Trust. The Trust Deed and the rules of all schemes contain provisions limiting awards to 5 per cent in 5 years and 10 per cent in 10 years
for all employee schemes with an additional restriction to 5 per cent in 10 years for executive schemes. Currently an aggregate of only 0.9 per
cent of the Company’s issued share capital is subject to awards under the Group’s share schemes.
Directors’ pensions
The Executive Directors are all members of the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund, the principal defined benefit scheme operated by the Group. For
members who joined prior to 1 April 2002, the fund is non-contributory and fully funded with a normal retirement age of 60. The fund allows
members to achieve the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary at normal retirement age after 32 years’ service. For members joining on
or after 1 April 2002 (“New Members”), including Mr M A Häussler, employee contributions of 5 per cent of pensionable salary are payable, the
normal retirement age is 65 and maximum pension is achieved after 40 years service. Pension commutation to enable participants to receive a
lump sum on retirement is permitted within Inland Revenue limits.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable together with a spouse’s pension of two-thirds (half for New
Members) of the member’s expected pension at retirement. For death in retirement, a spouse’s pension of two-thirds (half for New Members) of
the member’s pre-commutation pension is payable. Dependant children will also receive allowances.
Other than for New Members, whose pensions after retirement increase by the lesser of 5 per cent and the increase in the general index of retail
prices (“RPI”), pensions increase by the lesser of 10 per cent and the increase in RPI, together with an option under the rules to surrender part
of a pension for pension increases in line with the general index of retail prices of up to 15 per cent.
All Executive Directors earn benefits on the standard scale with a normal retirement age of 60 except Mr M A Häussler, whose normal retirement
age is 63.
In addition to the pension arrangement above, Mr M A Häussler’s service contract contains a provision that he will receive a similar benefit to
that he would have received had he remained in his former Reemtsma plan. Under his former, non-contributory, plan he would have received 42
per cent of his final salary upon retirement at age 63. Upon retirement Mr M A Häussler will receive his accrued pension from the Reemtsma plan
and the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund. The Company has undertaken to provide for any shortfall between the pensions payable from the above
plans and the agreed benefit. The Company has been advised by its actuary that the estimated actuarial present value of this shortfall will be in
the order of £1.2 million.
In previous years, details of Directors’ pension benefits have been reported in accordance with the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
However, the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 have introduced the requirement to disclose additional information for Directors’
pension benefits under defined benefit schemes.
The following table provides the information required on both bases and gives details for each Director of:
• the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as if he had left service at the year end;
• the increase in accrued pension during the year, excluding any increases for inflation in respect of the disclosure required under the Listing
Rules;
• the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension calculated in accordance with the actuarial guidance note GN11.
None of the Directors have made additional voluntary contributions. ITG 56

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPOR T TO THE
MEMBERS OF IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, statement of total recognised gains and
losses, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated cash flow statement, accounting policies, notes to the accounts and the Imperial Tobacco
Group PLC balance sheet and related notes. We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act
1985 contained in the Directors’ remuneration report (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities. The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Directors’
remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion,
has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no
other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report
to you if, in our opinion, the Report of the Directors is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s statement,
operating and financial review, the corporate governance statement and the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s or
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the United Kingdom Auditing Practices Board and with the Auditing
Standards generally accepted in the United States. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
United Kingdom opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 30 September 2003 and
of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985,
and those parts of the Directors’ remuneration report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
United States opinion
In our opinion the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group at 30 September
2003 and 28 September 2002 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended 30 September 2003, 28 September 2002
and 29 September 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom. These principles differ in certain
respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The effect of the differences in the determination of net income,
shareholders’ equity and cash flows is shown in note 29 to the financial statements.

The results of businesses are included from the effective date of acquisition and businesses sold are included up to the date of disposal.
The principal operating subsidiary undertakings are listed on pages 99 and 100.
US filing and corresponding amounts
The financial statements incorporate the financial information required to satisfy the Company’s US Form 20-F filing requirements which includes
three year profit and loss account and cash flow statement information.
Intangible fixed assets – goodwill
Businesses acquired have been dealt with in the consolidated accounts using acquisition accounting. Upon the acquisition of a business, the
fair values that reflect the condition at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Adjustments are also
made to bring the accounting policies of the businesses acquired into alignment with those of the Group. Where the consideration paid exceeds
the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made on or after 27 September 1998 is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful
economic life, a period not exceeding 20 years. Previously all goodwill was written off against reserves in the period of acquisition. On the
subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable
amount of purchased goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Intangible fixed assets – trade marks and licences
Trade marks and licences are included at cost and amortised in annual equal instalments over a period which does not exceed 20 years.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are shown at cost less depreciation. No depreciation is provided on freehold land. Depreciation of other fixed assets is
calculated to write off their cost less residual values over their expected useful lives as follows:
Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 years (straight line)
Plant and equipment 2 to 20 years (straight line/reducing balance)
Fixtures and motor vehicles 3 to 14 years (straight line)
Impairment of fixed assets
The carrying value of fixed assets is subject to periodic review and any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Cost includes an
addition for overheads where appropriate.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more
likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been discounted.
Turnover
Turnover represents the amount charged to customers in respect of goods supplied, exclusive of VAT but inclusive of excise duty. ITG 62
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction, or where forward cover contracts have
been arranged, at the contracted rates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, where a contracted rate does not apply,
are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date and any exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange ruling during the year. The balance sheets
of the overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Differences between the profit
and loss accounts translated at average rates and at balance sheet rates are shown as a movement in reserves and in the statement of total
recognised gains and losses.
The Group’s significant overseas equity investments are hedged by borrowings in the currencies in which those assets are denominated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the overseas net investments, including goodwill, less exchange differences on the
borrowings, to the extent that they finance those investments, are taken to reserves through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Other exchange gains and losses are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Instruments qualify for hedge accounting
where the underlying asset or liability has characteristics which can be directly related to the instrument transacted. The gains and losses on
those instruments, qualifying for hedge accounting, are recognised in the financial statements over the life of the transaction. All current derivative
financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting under UK GAAP.
The Group excludes all short-term debtors and creditors from its derivatives and financial instrument disclosures, other than those on currency
risks relating to monetary assets and liabilities.
Pension costs
The cost of providing pensions is charged to the profit and loss account over employees’ service lives. Variances arising from actuarial valuations
are charged or credited to profit over the estimated remaining service lives of the employees to the extent that any resulting credit does not
exceed the regular cost.
Leases
Rental costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Interest
Interest payable and receivable is recognised in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis. Derivative transactions, principally interest rate
swaps, are used to reduce exposure to interest rate movements on a proportion of floating rate debt. Hedge accounting is applied to these
transactions and as a result the interest differentials under these transactions are recognised in the financial statements by adjustment of interest
payable (and receivable) over the life of the transactions. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

Factors affecting the current tax charge for the year
Pre-goodwill amortisation, the tax assessed for the year at 27.1% is lower than the standard higher rate of corporation tax in the UK (30.0%).
Post-goodwill amortisation, the effective tax rate exceeded 30.0%. A reconciliation between the current tax charge at the standard UK rate
and the actual current tax charge is shown below:

Total current tax 236 167 135
Factors that may affect future tax charges
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains rolled over into replacement assets. Such tax would become payable only if the assets
were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief. The total amount unprovided is £6m and it is not envisaged that this tax will
become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, as no dividends have been
declared. The Group currently does not have any intention to remit dividends from overseas subsidiaries to the UK but if it were to do so,
the tax effect would be immaterial. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

of £203m (2002: £83m), since the Directors consider that this gives a useful additional indication of underlying performance.
2001 adjusted earnings per share have been calculated using earnings before amortisation of the intangible assets acquired in Australia
and New Zealand in September 1999, and the EFKA group, the Baelen group, Tobaccor and Mayfair vending business assets in 2001.
There would be no significant dilution of earnings if the outstanding share options referred to in note 18 were exercised.

15 Borrowings and financial instruments
The Group operates a centralised treasury function that is responsible for the management of the financial risks of the Group, together with
its financing and liquidity requirements. It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions, and is subject
to policies and procedures approved by the Board. On a frequent basis, the Group Treasurer discusses matters with a treasury sub-
committee, consisting of senior executives, including the Finance Director. The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board,
including provision of monthly treasury summaries and an annual review of strategy.
The following table analyses the Group’s financial liabilities at the balance sheet date:

3,427 3,645
Total borrowings 4,032 3,738
Loans amounting to £8m (2002: £9m) are secured by charges, mortgages or liens on certain fixed assets.
In addition to the bank loans maturing between two and five years, there are b610m of bank guarantees issued to support the future
purchase of 9.99% of Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH.
The loans maturing after five years are the US $600m global bond (which matures in April 2009), and the £350m sterling bond (which
matures in June 2012).
(i) Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings and surplus cash. In order to manage interest rate risk, the
Group maintains both fixed and floating rate debt and uses derivatives, including interest rate and cross currency swaps, to vary the
mix.
The following table analyses the currency and interest composition of the Group’s financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.

The floating rate financial liabilities comprise of bank borrowings and capital market issuance. The majority of bank borrowings bear
interest at rates fixed in advance for periods of one month by reference to LIBOR (in the case of sterling borrowings) and EURIBOR
(in the case of euro borrowings). The capital market issuance in place at the year end bears interest (post interest and currency swaps)
at rates fixed in advance for six months by reference to LIBOR (in the case of the US dollar bond), for three months by reference to
EURIBOR (in the case of the sterling bond and some of the euro bonds) and for three months by reference to Australian dollar bank
bills (in the case of one of the euro bonds).
The figures shown in the tables above take into account various interest rate and currency swaps. Hence the US dollar denominated
bond issued in 1999 is shown within the sterling balance, and the sterling bond issued in 2002 is shown in the euro balance. The fixed
rate financial liabilities do not take into account forward start swaps, which may become effective after the balance sheet date.
(ii) Currency risk disclosure
The Group is exposed to the translation of the results of overseas subsidiaries into sterling, as well as the impact of trading transactions
in foreign currencies. On significant acquisitions of overseas companies, borrowings are raised in the local currency to minimise the
translation risk. For transaction risk, where necessary, forward foreign exchange deals are entered into to hedge a proportion of the forecast
foreign currency cash flows. At the year end, £47.7m notional of forward foreign exchange deals were outstanding (2002: £32.6m).

currency, at the balance sheet date:

UK Sharesave Scheme
Under the terms of the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Sharesave Scheme the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the
Company to UK employees who enter into an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn (SAYE) savings contract. The price at which
options may be offered is up to 20% less than the mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC share on the London Stock
Exchange on the day prior to the invitation. The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the expiry of the
SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the Scheme.
International Sharesave Plan
Under the Plan the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares (ADSs) in the Company to non-
UK employees who enter into a savings contract. The price at which options may be offered varies depending on local laws, but for ordinary
shares will not be less than 80% of the mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC share on the London Stock Exchange on the
day prior to invitation. In respect of ADSs the price will not be less than 80% of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the
same day. Options may normally be exercised during the six months after expiry of the savings contract, three years after entering the Plan.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
In respect of the performance period ending in December 2002, the Company’s total shareholder return exceeded that of all the companies
in the FTSE 100 Index. By exceeding the bottom 80 per cent of the companies in the Index, the award vested in full on 6 January 2003.
In respect of the November 2000 – November 2003 award, based on earnings per share to the end of the financial year, 100% of the award
will vest, on 27 November 2003.
Share Matching Scheme
The Share Matching Scheme is designed to encourage employees to acquire and retain Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares.
There was an initiative in 2002 to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company (of Great Britain and Ireland)
Limited. All employees of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the date of the centenary, were
invited to purchase up to £3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares and lodge them with the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided these shares are left in the Trusts, the lodged shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20% for one year’s retention to a
maximum of 100% if they are retained for five years.
For Executive Directors and selected management, individuals may elect to invest any proportion up to a maximum of 100% of their gross bonus
in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trusts. Provided that the shares elected for are left in the
Trusts for three years, and the individual remains in employment with the Group, the participant would receive the original shares plus additional
shares. The matching ratio for bonuses is 1:1 to encourage Directors and managers to build a meaningful shareholding in the Group.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts (ESOTs)
The Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Employee and Executive Benefit Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust
have been established to acquire ordinary shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the
Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the share matching and performance-related
share awards. At 30 September 2003, the Trusts held 5.5m (2002: 3.9m) ordinary shares, with a nominal value of £552,042, all acquired
in the open market at a cost of £49.1m (2002: £26.7m). These were financed by a gift of £1.7m and an interest free loan of £47.4m. None
of the ESOT shares have been allocated to employees or Directors as at 30 September 2003. All finance costs and administration expenses
connected with the ESOTs are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue. The cost of the shares is being amortised over the
performance period of the associated schemes. The Trusts have waived their rights to dividends and the shares held by the Trusts are
excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

20 Acquisitions
Reemtsma. During 2002 the Group acquired a 90.01% interest in Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and entered into an Option
Agreement enabling the acquisition of the outstanding 9.99%. The Group also entered into a Profit Pooling Agreement whereby the holders
of the outstanding 9.99% surrendered their interests in the equity and results of Reemtsma in exchange for a fixed return. As a result the
Group has consolidated 100% of the results and net assets of Reemtsma and have reflected a liability to the holders of the 9.99%. The
acquisition method has been adopted. Provisional fair valuations included in the 2002 Group financial statements have, in accordance with
FRS 7 “Fair values in acquisition accounting”, been finalised resulting in a decrease in net assets acquired of £47m, and a corresponding
increase in purchased goodwill which has been incorporated into the 2003 Group financial statements.
The principal adjustments have been a £57m reduction on plant and machinery following completion of a comprehensive review of the
assets acquired, together with a £19m decrease in associated deferred taxation liability. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

22 Legal proceedings
The Group is currently involved in a number of legal cases in which claimants are seeking damages for alleged smoking-related health
effects. In the opinion of the Group’s lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously
contested. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not
have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.
23 Pensions
The Group operates pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally those operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited, John Player & Sons
Limited, Reemtsma Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and Badische Tabakmanufaktur Roth-Händle GmbH
(BTM). The main schemes are of the defined benefit type and the assets are held in trustee administered funds, apart from the German
schemes which are unfunded.
The principal Group scheme, covering UK employees, is the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund (‘the Scheme’). An actuarial valuation of the
Scheme was made at 31 March 2001. The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the Scheme’s liabilities were
those relating to the rate of investment return earned on the Scheme’s existing assets and the rates of increase in pay and pensions. It was
assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5% per annum and that pay and pension
increases would average 4.25% and 2.5% per annum respectively. The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2001, the market value of the assets of the Scheme was £2,439m. The total assets were sufficient to cover 111% of the
benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases. Group contributions to the Scheme
remain suspended having regard to the surplus disclosed in this valuation.
There was no pension cost to disclose in respect of the Scheme for the year ended 30 September 2003. The pension cost has been
assessed in accordance with the advice of Watson Wyatt LLP, actuaries and consultants, using the projected unit method. There were no
outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date.
Since the date of the last formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme, stock markets have fallen significantly, impacting the valuation of the
assets of the Scheme. The pension cost will be reassessed following the next formal valuation as at 31 March 2004. This valuation is not
expected to have a material effect on the future profits of the Group.
Actuarial valuations of the pension liabilities of the Reemtsma Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and BTM
pension schemes were undertaken at 28 September 2002 and 30 September 2003. These quantified unfunded past service liabilities of
£291m at 28 September 2002 and £337m at 30 September 2003, which has been recognised in the accounts, together with the other
German unfunded schemes. The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the Scheme’s liabilities were those relating
to the rates of increase in pay and pensions. These would be in the range of 2.8% to 2.9% for the increase in pay and 1.5% to 1.6% for
the increase in pensions.
The pension cost relating to foreign schemes is calculated in accordance with local accounting principles. The pension cost for foreign
schemes in the year was £34m (2002: £13m). NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS

FRS 17 disclosures for the year to 30 September 2003
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24. Full implementation of FRS 17 “Retirement benefits”, which
was to be mandatory for the Group for the year ended September 2003, has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board until
accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005. However, the following transitional disclosures are still required.
The results of the most recent available actuarial valuations for the principal Group schemes have been updated to 30 September 2003 by
Watson Wyatt LLP, actuaries and consultants.

and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
ITG 91
29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) (continued)
(i) Pensions
Under UK GAAP, pension costs are accounted for under the rules set out in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. 24
(SSAP 24). Its objectives and principles are broadly in line with those set out in the US accounting standard for pensions, Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (SFAS 87). However, SSAP 24 is less prescriptive
in the application of the actuarial method and assumptions to be applied in the calculation of pension costs.
Group contributions to the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund (‘the Scheme’) are suspended as a result of the surplus disclosed in note
23. Under UK GAAP, in accordance with SSAP 24, no pension expense has been reflected in the profit and loss account and no
pension asset has been recognised in the balance sheet for the UK and Irish pension schemes. A pension liability and related pension
expense is recognised for the German unfunded pension schemes, in accordance with SSAP 24.
Under US GAAP, the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period as determined in
accordance with SFAS 87. Under SFAS 87, a pension asset representing the excess of Scheme assets over benefit obligations has
been recognised in the balance sheet.
(ii) Intangible assets
Both UK and US GAAP require purchase consideration to be allocated to the net assets acquired at their fair value on the date of
acquisition. Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets acquired on acquisitions made
on, or after, 27 September 1998 are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, not exceeding a period of 20 years. Prior to 27
September 1998, all goodwill and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets were written off to reserves on acquisition.
Under US GAAP, identifiable intangible assets are separately valued and amortised over their useful lives. The separately identifiable
intangible assets included in the US GAAP balance sheet are principally comprised of brand rights which are being amortised over
25 to 30 years.
The Company adopted SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” with effect from 1 July 2001 and accordingly goodwill
generated on acquisitions after this date was not amortised. For purchase transactions prior to 1 July 2001, goodwill was capitalised
and amortised over its useful life. From 29 September 2002, in accordance with SFAS 142, the Company no longer amortises
goodwill but rather tests such assets for impairment on an annual basis or where there is an indicator of impairment.
The Company has completed the first step of the impairment test under the transitional requirements of SFAS 142 and an annual
impairment review as of 30 September 2003. No impairment charge of goodwill was indicated. A reconciliation of previously reported
net income under US GAAP and income per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill amortisation is presented
below. Income per ordinary share adjusted for goodwill charges is calculated by adding back the goodwill charge to net income and
dividing by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for all periods presented.

29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) (continued)
(iii) Deferred taxation
Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised where their
recovery is considered more likely than not.
US GAAP requires deferred taxation to be provided in full, using the liability method. In addition, US GAAP requires the recognition
of the deferred tax consequences of differences between the assigned values and the tax bases of the identifiable intangible assets,
with the exception of non tax-deductible goodwill, in a purchase business combination. Consequently, the deferred tax liability
attributable to identifiable intangible assets has been recognised and is being amortised over the useful economic lives of the
underlying intangible assets.
(iv) Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into certain swap transactions with contractual maturities exceeding those of the underlying debt being
hedged, in anticipation of there being additional floating rate debt when the existing debt matures. Under UK GAAP, derivative financial
instruments that reduce exposures on anticipated future transactions may be accounted for using hedge accounting.
US GAAP requires the Group to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The Group has decided not to satisfy the
SFAS 133 requirements to achieve hedge accounting for its derivatives, where permitted, and accordingly movements in the fair value
of derivatives are recorded in the profit and loss account.
(v) Proposed dividends
Under UK GAAP, dividends paid and proposed are shown on the face of the profit and loss account as an appropriation of the current
year’s earnings. Proposed dividends are provided on the basis of recommendation by the Directors and are subject to subsequent
approval by shareholders.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders.
(vi) Shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trusts (ESOTs)
Under UK GAAP, shares held by the Trusts are recorded at cost and reflected as a fixed asset investment in the Group’s balance sheet.
Under US GAAP, these shares are recorded at cost and reflected as a deduction from shareholders’ funds.
(vii) Employee share schemes charge to the profit and loss account
Under UK GAAP, the cost of shares purchased by the ESOTs in conjunction with an employee share scheme are charged to the profit
and loss account according to the book value of the shares at the date of purchase. The cost of employee share schemes not held
under the ESOTs are charged using the quoted market price of shares at the date of grant. The charge is accrued over the vesting
period of the shares in both cases.
Under US GAAP, the compensation cost is recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and
the quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
For option plans which contain performance criteria, compensation cost is remeasured at each period end until all performance criteria
have been met.
(viii) Inventory step-up
On acquisition under UK GAAP, the fair value of inventory is represented by the acquired companies’ current cost of reproducing that
inventory.
On acquisition under US GAAP, the fair value represents the selling price less any further costs to be incurred to sale. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
ITG 93
29 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) (continued)
(ix) Restructuring costs
On acquisition under UK GAAP, restructuring provisions may only be recognised as a fair value adjustment, if the acquired company
had an irrevocable commitment to restructure which was not conditional on the completion of the purchase.
On acquisition under US GAAP, restructuring liabilities relating solely to the acquired entity may be provided in the opening balance
as a fair value exercise, if specific criteria about restructuring plans are met.

(xii) Cash flow statements
The consolidated cash flow statements have been prepared under UK GAAP in accordance with FRS 1 (revised) and present
substantially the same information as required under SFAS 95. There are certain differences between FRS 1 (revised) and SFAS 95
with regard to classification of items within the cash flow statement.
In accordance with FRS 1 (revised), cash flows are prepared separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of
finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid
resources and financing. Under SFAS 95, cash flows are classified under operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Under FRS 1 (revised), cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand. Under
SFAS 95, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
A summary of the Group’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities classified in accordance with SFAS 95 is
presented below. For the purposes of this summary, the Group considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months
or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

(xiii) Impact of new accounting standards
In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 149 “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities
under SFAS 133. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after 30 June 2003 and for hedging relationships
designated after 30 June 2003. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s results.
In May 2003, the FASB issues SFAS 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity”. SFAS 150 establishes standards on how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics
of both liabilities and equity. It requires that a company classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset
in some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. This statement is effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after 31 May 2003 and otherwise is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after 15
December 2003. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s results.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51.” FIN No. 46 requires certain variable interest entities, or VIEs, to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the
entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity
at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN No. 46 is effective
for all VIEs created or acquired after 31 January 2003. For VIEs created or acquired prior to 1 February 2003, the provisions of FIN
No. 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after 15 December 2003. The Group currently have no
contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and, therefore, the Group does not expect the
adoption of FIN No. 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITG 96

(vi) Contingent liabilities
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has guaranteed various borrowings and liabilities of certain UK and overseas subsidiary undertakings,
including its Dutch and Irish subsidiaries. At 30 September 2003, the contingent liability totalled £4,547m (2002: £4,342m).
The guarantees include the Dutch subsidiaries which, in accordance with Book 2, Article 403 of The Netherlands Civil Code, do not file
separate accounts with the Chamber of Commerce. Under the same article, Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has issued declarations to
assume any and all liability for any and all debts of the Dutch subsidiaries.
The guarantees also cover the Irish subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 September 2003. The
Irish companies, namely John Player & Sons Limited, John Player Distributors Limited and Van Nelle (Ireland) have therefore availed
themselves of the exemption provided by section 17 of the Irish Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 in respect of documents required to
be attached to the annual returns for such companies. ITG 99

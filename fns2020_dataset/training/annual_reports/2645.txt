Nathan Bostock, CFO, Abbey Group Chairman’s Statement
Business Control Solutions Group plc
Annual Report 2007
04
2007 has been a year of significant change and progress and the
business is fully focused and clear about its priorities. We have achieved
good growth in the business despite the high levels of investment in
both our Consultancy and Software businesses as we have set about
delivering on our strategy. 
Our Consulting business performed strongly, building momentum
through the year. The first half of the year saw us invest in recruiting and
retaining the necessary skills. The business won several important new
accounts and with increased revenue across more key clients and
engagements the business enters 2008 in a healthy position.
In our Software business our strategy has been to invest heavily in
building our strategic products. We made progress in improving the
quality of our sales by moving to an annuity based revenue model,
thereby reducing our reliance on non-recurring revenue. We are entering
a key phase in the Software business with the recent launch of our
Balance Sheet Integrity product. Initial interest is encouraging and our
challenge for 2008 is to translate this interest into sales. 
We have also moved to strengthen the Board in 2007 with the
appointment of Roger Shepherd as Group Finance Director, who I am
delighted to welcome to the Company. I am confident the team we now
have in place will ensure we are able to drive the Group forward in the
coming year, drawing on the strong progress achieved particularly in the
second half of 2007.
In the year ahead we expect the demand for our services and products to
remain strong as the pressure on our customers to become more
efficient grows. We have good visibility on our order book and our well
diversified client base and assignment portfolio provides us with a robust
revenue stream.
I’d like to finish by thanking all of our staff for their continued hard work
and commitment during 2007. Our foundations are well established and
we are building for the future.

Simon Hudson-Lund, 
Chief Operating Officer at International Financial Data Services UK (IFDS) Chief Executive’s Review
Business Control Solutions Group plc
Annual Report 2007
06
In 2007 we have focused our efforts on implementing the strategy we set
out at the time of our fund-raising at the end of 2006. We invested
significantly in both our Consulting and Software businesses, whilst
continuing to transition our revenues to an annuity base. The initiatives
undertaken during 2007 ensure we are well positioned for the year ahead.
Financial Performance
The Group had revenues of £9.7m for the year showing a 20% increase
on 2006. The Consulting division grew at 26% whilst the Software
division was up by 4%, despite significant investment in the year and the
transition of our revenues to an annuity based revenue model.
Contracted annuity income within the software business at 31 December
2007 was £776,000 compared to £413,000 at the end of 2006, a rise of
88%. Deferred income as at 31 December 2007 was £298,000, a 4%
increase on 2006.
Gross margin for the Group was unchanged at 38% for the year despite
the stronger sales performance from the Consulting division where gross
margins are typically lower than those achieved in the Software division.
An improvement in the Consulting gross margin compensated for the
adverse shift in the sales mix away from the Software division. The
Consulting margin benefited from improved rates of utilisation, with the
utilisation rate being maintained consistently above 85% throughout 
the year.
The Group continues to invest in building its strategic software products
with development effort having been focused on the three strategic
products of Agent Reconciliation and Control (Arc), Balance Sheet
Integrity (Integrity), and our Operational Control Architecture (OCA). In
the year to 31 December 2007 £552,000 (2006: £35,000) of
development costs have been capitalised under IFRS where the Directors
consider the recognition criteria to have been met.
Our operating expenses continue to be largely personnel-related and
have risen 12% on 2006. Removing the impact of development cost
capitalisation, operating expenses would have risen by 26%. This rise has
been driven by an increase in the average number of heads employed
during the year in the Group by 37% to 93 as we have added to our
development capability and increased our Consulting labour pool, in line
with the rise in the demand for our services.
The loss before tax for the year was £237,000 (2006: £516,000) before
allowing for a charge for share options of £162,000 (2006: £168,000).
Taking into account the share options charge then the loss before tax
was £399,000 (2006: £684,000).
Trade debtors have risen commensurately with sales. Debtor days
outstanding have improved slightly to 61 (2006: 62.5).
The Group used £906,000 of cash during the year as we invested in our
new strategic products and grew our Consulting capability. Much of this
investment occurred in the first half of the year with the second half 
of the year seeing the Group return a positive cash flow. As at 
31 December 2007 the Group had £2.8m in cash.
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a final dividend for the
period ended 31 December 2007 (2006: nil).
Consulting Division
The division has enjoyed a strong year with revenues up 26% on 2006.
This growth has been experienced across all areas of our service offering.
The division is now significantly more robust with revenue now being
shared more evenly across engagements and clients. I am particularly
encouraged that this broadening of our customer base has been achieved
by continuing to focus our offering on the financial services sector.
Achieving significant growth in our Consulting business is reliant on our
ability to grow our headcount. In line with our stated intentions, the year
saw us increase our Consulting headcount by ten, incurring significant
recruitment fees as we sought to add to our consulting skill set and
establish ourselves as a leading provider of management consultancy
within the European financial services market. Despite this high level of
recruitment we were able to maintain our utilisation rates consistently
above 85% throughout the year ensuring strong revenue growth was
achieved whilst at the same time protecting our gross margin. 
During the year the Group launched its CTRL+ methodology specifically
targeting the areas of operational risk management and control. This
newly defined approach will enable clients to successfully diagnose
operational risk, implement changes and achieve continuous
improvement through having real time visibility over the status of their
risks and controls. This solution combines the Group’s Consultancy and
Software expertise to deliver best practice in operational control and
operational risk management and will allow the Group to exploit any
cross-selling opportunities.  07
Chief Executive’s Review
Employees and Board Changes
The year has seen key changes at Board level including Steve Russell’s
appointment as Chairman following Mitchel Lenson’s departure. Steve’s
contribution has been significant in ensuring we remain focused on our
strategic goals. During the period, we also saw the addition to the Board
of Roger Shepherd, our new Group Finance Director. I am confident we
have the right team in place to deliver on our strategy.
Group headcount grew by 10 to 102 as at 31 December 2007, of which
83 were permanent employees up from 78 on 31 December 2006. This
increase in headcount can be attributed to the growth in the Consulting
division which has been the primary driver behind our strong sales
growth. Our future growth prospects in the Consulting division are
rooted in our ability to recruit and retain talented individuals with the
appropriate level of skills and experience.
Strategy
Our strategy remains unchanged. The Consulting division now has the
necessary cash flow and processes in place to support the continued
investment in recruiting and training our Consulting personnel. 
In the Software division we will be investing in sales and marketing
activities in 2008 as we seek to establish Integrity, OCA and Arc as
industry leading products.
We continue to see opportunities internationally and as such continue to
look for international partners to accelerate our growth.
Current Trading and Outlook 
The Consulting division has begun 2008 in the same vein as it finished
2007 enjoying strong growth across our client base and our range of
services. We are entering an important phase for the Software division
with the recent launches of Integrity and Arc and the continued
investment in OCA. Levels of interest in the products are high and we
remain confident in their future success. We will be investing in sales and
marketing activities in 2008 as we seek to establish Integrity, OCA and
Arc as industry leading products. 
Although we remain mindful of the broader economic environment, to
date we have not seen any indication of a slowdown requiring us to alter
our positive view of our prospects for the year ahead. If anything, the
current environment has heightened the awareness of control related
issues within the financial service marketplace. 
We have greater visibility on our forward revenues than at any time in
the past and our well diversified client base and assignment portfolio
provides us with a robust revenue stream and gives us confidence in
achieving another successful year.
N D Walder
Chief Executive
28 March 2008
Software Division
The division has had a demanding year as it has sought to manage the
needs of its existing clients whilst at the same time focusing its efforts on
building the Group’s new strategic products. The transitioning of the
business into an annuity revenue model has gained traction with a near
doubling to 40% of 2008’s target now contracted. Going forward we
will be looking to accelerate the growth of this number as we focus on
selling new products on an annuity basis.
The investment in new staff with the necessary skills to design, build,
market and sell our new products, which we began in 2006, carried
forward into 2007. Average headcount employed in the division during
the year rose to 38 from 23 in 2006 as we deliberately ring-fenced our
strategic development activity to ensure the quality of the delivered
product is at its highest. £552,000 of internal development labour costs
were capitalised during the year.
We continue to focus on our three strategic products: 
1. Integrity. The product provides senior management of our client
organisations with transparency and enables greater control over the
balance sheet substantiation process. It provides management with
confidence that the assets and liabilities held on the Company’s
balance sheet are accurately stated. 
2. Operational Control Architecture (OCA). OCA gives senior
management visibility over their business processes identifying and
prioritising any risk areas. The product is currently operational in five
leading banking groups. An updated version with enhanced
functionality will be available in quarter four 2008.
3. Agent Reconciliation & Control (Arc). Arc is the next generation
of our existing product (Network Management). The product
validates agent banks’ invoices against system generated expected
fees and highlights any discrepancies for investigation.
The first quarter of 2008 has seen the focus of the division shift into
sales and marketing, primarily on these three core products. For
example, our ‘Integrity’ product carried out its formal product launch on
25 February. Marketing efforts have been enhanced significantly raising
the awareness of both the Company and our products. These include a
Company event held at the Tower of London on 28 February, where
senior financial managers attended a panel discussion by leading
industry experts on control around the balance sheet substantiation
process. Directors and Advisors

Business Control Solutions Group plc
Annual Report 2007
10
The Directors present their report and the audited financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Principal activities
Business Control Solutions Group plc provides management consultancy
services and operational control software to financial institutions. Our
people have operated at senior levels in global organisations and use this
experience to help our clients fast-track solutions to complex problems.
Our commitment to sustainable delivery has resulted in long-term,
trusted relationships with our clients, who include six of the world’s top
ten banks. 
Business review and future developments
The Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review on pages 4 to 7
contain a review of the Group’s performance during the year and its
likely future development.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The management of the business and the execution of the Company’s
strategy are subject to a number of risks.
Risks are formally reviewed by the Board and appropriate processes put
in place to monitor and mitigate them.
The key business risks affecting the Company are set out below:
Competition
The Group operates in a highly competitive and dynamic market. This
could result in not only downward pressure on our margins but also that
we may not meet all our customers’ expectations. In order to mitigate
this risk, our managers work closely with our clients to fully understand
their existing and future requirements and to ensure that we have the
products and skill sets that meet these requirements.
Products and Services
Although the Group’s software products are not involved in our clients’
transactional business, they do nonetheless provide an active tool in
ensuring their operations are managed effectively and remain under
control. The Group looks to manage the reputational risk of our products
failing to provide ongoing functionality as installed by investing in the
recruitment and retention of highly experienced programmers, effective
Quality Assurance and Delivery teams. 
Some of the Group’s products provide clients with a tool to help them
comply with UK and other national government legislation such as
Sarbanes Oxley, Basle II and MiFID. There is the risk that such products
could fail to ensure compliance in an ever changing and demanding
regulatory environment which in turn would put the products’ longer
term viability at risk and cause associated risk to our reputation. The
Group looks to mitigate this risk by employing managers who are well
versed in the regulatory requirements. In turn, they are supported on the
consultancy side by relevant subject matter experts.
Similarly, the Group offers a range of consultancy services to clients to
assist them in managing projects, introducing cost control programmes,
technological change and high level business consultancy. There is a risk
that the Group could fail to provide the appropriate resources to meet its
clients’ requirements and ultimately fail to meet the pre-determined
project deliverables. The Group looks to mitigate this risk by not only
employing staff who are suitably qualified and experienced but also by
ensuring the contract deliverables are clearly defined, achievable and
agreed between the contracting parties.
Employees
The Group’s staff is vital to the success of our business. If the Group were
to lose key managerial, technical or sales staff then this could have a
serious impact on the business. The Group’s future success depends
largely upon its ability to retain and recruit appropriately qualified staff to
ensure it can meet the requirements of its clients and also to ensure its
products remain at the forefront technologically and functionally. To
mitigate these issues the Group looks to ensure it provides its employees
with a competitive remuneration package and constantly monitors the
market for potential new recruits across all its office locations. The Group
looks to retain the services of its employees through ensuring they
remain motivated by the demands of the Group’s businesses and the
work they carry out as employees. All our employees are regularly
appraised and are encouraged to develop their skills and where
appropriate are promoted in line with their potential.
Intellectual property
The Group’s software business could suffer should third parties infringe
the Group’s intellectual property rights. The Group has taken reasonable
steps to ensure its intellectual property rights are protected by law.
The Group’s management team is experienced in managing the risks
identified above. The Group has a strong balance sheet with significant
cash and trade debtor balances derived from the Group transacting
business with well rated customers and as such does not consider the
Group is subject to undue financial risk.
Dividends
In the light of the retained loss for the year, the Directors do not
recommend the payment of a dividend.

Mitchel Lenson (Resigned 28/9/07) Non-Executive Chairman

during the year. In the opinion of the Directors, continuity of investment
in this area is essential for the maintenance of the Group’s market
position and for its future growth.

2007 comprised the Chairman, two Executive Directors and two Non-
Executive Directors. The Directors’ respective Committee responsibilities
are set out in the table below:
Audit Remuneration
Committee Committee
Steve Russell Non-Executive Chairman Chairman Member
Nigel Walder Chief Executive ——
Roger Shepherd Finance Director ——
Simon Gulliford Non-Executive Director Member Chairman
Sandy Anderson Non-Executive Director ——
The Board has concluded that Steve Russell and Simon Gulliford are
independent of management and free from any business or other
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their
independent judgment.
Simon Gulliford is the Senior Non-Executive Director.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of corporate governance.
Operational control is delegated by the Board to the Executive Directors.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s attention.
The schedule includes activities such as acquisitions and disposals,
material capital expenditure projects and the release of price sensitive
information. The schedule of matters reserved for the Board is reviewed
annually. To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors have
full and timely access to all relevant information and if required all
Directors may take independent professional advice at the expense of
the Group. 13
Corporate Governance
Going concern
Having reviewed the future plans and projections for the business, the
Directors believe that the Group has sufficient resources to continue
operating for the foreseeable future — a period of not less than 12
months from the date of this report. For this reason, they continue to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Auditor independence
The Board has considered the independence of the external Auditors and
has reviewed the work undertaken and fees charged. For details of the
Auditors’ fees charged see note 3 to the financial statements. The Board
receives written confirmation from the Auditors of any relationships they
have which may cause a conflict of interest together with a declaration
from the Auditors that they consider themselves to be independent.
Nominations Committee
Currently there is no Nominations Committee and therefore the Group
does not comply with the Combined Code in this respect. The Group
does not feel given its size, that there is a need for a Nominations
Committee currently but will review the situation periodically. Matters
relating to succession planning, Board appointments, Non-Executive
Director commitments and Board composition are considered by 
the Board.
Performance evaluation
During the year the Chairman carried out a review of each Director’s
performance in their role using feedback given by fellow Directors. The
Senior Independent Director will review the Chairman’s performance in
his role. 
Internal control and risk management
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s system of internal
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Group’s system of internal
control includes operational and compliance controls together with
financial controls. The Board is of the view that there is an ongoing
process in place for identifying evaluating and managing the Group’s
significant risks. There are no significant issues disclosed in the report
and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 and up
to the date of approval of the report and financial statements, that have
required the Board to deal with any material internal control issues.
In line with many companies of its size, the Group does not have an
internal audit function. The Board consider that given the size of the
Group and the active day-to-day management of the Executive Directors,
such a function would not add sufficient value.
Relations with shareholders
The Company values the views of its Shareholders and recognises their
interest in the Company’s strategy and performance. The Chief Executive
and Finance Director hold briefing meetings with institutional
Shareholders and analysts primarily following on from both the interim
and full year results announcements. Feedback from these meetings is
presented to the Board. 
Communication with private Shareholders is carried out through the
annual report, interim announcement, the Company’s website
www.bcsplc.com and the AGM. This year’s AGM will be held on 
5 June 2008. Remuneration Report

Remuneration components
Basic salary
Basic salary is reviewed annually in December with increases taking effect
from 1 January.
Benefits in kind
The Executive Directors receive certain benefits in kind, principally private
medical insurance.
Annual bonus
The Committee establishes the objectives which must be met for each
financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid. The purpose of the bonus is
to reward Executive Directors and other senior employees for achieving
above average performance which also benefits Shareholders.
Share options
Options are granted to the Group’s employees including Executive
Directors. The purpose of the Company’s share option plan is to ensure
option holders are motivated over the medium to long term to drive the
Group forward and, as a consequence, benefit from it.
Pension arrangements
The Group contributed 10% of basic salary towards personal pension
plans for two Executive Directors, N D Walder and M Preen, and 5% for 
R A Shepherd.
Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have contracts
with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one year’s notice. 
In the event of early termination, the Directors’ contracts provide for
compensation up to a maximum of basic salary for the notice period.
Non-Executive Directors
The fees of Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a
whole having regard to the commitment of time required and the level
of fees in similar companies. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to
participate in the Company’s pension scheme.
Non-Executive Directors are employed on renewable fixed term contracts
not exceeding three years.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Combined Code
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the
Regulations). The Regulations require the Company’s Auditors to report
on certain auditable information required to be included in the Directors’
Remuneration Report.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s remuneration policy and setting
Non-Executive fees. The task of determining and monitoring the
remuneration packages of the Executive Directors has been delegated 
to the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for ensuring that the
remuneration packages provided to Executive Directors are appropriate
to individual levels of experience, responsibility and performance, and 
are consistent with those provided by comparable organisations.
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which
comprises the two independent Non-Executive Directors, S Gulliford and
S Russell. S Gulliford is the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The Board (excluding the relevant Non-Executive Directors) determines
the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s policy on remunerating its Directors is to ensure its
remuneration packages should be capable of attracting, rewarding and
retaining Executive Directors whilst ensuring the remuneration packages
are comparable with similar sized organisations.
The remuneration packages of Executive Directors contain performance
related elements linked to both corporate and individual objectives. The
bonus scheme is performance related and is non-pensionable.
Remuneration for Non-Executive Directors is limited to salary only and
share options and has no related performance criteria.
Remuneration for all Directors is to be reviewed annually and is approved
by the Board.
This Remuneration Report is included in the Annual General Meeting
agenda for Shareholder approval. 15

Remuneration Report / Directors’ Responsibilities
Directors’ Responsibilities in the 
preparation of Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
UK Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors
are required to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
EU and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by
the EU to present fairly the financial position and performance of the
Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial
statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial
statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving 
a fair presentation.
The Company financial statements are required by law to give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. 
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the
Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c. for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been
prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the EU; and for the
Company financial statements state whether applicable UK
accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the Company financial
statements;
d prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. Independent Auditors’ Report to the 
Members of Business Control Solutions Group plc
Business Control Solutions Group plc
Annual Report 2007
18
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements
on pages 20 to 48. 
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements
which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group and Parent
Company Balance Sheets, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Group
Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, and the related notes. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, and the
Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union (“EU”), and for preparing the Parent Company financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give
a true and fair view and whether the financial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not
kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Corporate Governance
Statement and the Remuneration Report. We consider the implications
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in 
the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the
state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its loss for
the year then ended;
• the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2007;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the
financial statements.

Consolidated Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRICS, as adopted by the EU, and the Companies Act 1985
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. This is the Group’s first annual reporting period under IFRS. 
The Group’s results were prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“UK GAAP”) for the year ended 31 December
2006. UK GAAP differs from IFRS in a number of areas. In preparing the financial statements the Directors have amended certain accounting and
valuation methods applied in the UK GAAP financial statements. The effect of the transition to IFRS from UK GAAP on the Group’s profit and net
assets is provided in numerical reconciliation statements together with explanatory notes on pages 40 to 42.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except where stated below. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate those of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings as at 31 December 2007. The consolidated
financial statements exclude any intra-group transactions.
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” retrospectively to its business combinations before the date of transition, 
1 January 2006.
Merger accounting
Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited acquired the entire share capital of Business Control Solutions Software Limited (formerly Iorbia Limited)
and The Buttonwood-Tree Group Limited through a transaction under common control, as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations. It is noted that
such transactions are outside the scope of IFRS 3 and there is no other guidance elsewhere in IFRS covering such transactions.
IFRS contain specific guidance to be followed where a transaction falls outside the scope of IFRS. This guidance is included in paragraphs 10–12 of
IAS 8 “Accounting principles, changes in accounting estimates and errors”. This requires, inter alia, that where IFRS does not include guidance for a
particular issue, the Directors may also consider the most recent pronouncements of other standard setting bodies that use a similar conceptual
framework to develop accounting standards.
In this regard, it is noted that the UK Accounting Standards Board has, in issue, an accounting standard covering business combinations (FRS 6). This
standard uses the principle of merger accounting. The Group has adopted the principles of FRS 6 and accounted for the combination of Business
Control Solutions Holdings Limited, Business Control Software Limited and The Buttonwood-Tree Group Limited as a Group reconstruction using the
principles of merger accounting.
Reverse acquisition accounting
In 2005 the Company became the legal parent of Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited and its subsidiary companies in a share for share
transaction. Due to the relative size of the companies, Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited Shareholders became the majority (97%)
Shareholders of the enlarged share capital. Furthermore, the Company’s continuing operations and Executive management were those of Business
Control Solutions Holdings Limited. Accordingly, the substance of the combination was that Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited had acquired
Business Control Solutions Group plc in a reverse acquisition.
Under the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, it would normally be necessary for the Company’s consolidated accounts to follow the legal
form of the business combination. In that case the pre-combination results would be those of the acquired Business Control Solutions Group plc and
Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited would be included only in relation to its performance from 31 May 2005. However, this would portray
the combination as the acquisition of Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited by Business Control Solutions Group plc and would, in the opinion
of the Directors, fail to give a true and fair view of the substance of their business combination. Accordingly, the Directors have adopted reverse
acquisition accounting as the basis for consolidation in order to give a true and fair view.
Under reverse acquisition accounting an adjustment within Shareholders’ funds is required to eliminate the cost of acquisition in the issuing
Company’s books, and introduce a notional cost of acquiring the smaller issuing company based on the fair value of its shares. The resulting
difference has been debited to the capital reserve.
A further adjustment is required to show the share capital of the legal parent in the consolidated balance sheet rather than that of the deemed
acquirer. The resulting adjustment is credited to other reserves.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents amounts receivable net of Value Added Tax, of services provided to external customers during the year.
The Company recognises revenue once evidence of a contract or a purchase order has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or
determinable and collection is reasonably assured. 25
Financials
Software solutions
The Group licenses its software on either a Perpetual Licence Fee or Annual Licence Fee basis. 
Revenues are assigned to each clearly identifiable deliverable within the contract and revenues are then recognised as a percentage of completion of
each of these contracted deliverables. 
Revenues from installation consultancy and training services are chargeable on a time and materials basis and are recognised when the work is
performed. 
Revenue on installed systems maintenance is recognised over the term of the maintenance contract.
Consultancy services
Revenues from contracts for the supply of consulting services are based on a time and materials basis or a fixed price per contract. For fixed price
contracts the Company recognises revenues as amounts become billable under the contract’s terms provided the amounts are not contingent and 
are consistent with the services delivered. 
Segmental reporting
A business segment is a distinguishable component of a Group engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that 
are different from those of other business segments. The Group considers there to be two business segments, Consultancy Services and Software
Solutions. The Group operates in one geographical segment, the UK, based on the location of its customers. 
Intangible assets
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred on product development relating to the design, programming and
testing of new or enhanced products are capitalised as intangible assets after considering: the probability that the development will provide economic
benefits; its commercial and technological feasibility; resource availability; and whether costs can be measured reliably. The expenditure capitalised is
the direct employment costs and is managed and controlled centrally. Other development costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Capitalised product development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Product development costs
capitalised are amortised from the date on which the asset is available for use on a straight-line basis over three years. Development assets are tested
for any impairment to their carrying value on an annual basis.
Purchased software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss. Purchased software is amortised on a straight-line basis
over three years.
At the beginning of the year the Directors reassessed the lives and residual values of ‘Software’. As a result of this reassessment the rate of
depreciation on certain assets has been increased from 25% to 33% straight-line. The impact on the current year has been to increase the
depreciation charge by £16,110.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms. The amount of the provision is the difference
between the asset’s carrying value and the value of the estimated future cash flows. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income
statement within administration expenses.
Share-based payments
The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the
period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The total amount to be expensed over the expected life of the option is
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted. At each balance sheet date the Group revises its estimate of the number of options
that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment 
to equity.
Fair value is measured using the Black–Scholes pricing model and has been adjusted for the estimated effect of non-transferrability, exercise restriction
and behavioural considerations. 
Pension contributions
The Group operates a defined contribution stakeholder pension scheme and contributes towards personal pension contributions for certain
employees. The cost is charged to the income statement as it is incurred. Business Control Solutions Group plc
Annual Report 2007

Consolidated Accounting Policies
Interest income
Interest receivable on interest bearing financial assets is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest
rate used reflects the anticipated cash flows to be received.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Costs in
respect of operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rent-free periods received on entering
into a lease are accounted for over the period of the lease.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor
taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance
sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be
utilised.
Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to
write each asset down to its estimated residual value on straight-line basis over its useful life as follows:
Furniture & Fittings 25% straight-line
Computer Equipment 25% straight-line
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying amount is written
down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying value is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on
disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within ‘Operating Expenses’ in the income
statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less.
Foreign currency translation
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the Group operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling (“£”), which is the Company’s
functional and presentational currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the year end exchange rates of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Employee benefit trusts
The Group has established employee benefit trusts (“EBTs”) which hold shares in the Company. The Group records the assets and liabilities of the
EBTs as its own. Own shares held are measured at cost and are deducted in arriving at Shareholders equity and are included in a separate negative
reserve. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the sale or purchase of such shares, any gain or loss is recognised directly in equity
attributable to the Company’s equity holders. 27

carried forward at full corporation tax rate of 28% amounts to £814,800 (2006: £773,700) and on short-term timing differences amounts to
£119,000 (2006: £70,000). No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses until it is more likely than not that suitable
profits will be generated. 31

9 Loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the Group’s loss after taxation of £399,104 (2006: £684,094) by the weighted average number of
shares in issue less the weighted average number of shares held by the EBTs during the year of 268,328,981 (2006: 225,611,187).
No diluted earnings per share is presented as the effect of the exercise of share options or warrants would be to decrease the loss per share.

The warrant reserve arose from the capitalisation of debt owed by Business Control Solutions Group plc to Thistledown Investments Limited in
2005 in exchange for the issue of warrants. The warrants were deemed to have been issued immediately prior to the reverse acquisition of 
the Company.
The merger reserve arises on the consolidation of Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited’s and the Business Control Solutions Group plc’s
subsidiary undertakings. 35
Financials
19 Group – other reserves continued
The capital and other reserves arise on the reverse acquisition accounting of Business Control Solutions Group plc as described in the
accounting policies and as follows:
The capital reserve represents the elimination of the cost of acquisition by Business Control Solutions Group plc of Business Control Solutions
Holdings Limited amounting to £1,900,000 and introducing a notional cost of £749,851 for the reverse acquisition of Business Control
Solutions Group plc, based on the fair value of the shares of Business Control Solutions Limited.
The other reserve represents the adjustment required to show the share capital of the legal parent within shareholders equity. It is calculated as
the difference between the share capital of Business Control Solutions Holdings Limited of £1,000,000 and the share capital of Business
Control Solutions Group plc (as reduced by the capital reduction) at 31 May 2005.
20 Share options
In addition to those options granted to Directors as detailed in the Directors’ Report, Business Control Solutions Group plc has granted options
over its Ordinary shares to senior Executives as follows:

The options are subject to certain vesting and/or performance criteria and are exercisable on or before the tenth anniversary of their grant.
No options were exercised during the year and the weighted average share price during the period was 4.9p (2006: 9.9p). Options outstanding
at 31 December 2007 are exercisable at prices ranging between 2.62p and 12.75p (2006: 8p and 12.75p) and have a weighted average
remaining contractual life of 9.7 years (2006: 9.25 years). Business Control Solutions Group plc

21 Employee benefit trusts
A number of employees have been granted options over shares in Business Control Solutions Group plc which are subject to defined vesting
schedules, and are only exercisable on the satisfaction of certain conditions. These options have been issued by two employee benefit trusts:
(1) Under the terms of the option agreements issued B2B Systems Trustees Limited is obliged to sell the shares which it holds in Business
Control Solutions Group plc to employees of the Group.
As at 31 December 2007 there were 1,351,513 (2006: 2,165,342) options outstanding over the 1p ordinary shares in Business Control
Solutions Group plc held by the EBT under option to employees. During the year options over 721,821 shares were issued (2006: nil) and
options over 1,535,650 shares were exercised (2006: nil). No options lapsed during the year (2006: 721,821).
All existing options have a zero strike price.
The trust is not obliged to purchase any additional shares to fulfil its obligations and therefore there is no cost to the Group when these

(2) Under the terms of the option agreements, N Walder and his wife are obliged to sell sufficient shares to The Buttonwood-Tree Group
Limited employee benefit trust to meet its obligations under options issued to employees. Any cost associated with the funding of the
employee benefit trust is shown as a separate reserve movement. See note 19.
At 1 January 2007 there were 17,087,350 options in existence. During the year no further options were issued, a total of 2,113,294 were
exercised (2006: 3,362,524) and 5,120,481 options lapsed (2006: 11,706,128).
The total number of options in existence as at 31 December 2007 was 9,853,575. These options have been granted subject to defined
vesting schedules, and are only exercisable on the satisfaction of certain conditions and in certain cases performance criteria.
22 Equity settled share-based payments
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price. Options were granted during the year with exercise prices equivalent to the market value at the
date of grant or with a zero exercise price. The contractual life of all options is ten years. Options become exercisable either at the date of grant
or after two and three years. Options are valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing model.
The fair value of share based payments charged to the Group profit and loss account in the year was £161,723 (2006: £168,011).

25 Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, short-term loans and debtors, including trade receivables, and creditors, including trade
payables, that arise from its operations. The main purpose for these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. There was
no difference between the book value and the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006.
The Group has not entered into any derivative transactions during either period. The Group did not enter into any hedge transactions during
either period. The foreign currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account in either period were immaterial.
Changes in the market interest rates of non-derivative financial instruments with fixed interest rates only affect income if these are measured at
fair value. As such all financial instruments with fixed interest rates that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk as
defined in IFRS 7. Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of non-derivative variable-interest financial
instruments, the interest payments of which are not designated as hedged items of cash flow hedges against interest rate risks. As a
consequence, they are included in the calculation of income related sensitivities.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risks.
Financial assets
The Group has no financial assets, other than the amount of sterling cash at bank earning interest at floating rates linked to base rates.
Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities, other than short-term creditors and accruals at the year end were as follows:
2007 2006
£ £
Due within one year 8,726 5,508 
Due after one year 10,831 20,361 
Total 19,557 25,869 
There was no interest accrued at the year end in respect of financial liabilities (2006: £nil).
Borrowing facilities
The Group has an undrawn committed borrowing facility which is renewed annually. The maximum undrawn facility available (subject to
sufficient qualifying trade debtors) as at 31 December 2007 was £300,000 (2006: £300,000). The facility had not been drawn down on during
the year. Business Control Solutions Group plc

30 Accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and various other factors that are considered to be reasonable, the results for which form the basis of making judgments about
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The
estimates, assumptions and judgments that are likely to contain the greatest degree of uncertainty are summarised below.
Development expenditure
The Group invest in the development of future products and in enhancing its existing products in accordance with the accounting policy. The
assessment as to whether each element of this expenditure will be technically feasible, generate future economic benefit and the period over
which to amortise the expenditure is a matter of judgment.
Revenue
Where revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis management exercises judgment in determining the percentage complete and
the total cost of implementation. Estimates are reviewed continually and are revised based on changes in the facts relating to each contract.
Income taxes
In recognising income tax assets and liabilities estimates have to be made as to the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions
and events whose outcomes are uncertain and on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Useful lives
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are expensed over their estimated useful lives. The period of actual use or economic benefit
may differ from these estimated lives.
Share options
The assumptions used in calculating the charge are disclosed in note 22. Business Control Solutions Group plc

31 Explanation of transition to IFRS
This is the first year the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS. Consistent accounting polices have been applied in preparing
comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2006 and the preparation of the opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2006 (the
Group’s date of transition). 
In preparing its opening balance sheet and comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2006 the Group has adjusted amounts
previously reported in its financial statements prepared in accordance with UK GAAP .
The adjustments arising from the conversion to IFRS had no impact on the cash flows of the Group although there are a number of
presentational changes required under IFRS.
The principal effects of IFRS on the financial statements of the Group are shown below.

Company Accounting Policies
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been produced under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in Financial Reporting Standard 1 (Revised 1996) from the requirements to produce a cash flow
statement on the grounds that it is a subsidiary undertaking where 90 per cent or more of the voting rights are controlled within the Group and is
included in consolidated accounts which are publicly available.
Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated and not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average of tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse,
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-
discounted basis.
Pension contributions
The Company contributes towards personal pension plans for certain employees. The cost of contributions is charged in the profit and loss account as
incurred.
Share-based payments
The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the
period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual
number of share options that vest.
In the Company financial statements, equity settled share-based payments issued to its own employees are recognised in the income statement with
a corresponding increase in equity. Equity settled share-based payments issued to employees of subsidiary undertakings are treated in the financial
statements of the Company as an increase in investment in subsidiary companies, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting
period based on the Group’s estimate of shares which will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black–Scholes option model and has been adjusted for the estimated effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions
and behavioural considerations.  45

1 Please indicate how you wish your votes to be cast on a poll in respect of the resolutions to be proposed at the said meeting. If you do not indicate how you wish
your proxy to use your votes, the proxy will exercise his discretion both as to how he votes and as to whether or not he abstains from voting. Your proxy will have the
authority to vote at his discretion on any amendment or other motion proposed at the meeting, including any motion to adjourn the meeting.
2 If you prefer to appoint some other person or persons as your proxy, strike out the words “the Chairman of the Meeting, or” and insert in the blank space the name
or names preferred and initial the alteration. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. Completion of a form of proxy will not preclude a member from
attending and voting in person.
3 In the case of joint holders, the signature of the holder whose name stands first in the relevant register of members will suffice as the vote of such holder and shall be
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. The names of all joint holders should, however, be shown.
4 If a member is a corporation, this form must be executed either under its common seal or under the hand of an officer or agent duly authorised in writing. In the
case of an individual the proxy must be signed by the appointor or his agent, duly authorised in writing.  
This form of proxy has been sent to you by post.  It may be returned by post or courier or by hand to the Company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars, The Registry,

In each case the proxy appointment must be received not less than 48 hours before the time for the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting together with any
authority (or a notarially certified copy of such authority) under which it is signed.
5 Pursuant to regulation 41 (1) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (2001 No. 3755) the company has specified that only those members registered on
the register of members of the Company at 6 pm on 3 June 2008 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM in respect of the number of Ordinary Shares
registered in their name at that time. Changes to the register of members after 6pm on 3 June 2008 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to

Notes on filling in your form of proxy
1. As a Shareholder of Business Control Solutions Group plc, you have a right to go to, speak at and vote at the Annual General Meeting. If you cannot or do not want
to go to the meeting, but still want to vote you can appoint one or more persons to go to the meeting and speak and vote instead of you. That person is known as a
“proxy”. You can use this form to appoint the Chairman or someone else as your proxy.
2. Your proxy does not have to be a Shareholder of Business Control Solutions Group plc. 
3. If you want to appoint the Chairman as your proxy, insert “Chairman” in the space above. If you want to nominate someone other than the Chairman as your proxy,
give that person’s name in the space above. Your proxy must then go to the meeting to vote on your behalf. However, if you do this and you, or your proxy, do not
go to the meeting, your vote cannot be counted.
4. In the case of joint holders, the vote of the senior Shareholder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, will be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of
the other joint holders. For this purpose, seniority is determined by the order in which the names appear in the register of members in respect of the joint holding.
5. If someone signs this form for you, when you or that person send the form back to us, you or they must enclose the authority under which the form is signed. If you
are appointing the proxy for a company, the form must show the company’s seal or be signed on its behalf by an officer, attorney or other person authorised to sign
for the Company. Where an officer signs this form, the signatory should state his or her office on the form.
6. For the proxy named in this form to act for you, your completed form must be completed and lodged with the Company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars, The Registry,
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU, by 11 a.m. on 3 June 2008 or at least 48 hours before any adjourned meeting. Please do not enclose anything else
with your form (except for the authority mentioned in Note 5 above where appropriate). If your form arrives late, it will not be valid and will not replace any earlier
form of proxy we have received. We cannot accept forms of proxy returned by fax.
7. Entitlement to attend and vote at the meeting or at any adjourned meeting and the number of votes you can cast, will be determined by reference to the
Shareholder register at 6 p.m. on 3 June 2008 or, if the meeting is adjourned, 6 p.m. on the day two days before the date fixed for such an adjourned meeting.
8. If you send a form of proxy, you can still go to the meeting and vote.
9. If we receive more than one form of proxy from the same Shareholder, we will accept the last one.
10. If you make any alterations on this form, you must put your initials next to them. 
11. A Shareholder which is a company may appoint a corporate representative to attend the meeting, speak and vote on its behalf. To do so, the Company must submit
a form of resolution giving the relevant authority to that corporate representative. A corporate representative so appointed has the same powers on behalf of the
company he/she represents as that company would have were it an individual member. BUSINESS REPLY SERVICE

1. TRAINING FOR THE UNVEILING
OF THE 2012 LOGO
In 2005 Freshwater Academy provided
presentation training for Seb Coe and the
winning London 2012 Olympic bid team.
Following this success, Academy was
reappointed in 2007 to provide further
presentation training for the London
Organising Committee of the Olympic and
Paralympic Games when the much talked-
about London 2012 logo was unveiled to the
world.
2. VOICE COACHING TRAINING
FROM ACADEMY
Skadden is the first 'go-to' law firm for
America's biggest corporations according to
The National Law Journal, representing
more Fortune 250 companies than any
other lawyers. Freshwater Academy
developed a coaching programme for one of
their Canary Wharf-based arbitration and
litigation lawyers, including presentation
training and voice coaching. Radio 4
presenter and producer Sara Jones and BBC
radio actress Anna Bentinck led the sessions,
which covered the complex skills needed to
become a confident and articulate presenter
- from structuring key messages to working
on relaxation of the shoulders and neck. The
client was so impressed with the course they
are planning further coaching sessions.
3. LEADING THE WAY FOR NHS
TRAINING IN LONDON 
Freshwater Academy provides a series of
communication training courses for the NHS
Board Leadership Programme, run by The
King's Fund, an independent charitable
foundation working for better health. The
development programme is aimed at chair
people and non-executive directors in the
NHS in London, and since it began in May
2000, all health authorities and NHS trusts in
the London area have been represented at
events. The seminars run by Academy
include An introduction to communication in
the NHS and Understanding leadership in a
political environment. Excellent feedback
from participants and The King's Fund has
led to more seminars being planned.

4. LIQUIDITY SPARKS NATIONAL
DEBATE
Freshwater Midlands was briefed to organise
a business breakfast featuring a major speaker
for business finance house Liquidity. The aim
was to raise the profile of Liquidity and show
the firm as a thought leader. Freshwater
secured Jon Moulton, Chief Executive of one
of the UK's leading private equity firms,
Alchemy Partners LLP, to speak at the
breakfast - who fitted perfectly with Liquidity's
strategy for the event.
The speech created regional and national
interest as Jon Moulton was one of the first
to predict the impact of the 'credit crunch'
on the UK market. Coverage in the Financial
Times and key regional newspapers all
mentioned Liquidity, and led to an interview
on Radio Four's T oday programme. The link
with high profile speakers and accompanying
media interest placed Liquidity ahead of its
larger rivals in the SME market and
effectively supported its direct sales and
introducer-led activity.
5. NEW FRONTIER FOR No5
Already the largest barristers' chambers
outside London, No5 Chambers furthered
its horizons this year when it confirmed a
strategic alliance with Zhonglun W & D LLP ,
one of Asia's fastest growing law firms and
the first and only Chinese law firm to open
an office in London. Freshwater Midlands
was appointed to generate publicity for the
move and help establish the partnership. It
developed a targeted media relations
campaign involving face to face briefings with
key opinion formers in the media. The result
was high quality coverage in the law press and
across UK regional and international titles.

6. HOUSING A DEBATE
To promote the Property Investor &
Homebuyer Show at the Scottish Exhibition
and Conference Centre (SECC), Freshwater
Scotland organised a property trade debate
on the subject 'Why is property still the right
home for your money?'.
The debating panel of industry professionals
included the sales and investment director of
Dandara and the marketing manager of the
Glasgow Solicitor's Property Guide. The
event was chaired by George Kerevan,
associate editor of The Scotsman. 
A steady stream of media coverage in target
property publications and regional
newspapers helped promote the event and
the debate positioned client Homebuyer
Events as experts in the field, promoting
their other property shows around the UK
and raising awareness of them in the industry. 
7. LAUNCHED WITH A SWING
Freshwater Scotland held an event with a
swing when it launched international property
developer Southplace’s new development in
Glasgow, The Plaza. Briefed to host a launch
that would secure reservations and sales,
the Scotland team plumped for a 50s
themed event to celebrate The Plaza’s
1950s heyday, hiring veteran band leader
Harry Margolis and his famous Glen Miller
Band to perform.
The launch, combined with regular news fed
to the press, ensured weekly coverage in the
months leading up to and following the event.
The result was 17 direct sales in the first two
weeks and a very happy client. The team has
now been appointed to organise a similar
event in August 2008.
8. GETTING FRESH WITH
SCOTCAMPUS
The inaugural Scotcampus Freshers Festival
2007 was the very first large-scale
independent event for Glasgow’s student
population organised by Scotcampus
Newspaper – Scotland’s leading student
publication.
Freshwater Scotland delivered a high-impact
PR campaign that secured coverage with key
Glasgow media outlets including the Daily
Record and Metro Clyde 1 FM, Glasgow’s
biggest radio station. Freshwater’s work
dramatically increased awareness of the
event among key audiences including
potential exhibitors, school leavers and fresher
students. It also helped secure exhibitors and
deliver footfall for the event, achieving 10,000
visitors over the two days.

9. CREATING A NEW HEART FOR
BARNSLEY
The site of the former Civic Theatre in
Barnsley is undergoing a transformation to
become a new creative industries quarter at
the heart of the town centre. Our challenge
involved communicating the dramatic
changes taking place inside the building at
the same time as working to maintain its
place in the affections of many of Barnsley’s
residents.
Freshwater Northern and Freshwater
Creative devised an integrated
communications campaign around the
theme ‘DARE to be different’, which was
used in the hoardings around the Civic, in
recruitment advertising and on the website.
A PR campaign fed regular stories to the
region’s media to let people know what was
happening, and included support from
Denise Van Outen, who made one of her
very first public appearances on the Civic’s
stage as a 14 year old.
10. BUSINESS AS USUAL
MESSAGE FOR HOWELLS
One of Howells Solicitors’ Sheffield offices
was so badly hit by the floods in summer
2007 that the entire staff and building
contents had to be relocated. An immediate
priority was to ensure that clients knew as
soon as possible that it was business as usual
for the firm. Freshwater Northern got
started straight away and negotiated a deal
with the local newspaper group to run full
and half page adverts in the weekly and daily
papers and banner ads on the Sheffield
Today website. A newsletter was also
produced in less than a week and distributed
to all clients, and signage was installed to
redirect clients to the firm’s other office.
The campaign achieved a high level of
awareness and reassured clients, meaning it
really was business as usual.

11. SAFEGUARDING CHILDREN
MADE SIMPLE
Sheffield Safeguarding Children Service
wanted to create a way of ensuring that
schools could access vital information about
safeguarding children in an attractive, easily
available and simple-to-update format.
Freshwater Northern began by advising on
how to simplify and amalgamate existing
material to make it easier to use and
understand and drafted new material as
required. Alongside this, Freshwater
Creative developed a Safeguarding Children
brand and produced a whole suite of the
new documents in a format that was user
friendly and easy to update.
12. GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE…
John Francis is Wales’s largest independent
estate agency and has a reputation for selling
quality homes. But one property that came
up for sale this year stood out from the
crowd. Little Marloes Farm sits on its own
peninsula on the Pembrokeshire coast,
jutting out spectacularly into the Irish Sea.
The former farmhouse came with
outbuildings and land, and was up for sale at
auction with a guide price of £275,000.
Freshwater Wales secured the coveted ‘Is it
worth it?’ slot in The Sunday Times, as well
as substantial regional coverage. On the day
of the sale, John Francis had a packed
auction room and bidders on the phone
from London. The bids started at £400,000
and the hammer fell at £764,000 to a
London buyer. The incredible price
exceeded all expectations and earned
Freshwater praise from John Francis for
being “our 19th branch!” Freshwater UK Annual Report 06/07    09

13. MAKING A NOISE FOR LLOYDS
TSB
Lloyds TSB has sponsored the Welsh Proms
for the last two years, with fantastic profile-
raising results throughout the country. For
the 2007 Proms, the company wanted to
extend its support and raise awareness of its
sponsorship with the Welsh communities it
operates in. Freshwater Wales was
appointed to promote In Tune with Wales, a
schools’ music ensemble competition aimed
at secondary schools across the country.
The Wales team devised, managed and
undertook all PR activity and media relations
to correspond with each stage of the
competition. Releases were sent out to the
regional press and broadcast media
operating in the locality of each of the
shortlisted schools, accompanied by creative
photography of pupils practising with their
local Lloyds TSB branch manager. Releases
were tailored to encourage local and
regional media interest and Lloyds TSB was
highlighted as a strong community partner in
the resulting coverage. The campaign
received a return of investment of 5:1, on an
industry average of 3:1, and the contract has
been renewed for the 2008 competition.
14. RECRUITMENT DRIVE
Freshwater Wales has worked with
Castleoak Care Partnerships for a number of
years. The company specialises in the
construction of accommodation for older
people throughout the UK, and in June 2007
Freshwater Wales was specifically tasked to
help boost recruitment in a highly
competitive industry by highlighting
Castleoak’s commitment to its employees’
welfare.
Following a media audit, Freshwater devised
a specific recruitment communications plan
targeting key construction trade titles with
releases covering news from contract wins
to opinion pieces on industry issues.
Working closely with Freshwater Creative
and Freshwater Digital, the team devised a
new recruitment advertising campaign to
attract the very best candidates, and a video
of Castleoaks’ annual staff conference was
produced to highlight its worker-friendly
culture.

15. KEEP SOMERSET LOCAL
Freshwater consultants from the Public
Sector and Southern teams worked closely
with the communications teams from five
Somerset district councils this year in a
successful campaign against the creation of a
unitary authority in the county.
After creating a working group involving all
five councils, Freshwater identified aspects
of the unitary proposal that could be
challenged and generated evidence to show
it could not deliver the promised benefits.
An integrated campaign was then launched –
branded “Keep Somerset Local” – to inform
Somerset residents and other stakeholders
about the proposal and encourage them to
vote in a county-wide poll, using a mix of
media relations, leaflets, posters, events, a
website, petitions and stakeholder lobbying.
200,000 people – almost half the county’s
population – voted, a turnout close to that
expected for a general election, and 82 per
cent said no to the unitary authority.
Communities Secretary Hazel Blears
subsequently rejected the unitary proposal,
citing lack of support from stakeholders and
the general public as a key reason behind her
decision.
16. ON THE ROAD WITH DIGNITY
AT WORK
For the past two years Freshwater Southern
has worked with Dignity at Work, Europe’s
largest anti-bullying in the workplace
initiative, co-funded by Unite the union and
the Department for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform. In March 2007, the team
was briefed to organise 13 seminars across
the country to take the anti-bullying
message to HR professionals, solicitors,
employment law specialists and union
representatives in the UK regions.
Although centrally coordinated by
Freshwater Southern, other regional teams
were involved in staging the events from
Southampton to Glasgow and Norwich to
Belfast. Freshwater was responsible for the
event management of the roadshow, from
compiling delegate databases and sending
invitations to securing media coverage for
each event. The roadshow was a real
success, with well-attended seminars,
including one with over 100 delegates,
excellent participant feedback and a
delighted client. Freshwater UK Annual Report 06/07   11

17. REGIONAL OPENINGS FOR
JOHN LEWIS
With 26 department stores across the
country, John Lewis is one of the UK’s
leading retailers. Freshwater started
working with the partnership in January
2007 to manage the regional media and
stakeholder relations of a nationwide store
opening programme. The team has
successfully completed a PR programme for
a new Cambridge shop, and activity on
Liverpool, Leicester and Cardiff is well
underway. The team draws on a wide range
of Freshwater expertise including consumer
PR, community relations and regional
knowledge. 
The opening in Cambridge was a huge
success with outstanding media coverage in
the run-up to and on the opening day –
including newspapers, radio and television.
Sales and footfall figures have exceeded
expectations, with revenue in the first week
almost double the forecast level.
18. COMMUNICATING TECHNICAL
EXPERTISE
Morgan T echnical Ceramics offers specialist
materials design and product manufacture to
a variety of demanding markets all over the
world. It has established an enviable
reputation for delivering value-added
solutions through world-class engineering,
design and production.
Freshwater Technology worked directly
with applications engineers and product
managers from across the firm’s European
operations to develop a series of
applications-focused articles that were
placed in key trade and technical
publications. Site visits were arranged so
journalists could see the state-of-the-art
manufacturing facilities first hand. 
As a result, the team achieved media
coverage across Europe in the vertical target
sectors of medical, aerospace, lasers and
automotive. 12 Freshwater UK Annual Report 06/07

19. ON TARGET
Freshwater Technology and Freshwater
Wales worked together to increase
awareness of software and services
company Target, which operates in the
consumer credit, general insurance and
financial services market. The teams
positioned Target as a thought leader,
operating responsibly within its community. 
To highlight the in-depth knowledge of
Target’s consultants, Freshwater T echnology
put together a panel of spokespeople, who
were trained to speak to the media. The
team then conducted a sustained campaign
to secure opportunities for by-lined articles
and comment in relevant features. 
The campaign achieved more than 20 pieces
of substantial coverage in Target’s key press,
and a significant change in perception among
key journalists, who are now proactively
approaching Target for contributions.
20. OFF-SHORE V ON-SHORE
DEBATE TO LAUNCH ALPHA 3
In January 2006, Abacus Group plc, one of
the leading distributors of electronic
components in Europe, re-structured its
manufacturing businesses to operate under a
brand new umbrella organisation, Alpha 3
Manufacturing. 
To launch the new brand, Freshwater
Technology identified a news hook around
the current debate in the electronics
industry about the pros and cons of offshore
versus UK-based manufacturing. The team
worked with Alpha 3 senior management to
develop clear messages, and a tailored
training session was provided to help the
Alpha 3 spokespeople deliver effective on-
message interviews.  
A series of one-to-one meetings was
arranged with leading electronics journalists,
supported by creative photography, which
led to good quality coverage in leading
electronics titles, including the front page of
Electronics Weekly. Freshwater UK Annual Report 06/07   13

21. HEALTHCARE MANAGE
HOSPITAL SUPERBUG CRISIS
The report of an outbreak of a new virulent
form of Clostridium Difficile Infection (CDI)
responsible for the deaths of 12 patients at
Stoke Mandeville Hospital attracted
widespread media interest and prompted
the then Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt to
call for an external inquiry by the Healthcare
Commission.  
Freshwater Healthcare was called in to help
the hospital prepare for publication of the
highly critical inquiry findings and manage
local and national media on the day of
publication. By highlighting vastly improved
infection control measures and significant
reductions in infection rates, Freshwater
Healthcare was able to restrict the negative
publicity to a 24-hour news cycle. This was
despite the fact that the Healthcare
Commission inquiry found that 334 patients
had acquired CDI while in hospital and 33
had died from the infection.
22. CHANGING OPINIONS FOR
NHS HERTFORDSHIRE
The Healthcare team was appointed by the
NHS in Hertfordshire to help explain
proposals for controversial local changes to
health services. Although senior doctors and
nurses support the proposed changes, the
public was concerned about the closure of
much loved local hospitals and what would
replace them, a concern which was
reflected in the local media and through a
high profile ‘Hospital SOS’ campaign. 
Freshwater Healthcare worked with in-
house communication teams to develop a
highly targeted media campaign delivered
over four months and aimed at countering
negative coverage and ensuring local people
understood the proposed changes and the
reasons for them. The campaign resulted in
some very positive coverage emphasising
that doctors and nurses were 100 per cent
behind the proposals. This helped reassure
local people, and the proposed changes to
local health services have since been
approved by Hertfordshire County
Council’s Health Overview and Scrutiny
Committee. 14 Freshwater UK Annual Report 06/07

23. MORPHY RICHARDS GETS
BALLS
In 2007, Morphy Richards created a new
range of irons and hair appliances to support
Everyman, the male cancer charity.
Attenborough Saffron came up with a multi-
faceted creative campaign to gain maximum
coverage for the range. The press office
function was launched with a quirky
postcard sent to target media, and followed
up with a stunning visual of the Cerne Giant
holding a Morphy Richards iron, to link the
product with Everyman’s mission. 
A central part of the campaign was the Male
Grooming Guide, a glossy 48 page guide of
top grooming tips, designed by Freshwater
Creative and written by Attenborough
Saffron. The guide included tips to help you
turn from ‘Cave Man’ to ‘Metrosexual’ and
was placed in 1,250 goody bags for shoe
retailer Office’s Student Lock In. This,
coupled with a three month sponsorship of
the grooming pages in lad’s mag Front,
ensured the key youth market was reached.
The campaign achieved 78 press cuttings,
reached 14,614,621 people and had a PR
value of £266,871, with more cuttings
expected.
24. SEARCH FOR A STAR WITH
QVC
QVC, the UK’s leading TV shopping channel,
works with Attenborough Saffron’s specialist
fashion and beauty consultants.  The team
devised a campaign to promote ‘QVC
Presenter Search’, a national competition to
find a new member to join the channel’s
team of professional presenters. The event,
a mix between X Factor and The
Apprentice, would provide the winner with
a one-year contract to present on QVC.
Attenborough Saffron secured The Sunday
Mirror magazine, Celebs on Sunday, to be
the event’s media partner, and secured
national and regional media exposure for the
auditions, celebrity judges, finalists and the
winner. The national event generated 90
pieces of editorial coverage, with OTS
figures of over 100 million. Highlights
included extensive publicity in the Sunday
Mirror, Independent, Guardian and BBC TV
News Scotland. The finalist TV show on
QVC achieved some of the highest viewing
figures for the channel during 2007 and
created a real buzz around the brand. Freshwater UK Annual Report 06/07   15

25. BEN FOGLE BRAVES THE
ELEMENTS FOR NATURE VALLEY
VODCAST
T o promote General Mills’ granola bar brand
Nature Valley, Attenborough Saffron created
a campaign linking the brand with the great
outdoors. A theme was launched to target
the walkers’ market – an audience looking
for a high energy boost when out and about.
Attenborough Saffron appointed outdoor-
loving television presenter Ben Fogle as the
brand’s spokesperson, and devised a raft of
promotional activity around the theme. 
This included a video of Ben guiding viewers
around his favourite walk, from Peak Cavern
to Mam T or in the Peak District, which was
filmed, edited and produced by Freshwater
Digital and available on the Nature Valley
website. As well as the vodcast, the
campaign for Nature Valley included a
syndicated radio feature with Ben for local
radio and a Guide to 50 Things to do
Outdoors, published in The Sunday
Telegraph.
26. ITALIAN STYLE HITS THE
FINCHLEY ROAD
Freshwater Consumer and Attenborough
Saffron were appointed to create an event to
launch premium Italian furniture brand
Natuzzi’s flagship store on Finchley Road.
The team was tasked to create excitement
around the brand and raise the profile of
Pasquale Natuzzi, the brand's founder and
chief designer.
Prior to the event, Italian male models were
hired to drive Natuzzi-branded scooters
around London and an exclusive press
breakfast was held for key magazine editors,
hosted by Pasquale Natuzzi. The launch
party was attended by 250 guests including
journalists, opinion formers, potential
customers, local community leaders and
trade partners. The evening included a
charity auction of one-off dresses in Natuzzi
fabrics, designed by London Fashion Week
Young Designer of the Year and modelled by
Take 2 Models, in aid of The Children's
Society.  
The event was such a success that the client
decided to recreate a smaller-scale version
for its new Dublin store, and the London
event is now being used as a blueprint for
best practice at every store opening globally. Chairman’s statement

27. THE ULTIMATE LAMB
SANDWICH
Attenborough Saffron has worked with New
Zealand lamb since 1996 to provide annual
campaigns that reflect the seasonal
availability of the meat and react to the
diminishing interest in traditional cookery of
the British public. A creative campaign was
used to launch the first ever downloadable
recipe for the iPod generation. Celebrity
New Zealand chef Peter Gordon was
appointed to demonstrate the creation of
the ‘Ultimate Lamb Sam’, available on the
website and to download for the video iPod.
National newspaper coverage was achieved
in You Magazine, The Sunday Telegraph,
Daily Express on Sunday and Daily Star on
Sunday. According to Meat New Zealand,
demand for lamb legs has grown in both
retail and the catering trade over the past
three years.
28. NEW BRAND FEEL FOR
SCOTTISH & SOUTHERN ENERGY
The utilities company needed a new
marketing identity to appeal to its mid
market and major business customers,
ranging from regional businesses to FTSE
100 firms. After an analysis of the existing
material, Freshwater Creative developed a
new core design and brand feel, working
with the existing logo and brand colours. A
vibrant theme was conceived that would
reflect the work Scottish & Southern does
and appeal to a diverse target market.
Working with Freshwater Wales, the
brochures were completely rewritten and
the design team also came up with creative
ideas for adverts, corporate stationery,
newsletters brochures and exhibition
material.

29. AWARD-WINNING WEBSITE
FOR MEADGATE
Freshwater Creative and Freshwater Wales
have worked with Meadgate Homes for
several years on the full range of its
marketing activity, from brochures and
branding for each development to media
relations to help drive sales. Following the
appointment of a new sales & marketing
director, Meadgate wanted a major overhaul
of its website as part of a campaign to
revamp the company’s entire marketing
strategy. 
An audit of the existing Meadgate website by
Freshwater found that it was difficult to
navigate and hard to find important
information. The team advised that a simple
approach would make it easier for potential
homebuyers to find what they were looking
for and better promote the range and quality
of Meadgate’s houses. Freshwater Wales
drafted new copy and Freshwater Creative
redesigned the entire site. The result was an
eye-catching and uncluttered look that gives
a taste of the lifestyle a Meadgate home
offers and focuses on the most important
factor to consider when buying a home –
location. The website also won a silver in the
Best Website category at the CIPR Cymru
New Pride Awards.
30. A NATIONAL CONTRACT
AWARDED BY THE
ENVIRONMENT AGENCY
The Environment Agency has been working
with Freshwater’s media buying division for
the last eight years, gaining preferential rates
and placing legal and public notices in the
press in Wales and other regions. In 2007,
Freshwater was appointed to handle the
UK-wide media buying for The Environment
Agency’s rod and line fishing licence duties
for 2008 to 2011. Freshwater Creative’s
media buying experts placed adverts in
publications ranging from The Cornishman
to The Sun, allowing The Environment
Agency to communicate with its widespread
and varied audiences.

Chairman’s Statement &
Chief Executive’s Review Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to present to shareholders our first annual report and accounts as an AIM
listed company.  
The Group has delivered another outstanding set of financial results, with operating profit
growing by 114 per cent as a result of a combination of acquisitions, organic growth and
efficiency improvements. 2006-07 was our seventh consecutive year of profitable growth
since incorporation.
Our strategy of building a focused and integrated group under a single brand through
selected acquisitions and organic growth continues to pay off. The results reflect both
earnings-enhancing additions to our operations and the benefits of cross-selling, combined
selling and efficiency gains from integration. Above all, they reflect the continued success
of our entrepreneurial approach to meeting the needs of our markets.
Results
T urnover for the year was £6.54 million (2006: £4.12 million), an increase of 59 per cent
over the prior year as a result of organic growth of 7.7 per cent, a full year’s trading from
the four businesses acquired in 2005/06 and six months contribution from Attenborough
Saffron acquired in February 2007. Revenue (gross profit) increased by 65 per cent to
£4.66 million (2006: £2.82 million). Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation were £1.14 million (2006: £0.58 million). Operating profit margins as a
percentage of revenue increased to 21.8 per cent (2006: 16.9 per cent). Profit before
taxation increased by 111 per cent to £0.92 million (2006: £0.44 million).
Basic earnings per share were 9.66p (2006: 6.10p), an increase of 58 per cent and fully
diluted earnings per share rose by 55 per cent to 9.48p (2006: 6.10p). 
We continue to see strong cash generation by the Group, with net cash flow from
operating activities of £0.81m in the year (2006: £0.60m). This coupled with our other
available funds, makes us well placed to finance growth going forward.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.5145p taking the total to 2.98p for the
year, an increase of 22 per cent on the prior year. This is in line with our progressive
dividend policy, and the dividend was covered 2.5 times by earnings. The dividend will be
paid on 10 January 2008 to shareholders on the register on 14 December 2007. 
Financing
On behalf of the Board, I would like to welcome the new investors who showed
confidence in Freshwater’s strategy by supporting the placing which raised £4m before
expenses as part of the Group’s admission to AIM on 16 July 2007. I would also like to
thank those who invested in our final fund-raising as a private company, which raised
£0.44m in January-February 2007 taking the total equity investment prior to joining AIM
to £2.2m.
On top of the aggregate £6.2m in equity investment, we have also negotiated a £2.2m
banking facility with Royal Bank of Scotland.

Board and Employees
I took over the chair midway through the year from David Howell, who held the post for
three years and helped steer the Group through a period of very rapid growth, including
seven acquisitions.  David continues on the Board as a non-executive director. 
Ken Tilley, our vice chairman and also a non-executive director, intends to step down from
the Board at the Annual General Meeting on 24 January 2008. The Board would like 
to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to him for his contribution over 
the last five years.  He will continue to be involved as Company Secretary with effect from
the AGM.  
Baroness Cohen of Pimlico, also a non-executive director of the London Stock Exchange
plc, was appointed to the Board on 1 June 2007 and now chairs our Audit Committee. 
Following the acquisition of Leeds-based Lynx Public Relations on 1 November 2007 and
of Waterfront Public Affairs and the Waterfront Conference Company on 2 December
2007, the Group now employs 118 people all of whom are contributing to the
implementation of our strategy.  
The Board is committed to ensuring they share in the Group’s success through our
progressive approach to rewards including share options, bonuses, pensions and salaries.
Outlook
Since 31 August 2007, we have been trading in line with expectations, and the two latest
acquisitions - Lynx and Waterfront - have added further regional and specialist strength to
the Group.
While we are aware of the potential threats to global economic growth, we are still
experiencing robust market conditions  and  we have an excellent spread in terms of both
business offering and client base, making the Group resilient to the impact of any slow
downs that may occur in the economy. As a result, we are confident of the prospects of
the Group and of making further progress in the year to 31 August 2008.

Chairman’s statement Chief Executive’s Review
Freshwater UK made considerable progress in 2006-07 towards its goal of building a
substantial PR-led marketing group combining a regional network with specialist and
sectoral expertise.
During the year, the Group transformed itself into a public company and secured
admission to AIM in July 2007 through a placing that raised £4m before expenses to fund
further growth.  
The year also saw a very strong trading performance with turnover rising 59 per cent to
£6.54m, revenue (gross profit) rising 65 per cent to £4.66m and operating profit rising 114
per cent to £1.02m.
The large increases in turnover and revenue were achieved by a combination of:
� Organic growth of 7.7 per cent in the businesses that were in the Group at the start of
the previous financial year (2005-06)
� A full-year’s trading from the four businesses acquired in 2005-06, all of which were
successfully integrated under the Freshwater brand during 2006-07
� A contribution of six months’ trading from Attenborough Saffron, a leading London-
based consumer agency
At the same time, the Group has delivered increases in profit margins, taking them to
among the best in the PR industry.  As a percentage of revenue, operating profit grew from
16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent and EBITDA grew from 20.7 per cent in 2005-06 
to 24.6 per cent in 2006-07, ahead of our key performance indicator (KPI) target of 
23 per cent.  
This outstanding profit performance was underpinned by higher productivity, with average
revenue per full time employee rising 16 per cent from £61,373 to £70,963 and EBITDA
per full time employee rising 38 per cent from £12,681 to £17,443.
Strategy
Freshwater is now beginning to reap the benefits of its strategy of creating an integrated
Group, trading under one brand and offering a single point of contact for regional and
specialist PR and marketing services.  
Our model provides considerable scope for growth through cross-selling to existing
clients, economies of scale in our own marketing activity and the ‘combined’ selling of
diverse services and expertise to new clients.  We have also kept overheads low by basing
two-thirds of our staff outside London and centralising back office and Group functions 
in Cardiff.
The Group’s aim is to become Britain’s leading regional and specialist PR network through
organic growth and earnings-enhancing acquisitions.
We already have strong operations in Wales, Scotland and the English regions and
substantial specialist expertise in technology, healthcare, education, consumer, property,
leisure, retail, utilities and the public sector. Our PR and communications offering is
enhanced by teams offering creative, digital and training services.  
The market for agency PR services in the UK was estimated to be worth more than £1.2bn
in 2005 (Chartered Institute of Public Relations) and has seen sustained and substantial
growth every year since 2003. We believe that PR will continue to play a growing role as
media and communication channels become more diverse and technology changes make
them more accessible. PR is less vulnerable to cyclical factors than conventional advertising
and other marketing services, and the Freshwater business model, with its diverse client
base across many regions and sectors, is particularly robust.

Acquisitions
The acquisition of Attenborough Saffron on 28 February 2007, which had a turnover in the
11 months prior to completion of £2.1m, was our largest to date and puts Freshwater
among the market leaders in consumer PR.
Our policy is to acquire well-run businesses with a history of profitable trading led by
principals who share the Group’s vision and want to participate in implementing our
strategy. We are continuing to look at a variety of acquisition options that fit our strategy
in one or more of the following ways:
� Expansion into new regions and greater market share in regions where Freshwater
already has a strong presence
� The addition of new specialisms and sectors
� Expansion of existing specialisms to achieve market leading positions
� New marketing services that enhance and complement the PR offering
Our formula for acquisitions is financially prudent and minimises risk while incentivising
performance.
Freshwater’s strategy also provides for incremental and gradual expansion into overseas
markets, both organically and through acquisitions and joint ventures that fit our strategy
and deliver synergies with existing operations.   
On 1 November 2007, we acquired Lynx Public Relations in Leeds, which adds regional
strength in the north of England and specialist expertise in the utility sector and the
growing field of community relations. Its clients include; National Grid, Halifax [a division
of HBOS], Northern Electric Distribution Limited, Yorkshire Electricity Distribution and
York-based Beacon, the purchasing arm of Best Western Hotels and the UK’s largest
purchasing consortium for the independent hospitality industry. 
The total maximum consideration of the acquisition will be £1.25m. This comprises an
initial consideration of £0.45m, which is satisfied by £0.35m in cash and by the issue of new
Freshwater shares. In addition, a maximum payment of £0.15m will be made for the net
assets of Lynx at completion and a further deferred consideration of a maximum of £0.65m
will be made dependent on the profit performance of Lynx in the 12 months following
completion.
On 2 December 2007, we acquired the Waterfront Partnership and the Waterfront
Conference Company in London and Brussels. Waterfront will contribute public affairs
expertise to the Group, particularly in the transport sector, and a well-established
conference business with experience of organising up to 40 events annually at venues
across Britain.  Waterfront’s clients include the Association of T rain Operating Companies,
Civil Aviation Authority, Go Skills, Mersey T ravel, D P World, Port of London Authority,
UK Major Ports Group, Macquarie, GNER and Bristol Port Company. 
The combined businesses, which had unaudited turnover of £2.07m and net profit before
tax of £0.29m in the year to 31 March 2007, were acquired for a total maximum
consideration of £2.245m. This comprises an initial consideration of £0.945m, which is
satisfied by £0.72m in cash and the issue of new Freshwater shares. The additional
deferred consideration will be subject to the profit performance of the two businesses in
the 15 months following completion.

Clients 
Freshwater’s client roster grew from 239 in 2005-06 to 329 in 2006-07, with none
accounting for more than 3.5 per cent of revenue.
Major brands using our services include John Lewis, Lloyds TSB Insurance, Ryder Cup
Europe, Specsavers, Bellway, RBS, Morphy Richards, Waterford Wedgwood, Scottish &
Southern Energy, General Mills, Nivea Beauté, QVC and Edwards (formerly part of the
BOC group).
Public sector clients include the Environment Agency, London School of Economics,
Sheffield Hallam University, University of Birmingham, the Food Standards Agency, several
NHS regions and trusts, and the Welsh Assembly Government. 
Cross selling and combined selling is reflected in the fact that we provided more than one
service to 90 clients, including 18 of the top 20. We believe that the potential 
for broadening our partnerships with clients through meeting more of their marketing 
and communication needs is very significant, providing real potential for further growth
in revenues.
In 2006-07, we won a national award at the Chartered Institute of Public Relations’
President’s Grand Prix, for ‘Putting Newport on the Map', a campaign on behalf of
regeneration company Newport Unlimited.  The Midlands and Wales PR teams also won
one silver and three gold awards at the CIPR’s regional PRide awards, including the Grand
Prix for best overall campaign in Wales. 
Management
The Group has an integrated management team, many of whom benefit from a broad
business experience. Senior managers from each division meet with the executive
directors and group managers on a regular basis to discuss strategy, operational issues and
marketing and new business.
The Group team is responsible for finance and accounts, IT , human resources, corporate
communications, acquisitions and group marketing.  The Group also plays a co-ordinating
role on new business, particularly in relation to cross-selling and the ‘combined’ selling of
regional and specialist services.
All staff are incentivised through bonus schemes and share options.  In addition, a number
of senior managers hold shares by virtue of having been principals of acquired businesses
and some have also purchased shares.  
The Board and management are committed to building shareholder value. In 2006-07
basic earnings per share increased 58 per cent from 6.10p to 9.66p.
Outlook
Our markets remain buoyant and our strategy of offering an integrated PR and marketing
service across all our offices has helped win new business and increase the range of client
needs we can meet. 
Our strong cash position also means we are well placed to make further acquisitions in line
with the Group’s strategy outlined above.  
T rading in the first quarter of 2007-08 is in line with expectations and we expect to deliver
another progressive trading performance in the current financial year.

review Operational review 
Introduction
Freshwater made considerable progress during the year to 31 August 2007 in
implementing its strategy operationally, particularly in integrating the business behind a
single brand and positioning itself nationally as a provider of combined regional and
specialist services.
The businesses acquired in 2005-06 were all successfully brought under the Freshwater
name in the first half of 2006-07 and a co-ordinated new business drive scored several
successes at Group level. These included substantial contracts to handle the John Lewis
store opening programme and a nationwide roadshow for Dignity at Work, Europe’s
largest anti-bullying in the workplace initiative, co-funded by Unite the union and the
Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform.
The Group has ten fee-earning teams functioning as separate profit centres: five regions
(Midlands, Northern, Scotland, Southern and Wales), three specialist PR teams
(Healthcare, Consumer and Technology) and two teams providing support services
(Creative and Academy).   
During the year, the total number of staff increased from 62 to 90, based in eight offices.
With the acquisition of Lynx and Waterfront since the end of the year, we now have 118
staff in 10 offices.
The Group continued to develop its human resources policies, with a strong focus on
incentives, training, team building and career development. We have experienced
recruitment problems in some specialisms, but these have been largely offset by the
development of existing staff and the success of our expanded and enhanced graduate
training scheme for which we had an abundance of applicants in 2007.    
The Group provided services to a total of 329 clients in 2006-07 drawn from a wide range
of sectors. The largest sectors by income were consumer and retail (29 per cent),
public sector (27 per cent), housing and property (15 per cent), professional services 
(12 per cent), and technology and industry (9 per cent).

Regional network
Freshwater’s five regions - Wales, Scotland, Midlands, Northern and Southern - employ 30
staff, mostly CIPR qualified fee earners, based in six offices. In aggregate, our regional
operations grew organically in the year by 5.5 per cent on a like-for-like basis to produce
combined revenue (GP) of £1.86m. The regional teams have their own portfolios of
clients, while also offering a single network to provide a seamless service to organisations
needing support in several regions at the same time.
The Birmingham-based Midlands team has significant specialist expertise in property and
professional services, as well as clients in automotive, education, health, manufacturing,
retail and utilities. The consultancy had a good second half after winning several major new
accounts, including Midland Heart, one of the UK’s leading housing associations, and
Castlemore Securities. At the very end of the year, the team won a competitive pitch,
jointly with Freshwater Creative, to provide full service marketing support for Ironstone,
a major new development near T elford by a consortium of the three largest house builders
in the UK.
The Northern region had a very successful first full year in the group winning major
contracts to promote the Barnsley Civic and South Yorkshire Open Forum jointly with
Freshwater Creative, as well as a number of new contracts with existing clients such as
Sheffield Hallam University and Sheffield City Council. It is also taking the lead role in work
for John Lewis relating to the Liverpool, Sheffield and Leicester store openings.  The
acquisition of Lynx Public Relations in Leeds and the planned opening of an office in
Liverpool will make the Northern region a focal point for growth in the Group in 
2007-08.    
Operating from Bristol and London, the Southern team scored a major success in being
awarded a contract to deliver, with support from the whole regional network, a UK-wide
roadshow for Dignity at Work. The team acts as the overall co-ordinator for the John
Lewis’s store opening programme across the country, as well as leading on the opening of
the Cambridge store. Freshwater Southern also successfully provided PR services in
connection with the opening in July of Puxton Park, a new multi-million pound farm-based
leisure attraction near Bristol.
The Group opened a new 2,000sq ft office at Skypark in the centre of Glasgow in May
2007 replacing the Scotland team’s two existing offices in Edinburgh and at Bearsden just
outside Glasgow. The team is a market leader in housing and property PR and has also
begun to diversify by gaining clients in retail, leisure and professional services.
Wales, Freshwater’s original business based in Cardiff, continues to be one of the most
successful and profitable divisions in the group. The region’s client base is very diverse,
including SMEs, professional firms, public sector bodies, retailers and housebuilders.
Among the additions to the portfolio in the year were Lloyds TSB, North East Wales
Institute in Wrexham and Visit Wales.

Specialist PR teams
The three specialist businesses (Consumer, Technology and Healthcare) delivered total
revenue of £2.26m in the year.  This comprises the first full year of trading from the three
acquisitions made in 2005-06 and a half year contribution from Attenborough Saffron.  
The teams employ a total of 36 staff and operate from offices in London and Romsey, 
near Southampton.
Consumer - The acquisition of Attenborough Saffron places Freshwater among the 
top ten agencies in consumer PR.  Attenborough Saffron is one of the oldest and best
known agencies in this sector and has a host of household names on its client roster,
including Nivea Beauté, New Zealand Lamb, Natuzzi, Waterford Wedgwood, Roberts
Radio and Jane Shilton. The acquisition of Attenborough Saffron gave the Group an
opportunity to concentrate London based consumer services under one roof.
Technology - The Technology team provides specialist PR consultancy in engineering,
electronics and IT . Formerly Black & White Communications, the business was successfully
integrated into the Freshwater brand this year. Its solid client base features long-standing
client relationships from manufacturing to software and high-tech spin-outs.  The client list
includes established international brands such as Emerson Process Management, Penny +
Giles and Morgan Advanced Ceramics, as well as emerging players Perpetuum, SPI Lasers
and iMeta.
Healthcare - A market leader in communication consultancy to clients in the public
healthcare sector, this division - formerly part of CLEAR, which was acquired on 1 June
2006 - specialises in public consultations about changes in healthcare services and issues
management.  Major projects in 2006-07 included work for the NHS in Hertfordshire, East
Sussex, Warwickshire, Bath, and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. This last project has been
shortlisted for the prestigious “Involvement to Impact” awards run by the NHS Centre for
Involvement. The team also won its first client for a new media analysis service it hopes to
roll out across the NHS.

Marketing support services
Freshwater is developing a portfolio of support services to complement its core 
PR business.  We currently offer a wide range of communications and marketing training, 
a full graphic design service, media buying and extensive expertise in digital media,
including podcasts, videos, DVDs, websites and e newsletters.  The services are grouped
into two divisions - Freshwater Academy and Freshwater Creative - which had a
combined income of £0.49m in the year to 31 August 2007.  
Freshwater Academy - Acquired as part of CLEAR, the training division was rebranded
during 2006-07 and sold across the Group using new marketing materials. This resulted in
training being sold to the clients of several other divisions, such as Morphy Richards, QVC
and Nord Anglia. Meanwhile, Academy continued to build its own client base, winning
contracts to deliver courses for the NHS Board Leadership Programme (a development
programme for chairs and non-executive directors in the NHS in London), the London
Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and NHS South West (the
strategic health authority covering the south west of England).  The latter was Academy’s
largest contract to date and involved providing comprehensive communication training for
approximately 70 senior NHS managers in the region.  In 2007-08, Academy will seek to
begin to regionalise its offering by locating part of its operation in Bristol.
Freshwater Creative - The team has enjoyed its most successful year to date, with
cross-selling to existing clients and combined selling with the PR teams playing a crucial
role in achieving a 39 per cent uplift in revenue. Major new business wins in the year
include Morphy Richards, Scottish & Southern Energy, Barnsley Metropolitan Council and
complete rebranding for the Golf Club Managers’ Association. The team offers media
buying and graphic design services, including a wide range of digital services such as
websites and e-newsletters.

Board of Directors
Freshwater UK Annual Report 06/07    31 The Directors present their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2007.
Principal activities 
Freshwater Group ('the Group') comprises Freshwater UK Plc (the ‘Company') and its subsidiary undertakings. A list of the Company’s
subsidiaries is provided in note 12 to the financial statements. At the start of the year, the Company transferred its remaining public relations
and marketing related trading activities to Freshwater Creative Limited, Freshwater Southern Limited and Freshwater Wales Limited. 
The Company has subsequently operated as a holding company. The primary activity of all other Group members during the year was the
provision of public relations and marketing services. 
Business review 
A review of the Group’s business including likely future developments therein is to be found in the Chief Executive’s Review and the
Operational Review. Financial and, where appropriate, other key performance indicators ('KPI') have been used to facilitate the understanding
of the development, performance and position of the Group’s business. The principal risks faced by the Group can be categorised as follows:
Economic
We are a UK based organisation, and a general economic downturn in the UK could have an adverse affect on our revenue. T o mitigate this
risk, we offer a broad range of services to a wide range of sectors so that we are not overly dependent in any one area.
Client Loss
During the financial year we billed 329 clients, with none accounting for more than 3.5% of our total revenue. Our client relationships are
fundamental to us, so we would always seek to replace them, but our wide base significantly de-risks the impact of any individual loss.
Staff Loss
As a people based business our staff play a critical role in our client offering, and the loss of key staff could be a risk to client relationships.
T o offset this risk, we have developed a team based approach to client service, so that no one member of staff is the sole point of contact
with any given client. We also look to retain all staff with a share option scheme, and we also ensure all staff are covered by employment
contracts with appropriate levels of lock-ins and restrictive covenants.
Results and dividends
The Group’s results are on page 39. The Directors propose the payment of a final ordinary dividend of 1.5145p (2006:1.4p) per qualifying
share to qualifying shareholders on the register on the dividend record date. With the interim dividend of 1.4655p per qualifying share
(2006:1.05p) paid during the financial year this will produce a total ordinary dividend of 2.98p per qualifying share. The provided figures
reflect the effects of the 2:1 split in June 2007 under which each authorised and allotted 20p ordinary share was subdivided into two 10p
ordinary shares. See note 22 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not reflect the final proposed dividend which will be
accounted for in shareholder’s equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending 31 August 2008. 
Post balance sheet events 
On 1 November 2007, the Company acquired Lynx Public Relations Limited. On 2 December 2007, the Company acquired both the
Waterfront Conference Company Limited and the business of the Waterfront Partnership. Note 27 to the financial statements provides
information on these transactions which are considered material non-adjusting events.

Creditor payment policy
The Group agrees payment terms with its suppliers when it enters into binding purchase contracts. The Group seeks to abide by the payment
terms agreed with suppliers whenever it is satisfied that the supplier has provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms
and conditions. The Group seeks to treat all of its suppliers fairly. At the end of the financial year creditor days (defined as (trade payables /
cost of sales) / 365) were 68 days (2006: 82 days).
Political and charitable donations
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £1,000 (2006: £1,000). The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000
(the 'Act') requires disclosure of any donations to an EU political organisation (including a registered political party in the UK) or EU political
expenditure in excess of £200. The terms 'donation', 'EU political organisation' and 'EU political expenditure' are given broad definitions by
the Act.  Whilst the Group does not make donations to political parties within the normal meaning of that expression, as part of its normal
work on behalf of clients and as part of its own marketing, the Group needs to attend or sponsor events which are organised by political
parties or other political organisations for which a charge is made. During the year, the Group made a payment for an attendance cost that
fell within the definition of political donation introduced by the Act totalling £5,000 to the Labour Party. 
Financial instruments
A commentary on the financial instruments held by the Group and the Group's exposure to credit, interest rate and liquidity risk is provided
in note 15 to the financial statements.
Corporate governance
The Company is not required to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in July 2003 by the Financial Reporting
Council ('the 2003 FRC Combined Code') and accordingly does not report on how it has applied the principles therein or on the extent to
which it has complied with the provisions therein throughout the period. The Company's Directors are however committed to ensuring a
high standard of corporate governance that reflects the recommendations of the 2003 FRC Combined Code in a manner proportionate to
the Group's size. An insight into the Company's current corporate governance practice is provided below.

Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors, at the time of approving the financial statements, have determined that there is reasonable expectation
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors
have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors 
As far as the Directors are aware there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditors are unaware and they have taken
all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish
that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.
The auditors, PKF (UK) LLP , have indicated their willingness to continue in office, and a resolution that they be re-appointed will be proposed
at the Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ report 
for the year ended 31 August 2007 (continued) Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Freshwater UK Annual Report 06/07   37
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected 
to prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial statements are required to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group and of the profit or loss
of the group for that period. In preparing these financial statements the directors are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
� make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
� prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the company and the group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements and other information included in
annual reports may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
for the year ended 31 August 2007 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Freshwater UK Plc
38 Freshwater UK Annual Report 06/07   
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements ('the financial statements') of Freshwater UK Plc for the year ended 
31 August 2007 which comprise the consolidated income statement and the consolidated and company balance sheets, cash flow statements,
statements of changes in equity and the related notes. The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out
therein.
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors' report
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of directors' responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the directors' report is consistent with
the financial statements. The information in the directors' report includes that specific information presented in the Chief Executive’s Review
and Operational Review that is cross referenced from the business review section of the directors' report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. 
The other information comprises only the Financial and Business Highlights, the case studies, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s
Review, the Operational Review, Board of Directors and the Directors’ Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any
other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group's and company's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
� the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the
group's affairs as at 31 August 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended;
� the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as applied
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent company's affairs as at 31 August 2007;
� the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
� the information given in the directors' report is consistent with the financial statements.

1. FRESHWATER GROUP 
Freshwater Group ('the Group') comprises Freshwater UK Plc (the ‘Company') and its subsidiary undertakings a list of which is provided in
note 12. The Company is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. Its ordinary shares have been listed
and traded on the Alternative Investment Market since 16 July 2007. The Company’s registered office is at Freshwater House, Cardiff Gate
Business Park, Cardiff, CF23 8RS.
2. AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The group and parent company financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2007 ('the financial statements') were authorised for issue
by the Company’s Board on 11 December 2007 and signed on the board’s behalf by Steve Howell and Haydn Evans. The financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as adopted by the European Union ('EU') and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies were consistently
applied. The functional currency and presentational currency of the Group is Sterling.
This is the first year that financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The disclosures required
by ‘IFRS 1 - First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ in relation to the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are
provided in note 28. The transition date is 1 September 2005. 
a) Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entities that it controls (its subsidiaries) drawn
up to 31 August each year. Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefit
from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are incorporated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which control
passed to the Group, and continue to be included until the date that such control ceases. The effects of intra-group transactions are
eliminated in full.
b) Revenue and turnover
Revenue comprises professional fees and mark-ups. Professional fees and mark-ups are recognised in proportion to the extent to which the
service to be provided under the related contract has been performed. Revenue is stated exclusive of value added tax. T urnover (billings) is
revenue stated gross of marginal costs such as print costs and the purchase of advertising space that are incurred in providing a service and
that in accordance with industry practice are marked up and passed on to clients. 
c) Segmental analysis 
A geographical segment is a distinguishable component of an enterprise that provides products and services within a particular economic
environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments.
A business segment is a distinguishable component of an enterprise that provides products or services and that is subject to risks and returns
that are different from those of other business segments. The Group’s operations are entirely within the UK and the Group is not considered
to consist of differing geographical segments. With the exception of Freshwater UK Plc which operates as a holding company Group
members are in the business of providing public relations and marketing services. The Group is not considered to comprise of differing
business segments. In the absence of differing business and geographical segments segmental information is not provided.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
d) Dividends
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are considered to have become no longer at the discretion of the Company. Dividends
declared (i.e. appropriately authorised and therefore no longer at the discretion of the Company) after the balance sheet date but before the
financial statements are authorised for issue are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date. 
e) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Freehold land is not
depreciated. Other property, plant and equipment is depreciated so as to write off cost less estimated residual value over its expected life on
the following bases:
� Freehold Property - 3% straight line;
� Short Leasehold Property - 33% straight line;
� Plant and Machinery - 10% reducing balance or 25% on cost;
� Motor Vehicles - 25% on cost;
� Fixtures and Fittings - 25% on cost;
� Office Equipment - 25% reducing balance or 25% - 33% on cost. 
f) Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with the purchase method. 
Goodwill comprises the excess of the cost of a business combination over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities acquired. The cost of a business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of acquisition of the assets
given, the liabilities incurred or assumed and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control of an acquiree plus associated directly
attributable costs. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Where the cost of a business combination is less than the
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired the associated gain is recognised in the income statement
in the period of acquisition. 
The terms of a business combination may require for purchase consideration to be provided subsequent to the acquisition date. The value
of such deferred consideration may additionally be dependent upon future events. In such circumstances an estimate of the ultimate value of
the deferred contingent consideration is recognised at the date of acquisition. Subsequent revisions are accounted for as a revision to the cost
of the business combination and lead to a revision to the cost of goodwill associated with the combination. Such revisions are recognised
prospectively in the accounting period that they are made. Deferred consideration is not discounted where the effects of such discounting is
considered immaterial and recognised as a liability or as a component of equity depending on its nature. 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may
be impaired. At the date of acquisition goodwill is allocated to a cash-generating unit(s) and in the event of a subsequent reorganisation of the
cash unit(s) to which it has been allocated correspondingly reallocated. An impairment review comprises assessing the recoverable amount
of the cash generating unit(s) to which goodwill has been allocated. Where the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit(s) is less than
its carrying amount and associated goodwill an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement and
are not subsequently reversed. The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value
in use. Assessing the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit includes estimating the future cash flows that it will generate and
discounting these cash flows at what is considered to be an appropriate discount rate.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
g) Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. They are amortised to residual
values on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives with a maximum of 20 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever
changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. 
h) Trade receivables
T rade receivables are stated at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful receivables. Provision is made where there is
objective evidence that the group will be unable to recover balances in full. 
i) Derivative financial instruments 
The Group has sought to manage its interest rate risk through entering an interest (base) rate swap. The contract is carried at fair value with
any gains or losses being taken to the income statement.  
j) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. The group overdraft facility is an integral part 
of the Group’s cash management stragegy and is considered to form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of
cash flows.
k) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost calculated in accordance with the effective
interest method. 
l) Leases 
Where the use of an asset is funded by leasing arrangements that give rights over the asset approximating to ownership the asset is accounted
for as if it has been purchased and recognised at the lower of fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The capital
element of the obligations under the associated leasing arrangements is shown as obligations under finance leases and lease payments are
apportioned between interest which is charged to the income statement and liability which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give
a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations. All other leases are considered operating leases and payments thereunder are
recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.  
m) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Exceptionally such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference
arises from the recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition (other than a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a
transaction that affects neither the tax profit or accounting profit. Notes to the financial statements
Freshwater UK Annual Report 06/07   49
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 August 2007 (continued)
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
m) Deferred taxation (continued)
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realized or the liability
is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
n) Share based payments 
The cost of equity settled share option contracts is measured as the fair value of the associated options at the date of their grant. Fair value
is calculated using the recognised Black-Scholes-Merton methodology. This cost is expensed on a straight line basis over the associated vesting
period in a manner that reflects the expectation of the number of options that will eventually vest.  More particularly at each balance sheet
date before vesting the cumulative charge that should have been expensed in view of the extent to which the vesting period has expired and
management’s then best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest is calculated. The movement in the cumulative
expense since the previous balance sheet date is then recognised as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding entry in equity.
Upon the exercise of the associated options the credits in associated equity are reversed and the proceeds received in respect of share
options are credited to share premium and share capital.  
o) Accounting estimates and judgements
In applying the accounting polices detailed above decisions sometimes have to be made as to the likely outcome of future events. Those
judgements and estimates made in preparing the financial statements are based on historical experience and assumptions that the Directors
believed were reasonable in the circumstances. The Directors consider the key judgements and estimates made in preparing the financial
statements to have been those relating to:
� the recognition of revenue in relation to contracts which straddle the year end;
� the accounting for share option contracts; and;
� the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets. 
These judgements and estimates are discussed in more detail both above and in the relevant notes to the financial statements. 
p) Impact of standards not yet effective
The directors have considered standards and interpretations which have been issued but are not yet effective. Whilst certain standards such
as IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instrument Disclosures’ and IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ may affect disclosures in future financial statements,
implementation of new standards is not expected to have a significant effect on Group’s results or balance sheet. Notes to the financial statements

Details of the business combinations effected in the current and prior year are provided below. 
a) Freshwater Creative Limited, Freshwater Southern Limited and Freshwater Wales Limited 
These entities were acquired by the Company during 2006 as ‘off the shelf', non-trading companies. Since the beginning of the current
financial year they have carried out those trading activities previously performed by the Company.  
b) Freshwater Consumer Limited (formerly Trew Relations Limited)
On 1 December 2005 the Company acquired the entire issued ordinary share capital and thereby control of Trew Relations Limited

The acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with the purchase method. Notes to the financial statements

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another
entity. Freshwater Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The group’s financial liabilities include its
borrowings and trade and other payables. The group is additionally party to a £ Sterling denominated amortising interest (base) rate 
swap contract.
The risks associated with the group’s financial assets and liabilities include credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Group members
publish their accounts and conduct their business entirely in £ Sterling and accordingly the group does not face currency risk being the risk
that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation
(e.g. the risk of a trade debtor or a financial institution with which money is deposited defaulting on payment). The Group actively monitors
the composition of trade debtors and denies additional credit when appropriate. Undue concentrations of customer credit are not allowed
to develop. At the year end the Group’s bank accounts, deposits and borrowings were all with a single recognised UK high street bank.
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest
rates. The Group faces interest rate risk as a result of its borrowings and from holding money with financial institutions. At the year end all
the Group’s bank accounts, deposits and borrowings were with a single recognised UK high street bank. An analysis of the group’s
borrowings all of which are at a floating rate is provided in note 19. The group has mitigated the interest rate risk associated with its
borrowings through entering into a free standing 10 year £ Sterling denominated amortising interest (base) rate swap with its bankers. Under
the contract which had an initial nominal value of £900,000 the group pays interest at a fixed rate of 5.6% in exchange for the counterparty
bank’s base rate. The contract was entered into on 1 March 2007 and will end on 1 March 2017. Early exit would require the payment of
the then fair value of the contract.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. Within Freshwater
Group the responsibility for monitoring liquidity risk and for ensuring that individual Group members are adequately funded has been
centralised and lies with the ultimate parent undertaking, Freshwater UK Plc, which leads all borrowing and capital raising activities.

On the 31 May 2006 the Company issued transferable sterling denominated Floating Rate Notes of aggregate nominal value £650,000
to the vendors of the ordinary share capital of Clear Communication Specialists Limited (see note 13). These notes were redeemable at par
on the 31 December 2007 and as of 1 January 2007 upon due notice being served by noteholders. Noteholders could opt for the notes to
be redeemed in either £ Sterling or US$ at the prevailing spot rate on the redemption date. The Company’s obligations under the notes
were guaranteed by its bankers in exchange for it maintaining a matching ringfenced cash deposit as security. Interest was payable on the
notes quarterly in arrears at the counterparty bank’s base rate. The notes were fully redeemed in £ Sterling in April 2007 following due
notice being served by the noteholders.
On the 31 January 2007 the Company issued transferable sterling denominated Floating Rate Notes of aggregate nominal value £469,216 to
the vendors of the ordinary share capital of Clear Communication Specialists Limited (see note 13). These notes were analogous in all
respects to those issued on 31 May 2006. The notes were fully redeemed in £ Sterling in August 2007 following due notice being served by
the noteholders.
Early in 2007 the Company repaid its existing mortgage contract and entered into a new floating rate mortgage contract under which it was
advanced £600,000 at 1.75% above the counterparty bank’s base rate and also a floating rate term loan contract under which it was
advanced £500,000 at 2.25% above the counterparty bank’s base rate. In addition a new £400,000 group overdraft facility was negotiated
with interest payable at 1.75% above the counterparty bank’s base rate on net creditor balances up to the agreed limit. All these
arrangements were entered into with a single recognised UK high street bank.
The group overdraft facility continues in place subject to regular review and being repayable upon demand. The mortgage contract continues
in place. The amount advanced thereunder is repayable in monthly level instalments of capital and interest over 13 years and upon demand
on the occurrence of certain events including the breach of certain financial covenants.  The amount may be prepaid by the Company at any
time. Amounts prepaid may not be redrawn. The floating rate term loan contract was refinanced with an analogous contract for £1,217,000
in February 2007. This is repayable over four years in quarterly level instalments of capital and upon demand on the occurrence of certain
events including the breach of certain financial covenants. The loan may be prepaid at any time. Amounts repaid may not be redrawn.
The mortgage contract, term loan and group overdraft facility are all secured by an unlimited intercompany composite guarantee (under
which the members of the Group are jointly and severally liable for the Group’s obligations to the counterparty bank), debentures by the
members of Freshwater Group and a first legal charge over the Company’s property.

On the 28 February 2007 100,000 ordinary shares of 20p each were allotted at a deemed issue price of £1.75 to the vendor(s) 
of Attenborough Saffron Limited. See note 13.
On 4 June 2007 the Company’s authorised ordinary share capital was increased from 3,000,000 shares of 20p each to 7,000,000 ordinary
shares of 20p each. On the same day the Company’s preferred ordinary share capital was converted into a similar number of ordinary shares
due notice having been served by holders of not less than 51% of their number.
In June 2007 and subsequent to the conversion of the 20p preferred ordinary shares into 20p ordinary shares a 2:1 split occurred with each
authorised and allotted 20p ordinary share being subdivided into two 10p ordinary shares.
In July 2007 Freshwater UK successfully listed on the AIM market with 4,705,891 10p ordinary shares being placed at 85p each for total
consideration of £4,000,000 excluding transaction costs. T ransaction costs of £629,316 have been taken to the share premium account.
Preferred ordinary shares 
The non-redeemable 20p preferred ordinary shares had the same voting rights as ordinary shares and preferential rights in the event of a
liquidation or capital reduction. Holders ranked pari passu with the holders of ordinary shares in any general distribution and were entitled
to an additional annual non-discretionary preferred dividend calculated as a percentage of the Group’s consolidated net profit (as defined in
the Company’s Articles of Association) in the event of less than 40% of the Group’s consolidated net profit being distributed by way of
ordinary dividend in a given year. In the event of due notice being served by holders of not less than 51% of their number the preferred
ordinary shares were convertible into a similar number of ordinary shares. The 20p preferred ordinary shares were regarded as a compound
instrument comprising an ordinary share and a debt instrument and accounted for accordingly. Upon their conversion into ordinary shares
in June 2007 the then carrying value of the related liability component was written back to the share premium account. Notes to the financial statements

ordinary shares the preferred dividend paid to holders of preferred ordinary shares was accounted for as interest. Details of the proposed
final dividend for the current financial year are provided in the Director’s report. 
24.  SHARE OPTIONS 
The Company has entered into a number of share option contracts with certain employees and Directors of the Group under the umbrella
of an Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme. Contracts were entered into in February 2005, January 2006, July 2006 and July 2007. 
All the contracts entered into have a ten year term and lapse in the event of the optionholder becoming bankrupt or trying to sell his or her
interest. They also lapse upon the optionholder either giving or receiving notice of the termination of his or her employment with the Group,
save that a limited grace period is given in certain defined circumstances.
The contracts entered into by the Company provide the optionholder with an option to acquire a fixed number of ordinary shares in the
Company ('option shares') at a fixed exercise price that vests upon the occurrence of certain control events (e.g. certain restructurings of
the Company or the Company listing on a recognised investment exchange). The exercisability of the options provided under the contracts
is not dependant on any individual performance related criteria. Both the number of option shares and the exercise prices associated with
those contracts entered into in February 2005, January 2006 and July 2006 were proportionately changed following the 2:1 share split
effected in June 2007. Any obligations arising under the contracts are settled by the Company through the issue of new shares to the
optionholder for settlement at the relevant exercise price.
Upon the Company listing on AIM in July 2007 1/3 of the options associated with those contracts entered into by the Company:
� in February 2005 and January 2006 became exercisable at the exercise price on the listing date with: i) 1/3 becoming exercisable at the
exercise price on or after the first anniversary of the listing date; and; ii) 1/3  becoming exercisable at the exercise price on or after the
second anniversary of the listing date.
� in July 2006 became exercisable at the exercise price 12 months after the listing date with: i) 1/3 becoming exercisable at the exercise
price on or after the second anniversary of the listing date; and; ii) 1/3 becoming exercisable at the exercise price on or after the third
anniversary of the listing date.
� in July 2007 became exercisable at the exercise price 18 months after the listing date with: i) 1/3 becoming exercisable at the exercise
price on or after the elapse of 30 months subsequent to the listing date; and; ii) 1/3 becoming exercisable at the exercise price on or after
the elapse of 42 months subsequent to the listing date.
The occurrence of other control events in the future may result in all the options associated with the contracts so far entered becoming
exercisable in full immediately. Notes to the financial statements

In accordance with IFRS 2 - Share based payment the Company determined the fair value of the share option contracts it entered 
on the date of their grant, adjusted this amount to reflect its then expectation of the number of option shares that would ultimately 
vest and then commenced to expense the remaining balance on a straight line basis through its profit and loss account over the then
expected vesting period with a corresponding credit to its share option reserve. Subsequent changes in expectations have been dealt with
by catch up adjustments such that the cumulative amount charged to the profit and loss account and share option reserve is consistent with
latest expectations. Notes to the financial statements

The 20p preferred ordinary shares in issue during 2007 and 2006 were regarded as a compound instrument comprising an ordinary share
and a debt instrument. See note 22. In reflection of this their number has been taken into account when calculating the weighted average
number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share.
In June 2007 a 2:1 split occurred with each authorised and allotted 20p ordinary share being subdivided into two 10p ordinary shares. 
The weighted average number of ordinary shares figure for the prior year has been adjusted accordingly.

25.EARNINGS PER SHARE (CONTINUED)
Potential ordinary shares - share options 
The Company entered into analogous share option contracts in February 2005, January 2006, July 2006 and July 2007. See note 24. 
Until the Company listed on the Alternative Investment Market in July 2007 the vesting of the options under these contracts was subject to
the achievement of a performance related condition and the options were considered contingently issuable potential ordinary shares. The
options were not taken into account in calculating diluted earnings per share for 2006 as their vesting was subject to a performance related
condition that had neither in part or in full been met. This changed in July 2007 and in calculating diluted earning per share for 2007 the
options under those contracts issued in February 2005 and January 2006 being dilutive were taken into account from the beginning of the
period. Options under those contracts issued in July 2006 and July 2007 were not taken into account being antidilutive.
Potential ordinary share - Contingent share consideration 
Contingent share consideration that forms part of a business combination is taken into account in calculating diluted earnings per share from
the earlier of the beginning of the period and the date of acquisition to the extent that the relevant conditions have been met by the balance
sheet date and the consideration is dilutive. It should be noted that this approach can mean a mismatch between the dilutive potential
ordinary shares taken into account in calculating diluted earnings per share and the contingent share consideration that ultimately it is
expected will be provided based on future expectations. In particular it is expected that ultimately 800,000 ordinary shares will be issued as
a result of the earn out arrangements associated with the acquisition of Attenborough Saffron on 28 February 2007 whereas for the purposes
of calculating diluted earnings per share for 2007 it has been assumed that only 200,000 will be issued based on actual performance by the
balance sheet date.

Company
Key management personnel
The key management personnel of the Company are considered to be the Company’s Directors. Details of the compensation that became
payable during the year to the Company’s Directors are disclosed above. 
The highest paid Director received compensation (including pension contributions) of £94,865 (2006: £82,335). 
During the year contributions became payable by the Group in relation to the money purchase pension of 4 Directors (2006: 4). 
The contributions that became payable by group in relation to the highest paid Director amounted to £4,293 (2006: 3,600).
T ransactions with other Group members 
The Company is the Group’s ultimate parent undertaking. The Company’s subsidiary undertakings are listed in note 12. All are 100% direct
subsidiaries with the exception of the dormant company, Saffron Public Relations Limited, which is a 100% subsidiary of Attenborough
Saffron Limited.
The Company settles the VAT liabilities of other Group members and when appropriate recharges other Group members a proportion of
its employment and overhead costs. The only other events that routinely effect the amount owed to/by the Company by/to other Group
members are the payment of dividends by the Company’s direct subsidiaries and the advancing/borrowing of funds by the Company to/from
other group members. 
During 2006 the Company entered no significant non-routine transactions with other Group members. The Company additionally neither
re-charged employment and overhead costs to other Group members or received any dividends from its direct subsidiaries.  
During 2007 the Company transferred trade debtor balances amounting to £346,083 and trade creditor balances amounting to £107,034 to
Freshwater Creative, Freshwater Southern and Freshwater Wales as part of the transfer of its trading activities to these entities. In addition
the Company re-charged employment and overhead costs of £903,218 to other Group members and received dividends of £50,000 from
Freshwater Wales Limited and £100,000 from Freshwater Healthcare Limited. 
Similar to other Group members the Company maintains a single intercompany account in its ledger and monitors the aggregate net position
thereon. This is considered appropriate as with a few minor exceptions the Company can be considered to be the counterparty to all
intercompany transactions entered into by other Group members i.e. the components of the aggregate net balances on other Group
members’ intercompany accounts can be considered to relate entirely to the Company.

27. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE  
The following material non-adjusting events occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date and prior to the authorisation of these 
financial statements. 
Acquisition of Lynx Public Relations Limited  
On 1 November 2007 the Company acquired control of Lynx Public Relations Limited acquiring its entire ordinary share capital and Class
B ordinary share capital in exchange for an immediate cash payment of £350,000, the issue of 109,890 10p ordinary shares in Freshwater
UK and certain contingent consideration. The Class B ordinary shares acquired carried no voting rights but in all other respects ranked pari
passu with the acquired ordinary shares. Following completion the Class B ordinary shares were converted into ordinary shares on a one
for one basis. Contingent consideration included the promise of a cash payment equal to what subsequently was agreed as Lynx Public
Relations Limited’s net tangible assets less cash resources under UK GAAP at the completion date (subject to a cap of £150,000) plus its
cash resources at the completion date. It further included the promise of a cash payment and the issue of additional 10p ordinary shares in
Freshwater UK dependant upon Lynx Public Relations Limited’s profitability in the subsequent 12 months under UK GAAP . Lynx Public
Relations Limited had and continues to have no subsidiaries or associates.

The parties agreed that the fair value of each of the 109,890 10p ordinary shares issued upon completion should be considered 91p after
due regard to the recent quoted mid-market price of the Company’s shares.
The cash payment to be made and the value of shares to be issued as a result of the earn out arrangements disclosed above reflect the
current expectation of Lynx Public Relations Limited’s profitability under UK GAAP in the 12 month earn out period. The number of shares
issued as a result of the earn out arrangements will be such as to yield an agreed value based on the average quoted mid-market closing
price of the Company’s shares in the last month of the earn out period. Notes to the financial statements

27. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE (CONTINUED)
Acquisition of Lynx Public Relations Limited (continued)
Audited IFRS accounts for Lynx Public Relations Limited for the period ended 31 October 2007 were not available prior to the authorisation
of these financial statements and as a result the fair value of Lynx Public Relation Limited’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities at the date of acquisition disclosed above is based on unaudited UK GAAP management accounts. This value and the value of
goodwill disclosed are accordingly provisional and in particular may differ from the final agreed values due to the recognition of certain
intangible assets not recognised under UK GAAP .
Acquisition of the Waterfront Conference Company Limited  
On 2 December 2007 the Company acquired control of the Waterfront Conference Company Limited acquiring both its ordinary share
capital and its preference share capital in exchange for an immediate cash payment of £140,000, the immediate issue of 10p ordinary shares
in the Company of agreed value £25,000 and certain contingent consideration. Contingent consideration included the promise of a cash
payment equal to what subsequently was agreed as the value of the Waterfront Conference Company Limited’s net tangible assets at the
completion date subject to both a cap and in the event of this value being negative a corresponding clawback of the initial cash consideration.
It further included the promise of a cash payment and the issue of additional 10p ordinary shares in the Company dependant upon the
Waterfront Conference Company Limited’s profitability in the subsequent 15 months. It is currently anticipated that a cash payment of
£100,000 will be made and shares of agreed value £150,000 will be issued as a result of these earn out arrangements. The number of shares
issued as a result of the earn out arrangements will be such as to yield an agreed value based on the average quoted mid-market closing
price of the Company’s shares in the last month of the earn out period. At the date of authorisation of these financial statements financial
information for the Waterfront Conference Company Limited for the period ending 2 December 2007 had yet to be prepared and therefore
further information in relation to this acquisition is not given.  
The vendors of the Waterfront Conference Company’s Limited ordinary share capital and preference share capital were either the same as
or controlled by the vendors of the business of the Waterfront Partnership.
Acquisition of the Waterfront Partnership 
On 2 December 2007 the Company acquired the business and certain assets and liabilities of the Waterfront Partnership in exchange for an
immediate cash payment of £580,000, the immediate issue of 10p ordinary shares in Freshwater UK of agreed value £200,000 and certain
contingent consideration. Contingent consideration included the promise of a cash payment equal to what subsequently was agreed as the
value of the tangible assets and liabilities acquired at the completion date subject to both a cap of £150,000 and in the event of this value
being negative a corresponding reduction in the initial cash consideration provided by the Company. It further included the promise of a cash
payment and the issue of additional 10p ordinary shares in the Company dependant upon the acquired business’s profitability under UK
GAAP in the subsequent 15 months. It is currently anticipated that a cash payment of £125,000 will be made and shares of agreed value
£175,000 will be issued as a result of these earn out arrangements. The number of shares issued as a result of the earn out arrangements
will be such as to yield an agreed value based on the average quoted mid-market closing price of the Company’s shares in the last month
of the earn out period. At the date of authorisation of these financial statements financial information for the Waterfront Partnership for the
period ending 2 December 2007 had yet to be prepared and therefore further information in relation to this acquisition is not given.  
28. TRANSITIONAL DISCLOSURES
This is the first year that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS')
as adopted by the European Union. Previously the financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles ('UK GAAP'). IFRS differ in a number of significant respects from UK GAAP . In accordance with ‘IFRS 1 - First time
adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ reconciliations of the Group’s and the Company’s equity at 31 August 2006 and at
1 September 2005 ('the date of transition to IFRS'') under IFRS to the values previously reported under UK GAAP are provided below

Group - Restatement of UK GAAP
The process followed to prepare the Group’s and the Company’s first financial statements under IFRS as adopted by the EU uncovered
certain accounting matters. In addressing these matters the £78,859 of dividend expense previously reported in the Group’s and the
Company’s UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2006 was increased to £86,554 with a corresponding reduction in
the previously reported value of financial expenses. In addition the previously reported value of the Group’s equity at 31 August 2005 and
at 31 August 2006 in the Group’s UK GAAP financial statements for the years then ended was reduced by £41,956 with a corresponding
change to the value of goodwill. 
Group - Explanation of transitional items
Adjustment 1:
IFRS 3 - Business Combinations requires the goodwill that arises upon a business combination to be capitalised and then regularly tested for
impairment in accordance with IAS 36 - Impairment of assets. Impairment losses are required to be recognised in the income statement.
Previously under UK GAAP the goodwill that arose upon a business combination was capitalized and amortised. Adjustment 1 comprises
the writing back of goodwill previously amortised under UK GAAP .
Adjustment 2:
Under IFRS 3 - Business Combinations goodwill comprises the excess of the cost of a business combination over the net fair value of the
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. This is similar to UK GAAP however differences between IFRS and UK GAAP
mean that the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an acquiree at the date of acquisition under IFRS
can differ from that under UK GAAP . Adjustment 2 comprises the recognition of intangible assets that would have been recognised if the
net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of acquirees at the date of acquisition had previously been determined in accordance
with IFRS as opposed to UK GAAP . The recognition of these intangible assets is matched by a corresponding adjustment to the value of
goodwill previously reported under UK GAAP . Notes to the financial statements

28. TRANSITIONAL DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED)
Adjustment 3:
This comprises the impairment losses in relation to goodwill and the additional amortisation of intangible assets that would have been
recognised if the financial statements had previously been prepared under IFRS as opposed to UK GAAP .
Adjustment 4:
The introduction of a holiday pay accrual required under IAS19 Employee Benefits but that was not previously recognised under UK GAAP . 
Adjustment 5:
Under IFRS 2 - Share-based Payment the cost of equity settled share option contracts is expensed on a straight line basis over the associated
vesting period in a manner that reflects the expectation of the number of options that will eventually vest.  Cost is measured as the fair value
of the associated options at the date of their grant. More particularly at each balance sheet date before vesting the cumulative charge that
should have been expensed in view of the extent to which the vesting period has expired and management’s then best estimate of the
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest is calculated. The movement in the cumulative expense since the previous balance
sheet date is then recognised as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding entry in equity. Upon the exercise of the
associated options the credits in associated equity are reversed and the proceeds received in respect of share options are credited to share
premium and share capital. Historically under UK GAAP outstanding equity settled option contracts were not accounted for. Adjustment 5
comprises the corresponding restatement.

What we do
We have to constantly evolve to meet our customers’ needs.
What our customers say
Our unrivalled customer service is driven across everything we do.
The world of business is constantly 
changing and so are we. 20 years ago 
we were an innovative provider of 
serviced ofﬁ ces because that was what 
our customers needed. Yet work today 
is radically different to the early 1990s. 
As a result we have to constantly evolve 
to meet the ever changing needs of 
our customers.
Yes, we still rent serviced ofﬁ ces. But 
that’s an increasingly small part of what 
we do now. What we provide is the 
means – the workspaces – from which 
our customers can do whatever it is
they want to do. We are facilitators, 
concierges, technical support teams, 
property managers and business 
advisers. Our customers want meeting-
rooms, workstations, coffee lounges, 
video-communications facilities and all 
the latest IT and telecommunications 
support. We provide bookkeeping and 
payroll services, transcription services 
and help our customers purchase a wide 
range of ancillary business products and 
services. Sometimes they even want us 
to tell them what they need.
Above all, we take care of the everyday 
details of running a business so that our 
customers, be they the very largest 
global corporate or an entrepreneur with 
an idea, can concentrate on what they 
do best, which is run their business
and work their way. Every modern 
international business, large or small, 
must be agile, able to make decisions 
quickly, change direction or shift 
resources at short notice. 
In today’s ever more complex, ever more 
unpredictable, ever more interconnected 
world, Regus helps them to do just that.

complex networking problems.
“ With Regus we are no longer 
on the real estate roller coaster 
where we are constantly 
ramping up and ramping down 
our portfolio. We can now 
acquire just what we need, 
when we need it for as long 
as we need it without risk or 
excessive costs.”

Directors’ Report: Business Review
Chairman’s statement
Determined strategic implementation
This, coupled with consistent trading 
across all our markets, has enabled the 
Group to weather the unpredictable 
economic challenges of 2010. I am 
particularly pleased that our mature 
margins have started to recover during 
2010 and in addition the business has 
generated more cash year on year, with 
cash from operations increasing to £109.7 
million (2009: £105.1 million). The strength 
of this cash generation has enabled the 
business to invest signiﬁ cantly in growth, 
opening 125 centres, with an estimated 
cost to our proﬁ t and loss of £18.2 million 
and to our cash ﬂ ow of £69.7 million. It has 
also enabled us to increase our dividend 
by 22% to £23.2 million while maintaining 
a robust net cash position at £191.5 
million. The board remains conﬁ dent in the 
signiﬁ cant opportunities for our business 
as the global trend towards ﬂ exible, mobile 
work accelerates.
Network growth
To capitalise on the signiﬁ cant 
opportunities created by the trend towards 
increased ﬂ exible working we continue to 
grow our network to provide these agile 
workers with a mobile work platform. Our 
approach is two-fold: to open in new 
countries (such as Oman, Ghana and 
Lithuania), thus increasing our global 
footprint, and deepen existing in-country 
networks opening in cities (such as 
Canberra and Brasilia), thereby getting 
ever closer to new and existing customers.
In the year to 31 December 2010, we 
added 20,122 workstations an increase 
of 13% on 2009 for a total investment of 
£69.7 million. Approximately half of this 
growth came from acquisitions in markets 
such as Brazil, China, UK and USA. We 
will continue to explore such opportunities 
as we look to strengthen our market 
position and deliver on our strategy. 
Board changes
I would like to thank Ulrich Ogiermann, 
who resigned from the Board as of 
31 December 2010, for his contribution to 
the business over the years and we wish 
him well for the future. 
Dividend
It remains the intention of the Board to 
pay dividends at a level which it believes is 
sustainable throughout economic cycles 
and is in line with its progressive payment 
policy. Reﬂecting the underlying strength 
of the Group’s trading performance, our 
strong cash generation, robust cash 
position and future conﬁdence in 
the group’s prospects, the Board is 
recommending an 8% increase in the full 
year dividend per share to 2.6p per share. 
Subject to the approval of shareholders 
at the 2011 AGM, this ﬁnal dividend will 
be paid on Friday 27 May 2011 to 
shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on Tuesday 26 April 2011.

Chairman

I am pleased to report 
a solid performance 
by the group resulting 
from the determined 
implementation of 
our strategy which 
has transformed our 
business model over 
the last two years.

Directors’ Report: Business Review
Chief Executive’s review
A strong track record of delivery
2010 was a solid year of performance 
made possible by the delivery of key 
strategic initiatives rather than any 
noticeable pick up in the world economy. 
That the business remained proﬁ table and 
in 2010 generated more cash than in 2009 
demonstrates our strong and deep 
foundations. 
We are now a much ﬁ tter and more 
nimble business which will be to the 
beneﬁ t of our customers and 
shareholders. The strategic initiatives of 
2010 were focused on orientating the 
business to recover occupancy and 
margin in 2011 regardless of the rate of 
economic recovery. This includes having 
the right business centres in the right 
places on the right terms; generating 
more enquiries and increasing the sales 
conversion; streamlining processes and 
structures; continually innovating our 
product and service mix; and, crucially, 
investing in our people. Such investments 
have come at some cost but it is 
important to highlight these investments 
are fully self funded and we expect to see 
a return in 2011.
We continue to experience broad-based 
demand across all markets and market 
sectors but especially from large 
multinationals for our assistance in 
supporting their move to lower cost ﬂ exible 
working models. This accelerating trend is 
one of the key drivers of our business and 
we believe will be so for years to come. 
With renewed focus we have delivered 
the growth we set out to achieve at the 
beginning of 2010; we opened 125 new 
centres, which led us into seven new 
countries. It is our intention to sustain this 
growth rate into 2011 as we look to 
extend our global reach and strengthen in 
country networks giving us an ever 
greater addressable market. 
Strategy 
Our vision is clear; to be where people 
and businesses want to work and to be 
the platform from which they work, be it 
mobile or ﬁ xed, virtual or physical, large 
company or small. As a result our 
strategy is equally simple: to be in as 
many of those locations as quickly as we 
can. That we are the only business that 
can aspire to this demonstrates the scale 
of the opportunity in a world of more than 
a billion mobile workers. 
Strategic highlights
In 2010 we delivered a number of key 
strategic initiatives which have 
transformed the business. These are:
2009 and 2010 have been 
momentous years for 
the world economy and 
all businesses have had 
to respond and adapt in 
order to progress. We 
have been no different. 
Mark Dixon 
Chief Executive 
• Strengthened Management Structure
– To better manage our growing 
business, within our regions, we have 
started the process of organising day-
to-day management of 30 country/
market groupings. With supervisory 
oversight from our new global 
management centre in Geneva, 
decision making is being accelerated 
and improved. In 2010 key hires 
and internal promotions were made 
across all our major geographies 
including Canada, Brazil, Mexico and 
Japan amongst others. It is of crucial 
importance that the business continues 
to add to this cadre of its management 
population throughout 2011.
• Refocused Marketing – Spend was 
increased by 27% over the course 
of 2010 vs. 2009 to £33.3 million. 
The marketing management team 
was reorganised to deliver in-country 
planning and global campaign 
integration moving us away from a 
regional approach. Additionally, a 
number of tasks were brought back 
in-house, including web and search 
engine marketing. Together this 
resulted in a 32% increase in overall 
global enquiries but more importantly 
a dynamic approach to generating 
enquiries in the locations that most 
need them.
• Improved Sales – Signiﬁ cant changes 
to our sales structure, supporting 
systems and improved customer 
targeting, together with comprehensive 
bespoke training and development, 
resulted in deal volumes that were 
12% higher in 2010 than 2009. 
Good progress was made with our 
corporate accounts team, refreshing 
our entire product offering, providing 
targeted marketing support and 
systems, increasing headcount (from 
30 to 79) and making four key senior 
management hires. As a result our 
sales picked up strongly in H2 and this 
team now has momentum into 2011. 
• Streamlined Operations – 2010 saw 
further signiﬁ cant progress with our 
eCommerce rollout, speciﬁ cally TITAN, 
Peoplesoft and Oracle which are now 
ﬁ rmly embedded within the business. 
A signiﬁ cant number of centre routines 
and procedures were redesigned, freeing 
up centre team time to dedicate to 
customers. The centralisation of our back 
ofﬁ ce service functions to our shared

service centres was completed in Q4. 
It is already delivering both operational 
and ﬁ nancial efﬁ ciencies; for example, 
centralising our IT support desk has 
already resulted in annualised savings 
of £1.5 million. 2011 will see further 
centralisation including parts of the 
marketing, price and inventory functions.
• Delivered Procurement, New Centre 
cost efﬁ ciencies – Over 2010 we 
continued our proactive approach to 
driving cost and realising efﬁ ciency gains 
throughout the business. Centralised 
procurement programmes were put in 
place and key hires made, the beneﬁ ts 
of which we believe will be felt in 2011 
and beyond. Excluding the extra costs 
that have been incurred increasing the 
capacity of the business and some 
speciﬁ c investments, since the second 
half of 2008 annualised savings have 
been made of circa £135 million. 
Operational Review 
Operationally 2010 has been a busy year 
for the Group. During Q4 alone we 
averaged a centre opening a day. Our 
strategy of controlled and disciplined 
growth has resulted in an increase in total 
capacity (including non-consolidated 
workstations) of 9% to 188,567 
workstations in the year and the number of 
actual workstations by 8.8% to 178,084 
workstations as at 31 December 2010. 
The group opened 125 new centres during 
the year with the total number now 
standing at 1,084. Of these, 61 were as a 
result of organic growth of which 37 were 
opened on ﬂ exible, low risk leases.
On a regional basis, revenues and centre 
contribution can be analysed as follows:

* The mature business is deﬁ ned as the performance from centres owned and operated at 1 January 2009.
Americas 
Our business in the Americas comprises 
Canada, USA and the countries of Latin 
America, some 517 centres across 15 
countries. Our main business in the USA 
operates 411 centres. At actual exchange 
rates, the region delivered revenues of 
£436.9 million – up 3.1% on 2009 with 
average mature occupancy of 80% during 
the period (2009: 79%). During the year, 
we added 46 centres which contributed 
to the increase in the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 72,277 in 
2009 to 74,265 in 2010. 
The business made two key acquisitions in 
November 2010; one in Dallas adding nine 
centres; and one in Brazil adding 16. The 
latter acquisition makes us the number 
one workplace provider in that market. 
EMEA
Our business in EMEA encompasses 278 
centres across 49 countries. The region 
delivered revenues of £281.2 million, down 
8.2% on 2009, and achieved an average 
mature occupancy of 77% (2009: 80%). 
During the year we opened 36 centres, 
including 16 through acquisition. This 
contributed to the increase in the average 
number of consolidated workstations from 
34,260 in 2009 to 36,120 in 2010. We 
opened our ﬁ rst centres in Ghana, Oman, 
T anzania and Lithuania (new cities Porto 
and Basel).
Asia Paciﬁ c
Our business in Asia operates in 133 
centres across 16 countries. The region 
delivered revenues of £141.7 million, up 
7.1% on 2009, and achieved an average 
mature occupancy of 80% (2009: 76%). 
During the year we opened 20 centres, 
which increased the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 21,390 in 
2009 to 23,437 in 2010. 
UK
Conditions during 2010 continued to be 
extremely challenging with renewed 
pressure on key performance indicators 
and particularly price. Set against this 
backdrop, the region delivered revenues 
of £178.9 million, down 6.5% on 2009 
and achieved an average mature 
occupancy of 76% (2009: 78%). During

the year, we opened 23 centres of which 
15 were through acquisition. This 
increased the average number of 
consolidated workstations from 33,528 in 
2009 to 34,851 in 2010. 
In Q2 we embarked on a signiﬁ cant 
restructure of our UK lease portfolio; 
working in partnership with our landlords 
many were renegotiated and re-geared 
and only three centres were closed. This 
process concluded in Q3 and will result in 
annualised savings of up to £15 million per 
annum. We are conﬁ dent that in 2011 our 
UK business will return to operating proﬁ t.
Market opportunities – how 
we help our customers 
Our extensive geographic network offers 
a broad range of opportunities for Regus, 
as organisations of all sizes begin to 
seriously address structural inefﬁ ciencies 
in their property portfolio and as pressure 
from workers increases to make work 
more ﬂ exible, in terms of both time and 
geographic location.
Businesses around the world, from the very 
largest to the newest start-up, are 
increasingly recognising the beneﬁ ts of 
being property-light; reducing the number 
of ofﬁ ces they lease. This then enables their 
people to work where they need to, rather 
than where they always have been and for 
their business to realise the immediate 
beneﬁ ts of increased productivity and 
decreased costs. As such, a move to 
Regus is very much a commercial and 
ﬁ nancially driven decision; with the Regus 
advantage regularly delivering savings of 
50-80% vs. a comparable traditional leased 
ofﬁ ce model. We are attractive to any size 
of business and not just small and medium 
sized businesses on a short term basis. 
60% of our customers use us for more 
than 30 months; 40% of our customer 
base is large corporates; and, 20% sole 
traders and micro businesses. 
The scale and density of our ever 
expanding network, our strong track 
record of delivery, and our constant ability 
to innovate both product and service 
mean we are well placed to help our 
customers, both current and future, 
address the challenges of work, wherever 
they need us. For example:-
Yell – UK based business 
directory service
Closed 18 under-utilised sales ofﬁ ces and 
transferred circa.700 sales consultants to 
Regus through our Businessworld model. 
This approach is more cost effective, 
lower risk, ﬂ exible, sustainable and is 
gradually increasing productivity as less 
time is spent commuting and working in 
poorly equipped places. 
7-11 – Leading US franchised 
food retailer
Since year end we have signed a deal with 
7-11 whereby they will close more than 35 
under-utilised regional ofﬁ ces. More than 
250 franchise managers will use the Regus 
network establishing ﬂ exible zone ofﬁ ces in

Network growth 
In an ever more mobile, nomadic world of 
work, our primary asset, our business 
centres, will remain the foundation for our 
growth. Indeed it is our extensive 
network, virtually impossible to replicate in 
the medium term, which is so attractive to 
our customers and prospects and from 
which we will create signiﬁ cant 
shareholder value.
A larger network is necessary because:
• Our addressable market grows; locally 
from the businesses immediately 
surrounding the new location and 
globally for multinational businesses that 
want to do business in that location;
• We can leverage operational efﬁ ciencies;
• Additional brand exposure;
• We become an ever more attractive 
partner to other high proﬁ le global 
brands; and
• The barriers to competitive entry 
become greater. 
As such continued growth is core to our 
strategy.
It is important to state that our growth 
strategy is based upon making our past 
successes repeatable. We focus on 
projects that we can do again and again, 
moving us from one level to the next. 
Growth is always low risk and balanced. It 
is never growth for its own sake.
The acquisitions we have made and the 
organic growth which has happened 
alongside have expanded our served and 
addressable market. We now have 1,084 
centres worldwide
Outlook
Against a tough economic backdrop the 
business delivered solid ﬁ nancial results in 
2010, driven almost entirely by execution 
of a range of key strategic initiatives; we 
have seen little beneﬁ t from any economic 
upturn. We have continued to invest in 
growth, mature margins have held up well 
and cash ﬂ ow continued to be strong, 
reﬂ ecting the underlying health of 
the business.
We remain cautious on the economy, 
however we have been encouraged by 
recent positive trends that reﬂ ect the 
continued strategic delivery of the group. In 
2011 we are well positioned for a year of 
solid revenue growth business improvement 
with strong underlying cash-ﬂ ow generation.
Arguably the recession of the last two years 
has been good for our business; it made us 
take a long hard look at everything we did, 
improve it and in doing so we have been 
transformed. That we have emerged from 
2010 for the better is a testament to the 
hard work and dedication of our global 
team of highly motivated individuals. We 
have restructured and streamlined our 
management; we have grown and opened 
up new markets; we have continued to 
innovate; we have radically improved our 
sales and marketing; and we have 
continued to automate and improve our 
processes. We are a better business than 
we were when the recession started and 
we will realise the beneﬁ ts of the many 
improvements made over the years to 
come.
Finally, I would like to thank our employees, 
customers, shareholders, suppliers and all 
other partners for their continuing support. 
We look forward to an improved 2011 and 
the opportunity to grow our business and 
in doing so lead our industry.

Robust cash generation
This cash inﬂ ow has enabled the business to 
pay an increased dividend to shareholders 
(£23.2 million), buy back shares (£7.3 million), 
restructure the UK (£13.7 million to 31 
December 2010). As well as invest in 
capacity growth (£69.7 million).
Our net cash position at 31 December 2010 
remained strong at £191.5 million compared 
to £237.0 million at 31 December 2009.
If we had translated our 2009 results 
at 2010 rates revenue and gross proﬁ t 
would have increased by £16.3 million 
and £4.4 million respectively. On a 
constant currency basis revenue fell 
by 2.9% and gross proﬁ t by 10.0%.
Our mature or “like for like” business 
revenues decreased by £60.8 million and 
gross proﬁ t by £24.5 million driven by 
reductions in price. This is partially offset 
by real reductions in costs and the 
transfer of some other costs into 
overheads. 
However, while the overall proﬁ tability has 
fallen year on year mature margin has 
recovered during 2010.

Margin 22.1% 21.2% 22.3%
*  The above numbers are at constant currency and 
have been adjusted for the impact of certain costs 
being moved into overheads during 2010.
Centres added in 2009 contributed £13.0 
million of revenue and £4.8 million of 
gross proﬁ t, reﬂ ecting the improving 
occupancy and ability to reduce the 
normal start up losses as centres mature. 
New centres in 2010 contributed £25.1 
million of revenue but reduced gross proﬁ t 
by £7.0 million due to the normal start up 
losses incurred in establishing new centres. 
Despite the challenging 
trading conditions 
experienced across 
all of our markets, the 
business has generated 
more cash in 2010 than it 
did it 2009 with cash from 
operations increasing 
to £109.7 million (2009 
£105.1 million).

Revenue for the Group decreased 1.4% 
to £1,040.4 million (2009: £1,055.1

contribution) decreased 8.4% to 
£215.9 million (2009: £235.6 million).
This movement can be analysed as follows:
The year on year impact of centre closures 
was to reduce revenue by £8.3 million but 
increase gross proﬁ t by £2.6 million.
Taking all this together margins (before 
exceptional costs) reduced from 22.3% to 
20.8%.
Administration expenses
In 2010 administrative expenses (pre

can be broadly analysed as follows:

As a result of adding workstations 
overhead costs are also adversely 
affected as we invest in such costs as 
extra marketing, regional management, 
legal and other compliance costs. Year on 
year the increase in these costs is 
estimated at £5.3 million. 
To drive enquiries and future revenue 
growth, the Group has invested an extra 
£9.0 million in sales and marketing. In 
addition, £2.1 million has been spent to 
centralise our IT support structure which 
will start to yield savings in 2011. 
Net of the above there has been an 
underlying increase in overhead of 
£3.5 million.
Growth costs
As the rate of capacity growth increases 
the short term costs of this growth also 
increase. To give shareholders a better 
appreciation of the impact of this on our 
2010 proﬁ t and loss these costs have 
been estimated as follows:
£ million
Growth 
costs
Start up losses within centre 
contribution (including £2.7m 
of depreciation) (7.0)
Costs of teams that support 
the acquisition and 
implementation of centres (4.7)
Incremental marketing costs 
to launch centres (1.9)
Other overhead costs (sales, 
ﬁ nance, legal, management) (4.6)
(18.2)
In arriving at this number there has been 
no allowance for general management 
time and effort expensed across the 
business supporting growth which is also 
likely to be substantial.
Using these estimates, before and after 
proﬁ tability can then be summarised as 
follows:
£ million
Before growth 
costs
After growth 
costs
EBITDA* 112.6 97.2
EBIT* 42.0 23.8
* Before exceptional costs.
Taking into account an overall 
assessment of growth costs within the 
business and the expectation of further 
increases in capacity and therefore 
revenue, it is anticipated that an
‘ex growth’ overhead rate would be
circa 12% of revenues.
Cost reduction initiatives
The cost management actions taken by 
the Group throughout 2009 have been 
progressed in 2010, delivering further 
cost savings in the underlying business. 
The most signiﬁ cant savings are being 
driven through centre costs, where we 
are now seeing the beneﬁ t of reduced 
rent and service charges. Cost savings 
are also being made as we close 
underperforming centres and the 
centralisation of certain functions and 
processes has contributed operational 
efﬁ ciencies such as improved customer 
collections.
The trend in the total cost base is shown 
below. Excluding the extra costs that 
have been incurred increasing the 
capacity of the business and some 
speciﬁ c investments in 2010, since the 
second half of 2008 annualised savings 
have been made of circa £135 million.
Operating proﬁ t (before exceptional 
items)
Arising from the above operating proﬁ t 
was £22.5 million (2009: £67.7 million), 
representing a margin of 2.2% (2009: 
6.4%).
Exceptional items
During the year the Group has undertaken 
a UK restructuring programme and incurred 
exceptional charges of £15.8 million. These 
costs relate to a combination of asset 
write-downs, dilapidations, legal and 
professional fees, relocation costs, 
reorganisation costs and ancillary closure 
costs net of any onerous lease or other 
property related provision releases.

Of the net £15.8 million, £13.7 million has 
so far been expended in cash. 
As a result of the programme annualised 
rent savings have been achieved of up to 
£15 million.
Share of proﬁ t in joint ventures
The share of joint venture proﬁ ts 
attributable to Regus decreased to £1.3 
million (2009: £2.0 million). This reﬂ ects 
the acquisition of one of our JV partners 
in December 2009 which is now fully 
consolidated. 
Financing costs 
Financing costs can be summarised as 
follows:
£ million FY 2010 FY 2009
Interest payable (0.5) (1.6)
Interest receivable 1.8 2.6
Finance lease interest (0.1) (0.1)
Non-cash: 
Amortisation of 
deferred ﬁ nancing fees – (0.5)
Non-cash: UK 
acquisition related (1.4) (1.5)
Total ﬁ nancing 
costs (0.2) (1.1)
The lower interest payable of £0.5 million 
reﬂ ects costs associated with bank 
overdrafts in a limited number of countries 
and commissions on bank guarantees.
The £0.8 million decrease in interest 
receivable reﬂ ects the impact of lower 
global interest rates (reducing the Group’ s 
average yield from 1.2% to 0.9% on a lower 
average interest bearing cash balance of 
£204.8 million (2009: £219.2 million).
Finance lease costs have remained 
unchanged reﬂ ecting the continued low 
level of ﬁ nance lease liabilities held by the 
Group. The amortisation of deferred 
ﬁ nancing fees relates to the facility 
arrangement costs incurred for the new 
credit facilities entered into during 2006 
and which were voluntarily surrendered in 
April 2009 resulting in the recognition of 
an accelerated amortisation charge of 
£0.5 million in that year. The unwinding of 
discounted fair value adjustments on the 
Regus UK acquisition resulted in a non 
cash net ﬁ nancing charge of £1.4 million 
in the period to 31 December 2010 (2009 
£1.5m).
Taxation
The Group has recognised a £5.9 million 
tax charge for the period (compared to a 
tax charge of £19.2 million in the 
RG012_IFC-p13_AW.indd   11 07/04/2011   09:13 12 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010

Directors’ Report: Business Review
Financial review continued
comparative period). This includes a 
deferred tax charge of £0.5 million 
associated with the UK restructuring. 
The tax rate is 23.7%, excluding the 
exceptional item, compared to 26.9% pre 
exceptional in the comparative period. 
The deferred tax charge of £28.4 million 
includes the reversal of previously 
recognised deferred tax assets on losses, 
which no longer satisfy the Group’s 
recognition policy, giving rise to a decrease 
in the deferred tax asset from £65.1 million 
at 31 December 2009 to £37.1 million at 
31 December 2010. In addition, the Group 
has beneﬁ ted from a credit in relation to 
the settlement of a number of tax audits in 
relation to prior years. 
On a cash basis, the Group paid £15.5 
million in tax. Cash tax represents 
approximately 65% of proﬁ t before tax 
(excluding the exceptional charge). This 
arises largely because taxes paid in the year 
include ﬁ nal payments for earlier periods. 
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share for the full year before 
exceptionals have decreased to 1.9p 
(2009: 5.4p) with the impact of falling 
underlying operating proﬁ ts partially offset 
by cost savings. The average number of 
shares in issue decreased to 947,462,881 
(2009: 948,203,737) which reﬂ ects the 
net impact of the reissue of treasury 
shares held by the Group in order to 
settle the exercise of share awards 
partially offset by the impact of share 
purchases. 
Dividend
A ﬁ nal payment relating to 2009 of 
1.6p per share was paid in May 2010 
following shareholder approval (H1 2009 
1.2p per share). 
An increased interim dividend relating to 
2010 of 0.85p per share (H1 2009 0.8p) 
was paid in October 2009.
It is proposed, subject to shareholder 
approval, to pay an increased ﬁ nal 
dividend for 2010 of 1.75p (2009: 1.6p). 
This will be paid on Friday 27 May 2011 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on Tuesday 26 April 2011. 
If approved, this will represent an 8% 
increase in the full year dividend 
increasing from 2.4p per share for 2009 
to 2.6p per share for 2010.
Since 2008, Regus shareholders have 
been able to elect to receive either 
Luxembourg-sourced dividends from 
Regus plc SA (“plc”) or UK-sourced 
dividends from a UK-resident subsidiary 
of plc (the “IAS arrangements”). The IAS 
arrangements were put in place to allow 
shareholders to choose the dividend 
source which best suits their own tax 
position. 
Following various changes in relevant tax 
law and practice, however, the tax 
implications of receiving a dividend from 
either plc or a UK subsidiary should now 
be the same for most shareholders. In 
order to enable the discontinuance of the 
IAS arrangements, which are no longer 
considered necessary, Regus has 
implemented a restructuring. As a result, 
all shareholders will be paid dividends 
directly from plc, commencing with the 
ﬁ nal dividend to be paid to shareholders 
on or around Friday 27 May 2011. All 
such dividends should be payable by plc 
without deduction of Luxembourg 
withholding tax, regardless of the 
residence of the recipient. 
In general terms, UK resident 
shareholders receiving dividends from plc 
in the future should be taxed in the same 
way as if they had received a dividend 
from a UK company. Tax outcomes do, 
however, depend on the speciﬁ c 
circumstances of shareholders and any 
shareholder in doubt about their tax 
position (including in particular UK 
resident but non UK domiciled individuals 
who have elected to be taxed on a 
remittance basis) should consult their own 
professional adviser without delay.
Goodwill
Regus has £282.4 million of goodwill in 
the balance sheet principally arising from 
the purchase in August 2004 of HQ Global 
Holdings Inc. and the purchase in April 
2006 of the remaining 58% interest in the 
Regus UK business not already owned. 
Following the restructure of the UK 
business, the carrying value of the 
goodwill was tested for impairment and 
this indicated that no impairment was 
necessary. Although the short term 
performance of the business has 
worsened since the 2009 impairment 
review was carried out, the adverse 
impact of the resulting reduction in our 
anticipated future cash ﬂ ows has been 
offset by the savings arising from the UK 
restructuring. It should be noted, 
however, that the headroom in the UK 
goodwill calculations still remains low. It is 
therefore possible that a future, non-cash, 
impairment may be necessary arising 
from relatively small changes in 
assumptions.

Cash ﬂ ow 
The Group’s cash ﬂ ow statement can be summarised as follows:
Cash ﬂ ow from operations has increased 
£4.6 million from £105.1 million to £109.7 
million despite the reduction in operating 
proﬁ t. This arose from a net working 
capital inﬂ ow in 2010 in contrast to an 
outﬂ ow in 2009. 
The increase in free cash ﬂ ow is £3.3 
million arising from lower interest and tax 
payments offset by increased 
maintenance spend in our centres, in 
particular in the UK.
This cash inﬂ ow has enabled the business 
to pay an increased dividend (£23.2 
million), buy back shares (£7.3 million), 
restructure the UK (£13.7 million to 31 
December 2010) as well as invest in 
capacity growth (£54.2 million) and 
ﬁ nance the purchase of our ﬁ rst property 
(£5.5 million). In 2010 we have opened or 
acquired 125 centres. 
The net cash balance can be analysed as 
follows:
£ million FY 2010 FY 2009
Cash, cash 
equivalents and liquid 
investments 204.6 245.1
Bank and other loans (8.9) (6.0)
Finance leases (4.2) (2.1)
Net ﬁ nancial assets/
net cash 191.5 237.0
Of the balance of £191.5 million, £93.6 
million was held in Group immediately 
available for use, £65.3 million was held in 
the regions and £32.6 million is set aside 
to support letters of credit the business 
has issued and various other 
commitments of the Group.
Risk management and leasing
With the recent publication of an 
Exposure Draft on lease accounting there 
has been increased focus on the extent of 
our lease liability. While the contents of 
any potential new accounting standard 
remain uncertain it is not possible to 
estimate how or what impact on our 
ﬁ nancial statements this might have. 
However, I can provide some insight into 
our lease exposures.
Our current annual property related lease 
rentals are circa £400 million per annum 
and the minimum contractual lease 
rentals on a GAAP basis total £1,557 
million as disclosed in note 27 of our 
audited Annual accounts, the NPV of 
which is circa £1,100 million. Having 
carried out our own analysis of what we 
believe to be our actual exposure, taking 
into account commercial reality and from 
past experience, we estimate the NPV of 
our minimum lease rental to be nearer 
circa £553 million or a little less than one 
and half years of lease rental.
Principal risks and uncertainties 
The principal risks and uncertainties 
affecting Regus plc remain unchanged 
from those detailed in the Regus plc 2009 
Annual Report and Accounts.
The principal risks and uncertainties 
described in the 2010 Annual Report and 
Accounts are:
• Risk of economic downturn in 
signiﬁ cant markets;
• Exposure to movements in property 
markets;
• Exposure to movements in exchange 
rates;
• Risks associated with the Group 
reorganisation and restructuring; and
• Risk associated with centrally managed 
applications and systems.
Related parties
Details of related party transactions that 
have taken place in the period can be 
found in note 29 to the 2010 Annual 
Report and Accounts. There have been 
no changes to the type of related 
transactions entered into by the Group as 
described in the Regus plc 2009 Annual

effect on the ﬁ nancial statements for the 
period ended 31 December 2010.

Directors’ Report: Business Review
Corporate responsibility
Practicing sustainable business
Being a global business carries great 
responsibility. Even though our footprint 
is large, we seek to keep sustainability 
at the core of how we conduct business. 
Regus aims to bring employment and 
responsible investment in communities 
around the world while carefully 
considering the environment.
Our representative to the Board for 
Corporate Responsibility in organisational 
governance is the Company Secretary. 
Corporate Responsibility (CR) at Regus is 
now overseen by the Chief Sustainability 
Ofﬁ cer and our framework is based on ISO 
26000. This comprehensive standard 
provides guidance on social responsibility 
and has seven core subjects as its 
foundation – the environment; human 
rights; labour practices; consumer issues; 
fair operating practices; organisational 
governance and community involvement 
and development. It supports principles and 
guidelines of the United Nations (UN) and 
International Labour Organization (ILO). 
In supporting the three dimensions of 
sustainability – economic, social and 
environmental, CR at Regus will also 
have three dimensions – stakeholders, 
the environment, and community 
involvement and development. 
As a global company our stakeholders 
are diverse and include individuals, 
groups and organisations. Core to the 
nature of our business, key stakeholders 
for Regus are our employees, customers, 
shareholders, property agents and 
landlords, and suppliers. The health, 
safety and security of our stakeholders 
is also paramount to our business.
Our environmental considerations 
include reviewing our carbon footprint, 
waste avoidance, water usage as well as 
procurement and travel policies. In the UK 
Regus continues to make solid progress 
in its environmental performance. The 
strategy outlined in last year’s annual 
report targeted a 20% reduction in 
carbon footprint in 2010 based on our 
2007 baseline (see table opposite). Whilst 
this target was not met we did achieve a 
10.28% reduction and this coupled with 
our successful Carbon Trust Accreditation 
in May 2010 clearly demonstrates that 
we are taking our environmental impact 
and performance seriously. The emissions 
metric we are using to measure and track 
our carbon footprint is that of kg of CO
2
 
per occupied workstation, which has 
been accepted by the Carbon Trust as 
a unique measure for our business.

It remains our intention to reduce 
our carbon footprint by 50% by 
2020 using our 2007 baseline.
We recognise that we have not 
achieved our targets in waste, water 
and transport reductions as set out in 
our last annual report but in June 2010 
we introduced a behavioural change 
programme to encourage Greener 
Working. This campaign includes a 
variety of behavioural changes coupled 
with a series of energy and carbon 
saving practices across the estate. 
Each centre now has an appointed 
a Greener Working Champion whose 
primary role is to reduce energy, and
water consumption, encourage recycling 
and promote greener working amongst 
customers, clients and suppliers. Dry 
Mixed recycling was also introduced in 
2010 and is being successfully adopted 
by our staff and customers.
Our community involvement and 
development will focus on forging 
sustainable relationships with communities 
in the areas of education and skills

Results and dividends
Proﬁ t before taxation for the year was £7.8 million (2009: 
£86.9 million). 
The Directors are pleased to recommend a ﬁ nal dividend for 
2010 of £16.5 million (2009: £15.2 million), being 1.75 pence 
per share. The total dividend for the year will be made up of the 
interim dividend of 0.85 pence per share paid in October 2010

on the register at the close of business on 26 April 2011. 
Policy and practice on payment of creditors 
The Group does not follow a universal code dealing speciﬁ cally 
with payments to suppliers but, where appropriate, our practice 
is to:
• Agree the terms of payment upfront with the supplier
• Ensure that suppliers are made aware of these terms of payment
•  Pay in accordance with contractual and other legal obligations.
At 31 December 2010, the number of creditor days outstanding 
for the Group was 25 days (2009: 21 days) and the Company 
54 days (2009: 48 days).
Going Concern 
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Accounts 
on pages 32 to 74.
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the ﬁ nancial 
statements, the Directors have considered the further 
information included in the business activities commentary 
as set out on pages 8 to 9 as well as the Group’s principal 
risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 20 and 21. 
Based on the performance of the Group, its ﬁ nancial position 
and cash ﬂ ows, the Board is satisﬁ ed that the Group Is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the 
current uncertain economic outlook.
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can 
be found in note 23 to the notes to the accounts on page 57.
Employees
The Group treats applicants for employment with disabilities 
with full and fair consideration according to their skills and 
capabilities. Should an employee become disabled during their 
employment, efforts are made to retain them in their current 
employment or to explore opportunities for their retraining or 
redeployment elsewhere within the Group.

Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Corporate governance
The Board is committed to the high standards of corporate 
governance set out in the Combined Code published in June 
2008 (“the Code”) for ﬁ nancial periods beginning after 29 June 
2008. The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders 
and this report describes how the Board applied the principles 
of good governance. In its prospectus dated 8 September 2008 
the Company stated its intention to voluntarily comply with the 
Combined Code so far as it is practical for a Luxembourg 
company to do so. 
The Board
At 31 December 2010, the Board of Directors was made up of 
six members comprising the Chairman, two Executive Directors 
and three Non-Executive Directors. Biographical details of the 
Directors are set out on page 15. 
Role of the Board
The primary role of the Board is to provide entrepreneurial 
leadership and to review the overall strategic development of 
the Group. The Board approves the corporate plan and the 
annual budget and reviews performance against targets at every 
meeting. Through the Audit Committee, the Directors ensure the 
integrity of ﬁ nancial information and the effectiveness of ﬁ nancial 
controls and the internal control and risk management system. 
The Board has delegated authority to the Remuneration 
Committee to set the remuneration policy for Directors and 
senior management. The Nomination Committee recommends 
the appointment of Board Directors and has responsibility 
for succession planning at Board level. The various Board 
Committees (the “Committees”) have authority to make 
decisions in their areas of expertise. 
Frequency of meetings
There were eleven board meetings during 2010. 
The number of meetings of the Board and Committees and 
individual attendance by the Directors are shown below.

decision, to ensure that no one individual has unfettered powers 
of decision. These include:

and annual ﬁ nancial statements
• Terms of reference and membership of the Board and 
its Committees
• Changes to the Group’s capital structure
• Changes to the Group’s management and control structure

Directors, are encouraged to request inclusion of any unresolved 
concerns that they may have in the Board minutes. 
Roles of Board members
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive. 
The Chairman
Douglas Sutherland is responsible for leadership of the Board, 
setting its agenda and monitoring its effectiveness. He ensures 
effective communication with shareholders and that the Board 
is aware of the views of major shareholders. He facilitates 
both the contribution of the Non-Executive Directors and 
constructive relations between the Executive Directors and 
Non-Executive Directors. 
The Chairman, together with the Company Secretary, are 
responsible for ensuring all Directors are properly briefed on 
issues arising at Board meetings and that they have full and 
timely access to relevant information. 
The Chairman is deemed to be independent.
John Matthews retired from the Board with effect from 
18 May 2010 and was replaced as Chairman by Douglas 
Sutherland, who joined the Board in August 2008.
The Chief Executive
Mark Dixon is responsible for formulating strategy and for its 
delivery once agreed by the Board. He creates a framework 
of strategy, values, organisation and objectives to ensure the 
successful delivery of key targets, and allocates decision-making 
and responsibilities accordingly. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors each bring their own senior level 
of experience and objectivity to the Board. The independent 
counsel brought to the group by the Non-Executives enhances 
the overall decision making of the Board. Non-Executives are 
appointed for an initial three year term, subject to election by 
shareholders at each Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) after 
their appointment. 
On 18 May 2010 Martin Robinson, Senior Independent 
Non-Executive director and Chairman of the Remuneration 
committee, retired from the Board. On 31 December 2010 
Ulrich Ogiermann, Independent Non-Executive Director and

Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary, Tim Regan, is responsible for advising 
the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters 
and for ensuring that appropriate minutes are taken of all Board 
meetings and discussions. The appointment and removal of the 
Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board.

The Board has delegated the responsibility for applying an 
effective system of internal control and compliance, accurate 
external ﬁ nancial reporting, fulﬁ lling its obligations under law 
and the Combined Code, and managing the relationship with 
the Company’s external auditors to the Audit Committee. The 
Committee consists entirely of Non-Executive Directors.

The Audit Committee also meets independently with the 
Company’s auditors and with the Head of Risk Management 
to informally discuss matters of interest.
External auditors:

has recommended to the Board that a resolution to re-appoint 
KPMG Audit S.à.r.l. as the Company’s auditors be proposed 
at the AGM. The Audit Committee will continue to keep under 
review the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, 
the effectiveness of the audit process and the rotation of the 
lead audit partner.
The scope and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the 
Company’s external auditor is monitored by and, above certain 
thresholds, requires prior approval from the Audit Committee 
to ensure that the provision of non-audit services does not 
impair their independence or objectivity. During the year, KPMG

Principal risks and uncertainties
There are a number of risks and uncertainties which could have 
an impact on the Group’s long-term performance. The Group 
has a risk management structure in place designed to identify, 
manage and mitigate business risks. Risk assessment and 
evaluation is an essential part of the annual planning, budgeting 
and forecasting cycle. 
The Directors have identiﬁ ed the following principal risks and 
uncertainties affecting the company. These do not constitute 
all of the risks facing the Group. 
Economic downturn in signi cant markets
The Group has a signiﬁ cant proportion of its centres in the 
Americas (predominantly the USA) and Europe. An economic 
downturn in these markets could adversely affect the Group’s 
operating revenues thereby reducing operating performance 
or, in an extreme downturn, resulting in operating losses.
Generally, the terms on which the Group earns revenues from 
customers and pays its suppliers (principally landlords) are 
matched to reduce working capital needs. However, a reduction 
in revenues, with no immediate decline in the cost base, could 
result in signiﬁ cant funding shortfalls in the business. Any 
funding shortfall may require the Group to seek external 
funding or sell assets in the longer term.
In addition, competition may increase as a result of landlords 
offering surplus space at discounted prices and companies 
seeking to reduce their costs by sub-letting space. These 
factors could result in reduced revenue for the Group as the 
prices it is able to charge customers would be reduced. 
The Group has taken a number of actions to mitigate this risk:
• The Group has entered into performance based leases 
with landlords where rent costs vary with revenues earned 
by the centre. 
• Building lease contracts include break clauses at periodic 
intervals to allow the Group to exit leases should they become 
onerous. In cities with a number of centres this allows the 
Group to stagger leases such that an orderly reduction in 
exposure to the location may be facilitated. 
• The proﬁ le of clients in a centre is continually reviewed to 
avoid undue reliance on a particular client or clients in a 
particular industry group. 
Additionally, in the event of a downturn, the Group has a number 
of options for mitigating losses, for example by closing centres 
at lease break points. 
The Group’s strategy also focuses its growth into emerging 
markets that will reduce the proportion of the Group’s revenue 
generated from the USA and Europe over time and provide 
better protection to the Group from an economic downturn 
in a single market.
Exposure to movements in property markets
A number of the Group’s lease contracts contain market rent 
review clauses. This means that the costs of these leases may 
vary as a result of external movements in the property market. 
In particular, in the UK, lease contracts typically contain ‘upward 
only’ rent reviews which means that should open market rents 
decrease, then Regus could be exposed to paying higher than 
market rent in these locations. 
If the Group is unable to pass on increased rent costs to customers 
due to local property market conditions then this could result in 
reduced proﬁ tability or operating losses in these markets. 
Equally, for Group lease contracts without market rent review 
clauses, the Group may beneﬁ t from paying below market rent 
in a market with increasing open market rents. This may allow 
the Group to improve proﬁ tability if the movements in open 
market rents are passed on to clients.
The length of the Group’s leases (or the period after which the 
Group can exercise any break option in the leases) is usually 
signiﬁ cantly longer than the duration of the Group’s contracts 
with its customers. If demand falls, the Group may be unable 
to increase or maintain occupancy or price levels and if revenue 
declines the Group may be unable to reduce the lease cost 
base. Additional costs could be incurred if the Group disposes 
of unproﬁ table centres. 
Changes in assumptions underlying the carrying value 
of certain Group assets could result in impairment.
Regus completes a review of the carrying value of its assets 
annually to assess whether those carrying values can be 
supported by the net present value of future cash-ﬂ ows 
derived from such assets. This review examines the continued 
appropriateness of the assumptions in respect of which the 
carrying values of certain of the Group’s assets are based. This 
includes an assessment of discount rates and long-term growth 
rates, and timing and quantum of future capital expenditure. Due 
to the Group’s substantial carrying value of goodwill under IFRS, 
the revision of any of these assumptions to reﬂ ect current or 
anticipated changes in operations or the ﬁ nancial condition of the 
Group could lead to an impairment in the carrying value of certain 
assets in the Group. While impairment does not impact reported 
cash ﬂ ows, it does result in a non-cash charge in the consolidated 
income statement and thus no assurance can be given that any 
future impairments would not affect the Company’s reported 
distributable reserves and therefore its ability to make distributions 
to its shareholders or repurchase its shares. 
The Group’s geographic expansion may increase exposure 
to unpredictable economic, political and legal risks.
Political, economic and legal systems in emerging markets 
historically are less predictable than in countries with more 
developed institutional structures. As the Group increasingly 
enters into emerging markets, the value of the Group’s 
investments may be adversely affected by political, economic 
and legal developments which are beyond the Group’s control.

are generally conducted in the currency of the country in which 
they operate. The principal exposures of the Group are to the 
US dollar and the euro with approximately 38% of the Group’s 
revenues being attributable to the US dollar and 18% to the 
euro respectively. 
Given that transactions generally take place in the functional 
currency of Group companies, the Group’s exposure to 
transactional foreign exchange risk is limited. However, the 
translation into sterling of overseas proﬁ ts and net assets will be 
affected by prevailing exchange rates. In the event that either the 
US dollar or euro were to signiﬁ cantly depreciate or appreciate 
against sterling, this would have an adverse or beneﬁ cial impact 
on the Group’s reported performance and position respectively. 
The ﬁ nancial risk management objectives and policies of the 
Group, together with an analysis of the exposure to such risks 
are set out in note 23 of the Accounts. Wherever possible, the 
Group attempts to create natural hedges against currency 
exposures through matching income and expense and 
assets and liabilities in the same currency. 
Given the continued volatility in exchange rates in January 2009 
the Board approved a policy which allows the Group to hedge, 
subject to strict limits, the rates at which overseas earnings are 
translated. This will enable the Group to have more certainty 
over the sterling value of these earnings.
Group Structure
As a Jersey-incorporated company having its place of central 
administration (head ofﬁ ce) in Luxembourg and being tax 
resident in Luxembourg, Regus plc is required to comply with 
both Jersey law and Luxembourg law, where applicable. In 
addition, Regus plc’s ordinary shares are listed on the Ofﬁ cial 
List of the UKLA and admitted to trading on the main market 
of the London Stock Exchange. It is possible that conﬂ icts may 
arise between the obligations of Regus plc under the laws of 
each of these jurisdictions or between the applicable laws and 
the Listing Rules. If an irreconcilable conﬂ ict were to occur then 
Regus plc may not be able to maintain its status as a company 
tax resident in Luxembourg.
The Group manages the risk that a signiﬁ cant tax liability could 
arise by taking appropriate advice, both in carrying out the 
Group reorganisation and on an ongoing basis. In addition, the 
Group believes that under current laws and regulations the risk 
of irreconcilable conﬂ icts between current laws and regulations 
impacting Regus plc is also low.
Centrally managed applications and systems
The Group has moved to a centrally managed applications and 
systems environment with the resultant effect that all systems 
and applications are housed in a central data centre. Should the 
data centre be impacted as a result of circumstances outside 
the Group’s control there could be an adverse impact on the 
Group’s operations and therefore its ﬁ nancial results. This risk 
is managed through a detailed service arrangement with our 
external data centre provider which incorporates appropriate 
back-up procedures and controls.
Internal controls
The Board has ultimate responsibility for maintaining a 
sound system of internal control and for periodically reviewing 
its effectiveness. 
In accordance with the guidance set out in the Turnbull Report 
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code”, an ongoing process has been established for identifying, 
managing and evaluating the risks faced by the Group. The 
Group’s system of internal controls is designed to:
• facilitate an effective and efﬁ cient response to risks which 
might affect the achievement of the Group’s objectives;
• safeguard assets from inappropriate use or from loss or fraud;
• help ensure the quality of internal and external ﬁ nancial 
reporting; and
• help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
No system of internal control can provide absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The Group’s system of 
controls helps to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable 
assurance that potential problems will normally be prevented or 
will be detected in a timely manner for appropriate action.
Strategy and risk management
The Board conducts regular reviews of the Group’s strategic 
direction. Country and regional strategic objectives, quarterly 
plans and performance targets for 2011 have been set by the 
Executive Directors and are regularly reviewed by the main 
Board in the context of the Group’s overall objectives. 
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks faced by the Group. Major business risks and 
their ﬁ nancial implications are appraised by the responsible 
Executives as a part of the budget process and these are endorsed 
by regional management. Key risks are reported to the Board and 
the Audit Committee. The appropriateness of controls is considered 
by the executives, having regard to cost/beneﬁ t, materiality and the 
likelihood of risks crystallising. Key risks and actions to mitigate 
those risks are regularly considered by the Board and are formally 
reviewed and approved by the Board annually. 
Control environment
High standards of behaviour are demanded from staff at all 
levels in the Group. The following procedures are in place to 
support this:
• the induction process is used to educate new team members on 
the standards required from them in their role, including business 
ethics and compliance, regulations and internal policies;
• all team members are provided with a copy of the ‘Team 
Member Handbook’ which contains detailed guidance on 
employee policies and the standards of behaviour required 
of staff;
• policies and procedures manuals and guidelines are readily 
accessible through the Group’s intranet site; and
• operational audit and self-certiﬁ cation tools which require 
individual centre managers to conﬁ rm their adherence to 
Group policies and procedures.

www.regus.com/investor
To underpin the effectiveness of controls, it is the Group’s policy 
to recruit and develop appropriately skilled management and 
staff of high calibre, integrity and with appropriate disciplines. 
The Group has also established an externally hosted 
whistle-blowing channel to all staff to report issues and 
concerns in conﬁ dence. 
Control processes
The Company has had procedures in place throughout the year 
and up to 21 March 2011, the date of approval of this Annual 
Report, which accord with the Internal Control Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code. These include the following:
• The Board normally meets with regional executives every six 
months to carry out a wide-ranging review of Group and 
regional ﬁ nancial performance, business development 
opportunities, Group infrastructure and general Group 
management issues; 
• The annual budget process is driven from senior management 
meetings. Budgets are prepared at a detailed level by business 
centre and roll-up at a country and regional level. The Executive 
Directors review regional budgets to ensure consistency with 
regional strategic objectives, and the ﬁ nal budget is reviewed 
and approved by the Board. The approved budget forms the 
basis of business management throughout the year; 
• Operational reports and ﬁ nancial reports are prepared and 
distributed to the Board on a monthly basis. Actual results are 
reviewed against budget and forecast and explanations are 
received for all material movements; 
• Key policies and control procedures (including ﬁ nance, operations, 
and health and safety) are documented in manuals having 
Group-wide application. These are available to all staff on the 
Group’s intranet system;
• The Board has formal procedures in place for the review and 
approval of investment and acquisition projects. The Group 
Investment Committee (comprising the Executive Directors) 
reviews all investments prior to approval by the Board. 
Additionally the form and content of investment proposals 
are standardised to facilitate the review process; 
• The Group has clearly delegated authority limits with regard 
to the approval of transactions. Purchase orders must be 
obtained in advance for all purchases in excess of £1,000; and 
• Numerous reports are generated from the Group’s sales and 
operating systems on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to 
provide management at all levels with performance data for 
their area of responsibility which helps them to focus on 
operational issues that may require their input. 
Information and communications processes
The senior management team are integrally involved in the 
business and to this extent regularly discuss and address issues 
and opportunities with regional and functional teams. Formal 
business review meetings, chaired by Mark Dixon, are held with 
the regional teams and functional heads on a monthly basis.
Regular staff communications include general information on 
the business from senior management as well as operational 
guidance on changes in policies and procedures. 
Sales staff and operational management periodically attend 
regional sales or management conferences at which information 
on operational issues is shared. Delegates present the key 
messages to employees who did not attend the event. 
Monitoring effectiveness
The following key mechanisms were available to the Board at 
various times during the year in the conduct of its review of 
internal controls:
• Review of the Group’s monthly management accounts which 
contain detailed analysis of ﬁ nancial performance for the Group 
and each of the Group’s geographic reporting segments; 
• An ongoing process of review, through Board meetings, 
senior management meetings and divisional reviews as well 
as other management meetings, for the formal identiﬁ cation of 
signiﬁ cant operational risks and mitigating control processes; 
• Internal audit reviews of key risk areas. The ﬁ ndings and 
recommendations of each review are reported to 
management and the Audit Committee;
• Quarterly post-investment reviews are presented to the 
Audit Committee to allow appraisal of the effectiveness 
of investment activity; and 
• A bi-annual internal control self-assessment and management 
certiﬁ cation exercise covering the effectiveness of ﬁ nancial 
and operational controls. This is based on a comprehensive 
internal control questionnaire collated and reviewed by Internal 
Audit. Results and any necessary mitigating action plans are 
presented to senior management and the Board.
Other matters
Board Performance Evaluation
A formal evaluation of the performance of the Board was 
carried out by the Chairman. The aim is to ensure continuous 
improvement in the functioning of the Board.
Arising from the review carried out in 2010, the Board has 
agreed to ongoing development in the following areas:
• Strategy planning at Board level; and
• Submission of information to the Board. 
Training and resources 
Appropriate training is made available for all new Directors to 
assist them in the discharge of their responsibilities. Training 
is provided on an ongoing basis to meet particular needs with 
the emphasis on governance and accounting developments. 
During the year the Company Secretary, Tim Regan, provided 
updates to the Board on relevant governance matters, whilst 
the Audit Committee regularly considers new accounting 
developments through presentations from management, 
internal audit and the external auditors. The Board programme 
includes presentations from management which, together with 
site visits, increase the Non-Executive Directors understanding 
of the business and sector.

 Shareholder and Other Information
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that 
Board procedures, corporate governance and regulatory 
compliance are followed and complied with. Should a Director 
request independent professional advice to carry out his duties, 
such advice is available to him at the Company’s expense.
Directors and Of cers Insurance
The Group’s insurance programme is reviewed annually and 
appropriate insurance cover is obtained to protect the Directors 
and senior management in the event of a claim being brought 
against any of them in their capacity as Directors and ofﬁ cers 
of the Company.
Dialogue with shareholders 
Regus reports formally to shareholders twice a year, with 
the interim results announced in August/September and the 
preliminary ﬁ nal results announced normally in March. There 
are programmes for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer to give presentations of these results to the Company’s 
institutional investors, analysts and media in London and other 
locations. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer 
maintain a close dialogue with institutional investors on the 
Company’s performance, governance, plans and objectives. 
These meetings also serve to develop an ongoing understanding 
of the views and any concerns of the Company’s major 
shareholders. The Non-Executive Directors are given regular 
updates as to the views of the institutional shareholders and 
the Chairman is available to meet with these shareholders on 
request. The principal communication with private shareholders 
is through the Annual Report, the Interim Report and the AGM.
The Company has engaged the services of Brunswick Group plc 
as their Investor Relations adviser. 
AGM
The AGM will be held in May in Luxembourg and will be 
attended, other than in exceptional circumstances, by all 
members of the Board. In addition to the formal business of 
the meeting, there is normally a trading update and shareholders 
are invited to ask questions and are given the opportunity to 
meet the Directors informally afterwards. 
Notice of the AGM, together with any related documents, are 
mailed to shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
meeting and separate resolutions are proposed on each issue. 
The level of proxy votes cast and the balance for and against 
each resolution, together with the level of abstentions, if any, 
are announced to the meeting following voting by a show of 
hands. Substantial resolutions of the shareholders require a 
poll to be taken.
Financial and other information is made available on the 
Company’s website www.regus.com.
Re-election of the Board 
From 1 January 2011, all Directors submit themselves 
for re-election by shareholders annually and Directors 
appointed during the period are required to seek re-election 
at the next AGM.
Non-Executive Directors are subject to the re-election 
requirements and serve the Company under letters of 
appointment, which have an initial three-year term.
Compliance statement
The Company has complied with the provisions set out in 
section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the year ended 
31 December 2010, with the exception of the following:
• Provision D.1.1 – The Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director Lance Browne does not have regular meetings 
with major external shareholders. 
The Board considers it appropriate for the Chairman to be the 
main conduit with investors, rather than the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. The Chairman participates in investor 
meetings and makes himself available for questions, in person, 
at the time of major announcements. The Chairman regularly 
updates the Board and particularly the senior independent 
non-executive director on the results of his meetings and the 
opinions of investors. On this basis, Regus considers that the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is able to gain full 
awareness of the issues and concerns of major shareholders. 
Notwithstanding this policy, all Directors have a standing 
invitation to participate in meetings with investors.

Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Director statements
Statement of Directors responsibilities 
in respect of the annual report and 
ﬁ nancial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent company ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with Luxembourg Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice and applicable law. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the ﬁ nancial 
statements unless they are satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and their 
proﬁ t or loss for the period. 
In preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• For the Group ﬁ nancial statements, state whether they 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU;
• For the parent company ﬁ nancial statements, state whether 
applicable Luxembourg accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the parent company ﬁ nancial statements; and
• Prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the parent company 
and Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁ cient to show and explain the companies’ 
transactions and which disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the ﬁ nancial position of the parent company and 
to enable them to ensure that its ﬁ nancial statements comply 
with applicable law and regulations. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open 
to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, a Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply 
with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and ﬁ nancial information included on the 
Company’ s website. The legislation in Jersey and Luxembourg 
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁ nancial 
statements may differ from legislation by jurisdiction. 
The Directors who held ofﬁ ce at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report conﬁ rm that:
• so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditor is unaware, and
• each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
These annual accounts have been approved by the Directors 
of Regus plc. The Directors conﬁ rm that the annual accounts 
have been prepared in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations and that they include a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the parent 
company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.
We, the Directors of the Company, conﬁ rm that to the best 
of our knowledge:
• the ﬁ nancial statements prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation as a whole; and
• The Directors’ Report, including content contained by 
reference, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Issuer 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Remuneration report
The report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee 
(the “Committee”) of Regus plc (société anonyme) (the “Company”) 
and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). 
The report complies with the UK Directors’ Remuneration 
Report Regulations 2002 and, in compliance with such 
regulations, a separate resolution approving this report will be 
put to shareholders at this year’s Annual General Meeting. 
This report sets out the Company’s policy on Directors’ 
remuneration for the forthcoming year as well as information 
on remuneration paid to directors during the year.
Information relating to the emoluments and pension contributions 
of the Directors, and Directors’ interests in the Company’s shares 
and under Employee Share Plans has been audited. 
Unaudited Information
Membership and responsibilities of the Committee 
The Committee is made up of Non-Executive Directors and 
chaired by Elmar Heggen, the Company’s Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director. During the year the members of the 
Committee were:
• Elmar Heggen (appointed 1 June 2010)
• Lance Browne
• Alex Sulkowski (appointed 1 June 2010)
• Ulrich Ogiermann (resigned 31 December 2010)
• Douglas Sutherland (resigned 18 May 2010)
• Martin Robinson (resigned 18 May 2010)
The Committee met seven times during the year.
The Committee has responsibility for determining, in consultation 
with the Chairman and/or Chief Executive as appropriate, the 
total remuneration package of each executive director and 
senior manager, including bonuses, incentive payments and 
share options or other share awards.
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility to:
• determine and agree with the Board the remuneration policy 
for the Executive Directors and other senior management 
positions within the Regus Group (the “Group”); and
• approve the design of, and determine targets for, any 
performance-related pay schemes operated by the 
Company and approve the total annual payments 
made under such schemes. 
The Committee received advice on executive 
remuneration from Deloitte.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website, www.regus.com. The members of the 
Committee attend the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
and are available to answer shareholders’ questions about 
directors’ remuneration. 
Compliance with the best practice provisions
In accordance with the Board’s commitment to maintaining 
high standards of Corporate Governance, the Committee 
has complied with all remuneration-related aspects of the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance during the year. 
Remuneration policy 
The principal objectives of the Committee’s remuneration 
policy are:
• to focus on rewarding exceptional pay for exceptional 
performance: executives should be focused on delivering 
exceptional returns to shareholders over both the short and 
long term and be given the opportunity to receive exceptional 
levels of reward if such performance is delivered. Conversely 
if returns are conservative compensation levels should be 
extremely conservative. 
• to provide remuneration packages that will attract, retain and 
motivate people of the highest calibre and experience needed 
to shape and execute the Company’s strategy and to deliver 
exceptional shareholder value. 
The guiding principles which the Committee has regard to 
and balances, as far as practicable, in determining policy 
and objectives for 2010 and future years are:
•  to maintain a competitive package of total compensation, 
commensurate with comparable packages available with 
similar companies operating in similar markets;
• to make a signiﬁ cant percentage of potential maximum 
reward conditional on short and long-term performance;
• to ensure that the interests of the executives are closely 
aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders through 
the provision of share-based incentives;
• to link reward to the satisfaction of targeted objectives 
which are the main drivers of shareholder value; and
• to be sensitive in determining Executive Directors’ 
remuneration to pay and employment conditions 
throughout the Group.
In 2011, the Committee intends to review the long-term 
incentive arrangements for executive directors.
The table below illustrates the balance between ﬁ xed 
and performance-related (variable) compensation for each 
Executive Director for the year ended 31 December 2010: 
Mark Dixon
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer
Stephen Gleadle
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer 
Fixed 45.0 46.8
Variable 55.0 53.2
Fixed compensation comprises salary, beneﬁ ts and pension 
contributions. Variable compensation only comprises the total fair 
value of share awards granted in the year and the annual cash 
bonus payable in relation to the year ended 31 December 2010. 
The main elements of the packages and the performance 
conditions are described below. 
Non-Executive Directors are remunerated with fees, set at 
levels that are sufﬁ cient to attract and retain their services 
and are in line with market rates. The Non-Executive Directors 
do not receive any pension or other beneﬁ ts, other than 
appropriate expenses, nor do they participate in any bonus 
or share option schemes.

Remuneration packages 
The remuneration for Executive Directors during the year 
comprised a basic salary, a beneﬁ t package, participation in the 
annual bonus scheme and participation in the Company’s share 
incentive arrangement, the Regus plc Co-Investment Plan (“CIP”). 
For 2011, the remuneration framework for Executive Directors 
will remain unchanged with the exception that no awards will be 
made under the Co-Investment Plan. The Committee intends to 
review the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements for 
Executive Directors in 2011.
Basic salary and bene ts 
The Committee is intending to review the salaries for the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer during 2011. At the 
moment, they are unchanged from 2009, being £522,750 and 
£300,000 respectively. 
Beneﬁ ts comprise a company car or allowance, fuel, private 
medical insurance and a disturbance allowance.
Annual bonus scheme
The Committee believes ﬁ rmly in the ﬁ nancial effectiveness 
of short-term incentives. Accordingly, incentive schemes are 
widely used across the business. 
The Committee sets bonus targets and eligibility each year. 
The maximum bonus potential, for the Executive Directors, for the 
year ending 31st December 2010 was 200% of salary, consisting 
of a standard bonus (100% of salary) and a discretionary bonus 
(100% of salary) for exceptional performance.
The Committee has determined that the ﬁ nancial measures 
and targets required for the discretionary bonus were not 
achieved and therefore no bonus will be paid in respect of this 
element. The Committee has determined that there was a partial 
achievement against the criteria for the standard bonus and, as 
such, the Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer will 
each receive a cash bonus equal to 37.5% of salary (19% of 
the maximum bonus potential). The Committee believes that 
this level of payout provides a fair reward for the Company’s 
performance during the year. However, no awards will be made to 
the Executive Directors under the Co-investment Plan in 2011.
For the year ending 31 December 2011, the Committee has 
decided that the maximum bonus potential for Executive Directors 
will remain unchanged at a maximum of up to 200% of salary. 
The annual bonus will be assessed against the achievement of 
stretching short term ﬁ nancial and individual performance targets. 
It is intended that up to the ﬁ rst 100% of salary will be paid in 
cash and the remainder (up to 100% of salary) will be deferred 
for a period of up to three years and delivered in the form of 
ordinary shares in the Company. 
The vesting of the deferred element will be subject to the 
achievement of a relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) target 
over a three year period, as follows:
Regus TSR % achieved relative to 
FTSE All Share Total Return Index* % of shares vesting
100% Nil
Above 100% but below 101% 25%
For each complete 1% above 100% + 0.75%
200% or above 100%
* Over three years’ performance.
Note: The All Share index was considered the most appropriate relative 
measure, three being no obvious comparator group or sector that relates 
to the Company’s business.
The deferred shares award will be made under the LTIP section 
of CIP (discussed in more detail below). 
Bonuses are non-pensionable. 
Non-Executive Directors do not receive a bonus. 
Pension bene ts
The Executive Directors participate in the Company’s Money 
Purchase (Personal Pension) Scheme. The Company matches 
contributions up to a maximum of 7.0% of basic salary. The 
Committee considers that the pension beneﬁ ts of the Executive 
Directors are low compared with comparative companies but 
prefers to offer enhanced variable compensation (rather than 
a ﬁ xed additional pension contribution).
The Group does not operate a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme 
and has no plans to introduce such a scheme.
Long Term Incentives
Overview
The Company operates three long-term incentive plans; the CIP , 
the Regus plc Share Option Scheme and the Regus plc 2008 
Value Creation Plan (the “VCP”). 
Co-investment plan (“CIP”)
The Committee is keen to encourage Executive Directors and 
senior executives to build signiﬁ cant shareholdings in relation 
to their remuneration.
As such, as a condition of participation in the CIP , it is expected 
that members will over time build up a shareholding equivalent 
to two times their salary using shares acquired from the scheme. 
There are two elements to the CIP:
The ﬁ rst element operates in conjunction with the annual bonus 
whereby a gross bonus of up to 50% of salary will be taken as a 
deferred amount of shares (“Investment Shares”) to be released 
at the end of a deﬁ ned period of not less than three years, with 
the balance paid in cash.

 Shareholder and Other Information
Awards of Matching Shares are linked to the number of 
Investment Shares awarded and will vest depending on the 
Company’s future performance (see below). Matching Shares 
are awarded at no cost to the participants.
The maximum number of Matching Shares which can be 
awarded to a participant in any calendar year under the CIP 
is 200% of salary. As such the maximum number of Matching 
Shares which can be awarded based on Investment Shares 
awarded is in the ratio of 4:1. 
The second element of the CIP provides for the Committee to 
make stand-alone long-term incentive awards (“LTIPs”) without 
reference to annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of salary 
per calendar year. An LTIP is a conditional right over a speciﬁ ed 
number of shares with the release being dependent on the 
extent to which (if at all) the challenging performance conditions 
set by the Committee at the time of the LTIP award are satisﬁ ed.

During 2011, the Committee intends to review the Company’s 
policy on long-term incentive awards to Executive Directors. 
No awards will be made to the Executive Directors under the 
CIP in 2011.
Share Option Scheme 
The options granted to Executive Directors prior to the 
introduction of the CIP are set out below. The Company 
continues to grant options on an ad hoc basis to certain 
non-participants of the CIP .
Regus plc 2008 Value Creation Plan (the “VCP”) 
The VCP was introduced in 2008 as a one-off award with 
the objective of delivering exceptional rewards to participants 
provided absolute returns to shareholders are exceptional. 
The VCP operates over a ﬁ ve year period from May 2008 to March 
2013. Participants in the VCP are granted entitlements (“VCP 
Entitlements”) to receive a maximum number of shares which shall 
be earned by the conversion of the VCP Entitlements into an option 
or series of options (the “VCP Options”) which may be granted on 
certain dates (the “Measurement Dates”) based on the Company’ s 
share price performance. The exercise price for VCP Options will be 
the closing share price on the date of the Company’ s 2008 AGM.
VCP entitlements granted in 2008:
 Mark Dixon Stephen Gleadle
Number of shares subject 
to VCP entitlement* 3.5m 3.0m
*VCP Entitlements hold no value.
The share price of the Company will be calculated at each 
measurement date and compared against a matrix of extremely 
stretching ﬁ xed share price targets to determine the number 
of shares subject to the VCP Entitlement which a VCP Option 
will be granted over. If a lower share price target is achieved 
a VCP Option shall be granted over a lesser number of shares 
with the ability for the balance to be received at a subsequent 
measurement date subject to relevant share price targets 
being achieved.
The share price targets for the VCP Entitlements granted 
in 2008 are as set out in the following table:
Measurement date
31/03/2010 31/03/2011 31/03/2012 31/03/2013
{Shares awarded less shares already earned}
Share price less 
than £2.60 – – – –
Share price is 
more than £2.60 
but less than £3.50 2.5m 1.8m 1.2m 0.6m
Share price is 
more than £3.50 
but less than £4.50 3.5m 2.5m 1.8m 1.2m
Share price is £4.50 
or more 3.5m 2.5m 1.8m
The number of ordinary shares above are based on the entitlements of the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer. For the Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer the number of ordinary shares will 
be lower but based on the same ratios.
In respect of the ﬁ rst and second measurement dates 
(31 March 2010 and 31 March 2011, respectively), the 
Company’s share price was below the target and no VCP 
Entitlements vested.

The above graph shows the Company’s performance, 
measured by TSR for the Group compared with the 
performance of the FTSE 250 Index and the All Share Index. 
The Committee consider the FTSE 250 Index relevant since 
it is an index of companies of similar size to the Company. 
As detailed earlier in the report, the Company considers its 
TSR performance for share awards under the CIP in 
comparison to that of the All Share Index.
External appointments
As at 31 December 2010 the Executive Directors did not hold 
any external positions for which they received fees. Executive 
Directors are permitted to accept appointments on external 
boards or committees so long as these are not deemed to 
interfere with the business of the Group. Any fees received in 
respect of these appointments would be retained directly by 
the relevant Executive Director.

During the year the CIP Investment Shares awarded in March 2007 were released. All of the Matching Shares awarded in 
March 2007 (normal vesting date March 2010) failed to meet the related performance conditions and therefore lapsed.
The market price of the Company’ s ordinary shares at 31 December 2010 was 86.3p and the range during the year was 66.05p to 120p.
None of the Directors had a beneﬁ cial interest in any contract of any signiﬁ cance in relation to the business of the Company 
or its subsidiaries at any time during the ﬁ nancial year.
Annual resolution
Shareholders will be given the opportunity to approve the Remuneration Report at the AGM on 17 May 2011.
Audit requirement 
Under Luxembourg law and regulations there is no requirement for the sections on Directors’ remuneration, shareholdings and 
pension beneﬁ ts on pages 28 to 30 inclusive to be audited; therefore all sections of the Remuneration Report are un-audited.

Auditors report
REPORT OF THE RÉVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGRÉÉ
Report on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements of Regus plc (société anonyme), which comprise 
the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2010 
and the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and cash ﬂ ows for the year then 
ended, and a summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information.
Board of Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and 
fair presentation of these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control 
as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of consolidated ﬁ nancial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Responsibility of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
as adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance 
du Secteur Financier. Those standards require that we comply 
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on the judgement 
of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk 
assessments, the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé considers internal 
control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation 
of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not 
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating 
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board 
of Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of 
the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁ cient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
To the Shareholders of 
Regus plc S.A.
26, Boulevard Royal
L-2449 Luxembourg
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements give 
a true and fair view of the consolidated ﬁ nancial position of 
Regus plc (société anonyme) as of 31 December 2010, and 
of its consolidated ﬁ nancial performance and its consolidated 
cash ﬂ ows for the year then ended, in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
The consolidated Directors’ report, which is the responsibility 
of the Board of Directors, is consistent with the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements.

 Shareholder and Other Information
1. Authorisation of ﬁ nancial statements
The Group and Company ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2010 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 21 March 2011 and the balance sheets were signed 
on the Board’s behalf by Mark Dixon and Stephen Gleadle. Regus 
plc S.A. is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey and 
registered and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company’s ordinary 
shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted 
IFRSs”). The Company prepares its parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with Luxembourg GAAP; extracts 
from these are presented on page 76.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group ﬁ nancial statements consolidate those of the parent 
company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) 
and equity account the Group’s interest in the associate and 
jointly controlled entities. The extract from the parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements presents information about the Company 
as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise 
stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in 
these Group ﬁ nancial statements. Amendments to adopted 
IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) with an effective date from 1 January 2010 
did not have a material effect on the Group ﬁ nancial statements.
• IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised) and IAS 27 
Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (Amended); 
the revised business combinations standard introduces 
signiﬁ cant changes in the accounting for business combinations. 
Changes affect the valuation of non-controlling interests, the 
accounting for transaction costs, the initial recognition and 
subsequent measurement of contingent consideration and 
business combinations achieved in stages. These changes will 
impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in 
the period that an acquisition occurs and future reported results.
• IAS 27 (Amended) requires that a change in the ownership 
interest of a subsidiary (without loss of control) is accounted 
for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners. 
Therefore such transactions will no longer give rise to goodwill, 
nor will they give rise to a gain or loss. Furthermore the 
amended standard changes the accounting for losses 
incurred by a subsidiary as well as the loss of control of 
a subsidiary. The changes by IFRS 3 Revised and IAS 27 
(Amended) will affect future acquisitions or loss of control of 
subsidiaries and transactions with non-controlling interests. 
• IFRS 2 Share Based Payment – Group Cash-Settled Share 
Based Payment Transactions; the standard has been amended 
to clarify the accounting for Group cash-settled share based 
payment transactions. This amendment also supersedes IFRIC 8 
and IFRIC 11. The adoption of this amendment did not have any 
impact on the ﬁ nancial position or performance of the Group.
• Improvements to IFRSs in April 2009; the International 
Accounting Standards Board issued its second omnibus 
of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to 
removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording. The adoption 
of these amendments, which are effective from 1 January 
2010, did not have any impact on the ﬁ nancial position or 
performance of the Group.
• IFRIC 17 Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners; this 
interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements 
whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders 
either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends. The 
interpretation had no effect on the ﬁ nancial position or 
performance of the Group
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these 
accounting policies that have signiﬁ cant effect on the ﬁ nancial 
statements and estimates with a signiﬁ cant risk of material 
adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 31.
The ﬁ nancial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, 
with the exception of certain ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities that 
are measured at fair value. 
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the Accounts on 
pages 32 to 75.
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the ﬁ nancial 
statements, the Directors have considered the further information 
included in the business activities commentary as set out on 
pages 8 to 9 as well as the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties 
as set out on pages 20 and 21. 
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can 
be found in note 23 to the notes to the accounts on page 58.
The Group and Company ﬁ nancial statements are presented 
in pounds sterling and all values are in million pounds, rounded 
to one decimal place, except where indicated otherwise.
The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed 
of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has signiﬁ cant 
inﬂ uence, but not control, over the ﬁ nancial and operating 
policies. The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include the 
Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense of 
associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that 
signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence commences until the date that signiﬁ cant 
inﬂ uence ceases or the associate qualiﬁ es as a disposal Group 
at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value 
less costs to sell and carrying value.

2. Accounting policies continued
Joint ventures include jointly controlled entities that are those 
entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, 
established by contractual agreement. The consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements include the Group’s share of the total 
recognised gains and losses of jointly controlled entities on 
an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control 
commences until the date that joint control ceases or the jointly 
controlled entity qualiﬁ es as a disposal Group at which point the 
investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell 
and carrying value. 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint 
venture, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and 
recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent 
that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations 
or made payments on behalf of a joint venture.
On 19 April 2006 the Group acquired the remaining 58% of the 
shares of the UK business that were not already owned by the 
Group. As a result the Group fully consolidated the UK business 
from that date. The acquisition was accounted for through the 
purchase method and as a consequence the entire assets and 
liabilities of the UK business were revalued to fair value. The 
effect of these adjustments on the 42% of the UK business 
already owned was reﬂ ected in the revaluation reserve.
On 14 October 2008, Regus plc acquired the entire share capital 
of Regus Group plc in exchange for the issue of new shares of 
Regus plc on the basis of one share in Regus plc for one share 
held previously in Regus Group plc. At the date of the transaction, 
Regus plc had nominal assets and liabilities and therefore the 
transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Regus 
plc by Regus Group plc. Consequently no fair value acquisition 
adjustments were required and the aggregate of the Group 
reserves have been attributed to Regus plc.
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase 
method. Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of 
acquisition over the share of the fair value of identiﬁ able assets 
(including intangible assets), liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date 
of acquisition.
Business combinations that took place prior to the Group’ s transition 
date to IFRS on 1 January 2004 have not been restated under 
the requirements of IFRS.
Positive goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment 
in value. An impairment test is carried out annually and, in 
addition, whenever indicators exist that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. Positive goodwill is allocated to cash 
generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. 
Adopted IFRSs not yet applied
The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not 
been applied by the Group in these ﬁ nancial statements. Their 
adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the ﬁ nancial 
statements unless otherwise indicated:
•  Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation: 
Classiﬁ cation of Rights issues (mandatory for years 
commencing on or after 1 February 2010).
•  IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity 
Instruments’ (mandatory for years commencing on or after 
1 July 2010). 
•  Amendments to IFRIC 14 IAS 19 ‘The limit on a deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t – assets, minimum funding requirements and their 
interaction (mandatory for years commencing on or after 
1 January 2011). 
•  Revised IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosure’ (mandatory 
for years commencing on or after 1 January 2011). 
•  Improvements to IFRSs (issued May 2010) (mandatory for years 
commencing on or after 1 July 2010 or 1 January 2011).
The Group did not adopt any standards, interpretations and 
amendments to standards which were available for optional 
early adoption and relevant to the Group.
The adoption of any of the above standards or amendments 
to standards is not expected to have a material impact on the 
Group’s ﬁ nancial statements.
The Group will be adopting the above standards or 
amendments at the year ended 31 December 2011.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists 
when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern 
the ﬁ nancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
beneﬁ ts from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into 
account. The ﬁ nancial statements of subsidiaries are included in 
the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements from the date that control 
commences. The results are consolidated until the date control 
ceases or the subsidiary qualiﬁ es as a disposal group at which 
point the assets and liabilities are carried at the lower of fair 
value less costs to sell and carrying value.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets other than deferred 
tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have an indeﬁ nite useful 
life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the 
recoverable amount was estimated at 31 October 2010 and 
updated in February 2011.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of 
an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units 
are allocated ﬁ rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the cash generating unit and then to reduce the 
carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. 
A cash generating unit is the smallest identiﬁ able group of assets 
that generates cash inﬂ ows that are largely independent of the 
cash inﬂ ows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of relevant assets is the greater of their 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their 
RG012_p32-79_vAW.indd   38 07/04/2011   09:16  Business Review Corporate Gover nance Financial Statements

www.regus.com/investor
 Shareholder and Other Information
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂ ects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
speciﬁ c to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inﬂ ows, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from the business are 
capitalised at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of an 
acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from 
goodwill if their fair value can be identiﬁ ed and measured 
reliably on initial recognition.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the 
estimated useful life of the assets as follows:
Brand – Regus brand Indeﬁ nite life
Brand – Other acquired brands 20 years
Computer software 3 – 5 years
Customer lists 1 – 2 years
Management agreements Minimum duration of the 
contract
Amortisation of intangible assets is expensed through 
administration expenses in the income statement.
Leases
Plant and equipment leases for which the Group assumes 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nance leases. All other leases, including all of the 
Group’s property leases, are categorised as operating leases.
Finance leases
Plant and equipment acquired by way of a ﬁ nance lease is capitalised 
at the commencement of the lease at the lower of its fair value and 
the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception. 
Future payments under ﬁ nance leases are included in creditors, 
net of any future ﬁ nance charges. Minimum lease payments are 
apportioned between the ﬁ nance charge and the reduction of the 
outstanding liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income 
statement over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating leases
Minimum lease payments under operating leases are recognised 
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term. Lease incentives and rent free periods are included in the 
calculation of minimum lease payments. The commencement of 
the lease term is the date from which the Group is entitled to use 
the leased asset. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of 
the lease, together with any further periods for which the Group 
has the option to continue to lease the asset and when at the 
inception of the lease it is reasonably certain that the Group will 
exercise that option.
Contingent rentals include rent increases based on future 
inﬂ ation indices or non-guaranteed rental payments based on 
centre turnover or proﬁ tability and are excluded from the 
calculation of minimum lease payments. Contingent rentals are 
recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.
Onerous lease provisions are an estimate of the net amounts 
payable under the terms of the lease to the ﬁ rst break point, 
discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital.
Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are those items which are separately 
disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance. Such items 
are included within the income statement caption to which they 
relate, and are separately disclosed either in the notes to the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements or on the face of the 
consolidated income statement. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the 
assets as follows:
Buildings 20 years
Fixtures and ﬁ ttings Over the shorter of the 
lease term and 10 years
Furniture 10 years
Ofﬁ ce equipment and telephones 5 – 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Computer hardware 3 – 5 years
Revenue
Revenue from the provision of services to customers is measured 
at the fair value of consideration received or receivable (excluding 
sales taxes). Where rent free periods are granted to customers, 
rental income is spread on a straight line basis over the length 
of the customer contract.
Workstations
Workstation revenue is recognised when the provision of the 
service is rendered. Amounts invoiced in advance are deferred 
and recognised as revenue upon provision of the service.
Customer service income
Service income (including the rental of meeting rooms) is recognised 
as services are rendered. In circumstances where Regus acts as an 
agent for the sale and purchase of goods to customers, only the 
commission fee earned is recognised as revenue.
Management and franchise fees
Fees received for the provision of initial and subsequent services 
are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered. Fees 
charged for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, 
or for other services provided during the period of the 
agreement, are recognised as revenue as the services 
are provided or the rights used.
Membership card income
Revenue from the sale of membership cards is deferred and 
recognised over the period that the beneﬁ ts of the membership 
card are expected to be provided.
These categories represent all material sources of revenue 
earned from the provision of global workplace solutions.
Employee bene ts
The Group’s contributions to deﬁ ned contribution plans and 
other paid and unpaid beneﬁ ts earned by employees are 
charged to the income statement as incurred.

2. Accounting policies continued
Share based payments
The share option programme entitles certain employees and 
directors to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company; 
these awards are granted by the ultimate parent.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee 
expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value 
is measured at grant date and spread over the period during 
which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the 
options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using 
the Black-Scholes valuation model or the Monte Carlo method, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂ ect the 
actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture 
is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Share appreciation rights (CIP) are also granted by the Company 
to certain employees. The fair value of the amount payable to 
the employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The fair value is initially recognised at grant 
date and spread over the period during which the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to payment. The fair value of the 
share appreciation rights is measured based on the Monte Carlo 
valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the instruments were granted. 
The Group also operates a Value Creation Plan which awards 
entitlements to certain employees and directors of the Group. 
These entitlements are convertible into options over ordinary shares 
subject to the Group’s share price reaching certain targets. 
The fair value of the amount payable to the employee is 
recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in 
equity. The fair value is initially recognised at the date of the 
award of the entitlements and spread over the period during 
which the entitlements are convertible into ordinary shares.
The fair value of the entitlements is based on the Monte Carlo 
valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the instruments were granted.
Taxation
Tax on the proﬁ t for the year comprises current and deferred tax. 
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income 
for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in 
respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁ nancial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The 
following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets and 
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁ t other 
than in a business combination; and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax 
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement 
of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable proﬁ ts will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied 
by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle 
its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable 
that an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle 
the obligation.
Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a 
business reorganisation where the plans are sufﬁ ciently detailed 
and well advanced and where the appropriate communication to 
those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for onerous contracts to the extent that the 
unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract 
exceed the economic beneﬁ ts expected to be delivered, discounted 
using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital.
Finance charges
Interest charges and income are accounted for in the income 
statement on an accruals basis. Financing transaction costs that 
relate to ﬁ nancial liabilities are charged to interest expense using 
the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the 
carrying value of the related ﬁ nancial liability on the balance sheet. 
Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised as 
a prepayment and recognised through the ﬁ nance expense over 
the term of the facility. In the event of a facility being drawn the 
relevant unamortised portion of the fee is recognised within the 
carrying value of the ﬁ nancial liability and charged to the interest 
expense using the effective interest rate method.
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are 
carried at net present value, the increase in the amount due to 
unwinding the discount is recognised as a ﬁ nance expense or 
ﬁ nance income as appropriate.
Interest bearing borrowings and other  nancial liabilities 
Financial liabilities, including interest bearing borrowings, are 
recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction 
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, ﬁ nancial liabilities are 
stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and 
redemption value being recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
The Group derecognises ﬁ nancial liabilities when the Group’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Financial liabilities are classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nancial liabilities at fair value 
through proﬁ t or loss where the liability is either held for trading 
or is designated as held at fair value through proﬁ t or loss on 
initial recognition. Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁ t 
or loss are stated at fair value with any resultant gain or loss 
recognised in the income statement.

 Shareholder and Other Information
Financial assets
Financial assets are classiﬁ ed as either at fair value through proﬁ t 
or loss, held to maturity investments, available for sale ﬁ nancial 
assets or loans and receivables. The classiﬁ cation depends on 
the nature and purpose of the ﬁ nancial assets and is determined 
on initial recognition.
Trade and other receivables that have ﬁ xed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an active market are classiﬁ ed 
as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less 
any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the 
effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when 
recognition would be immaterial.
Liquid investments compose held to maturity bonds and deposits.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
using the closing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date 
and the gains or losses on translation are taken to the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The 
results and cash ﬂ ows of overseas operations are translated 
using the average rate for the period. Assets and liabilities, 
including goodwill and fair value adjustments, of overseas 
operations are translated using the closing rate with all exchange 
differences arising on consolidation being recognised in the 
foreign currency translation reserve. Exchange differences are 
released to the income statement on disposal. Under the 
transition requirements of IFRS, cumulative translation differences 
for all foreign operations have been set to zero at 1 January 2004.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand 
and are subject to an insigniﬁ cant risk of changes in value.
Derivative  nancial instruments
The Group’s policy on the use of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments 
can be found in note 23. Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are 
measured initially at fair value and changes in the fair value are 
recognised through proﬁ t or loss unless the derivative ﬁ nancial 
instrument has been designated as a cash ﬂ ow hedge whereby the 
effective portion of changes in the fair value are deferred in equity.

3. Segmental analysis – statutory basis
An operating segment is a component of the Group that 
engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues 
and incur expenses, including those that relate to transactions 
with other operating segments. An operating segment’s results 
are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the 
Board of Directors of the Group) to make decisions about resources 
to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and 
for which discrete ﬁ nancial information is available.
The business is run on a worldwide basis but managed through 
four principal geographical segments; Americas; Europe, Middle 
East and Africa (EMEA); Asia Paciﬁ c; and the United Kingdom. 
The United Kingdom segment does not include the Group’s 
non-trading holding and corporate management companies that 
are based in the UK and the EMEA segment does not include 
the Group’s non-trading head ofﬁ ce and holding companies that 
are based in Luxembourg. The results of business centres in 
each of these regions form the basis for reporting geographical 
results to the chief operating decision maker. All reportable segments 
are involved in the provision of global workplace solutions.
The Group’s reportable segments operate in different markets 
and are managed separately because of the different economic 
characteristics that exist in each of those markets. Each 
reportable segment has its own discrete senior management 
team responsible for the performance of the segment.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the 
same as those described in the Annual Report and Accounts 
for Regus plc for the year ended 31 December 2009. The 
performance of each segment is assessed on the basis of the 
segment operating proﬁ t which excludes certain non-recurring 
items (including provisions for onerous contracts and asset 
write-downs), exceptional gains and losses, internal management 
charges and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on 
transactions with other operating segments.

therefore, in the Group’s view are differentiated from other on-going charges within the operations of the business.

4. Segmental analysis – entity-wide disclosures
The Group’s primary activity and only business segment is the provision of global workplace solutions and therefore all revenue is attributed 
to a single Group of similar products and services. It is not meaningful to separate this Group into further categories of products. Revenue 
is recognised where the service is provided.
The Group has a diversiﬁ ed customer base and no single customer contributes a material percentage of the Group’s revenue.

 Shareholder and Other Information
During the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group undertook a UK restructuring programme at a net cost of £15.8 million. This 
balance consists of expenditure on the following categories: asset write down, reorganisation costs, space reduction costs, centre 
closure costs and other costs. An onerous lease and other property related provisions, which were identiﬁ ed during the restructure 
as being no longer required, were released. 
During the year ended 31 December 2009 the Group received a net amount of £18.3 million in relation to the settlement of a dispute 
with a supplier. The amount represents the cash received in settlement of the dispute less the directly attributable costs associated 
with the successful outcome of the negotiations. 
In December 2009 the Group initiated a new restructuring plan to develop and accelerate the actions which had commenced in 
2009 focused on the simpliﬁ cation and rationalisation of the sales and back ofﬁ ce processes and to address the parts of the Regus 
network not generating a sufﬁ cient level of proﬁ tability. In the year ended 31 December 2009, charges of £2.6 million were 
recognised in relation to the delivery of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the restructuring plan. 
The above items have been reported as exceptional items and are disclosed separately as they are relevant to the understanding 
of the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance.

Deferred tax assets recognised on short-term temporary differences consist predominantly of provisions deductible when paid and 
share based payments. Deferred tax assets have been recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities on the basis that there are 
forecast taxable proﬁ ts in the entities concerned.
At the balance sheet date, the temporary difference arising from unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries was £64.3 million 
(2009: £46.6 million). The only tax that would arise on these reserves would be non-creditable withholding tax.

12. Goodwill continued
Cash generating units (CGUs), comprising individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purpose of carrying 
out impairment reviews of non-current assets as this is the lowest level at which goodwill can be assessed. Goodwill acquired through 
business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash ﬂ ows of these CGUs.
The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows:
2010
£m
2009
£m
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Americas business segment 168.8 153.2 
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the EMEA business segment 6.6 5.4 
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Asia Paciﬁ c business segment 11.1 10.2 
Carrying amount of goodwill included within the UK business segment 95.9 90.3 
282.4 259.1 
The carrying value of goodwill and indeﬁ nite lived intangibles allocated to two CGUs, the USA and UK, is material relative to the total 
carrying value comprising 90% of the total. The remaining 10% of the carrying value is allocated to a further 23 countries (23 cash 
generating units). The goodwill and indeﬁ nite lived intangibles allocated to the USA and the UK cash generating units are set out below:
Goodwill

Other cash generating units 38.4 – 38.4 27.9 
282.4 11.2 293.6 270.3 
The indeﬁ nite lived intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business 
in the year ended 31 December 2006 (see note 13).
The recoverable amount of each of the CGUs above has been determined based on their value in use, calculated as the present 
value of future cash ﬂ ows attributable to the unit.
The value in use for each CGU has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each unit from the 
value in use of the Group as a whole. Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management it also reﬂ ects 
external factors, such as capital market risk pricing as reﬂ ected in the market capitalisation of the Group and prevailing tax rates, which 
have been used to determine the risk adjusted discount rate for the Group. While management believe that the projected cashﬂ ows are 
a reasonable reﬂ ection of the likely outcomes over the medium to long term, in the event that trading conditions deteriorate beyond the 
assumptions used in the projected cashﬂ ows, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods.
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each Group of CGUs:
• Future cash ﬂ ows are based on budget for 2011 approved by the Board. The model excludes cost savings and restructurings that 
are anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use. Thereafter forecasts have been 
prepared by management for a further four years from 2012 that reﬂ ect an average annual growth rate of 3-5.4% and an increase 
in gross margins driven by improving global economic conditions from 2011. This compared to forecasts used in the evaluation in 
the year ended 31 December 2009 that projected 3-5.5% growth but reﬂ ected a higher level of baseline cash ﬂ ows. 
• These forecasts exclude the impact of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods. As a result 
gross margins and real operating proﬁ ts at the end of the ﬁ ve year period remain either at or below the levels achieved in the year 
ended 31 December 2008. Management consider these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the 
mid-cycle position reﬂ ecting the current uncertain global economic conditions. Cash ﬂ ows beyond 2015 have been extrapolated 
using a 2.25% growth rate which management believe is a reasonable long term growth rate for any of the markets in which the 
relevant CGUs operate. A terminal value is included in the assessment reﬂ ecting the Group’s expectation that it will continue to 
operate in these markets and the long term nature of the businesses.

 Shareholder and Other Information
• The Group conducts a market risk assessment of CGUs in each country, with a country speciﬁ c pre-tax discount rate being 
applied to the future pre-tax cash ﬂ ows for each CGU based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital for the Group. 
This was unchanged from 2009 at 9%. The underlying pre-tax rate therefore reﬂ ects current market assessments of the Group 
as a whole and is adjusted for risks speciﬁ c to such businesses in each country, giving a risk adjusted range of 12% to 17% 
(2009: 12% to 17%) for the underlying CGUs. A detailed review has been performed of the ‘value in use’ models and the 
appropriate rate at which its cash ﬂ ows are discounted for impairment test purposes. The market risk adjustments added 
to the underlying CGU discount rates remain unchanged from 2009.
The trading conditions in which the Group operates are subject to competitive and economic pressures that can have a material 
effect on the operating performance of the business. Current market conditions remain challenging for the Group and the current 
global conditions makes forecasting medium term cash ﬂ ows more difﬁ cult than is traditionally the case. The forecast cash ﬂ ows 
used to derive the value in use are sensitive to changes in revenues (driven by changes in prices, occupancy or a combination 
of both), costs and discount rates (including the market assessment of the risks of the Group reﬂ ected in the Group’s market 
capitalisation). Actual conditions could result in either better or worse cash ﬂ ows than included in the value in use calculation. 
Should current economic conditions prove to be more severe or more prolonged than currently expected this would adversely 
impact the forecast cash ﬂ ows and could result in impairments to goodwill and indeﬁ nite lived intangible assets in future periods. 
The amount by which the value in use exceeds the carrying amount of the US CGU is sufﬁ ciently large to enable the Directors to 
conclude that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge for this CGU. The key 
assumptions used in the US model are that in 2011 the forecast centre contribution rises to 24% from 18%. Revenue and costs grow 
at 3% per annum from 2011 giving a terminal 2015 centre gross margin of 26%. Thereafter a 2.25% long-term growth rate is assumed 
on revenue and cost into perpetuity. The cash ﬂ ows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 12% (2009: 12%).
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a signiﬁ cant nature so as to result in most cash 
generating units carrying amount exceeding their recoverable amount. For the UK CGUs, however, a reasonably possible change 
in the key assumptions used to determine the cash generating unit’s recoverable amount could cause the unit’s carrying amount 
to exceed its value in use.
For the UK, the goodwill and the indeﬁ nite life intangible brand in this CGU arose on acquisitions completed in 2006 – principally 
the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business. The value in use exceeded its carrying amount by £37 million (2009: 
£20 million) and therefore no impairment was necessary at 31 December 2010. During the year the Group re-negotiated a number 
of lease commitments, this has signiﬁ cantly lowered its cost base and contributed to the margin improvement in the forecast period.
The forecast cash ﬂ ows assume an interim recovery reverting to mid-cycle revenue and occupancy being achieved in 2015 prior to 
the application of the long-run growth rate and the discount rate used. Our model incorporates a recovery in pricing but not at the 
same rate as the decline in pricing experienced in recent years, the terminal value assumed in 2015 is below that experienced in 
2008. Whilst occupancy levels are forecast to increase over the period, the level set for the terminal value calculation represents 
a mid-cycle occupancy. Revenue over the forecast period grows at an average of 5.4% p.a. from 2010. All other variables held 
constant, a reduction in the growth rate of 0.5% would result in the carrying amount being equal to the value in use. Management 
maintain that this would be offset by an increase in occupancy so that the carrying amount would be greater than the value in use. 
A fall of 1.6% in the average gross margins from 2011 in the forecast period would result in the recoverable amount being equal to 
the carrying amount. Similar to 2009 the model assumes a mid-cycle gross margin in 2015 of 17%. A reduction to 15% would result 
in the value in use being equal to the carrying amount. The cash ﬂ ows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 14% 
(2009:14%). The discount rate used is based on a risk adjusted Group WACC, reﬂ ecting the speciﬁ c risk proﬁ le of the UK business 
such as the greater degree of competition in the UK market. An increase in the pre-tax discount rate used from 14% to 17.5% 
would result in its value in use being equal to its carrying amount.
There is no goodwill relating to the Group’s joint ventures.

Included with the brand value is £11.2 million relating to the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended 
31 December 2006. The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indeﬁ nite useful life due to the fact that 
the value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indeﬁ nite useful life no amortisation is charged but 
the carrying value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis. The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the 
recoverable amount of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business 
(see note 12). The remaining amortisation life for non-indeﬁ nate life brands is 14 years.

and not available for use by the business.
Liquid investments represent corporate bonds and cash placed on deposit by the Group with a maturity over three months. Non-cash 
changes comprise the amortisation of debt issue costs, new ﬁ nance leases entered into and movements in debt maturity.
23. Financial instruments and ﬁ nancial risk management
The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to ﬁ nancial instruments and the management of capital 
are determined at Group level. The Group’s Board maintains responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer is responsible for policy on a day to day basis. The Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and Group Treasurer review the 
Group’s risk management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis. The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee 
the responsibility for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. 
The Audit Committee is supported by the Head of Risk Management in performing this role.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business. The principal ﬁ nancial instruments used 
by the Group to ﬁ nance its operations are cash and loans.
Going concern
The Business Review on pages 8 to 9 of the Report and Accounts sets out the Group’s strategy and the factors that are likely 
to affect the future performance and position of the business. The ﬁ nancial review on pages 10 to 13 within the Business Review 
reviews the trading performance, ﬁ nancial position and cash ﬂ ows of the Group. A feature of the Group has been its strong cash 
ﬂ ows and during the year ended 31 December 2010, despite the difﬁ cult trading conditions, the Group has maintained its cash 
levels at comparable levels to the position at the start of the ﬁ nancial year. Although many countries that the Group operates in 
continue to experience difﬁ cult economic conditions, the directors believe that the Group is taking the necessary actions and 
expect to strengthen the current market leading position of the Group. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report 
and accounts.
Following an internal review of the Group’s facility arrangements in March 2009, and given the strength of the Group’s cash position, 
the Board approved the early surrender of the £100 million revolving credit facility. This decision does not impact the judgment of 
the directors that it is appropriate for the Group to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these accounts.

Credit risk
Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a ﬁ nancial instrument and arises 
principally in relation to customer contracts and the Group’s cash deposits.
A diversiﬁ ed customer base and requirement for customer deposits and payments in advance on workstation contracts which 
contribute the majority of the Group’s revenue minimise the Group’s exposure to customer credit risk. No single customer contributes 
a material percentage of the Group’s revenue. The Group’s policy is to provide against trade receivables when speciﬁ c debts are 
judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced. A provision is created where debts are more 
than three months overdue which reﬂ ects the Group’s historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables. 
These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.
Cash assets and derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management 
does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, analysed by geographic region, is summarised below:

At the year end 31 December 2010, the Group maintained a provision of £11.8 million against potential bad debts (2009: £14.1 million) 
arising from trade receivables. The Group had provided £4.1 million (2009 £14.1 million) in the year and utilised £7.0 million (2009 
£7.1 million).
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority 
of its revenue in advance of the provision of ofﬁ ce services and requires deposits from its customers.

Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by reviewing its global cash position on a weekly basis and expects to have sufﬁ cient liquidity to meet 
its ﬁ nancial obligations as they fall due. The Group has free cash and liquid investments (excluding blocked cash) of £172.0 million 
(2009: £180.8 million) which the directors consider adequate to meet the Group’s day to day requirements.
In November 2010 the Group signed a three-year unsecured £80 million Bank Guarantee & Letter of Credit facility with Lloyds TSB bank. 
This will allow the Group to release cash previously set aside to support guarantees. The facility is subject to ﬁ nancial covenants 
covering operating cash-ﬂ ows, the ratio of Gross Debt to consolidated tangible net worth and the ratio of EBITDAR to net interest 
and rental charges.
The Group’s undrawn senior committed facility of £100 million was scheduled to expire on 19 March 2011, subject to the Group 
continuing to comply with the covenants of the facility agreement. The covenants included the ratio of net debt to EBITDA; the ratio 
of cash ﬂ ow to net debt service (including net interest expense and scheduled debt repayments) and the ratio of EBITDAR to net 
interest and rental charges. 
In March 2009, the Board approved the early surrender of the £100.0 million revolving credit facility following an internal review 
of the Group’s facility arrangements. Of the facility approximately £50.0 million had been set aside to support bank guarantees 
provided against obligations of the Group. In order to continue to support these, the Group deposited sufﬁ cient funds with the 
guaranteeing banks which reduced free cash available for use by an equivalent amount. In so doing the directors considered the 
Group’s forecast and sensitised cash ﬂ ow projections and do not believe that this will have an adverse impact on the Group’s 
liquidity given the strength of the Group’s cash position.
Although the Group has net current liabilities of £75.2 million (2009: £46.5 million) the Group does not consider that this gives 
rise to a liquidity risk. A large proportion of the net current liabilities comprise non-cash liabilities such as deferred income that will 
be recognised in future periods through the income statement. Although the Group holds customer deposits of £163.2 million 
(2009;£149.3 million) these are spread across a large number of customers and no deposit held for an individual customer 
is material. Therefore the Group does not believe the balance represents a liquidity risk. 
The net current assets, excluding deferred income, were £50.6 million at 31 December 2010 (2009: £68.2 million). It is considered 
appropriate to exclude deferred income in assessing the liquidity of the Group as it reﬂ ects the future non-refundable contractual 
revenue of the Group to be recognised as revenue in future periods.
Market risk
Interest rate risk
Surplus cash balances are invested to achieve maximum interest returns on a day to day basis. In order to maximise interest returns, 
surplus cash is also invested in AAA-rated corporate bonds and deposits with a maturity in excess of three months. At the balance 
sheet date no corporate bond or deposit had a maturity in excess of three months. Whenever possible, and subject to the operational 
requirements of the Group, cash is repatriated to the head ofﬁ ce and managed by the Group Treasury department.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal as the majority of day to day transactions of overseas 
subsidiaries are carried out in local currency. Working capital balances are generally held in the functional currency of the overseas 
subsidiary and therefore the impact of the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities in the income statement of overseas 
subsidiaries is not considered to have a material impact on the Group.
The majority of the Group’s net assets are in pounds sterling, US dollars and euros. During the year ended 31 December 2010 the 
Group continued the policy of partially hedging the translation effect of certain proﬁ ts incurred in foreign currencies (including the US 
dollar, euro, Japanese yen and certain East European currencies). The policy aimed to reduce the impact on the reported proﬁ ts of 
the Group from changes in the value of pounds sterling against the hedged currencies. As at 31 December 2010, all foreign exchange 
derivative ﬁ nancial instruments had matured and no open positions were held.
Historically the Group has occasionally used derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency ﬂ uctuations, 
although natural hedges limit the exposure to these risks. In the year ended 31 December 2010, the Group used derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments to manage the translation risk of certain foreign currencies on the reported proﬁ ts of the Group. 
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Other market risks
The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices.

 Shareholder and Other Information
Capital management
The Group’s parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base. The 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer monitors the diversity of the Group’s major shareholders and further details of the Group’s communication with 
key investors can be found in the corporate governance report on pages 18 to 23. In 2006, the Board approved the commencement 
of a progressive dividend policy to enhance the total return to shareholders.
The Group’s Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, Mark Dixon, is the major shareholder of the Company and all executive members of the Board 
hold shares in the Company. Details of the Directors’ shareholdings can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee on 
pages 25 to 30. In addition the Group operates various share option plans for key management and other senior employees.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a resolution for the Group to re-purchase up to 10% of its issued share 
capital in the market. In June 2007, the Group commenced a share buyback programme to meet both  the need to issue shares 
under the Group’s share option programme and, more generally, as a means of returning cash to shareholders.
In the year ended 31 December 2010 Regus plc purchased 1,353,188 (2009: 627,258) of its own shares in the open market and 
utilised these to satisfy employee share awards. Regus plc re-purchased 9,385,000, of its own shares in the open market and held 
these shares as treasury shares. As at 21 March 2011, 9,070,906 shares were held as treasury shares.
The Company declared an interim dividend of 0.85p per share (2009: 0.8p) during the year ended 31 December 2010 and 
proposed a ﬁ nal dividend of 1.75p per share (2009: 1.6p per share) an 8% increase on the 2009 dividend. 
There were no other changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
The Group’s objective when managing capital (equity and borrowings) is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Group holds minimal debt and is in a strong 
cash position therefore it is majority equity funded. The Board balances the higher returns possible with higher levels of borrowings 
with the stability and security afforded by a sound capital position. The Group’s return on capital employed for the year ended 
31 December 2010, deﬁ ned as operating proﬁ t divided by total shareholders’ equity, was 1.4% (2009: 17.2%).

Sensitivity analysis
At 31 December 2010 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Group’s 
proﬁ t before tax by approximately £1.4 million (2009: £1.7 million) with a corresponding increase in total equity.
It is estimated that a ﬁ ve percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against pounds sterling would have decreased 
the Group’s proﬁ t before tax by approximately £0.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2010 (2009: £0.9 million). It is estimated 
that a ﬁ ve percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against pounds sterling would have decreased the Group’s proﬁ t 
before tax by approximately £0.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2010 (2009: £1.1 million).
It is estimated that a ﬁ ve percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against pounds sterling would have decreased 
the Group’s total equity by approximately £7.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2010(2009: £9.1 million). It is estimated that 
a ﬁ ve percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against pounds sterling would have increased the Group’s total equity by 
approximately £0.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2010 (2009: £0.7 million).

 Shareholder and Other Information
Summary of methods and assumptions:
Trade and other receivables/payables and customer deposits
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reﬂ ect the fair value.
Finance lease liabilities
The fair value of ﬁ nance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash ﬂ ows at an appropriate discount rate which reﬂ ects 
current market assessments and the risks speciﬁ c to such liabilities.
Loans and overdrafts
The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at ﬂ oating 
rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments
The Group held several foreign currency swaps in the year, all of which matured during the year. The aggregate movement of the fair 
value of these instruments was a loss of £0.5 million (2009: gain £2.2 million). The instruments were not designated as hedges and 
the gain has been recognised in the income statement. No derivative ﬁ nancial instruments were held at the year end (2009: nil).

Performance conditions for share options
The options awarded in 2004 included certain performance criteria that needed to be met in order for the share options to vest. The 
share options vested based on the basic earnings per share (adjusted for non-recurring items and goodwill and intangible amortisation) 
that exceeded the targets linked to the Retail Price Index. The basic earnings per share for performance purposes was 1p. 100% of 
the options awarded in July and September 2004 vested during 2007.
The awards of options made in March 2007 and April 2007 failed to meet the related performance conditions and lapsed in prior years. 
The March 2008 options failed to meet the related performance conditions and lapsed in the year ended 31 December 2010.
The options awarded in March and June 2010 contain the following performance conditions:
50% of the options will be eligible to vest if the Regus Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) % achieved relative to FTSE All Share Total 
Return index is at least at the median over the performance period. 50% of the options will be eligible to vest subject to the EPS 
conditions in the table below:
Vesting Scale EPS target Y/E 2012
25% 15p
50% 16p
75% 17p

(a)  The LTIP Awards of 3 November 2005 and 28 September 2006 had a release date of 3 November 2008 and 28 September 2009 respectively. There was no expiry 
date and therefore remaining contractual life on the basis that the awards release immediately. The LTIP nil cost options had a vesting date of 3 November 2008 
and 28 September 2009 and an expiry date of 3 November 2015 and 28 September 2016 respectively. The performance conditions for the LTIP awards made 
on 3 November 2005 were based on the ﬁ nancial results for the year ended 31 December 2008 and, based on the ﬁ nancial performance of the Group, 80% 
of the awards and options vested on 20 March 2009. The remainder of the awards and options made on 3 November 2005 and all the awards made on 
28 September 2006 lapsed.
(b)  The CIP awards have a release date of 21 March 2009 and 21 March 2010. There is no expiry date and therefore remaining contractual life on the basis that the 
awards release immediately. The CIP nil cost options have a vesting date of 21 March 2009 and 21 March 2010 and an expiry date of 21 March 2016 and 21 March 
2017. The performance conditions for the CIP matching awards made on 21 March 2006 were based on the ﬁ nancial results for the year ended 31 December 2008 
and, based on the ﬁ nancial performance of the Group, 80% of the awards vested on 20 March 2009. The remainder of the matching awards made on 21 March 2006 
lapsed. The proportion of the CIP awards that represented the deferred bonus for the year ended 31 December 2005 were released on 20 March 2009.
(c)  The CIP Matching Shares and Share Option Plan awards made in 2008 and 2009 did not have performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at 
the date of the award. A valuation was performed for those awards based on the terms that applied to similar awards made in previous years. The Remuneration 
Committee set the performance conditions for the awards made in 2008 and 2009 effective from 22 March 2010 and the valuation of these awards has been 
updated in the year ended 31 December 2010.
(d)  The LTIP awards have a release date of 23 March 2013. There is no expiry date and therefore remaining contractual life on the basis that the awards release 
immediately. The LTIP nil cost options have a vesting date of 23 March 2013 and an expiry of 23 March 2020. The performance conditions are set out below.
The performance conditions for the grant of awards under the LTIP are set out in the following table:
For November 2005 and March 2006 awards: Adjusted EPS* (p) for the year ended 31 Dec 2008 11p 12p 13p 14p

* Adjusted EPS
It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently 
in determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion. The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets 
must have been met on a run rate or underlying basis. As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess 
the underlying performance of the business.
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees ﬁ t at the time, by way of example, the following 
adjustments are currently anticipated:

24. Share based payment continued
• In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive proﬁ ts in future years. Thus it is important 
to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year. Accordingly those 
costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth will be excluded from the EPS calculation. 
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current 
year losses from investing in new locations.
• Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded.
• It is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2008 the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised thereby 
increasing progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target. This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise 
deferred tax assets as the business strengthens reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next. To 
provide greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%.
• The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash ﬂ ow performance targets are a transparent and accurate 
measure of the Company’s performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long term shareholder value. 
In addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Company’s return to 
shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies.
The performance conditions for awards under the matching share element of the CIP made in March 2007 are set out below:
% increase in published EPS for the year ended 31 December 2009 compared to the published EPS for the prior 
year 15% 20% 25% 30%
Growth in free cash ﬂ ow per share over 3 years
10% 6% 13% 19% 25%
15% 13% 25% 38% 50%
20% 19% 38% 56% 75%
25% 25% 50% 75% 100%
% denotes the % of the award which will be released at the end of the performance period.
In addition, no awards will be released unless the Company’s TSR is at least at the median when compared against that of 
the companies comprising the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector at the date of the grant subject to the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
The associated Investment Share awards made in March 2007 will be released to participants (subject to any tax liabilities in 
accordance with the rules of the CIP).
As indicated in the Remuneration Report in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2008, the Remuneration Committee 
felt it inappropriate to set speciﬁ c performance conditions for Matching Shares under the CIP and options awards under the Share 
Option Plan awarded in March 2008 and March 2009 but were committed to carrying out a thorough review of the matter during 2009. 
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the following modiﬁ cations will be made to the awards made in 2008 and 2009 and 
that the following performance conditions will apply to these awards effective from 22 March 2010.

 Shareholder and Other Information
The total number of awards made in 2008 and 2009 to each participant will be divided into three separate equal amounts and will 
be subject to future performance periods of three, four and ﬁ ve years respectively. Thus, conditional on meeting the performance 
targets, the ﬁ rst amount will not vest until March 2013, the second will not vest until March 2014 and the third will not vest until 
March 2015. These vesting dates relate to the ﬁ nancial years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 
2014 respectively. The vesting of these awards will be subject to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets. 
75% of each of the three amounts will be subject to deﬁ ned earnings per share (EPS) targets over the respective performance 
periods. The remaining 25% of each will be subject to relative total shareholder return (TSR) targets over the respective periods. 
The targets will be as follows:
EPS targets for the ﬁ nancial years ending

50% 16p 20p 22p

24. Share based payment continued
The fair value of services received in return for share based payments are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity 
instruments granted. No awards were exercisable at the year-end (2009: nil).
The VCP awards are valued using the Monte Carlo method.
The inputs to the model are as follows:

There was no contingent consideration arising on the above acquisitions.
If the above equity acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2010, the revenue and net retained loss arising from these acquisitions 
would have been £40.7 million and £1.4 million respectively. In the year these equity acquisitions contributed revenue of £11.8 million 
and a net retained loss of £1.8 million.
The goodwill arising on the above acquisitions reﬂ ects the anticipated future beneﬁ ts Regus can obtain from operating the businesses 
more efﬁ ciently, primarily through increasing occupancy and the addition of value adding services. £1.2 million of the above goodwill 
is expected to be deductable for tax purposes.
The acquisition costs associated with these transactions were £1.0m (2009: £nil), recorded within administration expenses within 
the Consolidated Income Statement.
Adjustments to acquisitions and the payment of contingent consideration in relation to acquisitions completed prior to 1 January 2009.
Additional consideration of £nil (2009: £0.3 million) was accrued as a result of the improved ﬁ nancial performance of acquisitions 
under contractual earn-out provisions. There were no amendments in 2010 to provisional purchase price allocations on acquisitions 
completed in previous years (2009: £0.5 million).
There were no signiﬁ cant acquisitions completed after 31 December 2010.

Non-cancellable operating lease commitments exclude future contingent rental amounts such as the variable amounts payable under 
performance based leases where the rents vary in line with a centre’s performance. Following a detailed review of the Group’s lease 
database during the year, the prior year lease obligation disclosures were deemed to have overstated the minimum non-cancellable 
lease commitments. The disclosure has been restated accordingly.
28. Contingent assets and liabilities
The Group has bank guarantees and letters of credit held with certain banks amounting to £102.2 million (December 2009: 
£47.0 million). A number of lawsuits are pending against the Group, the outcome of which in the aggregate is not expected 
to have a material effect on the Group.

31. Key judgmental areas adopted in preparing these accounts
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and assumptions 
that affect reported statements and related disclosures. 
Fair Value accounting for business combinations
For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired. Where there is not an active market in 
the category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired 
company do not provide sufﬁ cient information to derive an accurate valuation, management calculate an estimated fair value based 
on available information and experience. 
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where management’s judgment has an impact on the amounts recorded include 
tangible ﬁ xed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities. For signiﬁ cant business 
combinations management also obtain third party valuations to provide additional guidance over the appropriate valuation to be 
included in the ﬁ nancial statements. 
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill
We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangibles to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an 
event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the carrying 
value of goodwill at the appropriate cash-generating unit level and make that determination based upon future cash ﬂ ow projections, 
which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying 
value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated recoverable amount. Further details of the methodology and assumptions 
applied to the impairment review in the year ended 31 December 2010, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions, 
can be found in note 12.
Tax assets and liabilities
We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and 
other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business 
results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred 
tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reﬂ ected in the accounting 
estimates. It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable proﬁ ts will be available 
against which the assets can be used. The Group considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable proﬁ t in the previous year 
and is forecast to continue to make a proﬁ t in the foreseeable future. Where appropriate the Group assesses the potential risk of 
future tax liabilities arising from the operation of its business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities 
for those risks that can be estimated reliably. Changes in existing tax laws can affect large international Groups similar to Regus 
and could result in signiﬁ cant additional tax liabilities over and above those already provided for.
Onerous lease provisions
We have identiﬁ ed certain poor performing centres where the lease is considered onerous, i.e. the Group does not expect to recover 
the unavoidable lease costs up to the ﬁ rst break point. The accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net amounts payable 
under the terms of the lease to the ﬁ rst break point, discounted at the Group weighted average cost of capital, where appropriate.
Dilapidations
Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date 
of signing the lease. The costs to bring the property back to that condition are not known until the Group exits the property so the 
Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date. However, given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made 
to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary. 
Consequently provision has been made only for those potential dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outﬂ ow will 
occur and can be reliably estimated.

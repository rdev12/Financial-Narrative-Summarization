PROGRESS MADE IN
A CHALLENGING YEAR
With our size and scale we can continue to invest
and take advantage of the growth opportunities 
that the European and North American construction
markets will provide in the future.
WO40009_R&A_01-41  12/10/07  10:57  Page 04
     2007 has been a particularly challenging period for the Group. 
In a year when we have achieved good performance across
European operations generally, we have also had to contend 
with a very difficult market for new housing in the US. Equally, 
we recorded our highest spend ever on acquisitions of £1,718 million
which included the purchase of DT Group in the Nordic region.
Overall, revenue ended up 14.6 per cent with trading profit down 
0.6 per cent.
The new housing market in the US has seen its biggest fall in more
than 15 years. As a result, it was necessary to significantly reduce
our cost base in Stock Building Supply (‘Stock’) (which is the
Group’s business most exposed to the new housing market in 
the US), closing a number of branches, reducing employee
numbers and tightly controlling overheads. However, the Board
continues to believe that the European and North American
construction markets, including new housing in the US, will provide
good opportunities for growth in the future. Ensuring that we have
the appropriate organisation to respond to customers’ changing
needs and yet be efficient in the way we do business continues to
be a priority.
With this in mind, Chip Hornsby, in his first year as Group Chief
Executive, has created a number of new roles, started new
initiatives and agreed new targets with the Board; among which 
are to improve cash flow along with generating a 7 per cent trading
margin by the year ending 31 July 2011. In the pages that follow,
you can read more about these initiatives, all of which are designed
to ensure that Wolseley benefits from being a genuinely international
company and develops into a truly world class Group. 
The size and scale of our operations mean that we can continue 
to invest in people, infrastructure and technology. Our aim is to
source products at the right price from our suppliers and deliver
these to our customers in the most effective manner possible. 
In support of this, we continue to expand our capabilities in areas
such as procurement, supply chain and IT to support our existing
businesses and to maximise the value that we obtain from
acquisitions going forward.
Dividend
In September 2006, the Group raised £646 million after costs from
the placement of new shares, equivalent to 10 per cent of its issued
share capital, in order to provide funding headroom for bolt-on
acquisitions and capital expenditure for expansion. The impact 
of this share issue and the lower profitability due to the difficult 
US housing market has caused our earnings per share before
amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles to fall 11.2 per cent
to 87.80 pence. However, the Board is confident of the Group’s
future prospects and it is, therefore, recommending a final dividend
of 21.55 pence, which represents a total dividend for the year of
32.40 pence. This is an increase of 10.2 per cent over the total
dividend paid last year.
The Board
Fenton Hord, who was responsible for the Group’s US building
materials business, retired from the Board on 31 July 2007 after 
20 years with the Group, including seven years as a Board member.
The Group has also announced that Robert Walker, a Non Executive
Director since 1998, will leave the Board on 31 October 2007. 
To both Fenton and Robert, I wish to extend the Board’s sincere
thanks and appreciation for their significant contributions to the
Group and wish them both well for the future.
I also wish to thank all of our customers, suppliers, investors and
each of our 78,948 employees for their support not just over the
last year, but over many years. 
The Board looks ahead with confidence. We have a sound strategy
with a proven track record of growth sustained over many years
and we operate in markets that are extremely fragmented. We are
confident that the initiatives and investments that Chip and his
team are undertaking today will drive Wolseley to new and even
greater achievements in the future.

DRIVING WOLSELEY
TOWARDS EVEN
GREA TER
ACHIEVEMENTS
The new housing market in the US has been tough, but our results
demonstrate the benefits of our diversity. We have continued to 
invest for future growth, made acquisitions and restructured our
operations to reduce costs and improve margins going forward.
WO40009_R&A_01-41  12/10/07  11:02  Page 08
     My first year as Wolseley’s Group Chief Executive has presented 
us with challenges in the US housing market, lumber price deflation
and a weaker dollar but I am encouraged by how our businesses
and people have responded and by what the Group has achieved.
The results demonstrate the benefits of the Group’s diversity and 
its ability to react swiftly to changing market conditions. We have
continued to invest in the business for future growth, made
acquisitions that further increase diversity and restructured our
operations to reduce costs and improve margins going forward. 
In North America, our businesses were impacted by the sudden
and rapid slowdown in the US new housing market. Our building
materials business, Stock Building Supply (‘Stock’), was most
affected as more than 80 per cent of its revenues have historically
been generated from customers who are house builders. It also faced
significant price deflation to add to the volume decline with around
45 per cent of the products it sells being commodity lumber and
panels. As a result, Stock’s local currency revenue fell 13.4 per cent
and its trading profit fell 74.9 per cent. In response to the poor market
conditions, headcount was reduced in Stock by around 20 per cent
with some 46 branches being closed. Stock’s branch network
going forward will comprise 287 branches in 33 states. The
measures taken to restructure the Stock business should show
increasing benefits as the US housing market improves.
Our US plumbing and heating business, Ferguson Enterprises
(‘Ferguson’), has performed very well with the growth in the
industrial, commercial, utilities and residential remodelling sectors
more than offsetting the effect of the decline in new housing.
Ferguson’s local currency revenue grew 14.8 per cent, including 
5.5 per cent organic growth, and trading profit increased 18.4 per cent.
Our market outperformance, once again, demonstrated the benefits
of our business diversity, specialist product offering, investment in
high calibre people, our unique distribution centre network and a
focus on cost efficiency.
Wolseley Canada achieved local currency revenue growth of 
2.1 per cent and trading profit increased 0.7 per cent, as it continued
to align its operations with the US business structure. Since 
1 August 2007, Wolseley Canada has been integrated into Ferguson,
which will enable further synergies, sharing of best practice and a
consistent approach to broadening the customer base. Increasing
synergies are being realised across our North American operations
as roles in areas such as IT, HR, indirect spend and property
management are performed at the continental level, reducing the
need to duplicate activities in the three businesses.
In Europe, we continued to grow, expanding the number of
countries we operate in from 13 to 21 as well as making good
progress across our established businesses.
In the UK, the restructuring continued whilst also achieving good
levels of organic revenue growth. Acquisitions made in the past 
few years, such as Brandon Hire (tool hire), Encon (insulation) 
and Neville Long (insulation and ceilings), are now well established
alongside our traditional brands. In addition, the electrical distribution
businesses of William Wilson and AC Electrical, have been merged
and rebranded as Electric Center, providing a good base on which
to derive future growth in that new product area. Revenues in the
UK were up 17.9 per cent including 9.9 per cent organic growth,
well ahead of the market generally. Trading profit rose a more modest
5.0 per cent, reflecting the £13 million of one-off restructuring costs
relating to 40 branch closures and rationalisation of head office.
Branch numbers grew overall by 74 to 1,917 and deliveries
commenced from the new 330,000 square foot National Distribution
Centre, which is located alongside Wolseley UK’s head office in
Leamington Spa.
In France, the three businesses – plumbing and heating, building
materials and timber import and solutions – now report into 
one management team following a period of major restructuring,
particularly in Brossette, the plumbing and heating business. 
It was encouraging to see good organic growth of 5.9 per cent 
in France with total local currency revenue up by 10.3 per cent and
trading profit up by 13.1 per cent. A national distribution centre was
opened in France during the year in Orléans with 210,000 square feet
of space. 
In Central and Eastern Europe we achieved a strong performance
with revenue up 22.4 per cent and trading profit up 9.6 per cent
with particularly good results in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Austria and Luxembourg. We also continued our geographic
expansion with the acquisition in October 2006 of Woodcote, 
a general builders’ merchant. This acquisition has taken us into 
the new geographic areas of the Slovak Republic, Poland, Romania
and Croatia and has also extended our reach in the Czech Republic
and Hungary. The businesses we already had in the Czech Republic
and Hungary have been integrated into Woodcote giving us more
critical mass and a strong management team which is now integral
to our Central and Eastern European team.
Our ability to identify and integrate acquisitions has been a key
feature of Wolseley’s growth and success for many years and last
year was no exception. In fact it was a record year for the Group 
with £1,718 million being spent on acquisitions. The biggest by far
was the acquisition of DT Group, the number one building materials
distributor in the Nordic region, for £1,339 million in September 2006.
We have been very pleased with how quickly DT Group has been
integrated into Wolseley and also by the quality of its ongoing
performance. It has an excellent management team which has been
very focused on driving efficiencies, cost control and cash flow and 
is now pursuing our aggressive growth objectives.
We invested £1,718 million on a total of 44 acquisitions in 17 countries
during the year, as follows:
Number of Acquisitions Spend £m
Europe 22 1,445
North America 22 273
Historically, acquisitions have delivered around half of our annual
growth and this is an area where we have considerable expertise.
We follow a rigorous assessment process before an acquisition is
made and then carefully integrate the business into the Group. By
monitoring the performance of our acquired businesses we ensure
that they perform to expectations and our track record demonstrates
that they deliver significant shareholder value.
A simple business model
Wolseley does not have a complicated business model – we buy
products well, add value for our customers, sell them at healthy
margins and create profitable growth and good returns for our
shareholders. We have demonstrated for many years that we 
are good at growing our business, taking advantage of our strong
market positions and using our experience to ensure that we
outperform our markets. We are not going to radically change 
the way we do business, but we must remain alert to changing
customer requirements and the behaviour of our competitors. 
With around £708 billion of construction products distributed
annually across Europe and North America, we have enormous
growth opportunities available to us and it is vital that we continue
to invest and to make our competitive advantages really count for
the benefit of our customers, employees and shareholders alike.
Group Chief Executive’s review 09
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
WO40009_R&A_01-41  12/10/07  11:02  Page 09 The impact that the weak US housing market has had on the
Group’s short-term profitability is clear. As a result, we have had 
to take some difficult decisions to reduce our cost base in order 
to maintain an acceptable level of profitability. This slowdown has,
however, created an opportunity for us to consider how we want
the Group to evolve over the next stage of its development and 
to put in place initiatives to enhance future performance. We are
determined to create a truly world class company.
Historically, Wolseley has an excellent track record of revenue and
profit growth, typically in excess of 10 per cent per annum. In the
last two years, however, as we have invested significantly in our
businesses, the rate of profit growth has been lower than that for
revenue and we have seen our trading margin slightly reduced. 
The initiatives we are putting in place are designed to reverse this
trend with the target of reaching a minimum 7 per cent trading
margin by 2011.
Our objective is to continue to achieve an average of double-digit
growth year on year and to ensure that our profits increase more
rapidly than our sales. We also aim to generate the cash required
to continue to invest in the business to sustain further growth. 
To achieve that aim, we have been putting increased focus on
improving our working capital performance. The results of this increased
focus were clear from the impressive improvement in free cash flow
generation delivered in the past year.
Margin enhancement, strong cash flow generation and growth 
are key attributes of world class performance. Within the Group 
we have started to communicate the ‘Earn, Turn, Grow’ initiative,
as these are the priorities that we wish each of our operations to
emphasise in their activities. A number of specific initiatives have
been launched across the Group to drive improved performance 
in these areas.
Earn
The ‘Earn’ focus means achieving profit growth in excess of
revenue growth, resulting in an improved margin, far in excess 
of anything we have achieved to date. This means increased cost
efficiency to generate productivity improvements, making the most
of all the investment that has been made in the past and those to
come through the business change programme. Further rewards
will be achieved from the distribution centres, supply chain and
sourcing strategy. 
Part of our sourcing strategy is to leverage our size and buying
power in order to enhance our gross margin. With around 5,300
locations to service our customers, we are a great route to market
for our suppliers. With cost of goods sold of around £12 billion 
last year, there is significant opportunity to improve our margins,
particularly as we develop Wolseley’s private label product offering
which will underpin and enhance our reputation for quality and 
high customer service. 
Turn
We will continue to focus on cash flow and working capital to ensure
that we have sufficient cash to enable us to continue to invest in the
business and to fund our bolt-on acquisitions. The three components
of inventory days, receivables and payables are being closely
monitored in each business to target improvement: turning our
inventory more quickly, collecting receivables efficiently and as 
fast as possible, and extending our payables terms with the
agreement of our suppliers. Cash is what drives a business and 
it will support our growth ambitions.
Grow
We want to continue to grow and double in size every five to seven
years. In the short term there needs to be more emphasis on our
organic growth, ‘sweating the assets’ by putting more volume through
our existing locations and taking advantage of past investments.
We will be putting a great deal of emphasis on improving our 
like-for-like sales growth in every branch. In addition, acquisitions
will continue to be a key part of our strategy, building on our ability
to seek out good quality companies that are successfully integrated
into Wolseley and then grown within our ownership.
We are a Group with a real understanding of our markets and
customers, an absolute grip on the basics of what differentiates 
us from our competitors and a clear desire to continue to grow 
and deliver even better overall business performance.
With the ‘Earn, Turn, Grow’ priorities clearly communicated across
the business units, we have identified five key areas that we will
focus on as a Group which will differentiate us from our competition
and which will support our objectives. These include:
• people development
• sourcing 
• supply chain
• growth
• business improvement
These are discussed in further detail on pages 11 to 21.
I am excited by the opportunities that we have as a Group. 
We operate in very fragmented markets, so there is plenty of 
scope for growing our business and our market share further. 
We have a business model where size really does make a
difference and the scale of our operation gives purchasing benefits
and sourcing opportunities which smaller competitors cannot
achieve. Our continued investment in the logistics network and
distribution centres gives competitive advantages that become 
ever greater as the business grows. We are currently in 28 countries
with a total of 5,296 branches, employing around 79,000 highly
talented people, I believe this is only the beginning. I am confident
that our priorities and focus will help make Wolseley a better, more
effective, world class company. Our goals are within our reach as
long as we continue to focus on our priorities, manage our growth
and increase the emphasis on margin enhancement and cash flow.
We have been through a difficult year with market conditions
continuing to be tough in the new US residential housing market
but I am confident that we will come through this as a leaner,
stronger organisation, eager and able to achieve world class status.

People development
The distribution of construction products to 
satisfy our customers is a relationship business,
with people at the heart of everything we do. 
It is vital that we have the best leadership talent
in the industry.
It starts with our extensive selection and recruitment programme at all 
levels and continues throughout our employees’ careers as they are trained
and developed, whether it be to provide better customer service, product
knowledge or management capability. The skills and commitment of our
employees are a major competitive advantage, which is why we invest 
so much in people and leadership development.

Buying the right products, with the

Wolseley’s size and scale means that
through our global sourcing programme
we can search the world for the best
products and buy in quantities that
ensure we get the best prices. With 72 per cent of our costs arising from the hundreds 
of thousands of products we buy, there is an opportunity to
reduce our £12 billion purchasing bill by standardising some 
of our products and suppliers across the Group. Increasingly
we will source products directly from manufacturers globally 
and sell more private label products through our extensive 
branch network.
Wolseley provides a powerful channel to the market for 
manufacturers’ products and through our partnerships 
we are confident that we will continue to meet the needs 
of our customers as well as our own financial objectives.

Supply Chain
New and expanded distribution 
centres are helping us move more
products, more quickly and 
efficiently, to more customers. 
Over many years, Wolseley has invested in large distribution 
centres (‘DCs’). These enable us to obtain bulk purchasing 
benefits, improved inventory management and better service 
to more customers, through a wider product offering and higher 
availability rates. In essence, working in partnership with our 
suppliers, we are able to take costs out of the supply chain.
Every day thousands of products are moved from our DCs to 
our branches for local onward delivery or pick up, or taken directly
to customers’ sites.
But it isn’t just about delivery. Whether it is online, from a catalogue
or at a branch, we want to provide our customers with easy access
to our products and to our knowledgeable staff. We want to make
doing business with Wolseley as easy and efficient as possible;
from the first mile out of our suppliers’ factory gates to the last 
mile to our customers …and all the miles in between.
Once the decision has been made to acquire a certain 
manufacturer’s products, the rest of the supply chain is 
then concerned with getting the product from the factory 
to the customer or the job site, in the most effective way. Group Chief Executive’s review 17

We are focused on growing our
business, organically and through
acquisitions, with the aim of doubling
in size every five to seven years.
GROWTH’
Organic growth is achieved from existing branches expanding
the range of customers they serve and the products they sell
and also from new branches. In 2007, 638 net new branches
were added to give a total of 5,296 across 28 countries in
Europe and North America.
We have had an extremely successful run on acquisitions over 
the past year, spending £1,718 million on a total of 44 deals, 
a record year for the Group. Achieving half of our double-digit
growth target from acquisitions currently requires spending 
of £400-£450 million on bolt-on deals. Occasionally we may 
find a larger company to buy and, in 2007, our spending included
the £1.3 billion acquisition of DT Group, the largest builders
merchant in the Nordic area with 275 branches in Denmark,
Sweden, Norway, Finland and Greenland. Since this acquisition,
DT Group has also become the leading builders’ merchant 
in Greenland. Another four new countries – Poland, Slovakia,
Croatia, and Romania – were added to our Central and Eastern
European operations in October 2006 through the acquisition 
of Woodcote.
The competitive advantage we obtain from our acquisitions
stems from our ability to find quality companies with good 
people, being able to integrate them effectively into the 
Wolseley structure, gain synergies, improve working capital 
and enhance their performance.
With acquisitions come new people, new facilities, new 
products, new customers and new growth opportunities. 
The construction materials distribution market in Europe 
and North America is worth around £708 billion per annum.
Wolseley, although it is the biggest player in its field, has a 
3 per cent market share and that is why we are confident 
of being able to grow well into the future.

In our industry, Wolseley is already 
a top class company, a leader in our
field, in terms of size, scale, financial
results and efficiency. However, we
have the opportunity to be even
better, to become truly world class.
The Group has continued to invest in key business improvement
initiatives to support its long-term growth objectives, whilst creating
a more effective and streamlined organisation.
As well as the investments we are making to leverage our size 
and scale in supply chain and sourcing, we are also embarking 
on a global business change programme to drive best practice,
establish more efficient processes, reduce costs and benefit from
synergies across the Group.
In particular, we have defined a target operating model that
captures Wolseley’s future vision and we are implementing a
common set of processes across the Group supported by a world
class, Company-wide, common IT platform. The systems being
developed will enable the Group to operate more effectively and 
will lead to continued market outperformance over the long term.
Wolseley is beginning to reap the rewards as several early 
programmes are being rolled out, such as the human resource
management system and a common IT platform across the
Austrian operations. In addition, we are assessing, updating 
and improving our supply chain and branch operations.
Wolseley’s business change initiatives aim to deliver real 
advantages and enhanced benefits to support the organisation’s
growth ambitions.
By creating a culture of continuous improvement, we are raising 
the bar – each year having higher expectations than the last.

A CHALLENGING BUT
REWARDING YEAR
2007 has seen a record level of investment of
£1.7 billion in acquisitions, including DT Group.
Whilst our financial performance has been
impacted by the weak new residential housing
market in the USA and the weakening of the 
US dollar, the Group is in a strong financial
position with free cash flow up 120 per cent.

Company overview and 
performance monitoring
Company overview
Wolseley’s business is the distribution of construction materials 
and the provision of related services primarily to a specialist market
of professional contractors. The Group is the world’s number 
one distributor of heating and plumbing products to professional
contractors and a leading supplier of building materials to the
professional market. The Group is an international business,
operating 5,296 branches in 28 countries and employing around
79,000 people.
Wolseley plc is the parent company of the Group and its subsidiaries
are organised into two geographic divisions – Europe and 
North America. Divisional management are primarily responsible 
for the profits of the operating companies they oversee and for
driving organic growth, which includes additional sales from 
existing branches, new branch openings and expansion into 
new geographies, new customer types and product areas.
The divisional teams are supported by global functional teams 
such as acquisitions, sourcing, supply chain, business improvement,
finance and human resource development. This structure allows 
the Group to focus on the key competencies by which the
business is driven forward. These key competencies and the
business model are described in the Group Chief Executive’s 
review on pages 8 to 21.
The principal activities of the Group are:
• the distribution of plumbing, heating and air conditioning
equipment within Europe and North America;
• the distribution of building materials in the UK, Ireland, France,
the Nordic region, Eastern Europe and the USA;
• the distribution of electrical components and supplies primarily 
in the UK, Ireland and France;
• the distribution of pipes, valves, fittings and waterworks 
in Europe and North America;
• the provision of construction and installation services in 
the USA and equipment hire in the UK, Austria and France.
Wolseley’s products
The Group supplies materials used in the construction industry. 
The range of products used in construction is broad and the 
Group continually seeks opportunities to widen that choice for its
customers. The main product categories supplied to customers 
are set out on page 24.
Wolseley’s customers
The Group has a wide range of customers operating in different
industry sectors that range from the individual plumber or builder
through to national contractor chains and house builders, and
include large industrial and commercial organisations. Wolseley’s
primary customer focus is on professional contractors. These
contractors work with households, governments, property
developers and industrial companies in the construction of new

homes, offices and industrial buildings or in the repair and
maintenance of existing premises. Increasingly, the Group has
structured around core business groups or brands allowing its local
companies to put real focus on these sectors, whilst enhancing
customer service and developing further product expertise.
Competitive environment
The Group aims to be a leading distributor in each of the markets
in which it operates. The markets where the Group operates are
typically fragmented with a few large players and a significant
portion of the market supplied by small local operations. In certain
markets the Group competes with the large DIY chains which have
increased their offerings to professional contractors.
The opportunities for organic and acquisitive growth in these
fragmented markets are substantial. The environment for
acquisitions has become marginally more competitive over 
the last few years in certain markets and the competition for 
large acquisitions from private equity investors has also increased.
However, for the majority of acquisitions which are smaller businesses,
financial purchasers are few (the main competition in this area is
from other trade purchasers) and there has been no significant
change in the competition for these acquisitions.
Other market factors
The changing demographics of the European and North American
markets, with a generally ageing population and increasing
immigration, suggests that demand for new housing will continue 
at relatively high levels over the long-term, although short term
weaknesses in demand may be experienced from time to time, 
as is currently the case in the USA. As the housing stock ages, 
it will increase demand in the repair and remodelling sector. Activity
in the commercial and industrial sector, which has been strong over
the past year, varies according to the level of business investment,
government spending and commercial property yields. The Group’s
business model gives it the flexibility and agility to respond to
changes in the market place across many different business cycles.
The diversity of the Group’s business provides further resilience 
in performance.
While the Group does not operate in a regulated industry, the
performance of the Group can be impacted by Government legislation.
The key regulatory influences centre on environmental legislation and
stipulations imposed when building or remodelling buildings. Such
changes in legislation present an opportunity for growth in response 
to increasing demand as customers or end users respond by changing
their buying habits. For example, the UK business is currently building
a sustainable energy centre to provide a shop window for energy
efficient products increasingly required by regulation and in response 
to increased environmental awareness of customers.
Performance monitoring
The Group employs a rigorous performance management
framework to plan, monitor and review the activities of its
businesses. A strategic plan is produced annually by all businesses
which sets out business plans and resource requirements. Linked
to this is the annual budget process, which is core to the target
setting process. The form and components of the budget are, 
in general, cascaded down to branch level within the businesses.
Each month, the businesses submit their results, which also include
a forecast for the remainder of the financial year. Performance
against both budget and prior month forecast is reviewed with 
the businesses by continental and Group management. Corrective
actions or additional resource deployments are discussed with the
benefit of such information.
The Board of Wolseley plc meets regularly to discuss trading results
and uses a set of Key Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’) to measure
the overall progress of the Group against its business objectives.
The KPIs used by the Group to monitor its performance are
currently being reassessed in light of the recently launched 
‘Earn, Turn, Grow’ initiative described in the Group Chief Executive’s
review on pages 8 to 21. This review is likely to result in the
replacement or redefinition of some of the financial KPIs detailed 
in the next section for monitoring performance in the year ending
31 July 2008, with more emphasis being placed on measures such
as like-for-like growth and cash-to-cash days which are integral to
the ‘Earn Turn, Grow’ initiative.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Key Performance Indicators
The Group has utilised the following indicators of performance to assess its development against its strategy and financial objectives
during the year ended 31 July 2007.
Key Performance Indicator and definition
Growth in organic revenue
The total increase or decrease in revenue for the year adjusted for
the impact of currency exchange, new acquisitions in the year and
the incremental impact of acquisitions in the prior year.
The Group seeks to achieve, on average, double-digit growth in
revenue both through organic growth and through acquisitions.
Over the economic cycle the Group would expect growth to come
broadly evenly from both sources.
Growth in acquired revenue
The growth in revenue from businesses that the Group has
acquired during the financial year and the incremental effect 
of the prior year’s acquisitions.
Trading margin
The ratio of trading profit to revenue expressed as a percentage.
The Group seeks to achieve a growth in trading profits higher 
than the growth in revenue through year-on-year improvements in
trading margin as a result of continuous improvement in operations
and the benefits of its international scale and leverage.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow represents cash flow from operating activities 
less maintenance capital expenditure, tax, dividends and interest.
The Group seeks to generate sufficient free cash flow over the
business cycle to fund normal bolt-on acquisitions and expansion
capital expenditure.
Return on gross capital employed
The ratio of trading profit to the aggregate of the monthly average
of shareholders’ funds, minority interests, net debt and cumulative
goodwill and acquired intangibles written off.
The Group targets to deliver an incremental return on gross capital
employed at least 4 per cent in excess of the pre-tax weighted
average cost of capital. A major driver of decisions relating to
acquisitions and capital expenditure is the incremental return 
on capital generated by those investments.
Review of performance
• Organic revenue increased in the year by 0.5 per cent.
• Ferguson achieved organic revenue growth of 5.5 per cent. 
Stock Building Supply (‘Stock’) experienced an organic revenue
decline of 24.2 per cent due to the weak new residential housing
market in the US.
• The UK business outperformed the market and achieved 
9.9 per cent organic growth.
• Each of the Austrian, Swiss and Dutch businesses achieved
double-digit organic growth.
• Over the past five years the Group has delivered average organic
revenue growth of 6.9 per cent.
• A total of 44 acquisitions were completed during the year,
including the Group’s largest ever acquisition, DT Group, 
for an aggregate consideration including net debt of £1,718 million.
• Acquisitions made in 2007 contributed £2,067 million to revenue
in the year or 12.7 per cent and £132 million to trading profit or
15.0 per cent.
• Over the past five years the Group has delivered average
acquired revenue growth of 12.3 per cent with 20.7 per cent 
in the last year, both exceeding target.
• Overall, Group trading margin fell from 6.2 per cent in 2006 
to 5.4 per cent in 2007 primarily as a result of the weak 
new residential housing market in the USA and a number 
of restructuring projects throughout the Group.
• Trading margin improvement was achieved in Ferguson but
Stock’s margin was significantly lower than last year.
• The European trading margin reduced due to lower trading
margins in the UK following competitive pressures in the first half,
restructuring costs and revenue investments.
• Over the past five years, the Group’s trading margin has been
around 6 per cent and this is targeted to increase to a minimum
of 7 per cent by 2011.
• Free cash flow increased significantly from £285 million in 2006 to
£626 million, up by 120 per cent as a result of greater focus being
placed on enhancing working capital performance across the Group.
• Over the past five years after dividends, average free cash flow was
£288 million.
• Return on gross capital employed in 2007 decreased from 
18.8 per cent to 13.7 per cent due to the significant reduction in
profit at Stock and higher acquisition spend in the year and was
2.1 per cent ahead of the estimated pre-tax weighted average
cost of capital of 11.6 per cent.
• Average return on gross capital employed over the past five years
was 17.3 per cent.
• Return on gross capital employed in Europe was 12.7 per cent,
down from 16.2 per cent in 2006 and in North America 
16.2 per cent, down from 21.9 per cent in 2006.

Human resource development performance indicators 
Wolseley’s 79,000 people are the cornerstone of providing service
to its customers and are one of its key competitive advantages. 
As much of the customer experience is generated through ongoing
relationships with the Group’s branch personnel or sales force, staff
turnover rates are considered an important indicator and these are
reviewed as part of the monthly reporting.
The overall turnover rate for 2007 was 24 per cent (2006: 22 per cent),
which reflects a number of branch closures and restructuring
activities at Stock and Wolseley UK. Excluding these one-off items,
the underlying turnover rate improved compared with the prior year
and is in line with industry standards. Turnover in 2007 at the
management level of staff was at much lower rates.
The safety of Wolseley’s people is also regarded as paramount and
lost time incident rates are monitored closely by health and safety
committees established in each of the major businesses. The lost
day incident rate used is affected both by the severity of the cause
of the absence from work and also the effectiveness of the handling
of each absence and return to work programmes. 
Other performance areas
In order to measure the success of its strategy execution, the
Group uses a variety of non-financial performance indicators 
which continue to be refined and developed.
Business diversity
A key element of the Group’s growth strategy is the enhancement
of business diversity, which has a number of elements. The Group
is continuously seeking to enhance its branch network to provide
improved service and a wider product offering to new and existing
customers. The expansion of the branch network is detailed in the
table below.
2007 2006 2005 2004 2003
Europe 3,311 2,861 2,486 2,393 2,266
North America 1,985 1,797 1,434 1,244 1,183
Total 5,296 4,658 3,920 3,637 3,449
The Group also aims to increase its geographic footprint in its
chosen areas of operation, Europe and North America. During the
year, the Group expanded its geographical diversity significantly,
entering eight new countries, by acquiring DT Group, which has
operations in Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Greenland,
and Woodcote which has operations in the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Slovak Republic, Poland, Romania and Croatia. In North
America, Stock expanded operations into the state of Arizona.
The Group has continued its strategy of moving into new market
segments within the construction materials and services industry.
Ferguson acquired Improvement Direct, an ecommerce business
with a network of online stores, providing immediate entry into the
home improvement segment, a key strategic move for North America.
In addition, most recent Stock acquisitions have been in the non-
residential housing market which is part of the Group’s strategy to
diversify the product offering at Stock into the repairs, maintenance
and improvement (‘RMI’) and industrial and commercial sectors and
reduce exposure to the new residential housing market.
In Europe, eight bolt-on acquisitions have been completed by 
DT Group to further expand its footprint in the Nordic region.
Additional acquisitions have been made in Central and Eastern
Europe in line with the strategy to expand the Group’s critical 
mass in that region, while in France acquisitions have expanded 
the Group’s presence in the new residential market. The Group’s
electrical distribution activities have been expanded through an
acquisition in Ireland.
Environmental
Wolseley is taking an active role in the sourcing and supply of
renewable and sustainable building materials. Wolseley UK’s
Sustainable Building Centre (‘SBC’), a 6,800 square foot, 
interactive showcase for renewable and sustainable building
materials, is presently under construction and is scheduled to 
be fully operational by April 2008. The building features the best
available sustainable construction products selected from a
bespoke range provided through Wolseley UK trading brands. 
The range, which has been established since the beginning of
2007, is already proving attractive to many Wolseley customers 
in a diverse range of business segments. Wolseley UK intends 
that the SBC will become the leading UK industry resource for
sustainable building products and supporting information,
promoting sustainable building best practices.
The Group’s approach to environmental measures is set out in the
Corporate social responsibility report on pages 44 to 51. In accordance
with the reporting guidelines suggested by the UK Government’s
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Group has
developed a range of environmental measures, including those in
the areas of carbon dioxide emissions, waste management and
water use which are disclosed in the Corporate social responsibility
report on pages 45 to 46.

Operations
Europe
Market
The European Division continues to develop under four geographic
areas (‘clusters’) – UK and Ireland, France, the Nordic region 
and Central and Eastern Europe. The latter is responsible for the
division’s operations in Austria, the Benelux region, Italy, Switzerland
and Eastern Europe.
The division has over 3,300 branches serving a diverse range 
of customers and market sectors within construction materials.
In the opinion of management, Wolseley UK’s plumbing business 
is the UK’s largest distributor of plumbing and heating products,
Brossette is the second largest distributor of plumbing and heating
equipment in France, PBM is the second largest integrated distributor
of heavyside building materials in France and DT Group is the
leading distributor of building materials for trade professionals 
and consumers in the Nordic region.
European markets each have their own economic growth rates 
and market participants. The diversity of the Wolseley operations
and the fragmentation that exists in the European markets present
significant growth opportunities for the Group. Some important
trends at present include:
• An increasing rate of residential repair and maintenance across
Europe, as more is spent on upgrading the ageing housing stock.
• An increasing percentage of flats/apartments in the building mix,
helping plumbing and heating products.
• Infrastructure growth in recently joined EU members in the Central
and Eastern Europe region.
• High levels of migrant workers creating both employment within
construction and ‘hot spots’ for residential growth.
• The growth of sustainable construction products across Europe.
• Increased usage of modern methods of construction, such as
offsite fabrication.
Wolseley has a well balanced product offer across Europe and is
able to adopt and adapt business practices to exploit these market
trends within its specific country markets.
The European division continues to seek opportunities to expand
into other geographic areas such as Spain, Germany and other
parts of Eastern Europe.
Market size
Management has estimated market sizes through evaluating the building materials suppliers’ total market if all products were channelled
through the distribution network. Management’s best estimate of both Wolseley’s activity in each market and the total size of these markets

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
The division has more activity generated from residential compared
to non-residential and civil infrastructure work. However, the actions
under way both through acquisitions and enhancement of business
diversity, continue to broaden the business base. 
Significant opportunities are available to broaden the division’s
reach both geographically and in terms of market segment. 
The acquisitions of DT Group and Woodcote represent significant
steps in this regard. 
Divisional performance
Most of the European operations achieved good revenue and profit
improvements and the results also benefited from acquisitions
which expanded the geographic diversity of the Group. 
Reported revenue, in sterling, for this division increased by 
46.8 per cent to £7,559 million (2006: £5,150 million), of which 
8.8 per cent was from organic growth. Recent acquisitions accounted
for £2,010 million (39.0 per cent) of revenue growth, including 
DT Group in the Nordic region in September 2006. Trading profit, 
in sterling, increased by 36.9 per cent to £433 million (2006: 
£316 million). Currency translation reduced divisional revenue by
£50 million (1.0 per cent) and trading profit by £2 million (0.6 per
cent). Excluding DT Group, European revenues and trading profit,
in sterling, were up by 15.4 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively. 
The overall divisional trading margin, after the allocation of central
costs, declined from 6.1 per cent to 5.7 per cent of revenue,
primarily due to lower trading margins in Wolseley UK and in Italy.
Underlying margin improvements were achieved in France and
most of the Central and Eastern European operations.
During the year, a further eight countries and net 450 branches
were added to the European network, giving a total of 3,311
locations (2006: 2,861), including 363 added through acquisitions.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
UK and Ireland
Wolseley UK grew strongly in a market which showed a gradually
improving trend over the year, despite rising interest rates.
Government spending on schools, hospitals and social housing RMI
underpinned the construction market. In Ireland, the market saw
continued rapid decline in housing starts, with some of the shortfall
taken up by strong RMI activity.
Against this background, Wolseley UK recorded a 17.9 per cent
increase in revenue to £3,171 million (2006: £2,690 million). Organic
growth of 9.9 per cent was a significant outperformance compared
to the market generally, which is estimated to have risen by around 
3 per cent.
Trading profit increased by 5.0 per cent compared to the prior year,
including the benefit from acquisitions. Whilst gross margin improved
slightly, the trading margin fell from 7.5 per cent to 6.7 per cent. 
The trading margin was lower due to the effect of £13 million of 
one-off restructuring costs relating to 40 branch closures and the
rationalisation of central offices, the initial dilutive impact of opening
125 new branches and the integration of the head offices of Brooks
and Heatmerchants in Ireland. 
During the year, 59 net new locations were added in the UK and
Ireland, including 12 branches added as a result of acquisitions,
taking the total number of branches for Wolseley UK to 1,917 
(2006: 1,858). 
France
In France, housing starts slowed significantly in the second half 
but remained at positive levels, whilst RMI, which represents
approximately two-thirds of revenue for both Brossette and PBM,
continues to show only marginal growth. 
Against this background, Wolseley’s French operations showed
good growth with revenue up 10.3 per cent to a2,774 million 
(2006: a2,515 million), including organic growth of 5.9 per cent.
Trading profit was up 13.1 per cent to a150 million (2006: 
a132 million) and trading margin improved to 5.4 per cent (2006:
5.3 per cent). The Wolseley France management structure is now
fully in place with a number of central functions supporting the three
business divisions, each of which performed well in the period. 
At the end of June 2007, a 210,000 square foot national DC 
was opened at Orléans initially supplying complementary building
products to more than 300 PBM locations. 
The two PBM businesses (Heavyside and Import and Wood Solutions)
together achieved a double-digit increase in revenue and underlying
improvement in trading margin. 
In the Brossette plumbing and heating business, revenue rose 
7.6 per cent to total more than a1 billion for the first time, with 
5.2 per cent organic revenue growth. The improved trading margin
benefited from the recent reorganisation including the centralisation
of a number of functions such as purchasing and logistics. 
The number of branches in France increased by 40 to 825 
(2006: 785).
Nordic
DT Group achieved a very strong performance, ahead of
expectations at the time of acquisition by Wolseley on 
25 September 2006. For the ten months of Wolseley ownership 
to 31 July 2007, revenue was DKK17,858 million (£1,617 million) 
and trading profit was DKK1,097 million (£99 million). The trading
margin was 6.1 per cent. This performance was achieved in
markets that remained good, although there were signs of the 
new residential market in Denmark softening a little towards the
end of the year.
DT Group’s integration was completed ahead of schedule and 
it has already made a valuable contribution to Group initiatives.
During the period, eight bolt-on acquisitions were completed,
including expansion into the plumbing and heating business 
in Norway and the purchase of the remaining 40 per cent of 
a builders’ merchant in Greenland. DT Group has also started 
to source and procure private label products with other Group
companies and assisted the UK and Irish businesses to introduce
its Craftsman concept into some branches, for clothing, personal
protection equipment and tools. The range of plumbing products 
in existing DT locations continues to be expanded.
For the 12 months to 31 July 2007, DT Group’s management
accounts show an underlying increase in revenue over the prior
year of 14.6 per cent, including double-digit organic growth, 
and in trading profit, of 26.5 per cent. 
DT Group had 275 branches as at 31 July 2007.
Central and Eastern Europe
The Group’s other Continental European operations enjoyed
generally good results with growth significantly ahead of generally
flat markets. Revenue, in sterling, in Central and Eastern Europe
was up by 22.4 per cent to £899 million (2006: £735 million),
reflecting organic growth of 11.7 per cent and the benefit of
acquisitions. Trading profit, in sterling, was up 9.6 per cent to 
£35 million (2006: £31 million). The trading margin declined to 
3.8 per cent (2006: 4.3 per cent) due to the previously announced
£3 million restructuring charge in Italy following the opening of the
new distribution centre and a lower trading margin in Belgium. 
In the other Benelux countries, both Wasco in the Netherlands 
and CFM in Luxembourg made excellent progress with double-digit
revenue and trading profit growth. 
Tobler, in Switzerland, had another strong year with double-digit
organic growth whilst increasing its trading margin. 
ÖAG, in Austria, reported double-digit organic revenue growth and
an improvement in trading margin, despite significant preparation
work ahead of the implementation of its new IT platform which
went live in August 2007.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
In Italy, revenue increased although profits were down, as expected,
due to the initial costs of the new a20 million (£14 million) DC that
commenced branch deliveries at the end of 2006 and the a4 million
(£3 million) one-off restructuring charge, primarily relating to the
closure of warehouses no longer required. The number of branches
fed from the new DC will be further expanded over the next six months.
In Eastern Europe, the Woodcote acquisition in October 2006,
which took Wolseley into Croatia, Slovakia, Poland and Romania
for the first time, is performing strongly across all regions.
During the year, 76 net new locations were added in Central and
Eastern Europe, including 45 branches through acquisitions, taking
the total number to 294 (2006: 218). 
North America
Market
The Group’s activities in North America centre around two main
market areas – plumbing and heating distribution, which are 
served by Ferguson and Wolseley Canada, and building materials
distribution, which is served by Stock. Ferguson and Wolseley
Canada have now been integrated to bring a more strategic approach
to plumbing and heating distribution at a North American level.
Ferguson is the largest wholesale distributor of plumbing supplies,
pipes, valves and fittings in the USA and a major distributor 
of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems
1
. The company
also distributes waterworks products, fire protection products and
industrial pipes, valves and fittings as well as operating a number of
speciality businesses, serving markets such as the nuclear industry
and a maintenance, repairs and operations management services
business. Ferguson is managed through ‘business groups’ such as
Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (‘HVAC’) and Waterworks.
These business groups allow management to focus on the specific
needs of key groups of customers. Ferguson is present in 50 states,
as well as the District of Columbia and has 1,417 branches 
(2006: 1,237 branches).
Wolseley Canada distributes plumbing, heating and piping
products, including heating, ventilation and air conditioning,
waterworks, refrigeration, industrial pipes, valves and fittings and
fire protection products as well as industrial plumbing supplies 
to customers through its 260 branches (2006: 246 branches).
Stock is the second largest supplier of building materials to
professional home builders and contractors in the USA
2
. Stock is
present in 33 states with 308 locations (2006: 314 locations) and
provides contractors with building materials such as structural
timber products, roofing materials, doors, windows, insulation and
hardware. Stock also assembles and sells a variety of engineered
wood products including roof trusses, and offers customer delivery,
design and installation as well as financing and credit services.
In general, the North American plumbing and heating distribution
market is fragmented with an estimated 95 per cent of distribution
operations employing less than 100 people. Consolidation of
market players has accelerated with some of the major retailers
having moved more significantly into the market. The North
American building materials market is also very fragmented.
Both markets have been impacted in the year by weakness in the
new residential sector of the market which has been affected by 
an oversupply of new homes, rising interest rates and sub-prime
mortgage default issues. Despite this, Ferguson has shown good
organic growth outperforming the market and gaining market
share. Although Stock’s revenue declined, it also outperformed 
its market.
Demographic trends support high rates of home ownership and
residential construction in the long-term with ‘baby boomers’
entering their peak earnings time and purchasing second or trade-
up homes. Baby boomers, who are thought to control a majority of
the wealth in the USA, are also expected to have a significant effect
on the repair and remodel market as their decision to improve their
existing homes will be less influenced by the state of the economy.
The plumbing and heating distribution market is driven by 
new construction and remodelling sales. The latter market is 
less cyclical. The building materials market is influenced similarly
although Stock’s business is currently more focused on the new
residential construction sector and has therefore been significantly
affected by weakness in that market in the year, as well as by lumber
and panel commodity prices which have declined in this period of
weak demand. Annualised housing starts in the USA at 31 July 2007
were 1.37 million per annum
3
, compared with just below 1.8 million
per annum at 31 July 2006.
Splitting the US into four geographic regions and using US Census
information (for housing starts) and estimates provided by North
America’s Home Improvement Research Institute (for remodelling),
it is possible to analyse the split and growth or decline in activity 
of new housing and remodelling by region. This can then be
compared to Wolseley’s share of its business in each of these
regions although it should be noted that this also includes some
revenue from non-residential sources.

In the South and West areas which in 2006 represented 75.2 per cent of new housing starts and 59.7 per cent of remodelling activity, 
the division had 76.9 per cent of its business and hence is well placed to exploit these key markets. 
Management has estimated overall market sizes for North America. For the materials market, market size is based on the final selling 
cost to the installer or end user. For construction services, the market only includes those activities currently serviced by Wolseley.
Management’s best estimate of both Wolseley’s activity in each market and the total size of these markets are set out below:

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
In general the division shows a broad spread of business across the
categories. While residential new construction has declined, the other
segments continue to show growth. Actions are being taken to widen
the Group’s North American business base and increase Wolseley’s
presence in these other market segments. The use of the business
group model providing dedicated focus on customer segments in
North America is assisting progress towards this objective.
Wolseley remains confident that with the continued development in
the strength and depth of its management and the investment being
made in the supply chain, the business is well placed to outperform
in its markets and succeed in meeting its growth targets and
improving margins over time.
Divisional performance
The North American division performed well ahead of a market
which was significantly impacted by a slowdown in the new 
housing sector, maintaining its position as the leading distributor of
construction products to the professional contractor in North America. 
Reported revenue, in sterling, of the division decreased 3.8 per cent
to £8,662 million (2006: £9,008 million), reflecting the 8.1 per cent
negative impact of currency translation and an organic revenue
decline of 4.6 per cent, partly offset by acquisitions. Trading profit, 
in sterling, declined by 19.2 per cent to £487 million (2006: 
£603 million), after charging £12 million of one-off costs relating 
to headcount reductions and branch closures. Currency translation
reduced divisional revenue by £726 million (8.1 per cent) and trading
profit by £49 million (8.1 per cent).
The North American operations are being increasingly integrated
with a number of central functions now supporting all three
businesses. Since 1 August 2007, Wolseley Canada has been
integrated into Ferguson, operating with the same business
structure which focuses on specific customer types, and will benefit
from leveraging the US operations, including the DC network. There
has been a particular focus to reduce aggregate corporate costs
across the North American businesses and functions and these
have declined by 8 per cent. There was a net increase of 188
branches in North America to 1,985 (2006: 1,797). Two new DCs 
in Frost Proof, Florida and Stockton, California are scheduled to be
opened before the end of the 2008 financial year, adding more than
one million square feet of space to the North American DC network.
In the USA, the new residential market continued to be challenging,
but the RMI market and the commercial and industrial sectors
continued to provide opportunities for growth. Aggregate revenue, 
in dollars, from the Group’s US businesses, including acquisitions,
was 4.8 per cent higher but US trading profit, in dollars, was down
by 13.2 per cent due to the decline in profits in Stock. US Dollar
weakness led to an 8.2 per cent adverse currency translation 
impact when US results are reported in sterling. 
US plumbing and heating
Ferguson produced another strong performance with 5.5 per cent
organic growth, from its focus on core businesses and the
advantages gained from its DC network. Commercial and industrial
activity remained strong throughout the year and the RMI market
remained robust for most of the financial year. However, there were
increasing signs of the RMI market slowing towards the end of the
period in response to weaker consumer sentiment relating to the
problems in the sub-prime sector and concerns associated with
the impact of the deteriorating housing market on the US economy. 
Local currency revenue in the US plumbing and heating operations
rose by 14.8 per cent to $11,079 million (2006: $9,651 million) 
with trading profit up by 18.4 per cent to $800 million (2006: $676
million). Organic revenue growth of 5.5 per cent was significantly
ahead of the market generally, benefiting from the diversity of 
the business across waterworks, heating, ventilation and air
conditioning, industrial and commercial as well as residential
markets. Gross margin was up slightly and the trading margin also
improved from 7.0 per cent to 7.2 per cent and is the highest ever
trading margin achieved. The higher trading margin reflects the
business diversity and the specialist product offering as well as 
a focus on cost efficiency. Increases in commodity prices, mainly
copper, gave rise to one-off profits amounting to around $20 million
in the year (2006: $43 million).
Ferguson’s total branch numbers increased by 180 to 1,417 locations
(2006: 1,237). 
US building materials
The continued slowdown in the new residential market, which
accounted for approximately 80 per cent of the activity in this
business, caused a reduction in volumes, increased price competition
and also led to significantly lower lumber and structural panel
prices. These factors have inevitably impacted on Stock’s financial
performance despite an aggressive cost reduction programme.
Stock continues to outperform in most of its major markets with 
a 15 per cent reduction in volumes compared to the 25 per cent
average decline in housing starts.
New housing has continued to be a difficult market with housing
starts having fallen from an average annualised rate of 2.02 million
for the 12 months to 31 July 2006 to an average of 1.54 million 
this year, with the figure in August 2007 being lower, at 1.33 million.
There continues to be significant regional variation with the markets
in Utah, Idaho, Texas and the Carolinas performing relatively better
than the weakest markets in the northeast, midwest, Las Vegas,
Colorado and Florida.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
In local currency, Stock’s revenue was down 13.4 per cent to
$4,596 million (2006: $5,305 million) with trading profit down 
74.9 per cent to $86 million (2006: $343 million), after charging 
the previously announced one off costs of $22 million relating to
branch closures and headcount reductions. During the year, there
was a reduction of around 3,500 people, representing approximately 
20 per cent of Stock’s total workforce. The decline in organic
revenue in the year was 24.2 per cent, reflecting the 15 per cent 
fall in volume and commodity price deflation in lumber and
structural panels, which fell 20 per cent and 24 per cent respectively.
The deflation in commodities, which account for around 43 per cent
of Stock’s revenue, had the effect of reducing local currency
revenue by $470 million (9 per cent). Acquisitions contributed 
$577 million (10.9 per cent) to revenue growth. 
Stock’s gross margin was slightly lower due to pricing pressure in
the difficult markets. The trading margin declined significantly from
6.5 per cent to 1.9 per cent, primarily due to lower volumes and
prices and the effect of one off restructuring costs. 
As part of a cost cutting programme, a number of initiatives have
been undertaken including centralising the sourcing of commodity
products, headcount reductions and the closure of 46 branches.
Stock will continue with its strategy of diversifying its business 
to reduce its dependency on the new residential market and
expand its presence in the commercial and industrial and RMI
markets by a combination of acquisitions and organic growth. 
The Group continues to believe that the US housing market offers
good long-term growth opportunities and Stock will continue to
expand its geographic coverage in selective residential markets
where value creating opportunities are identified. 
As previously announced, there was also a $10 million goodwill and
intangible asset impairment provision recorded as a result of market
conditions in the Midwest region, where a number of branches
were closed. At 31 July 2007, Stock had 308 branches, although,
following the previously announced closure plans, its branch
network going forward will comprise 287 branches across 
33 states (2006: 314 branches).
Wolseley Canada
In Canada, although housing markets held up reasonably well and
economic activity remained positive, business from the oil and gas
exploration industries in Western Canada was weak for most of the
year as a result of warmer weather, lower natural gas prices and
higher gas inventory levels. 
Against this background, Wolseley Canada’s local currency revenue
increased by 2.1 per cent to C$1,357 million (2006: C$1,330 million
and trading profit increased by 0.7 per cent to C$92 million. 
The trading margin declined slightly to 6.8 per cent (2006: 6.9 per cent)
reflecting the initial start up costs of the new regional DC in
Oakville, Ontario. 
Branch numbers in Canada were increased by 14 to 260 (2006: 246).
Future outlook 
Recent events relating to the sub-prime market in the US and the
subsequent concerns over liquidity in global financial markets have
created uncertainty which is reflected in less favourable recent sales
trends for a number of the Group’s businesses. It is too early to
assess whether these trends will continue.
There are no signs yet of any upturn in the US housing market and
the RMI market is now beginning to soften. The commercial and
industrial market should remain positive, albeit at lower rates of
growth. The strength and diversity of the Group’s US operations
and their ability to respond rapidly to the changing operating
environment will enable them to continue to outperform the market.
Generally in Europe, the underlying fundamentals of the
construction markets remain sound and Wolseley’s operations 
are expected to show further good progress. 
Irrespective of market conditions, the Group will continue to
execute its strategy of value creation through a combination of
organic growth and acquisitions. The Group is confident that it will
generate competitive advantage by pursuing the initiatives relating
to supply chain, sourcing and private label. The rigorous focus on
cash flow maximisation and cost efficiency will continue as will the
swift and decisive action in response to prevailing market conditions.
The Group is positioned well to benefit from any improvement in
business and consumer confidence.

Risk management
In any business, there are a number of risks and uncertainties
which could have an impact on its long-term performance. 
The Group has an extensive risk management structure in place
which is designed to identify, manage and mitigate business risk.
The Group recognises that the risks and uncertainties facing its
businesses are constantly changing and it therefore empowers
local companies to monitor these and deploy mitigation resources
as appropriate.
Risk
Market conditions 
Wolseley’s products are distributed to a wide range of customers
in connection with commercial, industrial and residential
construction projects and the Group’s results are consequently
dependent on the levels of activity in their markets. The level of
activity varies by market depending on many factors including
general economic conditions, the availability of credit to finance
customer investment, mortgage and other interest rates, inflation,
unemployment, demographic trends, weather, the price of fuel
and consumer confidence.
Product prices and availability
The market price and availability of products distributed by the
Group, such as stainless steel, copper, plastic, lumber and other
products (or commodities used in such products), can fluctuate.
These fluctuations can affect operating results.
Lumber prices are affected both by changes in the availability
of the raw logs and by changes in the volume and age profile 
of production capacity in the industry. Panel prices in the US 
are affected by housing demand and production capacity.
Product shortages may arise as a result of unexpected demand
or production difficulties and this could have an effect on the
Group’s operations.
Competitive pressures
The Group operates in a number of different markets with differing
characteristics. The principal aspects of the Group’s offerings that
have an impact on its competitive position in a market are product
availability, supply chain efficiency, pricing, the quality of its
people, customer service, branch location, availability of credit, 
an efficient and streamlined organisation, technical product
knowledge with respect to application and usage and advisory
and other service capabilities.
In its markets, Wolseley competes with and is affected by the
actions of many local and regional distributors together with
product manufacturers. Consolidation in the building materials
market may produce pressure on prices and margins, although
the competitive environment remains highly fragmented.

Risk assessment and evaluation is an essential part of the annual
planning cycle and an important aspect of the Group’s internal
control system. The relevant structures and processes across the
Group are more fully described on page 58.
The ability of Wolseley to monitor, assess and respond to these
business risks can often provide it with competitive advantages 
and hence the business’ resources are carefully managed in these
areas. The principal risks faced by the Group and its management
response thereto are summarised below:
Resource management
The Group’s businesses closely monitor both market and
geographic trends and understand lead and lag indicators in 
order to take timely actions to address issues affecting trading. 
The diversity of the Group’s operations, the nature of its customer
base and its ability to react to market changes also provide 
a degree of protection. The Group actively manages both its
acquisitions activity and new branch openings to ensure it is 
best placed to exploit market opportunities.
The Group’s businesses actively review market prices for their
supplies and take steps to protect themselves or, indeed,
maximise opportunities arising from significant anticipated price
rises. In many cases, the businesses are able to cooperate with
their supplier base to manage the effects of such product price
changes. Generally, the Group is able to pass on price increases
from its suppliers to its customers.
The Group sources products from a wide variety of manufacturers
and suppliers with none of these accounting for more than 5 per cent
of its total material and supply purchases during the 2007 financial
year. Increasing collaboration with suppliers including joint demand
forecasting initiatives is also helping to better manage product
shortage issues.
The Group actively works with its customers to find innovative
ways to meet their changing needs in order to remain at the
forefront of its chosen markets. Wolseley’s value proposition is
based on the service, expertise and the product breadth it offers
rather than strictly competing on price.
The combination of Wolseley’s international scale, allowing it to
continually invest efficiently in people, technology and logistics,
thus reducing the underlying cost base, together with local
company autonomy for managing the customer base, is designed
to enhance the Group’s competitive position.

Risk
Systems and infrastructure capabilities
Wolseley targets sustained double-digit growth from a
combination of acquisitions and organic growth. This growth
places increasing demands on Wolseley’s existing systems 
and on its supply chain and logistics infrastructure. Additionally, 
to support and enable future growth, the Group is undertaking
multiple business change initiatives and is in the process of
installing a common IT platform across the Group.
Identification and successful integration of acquisitions
Wolseley’s growth strategy is in part dependent on acquiring
businesses. Market consolidation may, over a period of time, 
lead to increased competition for targets and, as a result, 
higher acquisition prices or fewer value-creating prospects. 
The integration of acquisitions also involves a number of unique
risks, including diversion of management’s attention, failure to
retain key personnel of the acquired business and risks
associated with unanticipated events or liabilities.
Governmental regulations
The Group’s operations are affected by various statutes, regulations
and laws in the countries and markets in which it operates. While
the Group is not engaged in a regulated industry, it is subject to 
the laws governing businesses generally, including laws affecting
land usage, zoning, environmental (including laws and regulations
affecting the supply of lumber), health and safety, transportation,
labour and employment practices (including pensions), competition
and other matters. In addition, building codes or particular tax
treatments may affect the products Wolseley’s customers are
allowed to use and, consequently, changes in these may affect 
the saleability of some Wolseley products. 
Resource management
Wolseley is committed to investing to support its short, medium and
long-term growth targets and ensure the appropriate infrastructure 
is in place. There are several business improvement initiatives 
under way relating to supply chain, sourcing, private label, human
resources, the deployment of technology and customer service.
These initiatives are actively and carefully planned with defined
governance procedures in place. An important component of 
this planning process is to ensure that the risks of disruption 
to the business are controlled and monitored.
The Group continually reviews acquisition targets through
established processes and searches. The status of targeting and
progress in making acquisitions is reported regularly to the Board
and the Executive Committee. 
The Group employs dedicated acquisition and integration teams
whose processes have given the Group a successful track record
of integrating acquisitions and achieving expected results. Recent
changes have been made to the Group’s management structure to
increase the central resource focused on identifying and integrating
acquisitions.
The Group typically targets high quality businesses for acquisition,
which not only quickly contribute to cash flow and earnings, but
also expand the depth of management knowledge and expertise
and provide opportunities for best practice sharing with existing
businesses.
The Group continues to expect to find sufficient, suitably priced
acquisitions, to enable it to meet its growth targets. The Group
also has the advantage of being able to expand and leverage its
extensive existing network as an alternative means to achieving
growth in certain areas.
Post acquisition reviews are carried out on all acquisitions to
ensure achievement of the planned integration benefits.
The Group monitors regulations across its markets to ensure 
that the effects of changes are minimised.
Certain changes in regulations may also positively impact the
businesses. For instance, changes in building regulations in the 
UK with regard to the level of heat insulation required in new
buildings have presented a growth opportunity for Wolseley UK.
Such changes may also provide demand for a broader and higher
margin product range.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Risk
Litigation
The international nature of Wolseley’s operations exposes it to 
the potential for litigation from third parties. In the US, the risk 
of litigation is generally higher than that in Europe in such areas 
as workers’ compensation, general employer liability and
environmental and asbestos litigation.
There is risk that due to the increasing sourcing of products from
lower cost countries, recourse to the manufacturer may be more
difficult were a product to fail for a customer.
People
Wolseley’s ability to provide leadership and products and services
to customers is dependent on retaining sufficiently qualified,
experienced and motivated personnel.
In order to achieve its growth strategy and increase productivity,
Wolseley must continue to increase this skill and experience base
to develop the managers of the future.
Risks related to international operations
Wolseley has its principal operations in Europe and North America
and is therefore subject to the specific risks of conducting
business in these regions. In addition, there are particular risks
arising from managing operations internationally:
• fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect Wolseley’s
reported operating results and its financial position;
• changes in tax regulation and international tax treaties could
affect the financial performance of Wolseley’s foreign operations;
and
• changes in other regulations/treaties may also affect the ability
of the Group to repatriate profits from its foreign operations.
The management of Wolseley’s businesses and personnel across
28 countries can also present logistical and management
challenges due to different business cultures, laws and languages.
Resource management
Wolseley has a culture and approach which is designed to resolve
disputes directly with the party in question in a spirit of openness
and co-operation. Litigation is regarded as a last resort.
In the case of asbestos litigation, Wolseley employs independent
professional advisers to actuarially determine the potential gross
liability, which necessitates the application of certain assumptions
relating to claims development and the cost of settling such 
claims over the remaining lifetime of the potential litigants, which 
is approximately 50 years. There are a number of factors which
could enable actual experience to differ from the assumptions
made. Actual experience is reviewed against the assumptions 
each year and the liability adjusted in the financial statements.
Wolseley has insurance which significantly exceeds the current
estimated liability relating to asbestos claims. Based on current
estimates, no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to
arise in the foreseeable future. Wolseley has recognised a discounted
liability of £35 million in respect of asbestos litigation. An equal
receivable amount of £35 million is shown in other receivables
reflecting the discounted sum recoverable from insurers in respect 
of this liability.
One of Wolseley’s key competitive advantages is the quality and
experience of its people. Local companies have allocated specific
responsibilities for reviewing the performance of senior managers
and employees with high potential. Development and succession
planning for these individuals is planned and strong performance 
is actively rewarded. 
The Group continues to invest significant time and money in senior
management, manager development and graduate trainee and
graduate recruitment programmes. 
Wolseley believes that the benefits of its geographical spread
outweigh the associated risks. The portfolio effect of economic
conditions, exchange rates and other associated factors of having
operations in Europe and North America provide some protection 
in terms of the long-term performance of Wolseley.
The Group continually seeks opportunities to increase its business
diversity and has programmes in place to share best practice.
Increasingly, the Group’s businesses are working together to meet
customers’ needs and to ensure the Group achieves more
international leverage.
The Group seeks to manage its foreign currency risk and the steps
it takes are described in the Financial Risk Management section on
pages 40 to 41. The Group actively works with its taxation advisers
to minimise its tax exposure and risk.

Risk
Credit risk
Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay
outstanding balances.
Stock also provides loans to finance the construction of properties.
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay
outstanding loan balances.
Resource management
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to
review and collect outstanding receivables. Significant outstanding
and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting
actions are put in place on a timely basis. In many cases, protection
is provided through lien rights on projects or through credit
insurance arrangements.
All of the major businesses use professional, dedicated credit
teams, in some cases field based. Not only does this lessen the risk
of non-payment but it can also provide opportunities where these
teams can work with higher risk customers to provide innovative,
secured credit arrangements.
Historic write-off rates are low and appropriate provisions are made
for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis.
Stock’s construction loans are secured on the related properties 
and are managed by a dedicated lending team within that business.
Policies are also applied to provide further protection and KPIs 
are monitored regularly by management outside the business.

Revenue and operating profit
After taking account of currency translation, Group revenue
increased by 14.6 per cent from £14,158 million to £16,221 million.
Operating profit decreased by 9.7 per cent from £834 million 
to £753 million. Trading profit decreased by 0.6 per cent from 
£882 million to £877 million, before deducting amortisation 
and impairment of acquired intangibles of £124 million 
(2006: £48 million).
Currency translation
Currency translation decreased Group revenue by £776 million 
(5.5 per cent) and Group trading profit by £51 million (5.8 per cent)
compared with 2006. Over the past five years the constant
currency growth of the Group is as follows:
Annual growth in % % % %%
constant currency 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003
Revenue growth 21.2 22.8 14.2 29.5 8.5
Trading profit growth 5.5 21.6 19.7 37.2 6.9
Note: 2007, 2006 and 2005 figures prepared under IFRS. 2004
and 2003 figures prepared under UK GAAP.
The effect of US dollar depreciation has been to decrease
translated US profits by £46 million (8.2 per cent) compared with
2006. US dollar denominated profits account for 50.7 per cent of
the Group’s trading profit.
There has been a less significant reduction in the Euro translation
rate which has decreased Euro trading profits by £2 million. 
(1.7 per cent) compared with 2006. Euro denominated profits
accounted for 17.8 per cent of Group trading profit in 2007. If the
results of the Group are translated into dollars at the average rate
for the respective year the results of the Group are as follows:
US$ million 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003
Revenue in US$ 31,610 25,322 20,839 17,746 13,113
Trading profit in US$ 1,709 1,577 1,311 1,085 754
Operating profit in US$ 1,467 1,491 1,300 1,017 706
Note: 2007, 2006 and 2005 figures prepared under IFRS. 2004
and 2003 figures prepared under UK GAAP .
Further US$ figures and the basis of computation of the above
figures can be found within the Information in US dollars section 
on page 125.
Finance costs
Net finance costs of £119 million (2006: £65 million) reflect an
increase in Group debt as a result of the acquisition of DT Group
and other acquisitions and an increase in interest rates, partly offset
by the effect of strong operating cash flow. Net interest receivable
on construction loans amounted to £11 million (2006: £12 million).
Interest cover was 7 times (2006: 14 times).
Tax
The effective tax rate, being tax payable on profit before tax and
amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles, decreased
from 28.4 per cent to 25.4 per cent. This is due to a higher proportion
of the Group’s profits coming from lower tax jurisdictions in Europe
following the DT Group acquisition, the reduction in tax rates in
some companies and the impact of deferred tax on share options.

Earnings per share
Before the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles,
earnings per share decreased by 11.2 per cent from 98.90 pence
to 87.80 pence. Basic earnings per share were down by 19.0 per
cent to 73.52 pence (2006: 90.77 pence). The average number of
shares in issue during the year was 644 million (2005: 592 million).
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 21.55 pence per
share (2006: 19.55 pence per share) to be paid on 30 November
2007 to shareholders registered on 5 October 2007. The total
dividend for the year of 32.40 pence per share is an increase 
of 10.2 per cent on last year’s 29.40 pence. Dividend cover is 
2.3 times (2006: 3.1 times). The increase in dividend for the year
reflects the Board’s confidence in the future prospects of the Group
and its strong financial position. The dividend reinvestment plan will
continue to be available to eligible shareholders.
Financial position
Shareholders’ funds increased by £859 million from £2,592 million to
£3,451 million. The net increase comprised the following elements:

During the year the Group entered into certain foreign exchange
transactions to hedge the Group’s foreign currency net assets.
Gains and losses on these transactions were taken to reserves.
The gains and losses are subject to taxation and accordingly 
the taxation arising has been charged to reserves.
On 25 September 2006, a placing of approximately 10 per cent 
of Wolseley plc’s issued ordinary share capital raised £655 million
before issue costs of £9 million to restore the Group’s financial
flexibility and enable it to continue to pursue its strategy of organic
and acquisitive growth.
The Group’s employee benefit trusts purchased 2.6 million shares
for £27 million, including dealing costs, during the period in order 
to allow greater flexibility in the settlement of long-term employee
incentives.
Net debt, excluding construction loan borrowings, at 31 July 2007
amounted to £2,467 million compared to £1,950 million at 31 July
2006, giving gearing of 71.5 per cent compared with 75.2 per cent
at the previous year end and down from 89.6 per cent at the half year.
The movement of sterling against overseas currencies, particularly
the US dollar, resulted in a translation difference of £86 million
which decreased net debt on the balance sheet.
The Group seeks to maintain a level of gearing, generally in the
range of 40 to 100 per cent, to strike an appropriate balance
between maintaining an efficient capital structure and having
sufficient flexibility to fund further acquisitions. Interest cover for 
the year was 7 times (2006: 14 times). The Group is content to 
see interest cover in the 7–10 times range over a number of years
but would allow the cover to reduce to 5 times in appropriate
circumstances.
In the US, construction loan receivables, financed by an equivalent
amount of construction loan borrowings, were £286 million (2006:
£313 million). The decrease reflects a more cautious approach to
lending following the decline in the US new housing market and the
decline in the US dollar. 
Return on gross capital employed (‘ROGCE’) decreased from 
18.8 per cent to 13.7 per cent as a result of the significant
reduction in profit at Stock and higher acquisition spend, partly
offset by some organic growth and tighter control over working
capital. The ROGCE remains above the Group’s weighted average
cost of capital. 
The unamortised balance of acquisition goodwill in the balance
sheet as at 31 July 2007 is £1,890 million (2006: £1,173 million)
with the increase being due to the goodwill arising on acquisitions
in the year offset by a small amount of goodwill impairment 
in Stock. As set out on page 89 in note 12 to the accounts, 
the Group recognised, in accordance with IAS 38, acquired
intangibles of £549 million (2006: £251 million). These represent,
principally, customer relationships and brand names.
Provisions in the balance sheet (note 26) include the estimated
liability for asbestos claims on a discounted basis. This liability has
been determined by independent professional actuarial advisers.
The asbestos related litigation is fully covered by insurance and
accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been included 
in receivables. The level of insurance cover available significantly
exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash
flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
There were 320 claims outstanding at 31 July 2007 (2006: 246). 
The Group’s retirement benefit obligations have decreased from
£189 million to £111 million, largely due to an actuarial gain of 
£67 million on the main UK defined benefit pension scheme. 
Full details of the pension schemes operated by the Group are 
set out in note 27 to the accounts.

Shareholder return
The Group monitors relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) for
incentive purposes (as set out within the Remuneration report on
pages 63 and 64) and for assessing relative financial performance.
For the year ended 31 July 2007, Wolseley achieved an annualised
TSR of 5.96 per cent based on the average closing price achieved
during July 2007, which put it in 57th position against the
monitored peer group of 65 companies drawn from the FTSE 100
and the building materials and construction sectors utilised for the
latest award under the long-term incentive plan. Details of TSR
performance since 2003 and the composition of the peer group 
are set out in the Remuneration report. We continue to monitor
return on capital including goodwill, throughout the Group, as one
of the key measures of business performance. ROGCE (as defined
in the Five year summary on page 124) was 13.7 per cent (2006:
18.8 per cent), ahead of the Group’s weighted average cost of
capital. At the close of business on the date of the Report of the
Directors, the value of an ordinary share as quoted in the Financial
Times was 807.5 pence per share (2006: 1094.0 pence), a decline
of 26.2 per cent. The decrease primarily reflects adverse market
sentiment relating to the Group’s exposure to the weak US housing
market. The market capitalisation of the Group at the date of this
Report was £5,339 million (2006: £7,190 million). The total dividend
of 32.40 pence per share in respect of the financial year gives a
yield of 4.0 per cent.
Net cash flow from operating activities increased from £850 million
to £1,299 million, despite the reduction in trading profit as the
Group has improved its management of working capital. Free 
cash flow after dividends was £626 million (2006: £285 million).
Capital expenditure increased from £346 million to £396 million,
reflecting continued investment in the business. During the 
period the distribution centre and branch network in the US was
expanded, investment continued in distribution centres in France
and Italy and further expenditure was incurred on the common 
IT platform. Capital expenditure is expected to remain at a relatively
high level over the next few years with further investments in
distribution centres, new branch openings and IT as the Group
continues to put in place the infrastructure required to support
substantial growth and improved margins.
Investments in acquisitions completed during the year, including any
deferred consideration and net debt, amounted to £1,718 million
(2006: £914 million) with £1,339 million invested in DT Group and
£379 million invested in 43 bolt-on acquisitions. These 43 acquisitions
are expected to add around £671 million per annum of incremental
revenues in a full year. Further details regarding acquisitions are
included on page 106 in note 31 to the accounts.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained
profits and bank and other borrowings. The Group borrows in the
desired currencies principally at floating rates of interest and then
uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate
profile, thereby managing the Group’s exposure to interest rate
fluctuations. 
At the year end approximately £1,102 million of the Group’s net
debt was at fixed rates for one year or more, after taking account
of swaps. 
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at both
Treasury Committee and Board meetings. The Treasury Committee
gives prior approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements.
Liquidity risk
The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing
headroom to finance all investment and bolt-on acquisitions for the
following financial year with an additional contingent safety margin.
Large acquisitions such as DT Group are funded shortly before the
acquisition is made.
The Group currently has undrawn centrally managed facilities in
excess of £1 billion.
On 25 September 2006 DT Group was acquired, funded by a
syndicated bank facility for a1,500 million (£1,011 million) with a
maturity of 18 months. Also on 25 September the Group placed
approximately 10 per cent of Wolseley plc issued ordinary share
capital raising £646 million. These net proceeds were used to repay
a964 million (£646 million) of the 18 month facility. As at 31 July
2007, the outstanding drawings under the 18 month facility were
a500 million (£338 million). This facility will mature during the year
ending 31 July 2008 and will be refinanced from existing facilities.
A further £250 million of short-term facilities with core banks are
renewed on an annual basis.
Following its acquisition by Wolseley, DT Group renegotiated its
local bank facilities consisting of a DKK3,000 million (£272 million)
multi-currency revolving facility and DKK2,076 million (£188 million)
of mortgage facilities. These facilities are now on the same commercial
terms and financial covenants as the main Group facilities.
The year-end maturity profile of the Group’s centrally managed
facilities was as follows: 
2007 2006

Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international
operations. The Group has well defined and consistently applied
policies for the management of foreign exchange and interest rate
exposures. There has been no change since the year end in the
major financial risks faced by the Group. The main risks arising
from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity
risk and foreign currency risk.
The Treasury Committee of the Board reviews and agrees policies
for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies are regularly reviewed. The Group’s financial
instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and
liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and
trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The Group
also enters into derivative transactions (principally interest rate
swaps and forward foreign currency contracts). The purpose of
such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency
risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance.
Details of financial instruments are shown on page 92 in note 20 
to the accounts.
Derivatives are also used to a limited extent to hedge movements 
in the price paid for lumber. These options and futures hedging
contracts mature within one year and all are with organised
exchanges. The Group’s policy is to control credit risk by only
entering into financial instruments with authorised counterparties
after taking account of their credit rating. 
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s
policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative
transactions be undertaken.

The Group monitors two principal measures of financial gearing, 
the ratio of net debt to shareholders’ funds and the ratio of net
debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortisation). Over the longer term the Group aims to maintain 
the ratio of net debt to shareholders’ funds within the range 
of 50 to 75 per cent and as at 31 July 2007 the ratio was 
71.5 per cent.
The Group’s main borrowing facilities all contain a financial
covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. For all facilities
agreed after 1 August 2005 this ratio has been set at 3.5. As at 
31 July 2007 the ratio was 2.2:1 (2006: 1.9:1). The Group aims 
to maintain this ratio generally in the range of 1.5 to 2.3.
For the Group, these two ratios are highly correlated both historically
and prospectively and the two ranges are closely aligned.

Foreign currency risk
The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are
mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the
operations are located. Approximately 49.6 per cent of the Group’s
revenue is in US dollars. The Group does not have significant
transactional foreign currency cash flow exposure. However, those
that do arise are generally hedged with either forward contracts or
currency options. The Group does not normally hedge profit
translation exposure since such hedges have only temporary effect.
Most of the foreign currency earnings generated by the Group’s
overseas operations are reinvested in the business to fund growth 
in those territories. The Group’s policy is to maintain the majority of
its debt in the currencies of its operating companies as this hedges
both the net assets and cash flows of the Group.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of
overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the
translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies
used by the Group, are shown in the Five year summary on page 124.
The net effect of currency translation was to decrease revenue by
£776 million (5.5 per cent) and to decrease trading profit by £51 million
(5.8 per cent).
These currency effects reflect a movement of the average sterling
exchange rate against each of the major currencies with which the
Group is involved as follows:
2007 2006
(Strengthening)/ (Strengthening)/
weakening weakening
of sterling of sterling
US dollar (8.2)% 3.5%
Euro (1.7)% 0.1%
Commodity risk
The Group’s operating performance is affected by price fluctuations
in stainless steel, nickel alloy, copper, aluminium, plastic, lumber
and other commodities. The Group seeks to minimise the effects 
of changing prices through economies of purchasing and inventory
management, resulting in cost reductions and productivity
improvements as well as price increases to maintain reasonable
profit margins. With the exception of lumber futures held to hedge
future sales commitments, no trading instruments are held in
respect of these commodities. At 31 July 2007, the Group held 
no lumber futures contracts.
Market price risk
The Group regularly monitors its interest rate and currency risk by
reviewing the effect on profit before tax over various periods of a
range of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates. On
the basis of the Group’s analysis, it is estimated that the maximum
effect of a rise of one percentage point in the principal interest rates
on the Group’s continuing businesses would result in an increase 
in the interest charge of approximately £17 million. Similarly, it is
estimated that a strengthening of sterling by 10 per cent against 
all the currencies in which the Group does business would reduce
operating profit before amortisation and impairment of acquired
intangibles by approximately £72 million (8.3 per cent) due to
currency translation, with the US dollar reduction being £45 million
and the Euro reduction being £12 million.
Financial reporting
These financial statements are the Group’s second prepared under
IFRS. The Group’s accounting policies set out on pages 73 to 77 
of the accounts have remained unchanged from those disclosed
last year.
Insurance
The Group has a captive insurance company which is registered
and operational in the Isle of Man. No policies are written for 
third parties. The administration is undertaken by a specialist
management company. The Group’s insurance arrangements 
are reviewed annually.
Going concern
The Directors are confident, on the basis of current financial
projections and facilities available, that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the
foreseeable future. Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

WE ARE COMMITTED 
TO SOUND
CORPORATE SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY
Wolseley believes that implementing and developing
its Corporate Social Responsibility (‘CSR’) policies 
is integral to its operations. We are committed to
CSR as a sustainable approach to business that
benefits all stakeholders: customers, employees,
shareholders, as well as communities in general. Corporate social responsibility report 45
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Wolseley aims to uphold the highest standards of environmental
and social responsibility. CSR issues form part of the overall internal
control process and the safety and well-being of Wolseley’s
employees are paramount. The Company is a constituent member
of the FTSE4Good Index of socially responsible companies,
designed to measure the performance of companies that meet
globally recognised corporate responsibility standards.
This year, in addition to other relevant information, the Group 
is reporting for the first time on its carbon (CO 2
) emissions,
management of waste and use of water. A common platform 
has been established in order that such environmental information
from the Group’s diverse operations can be measured and reviewed
on a regular and consistent basis. 
We are continuing to develop systems which will enable and
enhance CSR reporting across all of the Group’s businesses
including in relation to CO 2
emissions, waste management and 
the use of water. 
Health, safety and environment
Wolseley operates a largely decentralised structure and one of the
key drivers of the Group’s success has been the high degree of
autonomy which is afforded to local managements, allowing each
to serve their markets in the manner most suited to their business.
Within this structure, the Board has set down a number of health,
safety and environmental principles with which all the Group’s
businesses are required to comply. Environmental principles include
the integration of environmental management into business
operations, a commitment to prevent pollution and comply with
local environmental legislation and ensuring proper communication
with employees on environmental matters. Health and safety
principles include the prohibition of substance abuse, fleet
maintenance in compliance with local legislation, the provision and
use of protective clothing and apparatus and full safety training for
all employees. 
Environment Management Systems
Our products impact the environment at every stage of their
life cycle, from the sourcing of materials through to their use
and disposal.
Wolseley’s aim is to continue to make improvements in
environmental performance through the efficient use of energy,
water and packaging and it has established systems to enable 
it to measure and set targets to reduce environmental impacts
throughout the Group. 
This year, following the continued development of its Environmental
Management System, Wolseley UK has attained ISO 14001
accreditation in a further eight branches, bringing the total to 
11 accredited branches. 
Carbon (CO2) Emissions 
Emissions of CO
2
have been reported according to the Greenhouse
Gas Protocol, which was jointly developed by the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources
Institute. The protocol differentiates between emissions for which
businesses are directly responsible, indirect emissions caused in
the generation of supplied electricity and all other indirect emissions
both upstream and downstream. As it is impossible to know or
control the negligible downstream emissions generated when
products sold by the Group are used, they have been excluded
from this report. Similarly, reporting on the upstream emissions of
our businesses would currently rely heavily on estimates and, as a
result, they have also been excluded from this analysis. However,
given the nature of our operations, the Group does believe that it 
is appropriate to report on the emissions from third-party provided
transportation.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
In total, the representative Group businesses within this report emitted
a total of 498,912 tonnes of CO 2
in the year ended 31 July 2007.
Approximately 70.0 per cent of the CO 2
emissions were as a result
of direct emissions from fossil-fuel consumption of which 34.6 per cent
were related to business operations and 65.4 per cent were related
to vehicle fuel use. Wolseley is committed to taking all practicable
steps to reduce its carbon footprint across the Group.
Waste Management
Wolseley recognises its responsibility to measure and minimise 
the waste generated by its business activities. Waste is divided 
into hazardous and non-hazardous, with hazardous waste
containing properties which may render it harmful to human health
or the environment and non-hazardous waste comprising general
office waste such as paper, card, wood, plastics and metals. 
All of the Group’s businesses comply with their applicable waste
management regulations.

Wolseley UK is continuing to implement initiatives to reduce, 
reuse and recycle its waste through waste segregation facilities
such as skips, wheelie bins and rear-end loader bins. A project 
to recycle waste from branches back to the Regional Distribution
Centres (‘RDCs’) began in February 2007 and the company has 
set a target of decreasing waste to landfill by 5 per cent and
increasing recycling by 5 per cent across the RDC network year 
on year. All RDCs are now recycling cardboard and plastic and 
this is being monitored on a monthly basis. As part of the
objectives for 2007/08, Wolseley UK is working with a number 
of its largest suppliers to reduce the quantity and improve the
environmental quality of packaging used in its supply chain with 
the aim of minimising the environmental impact of waste for its
business and customers.
As required by respective domestic legislation, Wolseley UK and
Brossette both comply with the European Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment Directive (the WEEE Directive) regarding
electrical material waste. Brossette has also installed containers at
each of its branches for the collection of plastic, paper, wood and
metal for recycling. ÖAG is a licensed member of the Abfallrecycling
Austria AG (‘ARA’) and complies with all Austrian legislation with
respect to waste collection and disposal and is subject to regular
ARA audits.
In Ireland, Heatmerchants backhauls all of its waste paper,
cardboard, wood pallets and plastic from its branches back to 
its distribution centre for recycling. During the year, over 2,800
tonnes of such material was recycled, resulting in cost savings 
of a500,000. Beijer in Sweden, a part of DT Group (‘DT’), has 
this year recycled 4,000 tonnes of waste, saving it from landfill,
which resulted in cost savings of approximately £200,000.
Stock Building Supply (‘Stock’) employs a process at its 
operational locations to identify recycling opportunities and waste
stream reduction, focused on removing solid wastes and recyclable
material in amounts which maximise the tonnage per haul, thereby
minimising environmental impact, expense and the number of hauls
needed to service its operations.
Water Use
Wolseley recognises that, irrespective of geography, water can 
be a scarce resource. Steps have been taken during the year 
to measure water consumption throughout the Group to enable 
the appropriate goals to be set for greater water efficiency.

Energy Efficiency
In the year ended 31 July 2007, Ferguson installed high efficiency
heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment and controls,
and energy efficient fluorescent lights in its warehouses which offer
up to 50 per cent greater energy efficiency than standard lamps.
The Wolseley UK standard fit-out specification for its warehouses
and distribution centres incorporates energy saving measures
including low energy lighting, high frequency lamps and lighting
controls. This area of energy efficiency is constantly being reviewed
to ensure the specification reflects current developments and best
practice in this area.
Environmental Opportunities
Wolseley UK’s Sustainable Building Centre (‘SBC’), a 6,800 square
foot interactive showcase for renewable and sustainable building
materials, is presently under construction and is scheduled to be
fully operational by April 2008. The building features the best
available sustainable construction products selected from a
bespoke range provided through Wolseley UK trading brands. The
range, which has been established since the beginning of 2007, is
already proving attractive to many Wolseley customers in a diverse
range of business segments. Wolseley UK intends that the SBC will
become the leading UK industry resource for sustainable building
products and supporting information, promoting sustainable
building best practices.
The SBC project has firmly established Wolseley UK as a leader
within the sustainable building sector in the UK. Customer demand
for sustainable materials will be supported as regulatory standards
such as the UK Code for Sustainable Homes, the European
Performance of Buildings Directive and the Merton Rule, the
planning policy which requires the use of renewable energy onsite
to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions in the built environment,
are implemented. Wolseley UK will continue to monitor product
advances and process changes in order to maintain excellence 
in the growing sustainable construction sector.
Timber
Responsible sourcing of raw timber products contributes 
to the success of sustainable forestry.
As part of the ongoing development of our CSR strategy, Wolseley
continues to recognise the importance of sustainable timber
sourcing and the elimination of illegally logged timber from the
supply chain and has well established policies in this area. 
Wolseley is committed to the responsible purchasing of forest
products from forests certified as well managed. This commitment
is set out in a Global Timber Policy and will be realised through 
a stepwise approach that utilises the best available techniques 
and information.
Wolseley aims to source timber products from forests or forest
product suppliers that comply with all relevant legislation in the
country of origin relating to trade in forest products and trade 
from protected areas, parks or similar areas. We also aim to source 
such products from forest areas or regions that are not subject 
to censure under the United Nations resolutions including number
2001/1343. 
Wolseley engages with its suppliers and seeks information as to 
the source of all forest products in order to evaluate this information
against its policies. Working with and encouraging suppliers who
support credible certification, Wolseley is committed to best
practice and to reviewing and reporting progress in this area.
The Group continues to work with local forest management
organisations and certification agencies to increase the amount 
of certified timber it purchases and just over 80 per cent of the
8,464,000 cubic metres of timber purchased in the year was from
certified sources. Unless the appropriate permits are in place, none
of the Group’s businesses purchase any species of timber included
in any of the Appendices to the Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which identify
threatened species of trees. All of the Group’s businesses have
engaged with their suppliers of Indonesian plywood to ensure that
any illegal logging is excluded from the supply chain.
For the fourth consecutive year, Stock purchased 90 per cent of 
its timber from suppliers certified by recognised sustainable forestry
agencies, such as the American Forest Products Association and
the Canadian Standards Association. Less than 0.05 per cent of
the 5,467,000 cubic metres of timber purchased by Stock during
the year consisted of Lauan plywood.
Wolseley UK continues to work with the UK Timber Trade Federation
to assess suppliers of timber products to ensure the legal and
sustainable status of timber supplied, particularly if it is sourced
from Asia Pacific, South America or West Africa. During the year, 
65 per cent of Wolseley UK’s 357,000 cubic metres of timber
purchased consisted of softwood and 30 per cent consisted of
products such as plywood. Build Center is now the UK’s leading
distributor of Forest Stewardship Council (‘FSC’) approved plywood.
PB & M SA (‘PBM’) works with its suppliers to ensure that timber 
is sourced from sustainable forests which have been certified by
recognised forestry associations promoting sustainable forestry
management. During the year, 76 per cent of the 925,000 cubic
metres of timber purchased by PBM was sourced from Russia,
Finland, Germany and France and less than 1 per cent consisted 
of plywood sourced from Indonesia under permit. 
This year, in recognition of its forestry and wood production
management, PBM became the first trading company in France 
to be awarded a ‘Two Leaf’ rating from Le Commerce du Bois, 
the French timber trade federation, which has developed a code 
of practice that sets standards for timber sourcing, purchasing 
and distribution throughout France. 
DT, which is a member of the Danish timber trade federation,
purchased most of its softwood from local forests, with small
amounts coming from Chile, China and the Baltic States. 
Less than 1 per cent of the 1,453,000 cubic metres of timber
purchased by DT during the year comprised hardwood sourced
from local wholesalers, Indonesia and Ivory Coast.

Heatmerchants in Ireland purchased 247,000 cubic metres

suppliers free of UN censure.
Chain of custody
Wolseley believes that whilst sustainable sourcing is vital, it is also
key that illegal timber be eliminated from the supply chain, from the
forest of origin to the end user. 
The chain of custody scheme, introduced in Build Center in the 
UK in 2003, now covers 3,660 products and certification has been
achieved at a further 85 branches during the year (exceeding the
target of 59 branches). Products within the chain of custody
scheme have been independently audited and approved by, or 
on behalf of, both the FSC and Programme for the Endorsement 
of Forest Certification (‘PEFC’). The scheme provides evidence that
products originate from certified, well-managed forests at any point
in the supply chain, giving our customers an independent guarantee
that the timber we are supplying is from a legal and sustainable
forest source.
Some 68 per cent of the timber purchased by Wolseley UK during
the year was controlled within the chain of custody scheme, an
increase of over 130 per cent from 2006. 
During the year, chain of custody certification was awarded to
PBM’s softwood import business, following such certification of its
hardwood business and its garden products business in 2003. In
line with its targets, 100 per cent of PBM’s timber purchased during
the year had either FSC or PEFC chain of custody certification.
Stock does not have a formal chain of custody procedure for its
timber as it relies upon the chain of custody procedures in place
within its suppliers. However, the vast majority of purchases made
by Stock are from suppliers who hold recognised certifications and
whose harvests are strictly controlled by US and Canadian Federal
and State law. Stock maintains an extensive dialogue with its
suppliers regarding sustainability issues, including chain of custody.

Transport
We continually seek ways to reduce our environmental
footprint.
Last year, the Group introduced a common standard for transport
management systems across its operations. This continues to be
implemented and will enable real-time transport management
systems to improve route planning and resource scheduling across
different business sectors and between multiple sites. This will help to
ensure increased efficiency in the utilisation of commercial vehicles.
The Group continues to focus on improving fuel consumption
across its primary distribution fleet, switching fuels where viable 
and replacing old vehicles with more fuel efficient models. 
Wolseley UK has continued to improve its transport fleet utilisation
by focusing on efficient route planning to minimise delivery journeys
and the number of kilometres travelled. The target set in 2005 to
reduce overall kilometres travelled by eight per cent remains on
track and is expected to be achieved by the end of July 2008.
Ferguson and Stock are continually evaluating and optimising all
modes of transportation to manage costs and reduce miles driven
by all freight carriers. The ability to measure the mileage reduction
and consequent fuel savings as a result of this optimisation is
currently being developed and should be fully established during 2008. 
Stock is in the process of testing new technology that treats friction
causing parts in engines and transmissions. First results have
shown a reduction in emissions of 14 per cent and increased 
fuel economy of 12 per cent in the tested vehicles. It is planned 
to continue to test a larger sample of the fleet and if similar results
are observed, consideration will be given to the introduction of this
technology across the fleet.
All new cars purchased by Brossette in France and Tobler in
Switzerland are low-emission vehicles. New trucks purchased 
by Mart in Hungary comply to the EUR04 standard as do all 
new trucks purchased by Manzardo in Italy. 
Accreditations during the year
• Wolseley UK attained ISO 14001 accreditation in a further 
eight branches.
• Mart in Hungary and Cesaro in the Czech Republic
continued ISO 9001 accreditation for their quality
management processes. Corporate social responsibility report 49
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Health and safety
The Company has developed a health and safety framework 
which requires local management to have suitable procedures in
place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations
and best practices promoted by the Group. An important objective
for the Group is to achieve work environments free from injury and
illness attained as a direct result of improvements in our health and
safety performance. 
Wolseley UK has established an executive safety steering group,
supported by its health and safety department, comprising senior
managers and local board directors. The steering group reviews 
the UK businesses’ performance in health and safety matters,
promotes good practice and ensures appropriate consultation 
on any intended changes to its health and safety management
systems. All branch and area managers are trained in this area 
and all employees are trained to complete their daily tasks in a 
safe manner. Wolseley UK has also introduced new workplace
health and safety initiatives including a new health and safety
employee handbook and improved in-branch communications.
These initiatives support the company’s ‘Don’t Walk By’ initiative,
encouraging pro-active responses from employees in relation 
to all health and safety matters.
During the year, Wolseley UK introduced two new awards for its
operations. The company’s ‘Health and Safety Awards’ incorporate
five separate categories for various achievements in this field 
which are awarded to the highest performing branch locations 
and promote a positive attitude towards occupational health and
safety. The ‘Commercial Driver of the Year Award’ aims to reinforce
Wolseley’s commitment to road safety, helping to promote the
highest standards of driving amongst Wolseley UK’s commercial
fleet. The first of these annual events was held in October 2006. 
In France, Brossette has a central health and safety committee,
which oversees individual branch health and safety committees.
Representatives of Brossette and its employees sit on each local
committee, together with an occupational health doctor. All new
employees and managers receive appropriate induction and
training, including matters of health and safety. PBM also seeks 
to increase awareness of the importance of health and safety
throughout its business by reinforcing the responsibility of each 
of its employees and their role in maintaining and improving health
and safety standards. During the year, a Wolseley France health
and safety committee was established and a number of initiatives
to promote enhanced health and safety performance are being
implemented across the business. 
Wolseley Canada was awarded a ‘Work Safe Alberta Best Safety
Performer Award’ from the Province of Alberta during the year.
This is awarded to those companies that have a 40 per cent lower
than industry average of disabling injuries, no work-related fatalities
in the previous three years, no outstanding compliance orders
under Alberta’s Occupational Health and Safety legislation and 
no pending prosecutions under the legislation.
In North America, Ferguson and Stock have continued to work
together to enhance their health and safety performance including
the incidence of traffic accidents. This has been driven, through 
the North American safety committee, by the desire to reduce the
number of work-related injuries and the resulting consequences that
such events have on other employees and the business. This has
produced significant improvements in the longer-term trends in both
companies’ health and safety records. Of those employees who 
have been injured at work during the year, approximately 98 per cent
have returned to work either on modified duty or to their original jobs
and the costs, including those associated with medical and other
expenses for claims for workers’ compensation, were reduced by
some $4 million. This project has now been extended to include
Wolseley Canada. It is proposed to develop further initiatives within
the Group’s European businesses applying the experience achieved
in North America as appropriate. 
Wolseley North America held a Winning Ideas in Safety & Health
(W.I.S.H.) competition during the year for its employees across
each of its businesses in the USA and Canada. This helped to
enforce its commitment to strengthening the safety culture across
all of the Group businesses, with the aim of promoting safety as 
an underlying theme in the way they operate each day.
Stock continues to operate and develop its ‘Driven to Safety’
programme which was first introduced in 2005. This is a proactive
safe driver training programme, where every driver is trained in 
a variety of ways to recognise hazardous conditions, plan the
appropriate response and take decisive action. As a result of this
programme, Stock was recognised for its outstanding results in
reducing its vehicle insurance claims by being presented this year
with Liberty Mutual’s Gold Fleet Safety Award. The Driven to Safety
initiative was also implemented by Ferguson during the year.
Ferguson has continued to promote its Customer ‘CARE’
(Customers and Associates Require Excellence) programme which
is intended to symbolise Ferguson’s determination to achieve a
culture of excellence throughout the organisation. The programme
includes two goals aimed at communicating the importance of
safety and quality and to promote a safe working environment 
for all of its employees. 
In common with Mart in Hungary which obtained its accreditation 
in 1997, Cesaro in the Czech Republic has also continued to
demonstrate its commitment to customer care during the year
following its achievement of ISO 9001 accreditation for its quality
management processes. The continued accreditations reflect 
the companies’ commitment to meet applicable regulatory
requirements and exceed customer quality expectations through
continuous improvement. 50 Corporate social responsibility report
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Acquisitions
A great deal of importance is placed on environmental matters
during the due diligence process for acquisitions. Where appropriate,
external environmental consultants review and assess environmental
risks to which the Group could potentially become exposed.
Depending upon the type of proposed acquisition, this assessment
could include reviews of environmental management systems,
compliance with laws and regulations and the respect and care
shown for the environment. A review of health and safety
compliance and processes is also carried out as part of due
diligence. Dialogue with, and indemnities from, the proposed
vendors are sought where appropriate.
Code of Ethics
The Group’s Code of Ethics (the ‘Code’) sets out a number of
fundamental principles which all Group companies and employees
are required to follow. The Code covers many areas including fair
competition, compliance with laws, including anti-trust laws, 
and maintenance of the Group’s reputation for integrity, including 
a prohibition on bribery and general principles for dealing with
suppliers and authorities. The Code can be viewed on the
Company’s website at www.wolseley.com or a printed copy 
is available from the Company Secretary.
In keeping with our decentralised approach, businesses are
required to adopt their own codes which respect local cultures and
businesses but which also set clear standards which are no less
exacting than those detailed in the Code. These individual codes
are appropriate to the scope of the local operation and endorse
existing practices. All new companies joining the Group are required
to adopt codes of ethics on the same basis as existing businesses. 
£14m
Spent on employee
training during the year
The workplace
One of the Board’s objectives is to ensure that Wolseley provides 
a workplace environment that encourages and supports all employees
to achieve their best personal performance. Wolseley continues 
to operate, through its ‘International Leadership Development
Programme’, a global training programme designed to develop 
and improve the management and leadership skills of its senior and
high potential managers. To date, over 700 employees have attended
Wolseley management training programmes and 30 senior executives
have attended leadership development programmes at Harvard and
other universities. Training programmes for all levels of employee
continue to be a high priority for the Company with over £14 million
spent on employee training during the year. 
Wolseley UK undertook its second annual company-wide employee
survey during the year, inviting employees to suggest areas for
improvement and voice any concerns. Its 2006 survey highlighted
improvements needed in internal communications and, in response,
the company has continued the roll-out of a series of employee
engagement initiatives. Employees are now kept informed and
involved through a wide range of communication channels, ranging
from a regular newsletter to programmes with a strong platform for
two-way dialogue. These include face-to-face meeting forums for
all levels of management and employees, as well as the expansion
of a monthly online chat session, which generated over 2,300
questions during the year. Each session is hosted by a senior
manager from Wolseley UK. Themes and topics that do not receive
sufficient coverage during the online sessions gain a response in
the weeks following the live event and all questions and answers
are posted on the company’s intranet to allow employees who 
were not able to join the live event an opportunity to participate.
A ‘Back to the Floor’ programme involving office-based 
employees spending time in the branch network has helped to
improve understanding of business operations and the evaluation
and feedback from this has been very encouraging. This initiative,
as part of a suite of programmes, received external recognition
including a ‘Best in Class’ in the 2006 CiB National Communications
Excellence Strategy Awards.
Achievements during the year
• PBM was the first trading company in France to be awarded
a ‘Two Leaf’ rating from Le Commerce du Bois.
• Wolseley UK was awarded a ‘Best in Class’ in the 2006 
CiB National Communications Excellence Strategy Awards.
• Stock Building Supply was presented with Liberty Mutual’s
Gold Fleet Safety Award.
• Wolseley UK was awarded the Royal Society of the
Prevention of Accidents Gold Award for Occupational 
Health & Safety. 
• Wolseley Canada was awarded ‘Work Safe Alberta Best
Safety Performer Award’.  Corporate social responsibility report 51

Community relations
The Group recognises its responsibility to support the 
communities in which our businesses operate and to act 
as a good corporate citizen.
Wolseley is a member of Business in the Community in the UK 
and continues to work with that organisation to help develop our
approach and practice. 
The Group’s businesses are involved in a wide range of initiatives
for the benefit of local communities.
Wolseley UK is supporting British Gymnastics, the UK national
governing body for the sport, as part of the FTSE-British Olympic
Association initiative. As the UK builds up to hosting the Olympic
Games in 2012, the initiative aims to link companies with sports’
governing bodies to help improve the effectiveness of their
business delivery and performance. The initial focus of the 
Wolseley UK-British Gymnastics partnership will be executive level
consultation, strategic marketing guidance, commercial proposition
development, customer research and targeted marketing activities.
Over the coming months and years, it is hoped that many Wolseley
UK employees will be able to get involved with the partnership,
especially at a local level, where British Gymnastics promotes its
sport at schools and clubs in employees’ communities.
Ferguson in the USA actively promotes the education and
development of young people in Newport News, where Ferguson’s
head office is based. Involvement with organisations such as the
Boy Scouts of America, the Boys & Girls Club, Achievable Dream,
Preschool Partners and the Rita Welsh Adult Literacy Program
emphasise the company’s commitment to the development 
of future community leaders. Ferguson and Stock also made
substantial donations to the Jamestown Foundation, the Virginia
State Agency that manages the Jamestown Settlement and
Yorktown Victory Center history museums, supporting the acquisition
of artefacts, new exhibit features and educational programmes. 
Silvan, one of DT Group’s subsidiaries in Denmark, has embarked
on a programme to encourage the employment of people aged
over 50 and receiving unemployment or disability benefit. The
programme offers flexible working hours, practical training with
hands-on experience in one of Silvan’s stores, personal coaching
and mentoring and continued personal monitoring with the aim of
over 70 per cent of participants obtaining paid employment at the
end of the programme. 
The Group’s North American businesses continued their support 
for Habitat for Humanity, a non-profit organisation that seeks to
eliminate substandard housing and homelessness. As part of this
programme, in excess of $2 million in cash and goods in kind was
contributed across North America and a national partnership has
been established whereby branches throughout North America
make donations of materials for every Habitat house built. 
This is expected to benefit up to 5,000 houses in the next year.
Ferguson also donates to ReStores across the USA through both
product donation and employees’ volunteer time. ReStore is a
network of building material warehouses that collects donated
materials from individuals, businesses and building contractors to
be resold to the public for a profit. The profits made from the sale
of these materials fund the construction of Habitat for Humanity
homes across North America.
Donations
The Group supports charities relevant to the countries and
locations in which its businesses operate. These are wide-ranging
and cover health, welfare, education, civic and community 
projects as well as culture and the arts. Each year, several hundred
donations are made. Many of our employees in North America
make regular contributions to the United Way, an organisation
which distributes funds to charities. A Give As You Earn Scheme
operates in the UK with the assistance of the Charities Aid
Foundation which distributes funds to UK charities. During the 
year, employees in the UK raised £400,000 for the children’s charity
NCH by undertaking a Grand Trek. DT Group in Denmark has
made significant donations to charities caring for the mentally and
physically disabled and other charities including the Red Cross and
Danish Cancer Society. Further details of the amount of donations
made during the year are set out on page 54. The Directors submit their annual report and the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the
year ended 31 July 2007.
Principal activities and business review
Wolseley plc is the parent of the Group and its operating subsidiaries
are organised into two geographical divisions which are set out 
on pages 27 to 33. The principal activities of the Group are the
distribution of plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment,
pipes, valves and fittings and building materials (including timber)
within Europe and North America. In the USA, the Group also
supplies other construction and installation services. In the UK,
France and Austria, the Group operates tool hire centres and, 
in the UK, France and USA, it distributes electrical components 
and supplies.
Details of the development of the Group’s businesses during the
year, including an assessment of the Group’s exposure to financial
risks and how these are managed, and information which fulfils the
requirements of the Business Review, are given in the Performance
review on pages 22 to 41 and in the Group Chief Executive’s
review on pages 8 to 21, which are incorporated into this report 
by reference.
Results and dividends
The Group’s consolidated income statement, set out on page 70,
shows a decrease of 9.7 per cent in Group operating profit from
£834 million in 2006 to £753 million. An analysis of revenue and
operating profit is given on page 80 in note 2 to the accounts.
Details relating to post balance sheet events are given on page 109.
Shareholders were paid the 2007 interim dividend of 10.85 pence
per share (2006: 9.85 pence) on 31 May 2007. The Directors
recommend a final dividend of 21.55 pence per share (2006: 
19.55 pence) making a total dividend for the year of 32.40 pence 
per ordinary share, an increase of 10.2 per cent on the 29.40 pence
paid in respect of last year. Payment of the recommended final
dividend, if approved at the Annual General Meeting, will be made
on 30 November 2007 to shareholders registered at the close of
business on 5 October 2007.
The Wolseley plc 2004 Overseas Employee Benefit Trust, the
Wolseley plc 2004 Employee Benefit Trust and the Wolseley plc
2004 Directors Benefit Trust were established on 5 October 2004 
in connection with the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 and the
Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme, details of which
are set out in the Remuneration report on pages 63 to 65. The
trustees of each of the trusts have waived their rights to receive
dividends on any shares held by them. Following purchases of
shares in the capital of the Company made between November
2004 and January 2007, the trustees of the Wolseley plc 2004
Employee Benefit Trust hold 6,200,000 ordinary shares in the
capital of the Company. The average purchase price was 
1174.7 pence per share (excluding dealing costs). The amount 
of dividends waived in respect of the year ended 31 July 2007 
was £1,572,000 (2006: £300,425). 
The Company’s dividend reinvestment plan continues to be available
to eligible shareholders. Shareholders who do not currently participate
in the plan and wish to do so can obtain an application form and
explanatory booklet from the Company’s Registrars, whose contact
details are shown on page 127. The latest date for receipt of new
applications to participate in respect of the 2007 final dividend is 
9 November 2007.
Change of control
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating 
to a change of control. Outstanding options and awards would
normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control,
subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.
Acquisitions and disposals
Details of acquisitions made during the year are contained in the
Performance review on page 25 and in note 31 to the accounts on 
page 106. There were no disposals of businesses during the year.
Future development
It remains your Board’s intention to develop the Group through
organic growth and by selective acquisitions.
Share capital
At the date of this report, 661,187,360 ordinary shares of 25 pence
each have been issued and are fully paid up and are quoted on the
London Stock Exchange. In addition, the Company has entered into
a Level II American Depository Receipt programme with the Bank of
New York Mellon, under which the Company’s shares are traded in
the form of American Depository Shares on the New York Stock
Exchange. The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s
ordinary shares, as well as the powers of the Company’s Directors,
are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which
can be obtained from Companies House in the UK or by writing to
the Company Secretary. There are no restrictions on the voting
rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares or on the transfer
of securities in the Company. No person holds securities in the
Company carrying special rights with regard to control of the
Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements between
holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities or on voting rights. Unless expressly specified to 
the contrary in the Articles of Association of the Company, the
Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by a special
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
During the year ended 31 July 2007, options were exercised
pursuant to the Company’s share option schemes, resulting in 
the allotment of 3,969,008 new ordinary shares. A further 22,136
new ordinary shares have been allotted under these schemes since
the end of the financial year to the date of this report. In addition, 
a total of 59,500,000 new ordinary shares were issued and allotted
on 25 September 2006 by a placement, further details of which
can be found on page 40. Details of these allotments, including,
where appropriate, the amounts subscribed for new shares are 
set out in note 28 to the accounts on page 102, which also
contains details of options granted over unissued capital. 
52 Report of the Directors
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Report of the Directors
Including the statement of remuneration policy for the year ended 31 July 2007
  The Directors propose (Resolution 9 in the Notice of Meeting set
out on pages 129 to 132) to renew the authority granted to them 
at the Annual General Meeting held in 2006 to allot equity shares
up to an aggregate nominal value of £34,703,160 (representing the
authorised but unissued ordinary share capital of the Company 
at the date of this report) (the ‘section 80 authority’). If approved 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the authority will expire 
no later than 15 months from the date on which the resolution 
is passed, or at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting 
to be held in 2008, whichever is the sooner. 
The limited power granted to the Directors at last year’s Annual
General Meeting to allot equity shares for cash other than pro rata to
existing shareholders expires no later than 29 February 2008. Subject
to the terms of the section 80 authority, your Directors recommend
(Resolution 10 in the Notice of Meeting) that this authority should be
renewed so as to give them the ability, until the Annual General
Meeting to be held in 2008, to issue ordinary shares for cash, other
than pro rata to existing shareholders, in connection with a rights
issue or up to a limit of 5 per cent of the ordinary share capital issued
at the date of this report. Your Directors have no present intention 
to issue ordinary shares, other than pursuant to the Company’s
employee share schemes and any share dividend alternatives. The
Directors recommend that you vote in favour of Resolutions 9 and 10
to maintain the Company’s flexibility in relation to future share issues,
including any issues to finance business opportunities should
appropriate circumstances arise.
A Special Resolution will also be proposed (Resolution 11 in the
Notice of Meeting) to renew the Directors’ limited authority last
granted in 2006 to repurchase the Company’s ordinary shares 
in the market. The authority will be limited to a maximum of
66,118,736 ordinary shares (being 10 per cent of the Company’s
issued share capital at the date of this report) and also sets the
minimum and maximum prices which may be paid. This authority
will enable your Directors to continue to respond promptly should
circumstances arise in which they consider such a purchase would
result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the best
interests of the Company. 
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares)
Regulations 2003 allow shares repurchased by the Company to 
be held as treasury shares that may be cancelled, sold for cash or
used for the purpose of employee share schemes. The Company
holds no shares in treasury but the Directors currently intend that
any shares which are repurchased will be held in treasury. The
authorities to be sought by each of Resolutions 10 and 11 are
intended to apply equally to shares to be held by the Company 
as treasury shares and to the sale of treasury shares. The 
Directors consider it desirable for these general authorisations 
to be available to provide flexibility in the management of the
Company’s capital resources.
CREST
The Company’s ordinary shares are in CREST, the settlement
system for stocks and shares.
Substantial share interests
The Companies Act 1985 provisions in respect of substantial share
interests were repealed on 20 January 2007 and, with effect from 
that date, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the UK Financial
Services Authority came into force.
At 31 July 2007, the Company had received notification that holdings
exceeding the 3 per cent notification threshold were as follows:
Name %
Baillie Gifford & Co 7.004
Lloyds TSB Group plc 6.060
Legal & General Investment Management Limited 3.443
Aviva plc 3.096
Barclays plc 3.020
Directors
Brief particulars of the Directors in office at the date of this report
are listed on pages 42 and 43 and further details of the Board
composition as well as the Company’s procedure with regard to 
the appointment and replacement of Directors are contained in the
Corporate governance report on page 55. The Directors standing
for re-election at the Annual General Meeting are Andrew Duff, 
Chip Hornsby and Jim Murray. Each Director, being eligible, offers
himself for re-election. It is the view of the Board that Messrs Duff
and Murray each bring considerable management experience and
independent perspective to the Board’s discussions and both are
considered to be independent of management and free from any
relationship or circumstance that could affect, or appear to affect,
the exercise of their independent judgement. 
Directors’ interests in shares
The interests of the Directors in office at 31 July 2007 and of their
families in the ordinary shares of the Company at the following 
dates were:
31 July 2007 1 August 2006

Report of the Directors 53
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Donations
The Company’s Corporate social responsibility report is set out on
pages 44 to 51. The Group’s charitable donations in 2007 totalled
£2,019,500 (2006: £2,445,000). 
At each of the Annual General Meetings held since 2002,
shareholders have passed a resolution, on a precautionary basis, 
to approve donations to EU political organisations and to incur EU
political expenditure (as such terms are defined in section 347A of
the Companies Act 1985 (as amended), which will be superseded
by sections 362 to 379 of the Companies Act 2006 with effect from
1 October 2007), not exceeding £125,000 per annum. The Board
has repeatedly confirmed that it operates a policy of not giving any
cash contribution to any political party in the ordinary meaning of
those words and that it has no intention of changing that policy.
The Directors, however, propose to seek once more authority 
for the Group to make political donations and/or incur political
expenditure in respect of each of the heads identified in Resolution 12
in the Notice of Annual General Meeting in amounts not exceeding
£125,000 in total, which they might otherwise be prohibited from
making or incurring under the terms of the Companies Act 2006
and which would not amount to ‘donations’ in the ordinary sense 
of the word. The authority sought by Resolution 12 in the Notice of
Meeting will last until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting.
Creditor payment policy
All Group companies are responsible for establishing terms and
conditions of trading with their suppliers. It is the Group’s policy
that payments to suppliers are made within agreed terms and are,
where applicable, consistent with the UK Government-backed
Better Payment Practice Code. Copies of this Code can be obtained
from the Company Secretary at the Company’s registered office. 
At 31 July 2007, the Company had no trade creditors (2006: nil).
The amount of trade creditors for the Group as at 31 July 2007
was equivalent to 59 days (2006: 52 days) of trade purchases.
Auditors and audit information
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are willing to continue as auditors of
the Company and Resolution 7 in the Notice of Meeting concerning
their reappointment and Resolution 8 in the Notice of Meeting
concerning the determination of their remuneration are to be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting. The Directors in office 
at the date of this report confirm that, so far as they are each
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are unaware and each Director has
taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as a Director 
to be aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are aware of that information.
Employee policies and involvement
The Group places particular importance on the involvement of 
its employees, keeping them regularly informed through informal
bulletins, such as ‘Directions’ and other in-house publications,
meetings and the Company’s intranet, on matters affecting them 
as employees and on the issues affecting their performance. A
European Works Council has been operating since 1996 to provide
a forum for dialogue and consultation with employees on significant
developments in the Group’s operations, management’s plans and
expectations, organisational changes within the Group and for
employee representatives to consult management about concerns
over any aspect of the Group’s operations. At the date of this report,
there were 25 members comprising 14 employee representatives
nominated from among employees from each European company
with the balance being Company appointees. For the forthcoming
year, as a result of the recent Woodcote acquisition, the European
Works Council will see an increase in total membership to 29 with
18 employee representatives.
Permanent UK employees are invited to join the Company’s
pension arrangements which include defined contribution and
defined benefit pension schemes. The principal UK scheme has
one corporate and two individual trustees. The chairman of the
trustees is David Tucker and, save for an independent trustee, 
all of the other trustees are UK-based employees or former employees
of the Group. The other main UK scheme provides benefits for
employees of the William Wilson Group and has five trustees. 
The chairman of the trustees is Ian Percy CBE and all of the other
trustees are UK-based employees of the William Wilson Group or
of the Company. Permanent employees outside the UK are offered
membership of their employing companies’ pension arrangements.
Employees are offered a range of benefits depending on their 
local environment, such as private medical cover. Employees 
are encouraged to become shareholders in the Company, where
possible, through participation in the Company’s share schemes.
Priority is given to the training of employees and the development
of their skills is of prime importance. Employment of disabled
people is considered on merit with regard only to the ability of 
any applicant to carry out the function required. Arrangements to
enable disabled people to carry out the function required will be
made if it is reasonable to do so. An employee becoming disabled
would, where appropriate, be offered retraining. The Group
continues to operate on a largely decentralised basis; this provides
encouragement for the development of entrepreneurial flair, balanced
by a rigorous control framework exercised by a small head office
team. Local managements are responsible for maintaining high
standards of health and safety and for ensuring that there is
appropriate employee involvement in decision-making.

Corporate governance
Including the report of the Audit Committee
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate
governance as set out in the Combined Code on corporate
governance published by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) 
in July 2003 (the ‘Code’). The Board has also applied the principles
and provisions in the form set out in the revised Combined Code
published by the FRC in June 2006 (the ‘Revised Code’). The Board
is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good governance
and this report describes how the Board applied the principles of
good governance as set out in the Code and the Revised Code
during the year under review.
The Board
As at 31 July 2007, the Board of Directors was made up of 
11 members comprising the Chairman, five Executive Directors 
and five Non Executive Directors. The Non Executive Directors are
considered by the Board to be independent of management and
free of any relationship which could materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement. The Board considers that
each of the Non Executive Directors brings his own senior level of
experience and expertise. Fenton Hord retired from the Board as
an Executive Director on 31 July 2007 and Robert Walker will step
down from the Board as a Non Executive Director with effect 
from 31 October 2007. Accordingly, at the date of this report, 
there are 10 members of the Board, comprising the Chairman, 
four Executive Directors and five Non Executive Directors. 
Biographical details of the Directors currently in office are shown 
on pages 42 and 43. The Company’s policy relating to the terms 
of appointment and the remuneration of both the Executive and
Non Executive Directors is detailed in the Remuneration report 
on pages 61 to 68.
The Board meets regularly during the year, as well as on an ad hoc
basis, as required by time critical business needs. The Board has 
a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for its decision, although
its primary role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership and to
review the overall strategic development of the Group as a whole.
Day-to-day operational decisions are managed by the Executive
Committee and the Executive Committee Advisory Group, referred
to on page 57. The Board met eight times during the year and
Director attendance for each meeting is shown in the table on 
page 58. The Board has established a procedure for Directors, 
if deemed necessary, to take independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense in the furtherance of their duties. 
This is in addition to the direct access that every Director has to 
the Company Secretary, who is charged with ensuring that Board
procedures are followed and that good corporate governance 
and compliance is implemented throughout the Group. Following
their appointment, formal comprehensive and tailored induction 
is offered to all Directors, which is supplemented by visits to key
locations within the Group and meetings with members of the
Executive Committee, the Executive Committee Advisory Group
and other key senior executives. 
Together with the Group Chief Executive and the Company
Secretary, the Chairman ensures that the Board is kept properly
informed and is consulted on all issues reserved to it. Board papers
and other information are delivered at times to allow Directors to 
be properly briefed in advance of meetings. In accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association, Directors are granted an
indemnity from the Company to the extent permitted by law in
respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office. The indemnity
would not provide any coverage to the extent that a Director is
proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The Company 
has also arranged appropriate insurance coverage in respect of
legal action against its Directors and Officers. The distinct roles of
Chairman and Group Chief Executive are acknowledged and set
out in writing. The Chairman has confirmed that he would not chair
any other major company’s board of directors. Gareth Davis is 
the Company’s Senior Independent Director and is available to
shareholders where communication through the Chairman or
Executive Directors would not be appropriate. The Chairman
ensures that the Board maintains an appropriate dialogue with
shareholders and, although the Non Executive Directors are not
formally asked, at present, to meet the Company’s shareholders,
their attendance at presentations of the annual and interim results
is encouraged. 
The Chairman reviewed the developmental needs of the Board as 
a whole, including the skills and contributions each Director brought
to it and confirmed that there were no outstanding items from the
performance evaluations which had been carried out during 2006. 
It is proposed that a further detailed review be carried out during
2008. The Chairman confirmed that should any Director have any
concerns or observations which they wished to raise, these could
be notified to him directly or to the Company Secretary, to be
addressed appropriately.
Meetings between the Non Executive Directors, both with and
without the presence of the Chairman and the Group Chief
Executive, are scheduled in the Board’s annual timetable. The
Board has also arranged to hold at least two Board meetings each
year at divisional locations to help all Board members gain a deeper
understanding of the business. This also provides senior managers
from across the Group the opportunity to present to the Board as
well as to meet the Directors on more informal occasions.
As part of their ongoing development, the Executive Directors are
encouraged to take up an external non executive position on the
board of a non competitor company, for which they may retain
payments received in respect of such appointment. In order to avoid
any conflict of interest, all appointments are subject to the Board’s
approval and, generally, outside appointments for Executive Directors
are limited to one company board. The Board monitors the extent
of Directors’ other interests to ensure that the effectiveness of the
Board is not compromised. Overall responsibility for succession
planning is considered to be a matter for the whole Board rather
than for a committee. 
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that one-third of 
the Directors retire by rotation each year and that each Director will
seek re-election by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting
at least once every three years. Additionally, new Directors are
subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity after 
their appointment. It is Board policy that Non Executive Directors
are normally appointed for an initial term of three years, which is
then reviewed and extended for up to a further two three-year
periods. It is also Board policy that Non Executive Directors should
not generally serve on the Board for more than nine years and that, 
in cases where it is proposed to exceed this period, the Director
concerned will retire annually and offer himself for re-election.
Details of the Directors seeking re-election at the 2007 AGM 
are given in the Notice of Meeting on page 130.
The formal terms of reference for the Board committees, approved
by the Board and complying with the Code to assist in the discharge
of its duties, are available from the Company Secretary and can 
also be found on the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com.
Membership of the various committees is shown on page 127. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to all Board committees. Nominations committee
The Nominations Committee meets on an as needed basis and 
was not required to meet during the year ending 31 July 2007. At the
date of this report, it comprises Messrs Whybrow (Chairman), Davis,
Duff, Hornsby and Walker. Mr Walker will be stepping down on 
31 October 2007 and Messrs Murray and Stein will be appointed 
to the committee with effect from that date. Mr Whybrow would not
chair the committee when it considers the appointment of a successor
chairman. The committee reviews the structure, size and composition
of the Board and its committees and makes recommendations with
regard to any changes that are considered necessary, both in the
identification and nomination of new Directors and the continuation 
of existing Directors in office. The committee retains external search
consultants as appropriate. The committee also advises the Board on
succession planning for board appointments although the Board itself
has overall responsibility for succession generally. 
Audit committee
The Audit Committee comprises Messrs Davis, Stein and Murray,
who chairs the committee. The committee’s membership is
reviewed by the Nominations Committee and by Mr Murray at
regular intervals. Members of the committee are appointed by the
Board following recommendations by the Nominations Committee.
The committee is normally comprised of three independent 
Non Executive Directors. Two members constitute a quorum. 
Each member of the committee brings relevant financial experience
at a senior executive level and the expertise and experience of the
members of the committee are summarised on page 43. The Board
considers that each member of the committee is independent within
the definition set out in the Code. Mr Stein is considered by the
Board to have significant, recent and relevant financial experience,
having been, until September 2007, Finance Director of GKN plc.
All members of the committee receive appropriate induction, which
is in addition to the induction which all new Directors receive and
includes an overview of the business, its financial dynamics and
risks. Members of the committee undertake ongoing training as
required. Audit Committee members are expected to have an
understanding of the following areas: 
• the principles of, contents of and developments in, financial
reporting, including the applicable accounting standards 
and statements of recommended practice and in particular, 
the appropriateness of the Company’s accounting policies; 
• the Company’s wider corporate policies and its financing; and
• the Company’s systems of internal control and matters that require
the use of judgement in the presentation of accounts and key
figures as well as the role of internal and external auditors.
The committee meets regularly throughout the year and its agenda
is linked to events in the Company’s financial calendar. The agenda
is mostly cyclical although each member of the committee may
require reports on matters of interest in addition to the regular
items. Members’ attendance at the meetings held during the year 
is set out in the table on page 58.
The committee invites the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive,
the Chief Financial Officer, the Director of Financial Reporting and
Strategic Planning and the Head of Internal Audit together with
senior representatives of the external auditors to attend each
meeting and receive its papers, although it reserves part of each
meeting for discussions without the invitees being present. Other
senior executives are invited to present such reports as are required
for the committee to discharge its duties. The Audit Committee
members regularly meet the Head of Internal Audit and the 
external auditors without the presence of executive management.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee attends the Annual General
Meeting to respond to any shareholder questions that might be
raised on the committee’s activities. 
The committee is required to assist the Board to fulfil its
responsibilities related to external financial reporting and 
associated announcements. During the year, the committee
reviewed, either as a committee or as part of the Board:
• the interim and annual financial statements, including the
requirements for financial reporting;
• the interim and preliminary announcements made to the London
and New York Stock Exchanges;
• the Company’s trading statements and, where practicable, 
all proposed announcements to be made by the Company 
to the extent that they contain material financial information; 
• the Form 20-F, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
in the USA, having received the appropriate information on 
the accounting principles, policies and practices adopted in 
the preparation of the accounts; 
• changes proposed to the Company’s policies and practices; 
• significant accounting issues; 
• operation of the Company’s whistleblowing policy; 
• litigation and contingent liabilities and tax matters, including
contingencies against tax liabilities together with compliance 
with statutory tax obligations;
• fraud reports; and
• the Company’s risk management process. 
The committee is also responsible for the development,
implementation and monitoring of the Company’s policy on 
external audit and the committee reserves oversight responsibility
for monitoring independence, objectivity and compliance with
ethical and regulatory requirements. The committee recommends
the appointment and reappointment of the Company’s external
auditors and annually reviews a formal letter provided by the
external auditors confirming their independence and objectivity
within the context of applicable regulatory requirements and
professional standards. The committee also reviews the terms,
areas of responsibility and scope of the audit (including schedules
of unadjusted errors and representation letters) as set out in the
external auditors’ engagement letter; the overall work plan for 
the forthcoming year, together with the cost-effectiveness of the
audit as well as the auditors’ remuneration and performance; 
any major issues which arose during the course of the audit and
their resolution; key accounting and audit judgements; the level 
of errors identified during the audit; and the recommendations
made to management by the auditors and management’s response. 
During the year, a review was carried out to provide assurance that
the Group was receiving value for money for the service provided
by the external auditors. The committee monitors the rotation 
of key partners within the external auditors from time to time in
accordance with UK and US rules. The committee also monitors
the extent of non-audit work which the external auditors can
perform, to ensure that the provision of those non-audit services
that can be undertaken by the external auditors falls within the
agreed policy and does not impair their objectivity or independence.
Under the policy, the external auditors cannot be engaged to perform
any of the following services:
• bookkeeping services related to accounting records or financial
statements;
• financial information systems’ design and implementation;
• appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions and
contributions in kind reports;
56 Corporate governance
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Corporate governance
Including the report of the Audit Committee Corporate governance 57
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
• actuarial services;
• internal audit outsourcing services;
• management functions including human resources;
• broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking
services; or
• legal and other services unrelated to the audit.
The policy requires pre-confirmation by the committee of any 
non-audit work subject to de minimis levels. The external auditors
provide audit related services such as regulatory and statutory
reporting as well as formalities relating to shareholder or other
circulars. The external auditors report any material departures 
from Group accounting policies and procedures that they identify
during the course of their audit work to the committee. Within the
constraints of applicable UK and US rules, the external auditors
undertake due diligence reviews and provide assistance on tax
matters given their in-depth knowledge of the Group’s business. 
The provision of non-audit services within such constraints and 
the agreed policy is assessed on a case-by-case basis so that 
the best-placed adviser is retained. During the year, the committee
carried out an extensive review of the effectiveness of the external
auditors, which included receiving responses from each of the
Group’s operating companies and considered whether the agreed
audit plan had been fulfilled and the reasons for any variation from
the plan. The committee also considered the external auditors’
robustness and the degree to which the external auditors were able
to assess key accounting and audit judgements and the context of
the management letter.
The total fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers in the year ended
31 July 2007 were £10.5 million (2006: £9.6 million), of which 
£4.2 million (2006: £4.2 million) related to non-audit work. Further
disclosure of the non-audit fees paid during the year ended 
31 July 2007 can be found in note 3 to the accounts on page 84.
The committee also reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s
internal audit function, including its terms of reference, audit plans,
general performance and its relationship with the external auditors.
Throughout the year, the committee reviewed the internal audit
function’s plans and its achievements against such plans. The
committee considered the results of the audits undertaken by 
the internal audit function and considered the adequacy of
management’s response to matters raised, including the time taken
to resolve any such matters. The committee carried out its annual
review to consider the effectiveness of the internal audit function
using guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England & Wales and the Institute of Internal Auditors – UK. During
the year, two continental audit committees were established by the
continental CEOs for Europe and North America, at the suggestion 
of the committee. The minutes of the continental audit committee
meetings will be provided to the Audit Committee.
The committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the
Group’s internal control systems, accounting policies and practices,
standards of risk management and risk management procedures
and compliance controls as well as the Company’s statements on
internal controls before they are agreed by the Board for each
year’s annual report. The committee has also monitored the
Company’s response to the requirements of the US Sarbanes-
Oxley Act as they apply to foreign private issuers with particular
focus on the progress made in evaluating internal controls as
required by Section 404 of that Act and the disclosures to be made
by the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer as part 
of the Form 20-F certification process. The Board retains overall
responsibility for internal control and for the identification and
management of business risk. During the year, the committee also
reviewed the processes which have been embedded throughout
the Group in compliance with IFRS reporting requirements. 
The Company’s whistleblowing policy, which is an extension of 
the Groupwide Code of Ethics, gives details of the international
whistleblowing hotline operated on behalf of the Company by 
an independent third party and sets out the arrangements for 
the Company Secretary to receive, in confidence, disclosures 
on accounting, risk issues, internal controls, auditing issues and
related matters which would, as appropriate, be reported to the
committee. A copy of the Group’s Code of Ethics is available on
the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com. 
Each year the committee critically reviews its own performance 
and considers where improvements can be made. The committee’s
terms of reference were reviewed and updated during the year 
and copies are available from the Company Secretary or on the
Company’s website at www.wolseley.com.
Remuneration committee
The committee comprises Messrs Davis, Walker and Duff, who
chairs the committee, all of whom are independent within the
definition set out in the Code. Mr Walker will step down from the
committee on 31 October 2007 and Messrs Stein and Whybrow
will be appointed to the committee with effect from that date. The
committee met four times during the year and Director attendance
for each meeting is shown in the table on page 58. The committee
has delegated authority to deal with remuneration matters on behalf
of the Board and the Board’s Remuneration report is set out 
on pages 61 to 68. During the year, the committee reviewed 
and updated its terms of reference, copies of which are available
from the Company Secretary or on the Company’s website at
www.wolseley.com. The chairman of the committee attends the
Annual General Meeting to respond to any shareholder questions
that might be raised on the committee’s activities.
Treasury committee
The committee comprises the Group Chief Executive, the Chief
Financial Officer, who acts as its Chairman, and the Group Treasurer.
The committee’s role is to consider treasury policy, tax matters and
certain transactions on behalf of the Group within a framework
delegated by the Board. 
Executive committee
The Executive Directors of the Company together with the 
Chief Business Development Officer, the Chief Operations Officer
and the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel, meet at
least eight times each year, often on the day before formal Board
meetings. The committee addresses operational business issues
and shares best practice, thereby allowing the Directors more time
at Board meetings to focus on strategy.
Executive committee advisory group
The Executive Committee Advisory Group comprises the Group
Chief Information Officer, the Group Senior Vice President Supply
Chain, the Group Senior Vice President Sourcing, the Director of
Financial Reporting and Strategic Planning and the Group HR
Director. The members of this group, who each have key roles 
in their own right, act as advisers to the Executive Committee. Meetings attendance

Internal audit
The internal audit function is fully independent of the day-to-day
operations of the Group. It is involved in the assessment of the
quality of risk management and internal control and helps to
promote and further develop effective risk management within 
the businesses. Certain internal audit assignments (such as those
requiring specialist expertise) continue to be outsourced by the
Head of Internal Audit to KPMG LLP as required. A policy has been
established regarding the recruitment of staff from both KPMG LLP
and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . The Head of Internal Audit
attends all Audit Committee meetings as well as having regular
meetings with the chairman of that committee. The Audit
Committee reviews key performance indicators relating to the
activity of the department. 
Internal control
In a decentralised Group, where local management has considerable
autonomy to run and develop their businesses, a well designed
system of internal control is necessary to safeguard shareholders’
investment and the Company’s assets. The Directors have overall
responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control and for
reviewing their effectiveness. In accordance with the guidance set
out in the Turnbull Report ‘Internal Control: Guidance for Directors
on the Combined Code’, an ongoing process has been established
for identifying, managing and evaluating the risks faced by the
Group and has been in place for the full financial year and up 
to the date on which the financial statements were approved.
The systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate
business risk, safeguard the Group’s assets against material loss,
fairly report the Group’s performance and position and to ensure
compliance with relevant legislation, regulation and best practice
including that related to social, environmental and ethical matters.
The systems provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against
material misstatement or loss and are regularly reviewed by the
Board to deal with changing circumstances.
A summary of the key financial risks inherent in the Group’s
business is given on pages 40 to 41. Risk assessment and
evaluation is an integral part of the annual planning cycle. Each
business documents the strategic objectives and the effectiveness
of the Group’s systems of internal control. As part of this review,
each business area and function has been required to identify and
document each significant risk, together with the mitigating actions
implemented to manage, monitor and report to management on
the effectiveness of these controls. 
Group companies also submit risk management and internal
control representation letters bi-annually to the Chief Financial
Officer, with comments on the control environment within their
operations. The Chief Financial Officer summarises these submissions
for the Audit Committee and the Executive Committee. The
chairman of the Audit Committee reports to the Board on any
matters which have arisen from the committee’s review of the 
way in which the risk management and internal control processes
have been applied or any breakdowns in, or exceptions to, these
procedures. Group companies are also required to support the
disclosures and attestations that the Group Chief Executive and
Chief Financial Officer are required to give under the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. These processes have been in place throughout the
year ended 31 July 2007 and have continued to the date of this
report. The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s
system of internal control for the year under review and a summary
of the principal control structures and processes in place across
the Group is set out below.
Control structures
Whilst the Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness, it has delegated
responsibility for the risk management and internal control programme
to the Chief Financial Officer. The detailed review of risk management
and internal control has been delegated to the Audit Committee.
The management of each Group company is responsible for risk
management and internal control within its own business and for
ensuring compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures.
Each Group company has appointed a risk director whose primary
role in such capacity is to ensure compliance by local management
with the Group’s risk management and internal control programme.
Both the internal and external auditors have reviewed the overall
approach adopted by the Group towards its risk management
activities so as to reinforce these internal control requirements.

Control processes
The Board reviews its strategic plans and objectives on an annual
basis and approves Group company budgets and strategies in light
of these. Control is exercised at Group, continental, cluster and
subsidiary board level through monthly monitoring of performance
by comparison to budgets, forecasts and cash targets and by
regular visits to Group companies by the Group Chief Executive,
Chief Financial Officer and continental CEOs. 
The Board has formal procedures in place for the approval of
investment and acquisition projects, with designated levels of
authority, supported by post investment review processes for major
acquisitions and capital expenditure. The Board takes account 
of social, environmental and ethical matters in relation to the
Group’s businesses when reviewing the risks faced by the Group.
The Board is conscious of the effect such matters may have on 
the short and long-term value of the Company. 
As noted on page 52, the Company has entered into a Level II
American Depository Receipt programme with the Bank of New
York Mellon and has securities registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the USA. As a result, the Company is
required to comply with applicable US regulations including the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, insofar as it applies to foreign private issuers.
In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
recommendations, the Company has established a disclosure
committee comprising the Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial
Officer, the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel and
the Director of Financial Reporting and Strategic Planning.
The Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer will also
provide the certificates required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when
the Form 20-F for 2007 is filed. There were no changes to the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting occurring 
during the year ended 31 July 2007 which have materially affected, 
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, that internal control.
Procedures relating to the internal controls, as required by Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, were in place throughout the year
ended 31 July 2007 and continue to the date of this report.
Compliance statement
The Company applied all of the principles set out in section 1 of the
Code and the Revised Code for the period under review and has,
throughout the year, complied with the detailed provisions set out
therein, save that, until 31 July 2007, the pensionable salary of one
Executive Director included his bonus capped at a fixed amount (as
detailed on page 67). From 1 August 2007, all Executive Director
service contracts comply with the Code and the Revised Code.
The Company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , are required
to review whether the above statement reflects the Company’s
compliance with the nine provisions of the Code specified for its
review by the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to report if
it does not reflect such compliance. No such report has been made.
New York Stock Exchange corporate 
governance requirements 
Although not required to do so as a foreign private issuer, 
the Company complies in all material respects with the corporate
governance measures set out by the board of the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc for US issuers. Those standards state that companies
should have a nominating/corporate governance committee
composed entirely of independent directors with written terms 
of reference, which develops and recommends to the board a set
of corporate governance principles for the company. The Company
has a Nominations Committee, details of which are set out on page
56 and a majority of the members of the Nominations Committee
are independent Non Executive Directors and all such Directors 
sit on the Board. The Board itself, rather than the Nominations
Committee, develops the corporate governance principles for 
the Company and approves the Group’s overall system of internal
controls, governance and authority limits. The Company’s practice,
in accordance with the UK Companies Act and the Code in relation
to the appointment and termination of the external auditors, is that
a recommendation is made by the Audit Committee to the Board,
which will then make a recommendation to shareholders in general
meeting. This differs from the procedure in the USA, where the
external auditors are accountable to the audit committee, which
has the authority to appoint or dismiss the external auditors without
reference to shareholders.
In July 2005, rules were introduced by the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock
Exchange which require the Company to comply with certain
provisions relating to audit committees. These include a requirement
related to the independence of audit committee members and
procedures for the treatment of complaints regarding accounting 
or auditing matters. The Company is fully compliant with these
requirements.
Communications with shareholders
The Company places considerable importance on communication
with its shareholders, including its employee shareholders. The Group
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer are closely involved in
investor relations and a senior executive has day-to-day responsibility
for such matters. The views of our major shareholders are reported 
to the Board by the Chief Financial Officer and by the Chairman and
discussed at its meetings. The Annual Report and Accounts are
available to all shareholders either in paper form or electronically and
can be accessed via the Company’s website www.wolseley.com or
via Shareview, an internet service offered by the Company’s Registrars,
as detailed on page 128.
The Company has regular dialogue with institutional shareholders
and meetings with shareholder representatives, as required, and
promotes communications with private shareholders through
attendance at the Annual General Meeting. Contact with institutional
shareholders and with financial analysts, brokers and the media 
is controlled by written guidelines to ensure the protection of 
sensitive information which could affect the Company’s share
price and which has not already been made generally available 
to the Company’s shareholders. Contact is also maintained, when
appropriate, with shareholders to discuss overall remuneration 
plans and policies. The Group’s preliminary and interim results, 
as well as all announcements issued to the London and New York
Stock Exchanges, are published on the Company’s website,
www.wolseley.com. The Company issues regular trading updates 
to the market and these, together with copies of presentations 
to analysts and interviews with the Group Chief Executive and 
Chief Financial Officer, are also posted on the Company’s website. 
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting is circulated to all
shareholders at least 20 working days before such meeting and it 
is Company policy not to combine resolutions to be proposed at
general meetings. All shareholders are invited to the Company’s
Annual General Meeting at which they have the opportunity to put
questions to the Board and it is standard practice to have the
chairmen of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees
available to answer questions. The proxy votes for and against  each resolution, as well as abstentions which may be recorded 
on the proxy form accompanying the Notice of Meeting, are
counted before the Annual General Meeting and the results are
made available at the meeting after shareholders have voted on
each resolution on a show of hands. The results are also announced 
to the London and New York Stock Exchanges and are published
on the Company’s website shortly after the meeting.

Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are required by UK company law as adopted by the
European Union to prepare financial statements for each financial
period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and the Group and of the profit or loss for that period.
The Directors consider that, in preparing the accounts, appropriate
accounting policies have been used and applied consistently,
supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates;
and the accounts have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by
the European Union and on the going concern basis. Applicable
UK accounting standards have also been applied for the parent
company accounts.
The Directors are also responsible for maintaining adequate
accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the
financial position of the Company and the Group, which enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
UK Companies Act and Article 4 of the International Auditing
Standards Regulation.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the
wolseley.com website. The work carried out by the auditors 
does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly,
the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may 
have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially
presented on the website. Legislation in the UK governing the
preparation and dissemination of the financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
Company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud or 
other irregularities. The Directors, having prepared the financial
statements, have permitted the auditors to take whatever steps
and undertake whatever inspections they consider to be appropriate
for the purpose of enabling them to give their audit opinion.

The Board sets the Company’s remuneration policy. The
Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board,
within its agreed terms of reference (available on the Company’s
website, www.wolseley.com) on the Company’s framework of
executive remuneration and its cost. It also determines, with
agreement with the Board, specific remuneration packages for each
of the Executive Directors, the Chairman, the Company Secretary
and members of the Executive Committee and Executive Committee
Advisory Group. The Chairman and the Executive Directors of the
Board determine the remuneration of the Non Executive Directors.
The committee is also responsible for the Company’s share incentive
schemes for employees. The current members of the committee, 
all of whom are independent Non Executive Directors within the
definition set out in the Code and the Revised Code, are set out 
on page 57 and the Company Secretary acts as its secretary. The
committee has access to detailed external research on market data
and trends from experienced independent consultants. Since 2003,
the committee has sought external advice from New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP and has in the past also been provided with advice
by Mercer Human Resource Consulting. The Group Chief Executive,
the Chairman and the Group HR Director are normally invited to
attend the meetings of the committee to respond to specific
questions raised by members of the committee. This specifically
excludes such matters concerning the details of and any discussions
relating to their own personal remuneration. The Chairman will join
the committee on 31 October 2007.
The Company has followed the provisions of Schedules A and B 
of the Code and the Revised Code and has complied with the
relevant provisions of the Companies Act 1985, as amended by 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Directors’ report on remuneration has been received and
adopted by shareholders at each of the Annual General Meetings
held since 2003 and shareholders will again be invited to receive
and adopt this report at the Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 28 November 2007. 
With the exception of the description of the performance bonus
arrangements, service agreement details, performance graph,
disclosure of remuneration to other senior executives, executive
share ownership and external directorships, the information set 
out on pages 62 to 68 of this report represents the auditable
disclosures referred to in the Auditors’ report on page 111 as
specified by the UK Listing Authority and under Schedule 7A of 
the Companies Act 1985.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors
The Company’s policy continues to be to provide remuneration
packages that fairly reward Executive Directors for the contribution
they make to the business, having regard to the size and complexity
of the Group’s operations and the need to attract, retain and
motivate executives of the highest quality. Remuneration packages
comprise salary, performance bonuses, share options, long-term
incentive awards, benefits in kind and retirement benefit provisions.
The Company takes all of these individual elements fully into
account in adopting a total approach to remuneration. None of the
variable elements of remuneration are pensionable. Each of the
packages incorporates performance related elements linking both
individual and company performance and strikes a balance between
short and long-term elements. These packages are designed to be
broadly comparable with those offered by other similar international
businesses and reflect competitive practices in the countries and
markets in which the Executive Directors operate. 
The policy is designed to incentivise the Executive Directors to meet
the Company’s financial and strategic objectives, such that a
significant proportion of total remuneration is performance related.
The committee considers that the targets set for the different
elements of performance related remuneration are appropriate and
demanding in the context of the Company’s trading environment
and the business challenges it faces. The following chart shows the
average of total remuneration attributable to salary, target bonus and
the estimated value of long-term incentive awards and executive
share options granted during the financial year to Executive
Directors in office at the date of this Report:

Remuneration report
Including the statement of remuneration policy for the year ended 31 July 2007 Salaries
Basic salaries are determined having regard to individual
responsibility and performance and are benchmarked with market
data which is derived from a group of companies selected on the
basis of comparable size, geographic spread and business focus.
Consideration is also given to general pay and employment
conditions across the Group. The target salary is set at the median,
with the opportunity to go above this level, subject to sustained
individual performance. New appointments, and in particular
internal promotions, will tend to move to the median over two to
three years once their expertise and performance has been proven.
The committee reviews the salaries of the Chairman and Executive
Directors annually on 1 August, having sought the views of both 
the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive (other than in the
case of their own salaries). The base salaries for the Chairman and
Executive Directors for the financial year commencing on 1 August
2007 are as follows: J W Whybrow £350,000; C A S Hornsby
$1,450,000; R H Marchbank £480,000; F W Roach $930,000; 
and S P Webster £540,000.
Benefits in kind
These principally comprise car benefits, healthcare insurance and,
in the case of Messrs Hornsby, Marchbank and Webster, relocation
and housing allowances following their relocations from the USA 
to the UK (Messrs Hornsby and Marchbank) and from Droitwich to
Theale (Mr Webster), where the Company’s head office is located.
Mr Webster’s housing allowance ceased with effect from 30 April 2007.
In addition, to ensure that senior executives who are US citizens
are not disadvantaged as a result of paying both UK and US taxes
on their income, there is a mechanism of tax equalisation, which
avoids the need to increase salaries to meet any additional tax burden.
Performance bonuses
Performance bonus arrangements for the Executive Directors are
designed to encourage individual performance, corporate operating
efficiencies and profitable growth. Stretching targets are set for
each element of the bonus, determined by the committee each
year, which also considers the levels of performance targets to 
be achieved for bonus payments to be made in the succeeding
year. The annual bonus awards are based on a mix of demanding
financial targets, derived from the Company’s historic performance,
annual long-term strategic business plan and annual budget, 
as well as market expectations. For 2006/07, performance was
measured against annual targets of return on capital employed,
working capital, Group profit before tax and, where relevant, 
profit before tax for the appropriate division which, in aggregate,
accounted for 90 per cent of the potential bonus with the majority
relating to the profit before tax targets. For 2007/08, performance
will be measured by trading margin, cash flow and growth in
earnings per share (‘EPS’), reflecting key performance indicators 
in line with the Group’s ‘Earn, Turn, Grow’ initiative. These elements
will account for 80 per cent of the bonus with the balance depending
on specific personal objectives set for each Executive Director.
The following percentages of base salary, which vary between
Executive Directors depending on their particular responsibilities
and spheres of influence, will be paid as bonus for the year 
ended 31 July 2007, subject to the achievement of the minimum,
on-target and maximum levels of performance for each element
(with the percentages increasing on a linear basis for achievement
between each level):
Percentage of base salary payable on achievement of:

F N Hord 80 120 160 24.2

R H Marchbank 40 70 100 33.9
F W Roach 80 110 140 42.0
S P Webster 40 70 100 30.0
For the year ending 31 July 2008, the committee has determined
that there will be no change from 2007 for the percentage of base
salary payable as bonus for the achievement of minimum, on-target
and maximum targets.

Other senior executives
There are a number of senior executives whose roles significantly
influence the ability of the Group to meet its strategic objectives.
They include non-Board members of the Executive Committee 
and members of the Executive Committee Advisory Group. 
The committee determines the level of remuneration for this 
group, based on proposals from the Group Chief Executive. Their
total remuneration including salary, actual bonus and the fair value 
of long-term incentives granted/awarded during the year ended 
31 July 2007 is summarised below:
Total remuneration 2006/07 Number in band

Service agreements
The Executive Directors have service agreements with Wolseley plc
which are subject to a maximum of 12 months’ notice of termination 
if given by the Company and six months’ notice of termination if given
by the Executive Director. Such notice periods reflect current market
practice and the balance that should be struck between providing
contractual protection to the Directors that is fair and the interests 
of shareholders. The Non Executive Directors do not have service
agreements and their terms of service are contained in their respective
letters of engagement. The date of each service agreement and the
year in which each Executive Director was last elected or re-elected
are noted in the table below. There are no provisions in any service
agreement for early termination payments and, in the event of early
termination of any service agreement, the committee will give full and
proper consideration to mitigation, which should be taken into
account when computing any compensation payable.

Long-term incentives
The Company currently operates a long-term incentive plan under 
the Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘2002
Scheme’), which was approved by shareholders in December 
2002 and amended at the 2004 Annual General Meeting. The 
2002 Scheme (as amended) provides for awards of ordinary shares
in the capital of the Company, subject to the Company meeting
total shareholder return (‘TSR’) targets over single three-year periods. 
All awards are made subject to the achievement of stretching
performance conditions and TSR has been selected as the
appropriate performance measure to more closely align the
interests of the Executive Directors and senior executives with
those of shareholders over the long term. The 2002 Scheme
rewards the relative outperformance of the Company against a
defined list of comparator companies. Calculations of TSR are
independently carried out and verified before being approved by
the committee.
The lists of comparator companies for awards made under the
2002 Scheme are based upon the constituent members of the
FTSE 100 as at the respective dates of grant, excluding banks,
telecommunications, IT and utility companies but together with
CRH plc and Travis Perkins plc, which compete in the same sector
as the Company. A similar group of companies will be selected for
the 2007 awards under the 2002 Scheme.
The 2002 Scheme is discretionary. The committee’s current policy
is to make annual awards to the Group Chief Executive, Executive
Directors and other senior executives. Awards are made in shares,
save where there are material securities or tax law constraints 
in overseas jurisdictions where the scheme would be operated, 
in which case conditional awards in cash would be considered.
Details of the awards conditionally made to the Executive Directors
in office during the year under the 2002 Scheme and outstanding
at 31 July 2007 are shown in the table below:

1. The share price on the date of grant of the award was 1250 pence per share.
2. The performance periods range from 1 August 2004 to 31 July 2009. The maximum amount that can be granted under the amended
2002 Scheme for each award is 200 per cent of base salary per
annum; however, awards made to date have not exceeded 125 per
cent, or 150 per cent in the case of the Group Chief Executive, of
base salary. Each year the committee assesses the proportion of
awards that should be made up of both share options and long-
term incentive awards. It is the committee’s intention that for the
year ending 31 July 2008, awards are made to the Group Chief
Executive of 150 per cent of salary with lower award levels for other
Executive Directors. The vesting level for a maximum award under
the 2002 Scheme requires performance to be in the upper decile.
To better reflect market practice, shareholder approval was sought
and received on 18 November 2004 so that 25 per cent 
of awards made from that date would vest for achievement of
performance at the median, with a straight line percentage to vest
between median and upper decile. Extant awards remain subject to
the achievement of performance conditions following a participant’s
agreed retirement and vesting is determined at the end of the
performance period.
The following table sets out the percentage of each award which
has vested and the percentage of each extant award, had it vested
on 31 July 2007:
Percentage vested on maturity or indicative vesting percentage
Year of award based on performance as at 31 July 2007
2002 100% (vested 31 July 2005)
2003 34.5% (vested 31 July 2006)
2004 0% (at 31 July 2007)
2005 0% (performance after 24 months)
2006 0% (performance after 12 months)
The committee annually reviews whether grants under the 2002
Scheme should be subject to a financial performance underpin, 
in addition to the satisfaction of a TSR performance target. The
committee decided that for the 2006 award, the continuing use of
EPS as a performance target under the Wolseley Share Option Plan
2003 and the use of financial measures for the annual bonus plan
provided an appropriate balance to the use of TSR within the 2002
Scheme. The committee has decided that future awards under 
the 2002 Scheme may, if deemed appropriate, be subject to 
performance criteria in addition to the current TSR targets and 
the committee will continue to monitor whether circumstances
warrant the imposition of such additional criteria. The factors which
the committee would consider relevant in making their decision
include: a substantial drop in the Company’s share price, the
presence of significant bid speculation in the sector, the adoption 
of weaker targets for the TSR condition, or, a significant change 
in policy away from granting options to granting only long-term
incentive awards. 
Performance graph
The following graph shows the Company’s TSR performance
against the performance of the FTSE 100 Index over the five-year
period to 31 July 2007. The FTSE 100 Index has been chosen as
being a broad equity market index consisting of companies
comparable in size and complexity to Wolseley.
Executive share options
The Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (‘2003 Plan’) received
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting held in
November 2003. Consequently, no further options will be granted
under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1984 (‘1984 Scheme’)
nor under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1989 (‘1989
Scheme’) which are now closed. No options under any such
scheme have or will be granted at a discount to the relevant 
middle market price at the time of grant and no option under any
such scheme can be exercised unless performance conditions
have been satisfied. 
All employees and Executive Directors of the Company, its
subsidiaries and joint ventures, are eligible to participate in the
2003 Plan. Participants are selected by the committee at its
discretion. The committee considers annually the levels of grant,
which are phased over time and they determine the size of each
award at the time of grant based on individual performance, the
ability of each individual to contribute to the achievement of the
performance conditions and market levels of remuneration. Awards
may not exceed an amount equal to five times salary for US-based
executives and three times base salary for UK and other European-
based executives, although the committee may, if it so determines,
also use the five times salary limit in exceptional circumstances. 
It is the committee’s intention that for the year ending 31 July 2008,
awards will not exceed 225 per cent of base salary or 300 per cent
in the case of the Group Chief Executive.
No options may be granted more than 10 years after the date on
which the 2003 Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders
and the committee will formally review the 2003 Plan by no later
than November 2008.
The Company monitors awards made under the various employee
and discretionary share plans, which it operates, in relation to their
effect on dilution limits. Options are either satisfied by the issue of
new shares or shares purchased in the market. In accordance with
the recommendations of the Association of British Insurers (‘ABI’),

granted under the 2003 Plan and any other employee share
scheme is restricted to 10 per cent of the issued ordinary share
capital of the Company over any rolling 10 years. Further, as set
out in the ABI principles and guidelines, the number of new shares
that may be issued to satisfy executive options granted under the
2003 Plan and any other discretionary share scheme is restricted 
to 5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company
over any rolling 10 years. In addition, for US-based participants, 
the 2003 Plan will be restricted such that the aggregate number 
of shares for which options may be granted to such participants
during the life of the 2003 Plan will not exceed 5 per cent of the
issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at the date the
2003 Plan was approved by shareholders.
At 31 July 2007, awards had been granted resulting in shares
being issued or capable of being issued during the preceding 
10 years under all of the Company’s employee share plans
representing some 7 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital 
at that date and 4.12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital
under the Company’s discretionary share plans. 
During the year, an employee benefit trust purchased shares in the
market in order to meet some of the Company’s liability for grants
made under the 2003 Plan and the 2002 Scheme. Details of the
shares held in the employee benefit trust and the price paid for
them are set out in note 28 to the accounts on page 103.
The extent to which the options will be capable of exercise
depends on the satisfaction of a performance condition, based 
on achieving growth above UK inflation in the Company’s EPS 
(as calculated under UK GAAP before goodwill amortisation and
exceptional items), measured from the year ended immediately 
prior to grant.
The performance condition for options now granted under the 2003
Plan operates on the following sliding scale:
Multiple of salary worth of shares under option Total margin over UK inflation after three years
First 100% of salary 9%
Second 100% of salary 12%
Next 50% of salary 15%
Greater than 250% of salary 15% to 21%
The performance of the Company is measured over three financial
years, starting with the financial year in which the option grant
takes place. For all grants made under the 2003 Plan on or after 
5 November 2004 there is a single three-year performance period
and, in the event that the performance conditions are not fully met
on the third anniversary of the date of grant, the options will lapse.
Provided the performance condition has been satisfied, an option
may be exercised at any time until it lapses, 10 years from the date
of grant. No amount is payable on the grant of an option. 
The committee can set different EPS targets from those described
above for future options, provided that the new conditions are no
less challenging in the circumstances than the initial ones. Similarly,
the committee can vary the terms of existing options to take
account of technical changes, for example, changes in accounting
standards. The amended target will be materially no less challenging
as a result of any such change. The committee continues to believe
that the EPS condition is appropriate for share options, as it
requires substantial improvement in the Company’s underlying
financial performance and complements the inherent requirement
for share price growth for an option to have value.
Following the introduction of International Financial Reporting
Standards (‘IFRS’), the Group now reports results on this basis.
EPS calculated under the IFRS basis will be utilised to measure
performance in respect of options granted since 2005 but EPS
and, to the extent required, return on capital employed, will be
calculated on as near a UK GAAP basis as possible in respect 
of options granted prior to 2005 under which performance is 
still required to be measured in order to assess whether options
have vested.

Directors in office during the year under the executive share option
schemes as at 31 July 2007.

Notes:
(a) The highest mid-market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year was 1407 pence
and the lowest was 1061 pence. The price on 31 July 2007 was 1083 pence.
(b) The performance conditions for option awards under the 1984 and 1989 Schemes granted in,
and subsequent to, December 1997 may not be exercised unless growth in EPS over a period 
of three consecutive financial years exceeds growth in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same
period by at least 9 per cent. The number of options exercisable for Executive Directors under the
1984 and 1989 Schemes are, in addition, determined by the return on capital employed achieved
over the same rolling three-year period. For options granted in 1997 and 1998, achieving a return
on capital employed of 15 per cent per annum will enable 50 per cent of options granted to
become exercisable, rising on a sliding scale to 100 per cent for achieving a return on capital
employed of 20 per cent or more. With effect from October 1999 the return on capital employed
required to permit exercise of 100 per cent of options granted was reduced from 20 per cent to
17.5 per cent and the sliding scale was adjusted accordingly.
(c) Options exercisable subject to meeting performance targets. 66 Remuneration report

Savings related share option schemes
The UK- and US-based Executive Directors may, along with all
eligible employees, also participate in the UK Savings Related Share
Option Scheme (‘SRSOS’) and the Employee Share Purchase Plan
(‘ESPP’) respectively. Under the SRSOS, participants who enter 
into a savings contract for three, five or seven years, to a maximum
level of £250 per month, are granted options to subscribe for 
shares in the Company. Under the ESPP , a US Code 423 Plan, 
US participants may enter into a one-year savings contract to a
maximum level of $400 per month. The Board may determine that
the options granted under either scheme may be awarded at a
discount. The maximum discount, as applied to the 2007 awards, 
is 20 per cent for the SRSOS and 15 per cent for the ESPP of the
average market prices used to determine the price of the award.
The following table sets out the number of share options held 
under the SRSOS and ESPP by the Executive Directors.

The value realisable from gains made on share options is the difference between the closing market price on the date of exercise and 
the original option price before any relevant tax deductions, although in most cases, some or all of the shares have been retained by 
the relevant Director.
The total number of options exercised in May 2007 by each of Messrs Hord, Hornsby and Roach under the ESPP was reduced by 
26 (which lapsed) from the total of 222 as listed at 1 August 2006, due to exchange rate fluctuations. Remuneration report 67
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Pensions
Mr Webster, a UK citizen, participates in the Wolseley Group
Retirement Benefits Plan (the ‘Plan’). The Plan is a defined benefit
scheme and provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The Company makes contributions to the Plan based on the
recommendation of the Plan actuary. Bonuses payable to Executive
Directors are not pensionable. Mr Webster currently contributes 
8 per cent per annum of his pensionable salary to the Plan. 
The Finance Act 1989 introduced an earnings cap (the ‘Cap’) 
for employees joining the Plan after 31 May 1989. This has the
effect of limiting the amount of an employee’s salary that can be
pensioned through a tax approved pension scheme. A Plan specific
earnings cap was introduced as a result of changes introduced by
the Finance Act 2004, effective 6 April 2006, when the Cap was
prospectively abolished. The current Plan specific annual limit, to
which Mr Webster is subject, is £112,800. The Company previously
agreed to provide Mr Webster with benefits which are broadly
comparable with those that would have applied under the Plan 
had the Cap not been introduced, which were provided for by
payments into a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme
(‘FURBS’). Following the introduction of the Finance Act 2004, 
the FURBS was no longer a tax efficient vehicle to fund pension
benefits. Accordingly, since 6 April 2006, Mr Webster’s benefits
have been provided through the Plan and through a cash
supplement which, together, are broadly comparable to those to
which he would previously have been entitled. No further monies
have been paid into the FURBS.
Additionally, the Finance Act 1989 capped life assurance payable
through a registered pension scheme in respect of such executives.
Mr Webster receives life cover up to the HM Revenue & Customs’
Lifetime Allowance under the Plan. A separate insurance policy,
paid for by the Company, has been taken out to cover the excess
above the Lifetime Allowance. The amount charged to the profit
and loss account during the year in respect of his future obligation
was £1,256 (2006: £2,988). 
Messrs Hornsby, Marchbank and Roach, who are US citizens,
participate in the defined contribution pension arrangements 
of Ferguson Enterprises, Inc. Messrs Marchbank and Roach
received contributions at the level of 23 per cent of their base
salary and Mr Hornsby at a level of 20 per cent. Bonus ceased 
to be included in the calculation of pension contributions from 
1 August 2006. 
Mr Hord, also a US citizen, participated in the qualified defined
contribution plan of Stock Building Supply, Inc. Mr Hord’s
pensionable earnings included his bonus up to a maximum of
$742,400 as agreed when the bonus scheme was introduced 
in order to preserve his pension entitlement at that time. Mr Hord 
was also a member of a US non-qualified defined benefit plan 
and he elected to receive a cash lump sum payment, in lieu of 
the 20 year instalments, at his retirement.
The following table shows those Executive Directors participating 
in defined contribution pension plans and the cost of the Group’s
contributions thereto:

A US subsidiary undertaking has a commitment to a former
Director, who is a US citizen, to pay a joint survivor pension 
of $300,000 per annum for 15 years from 1 August 1993. 
The net present value of the future obligation at 31 July 2007 
was £149,479 (2006: £298,000), which has been charged in 
prior years’ accounts.
Additionally, Brossette, a French subsidiary undertaking, has a
commitment to a former Director, who is a French citizen, to pay 
an annual pension of a225,597 (2006: a221,833), with a widow’s
entitlement of 60 per cent, subject to an annual increase based 
on the agreed French pension index. The full actuarial cost of this
arrangement was provided in previous years as part of Brossette’s
ongoing pension obligations. The Company is guarantor of this
future pension commitment which at 31 July 2007 was approximately
£2.2 million (2006: £2.3 million).
The following table shows the Executive Directors in office on 
31 July 2007 who participated during the year in the Group’s
defined benefit schemes and the amount of benefit accrued at the 
end of the year as if the Director had left service on 31 July 2007,
the change in accrued benefit over the year, the transfer value at
both the beginning and end of the year as well as the change in 
the transfer value over the year as required by the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The increase in transfer
value figures represents an obligation on the pension fund or the
Company – they are not sums due or paid to the Director. 
The Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority require additional
disclosure of the change in accrued benefit net of inflation and the
transfer value of this change. These pension liabilities are calculated
using the cash equivalent transfer value method prescribed in the
Listing Rules.

External directorships
Executive Directors are encouraged to take on not more than 
one external non executive directorship on a non-competitor 
board, as the committee believes there are significant benefits to be
achieved to both the Company and the individual. In order to avoid
any conflict of interest, all appointments are subject to the Board’s
approval. Executive Directors may retain payments received in
respect of these appointments. Mr Hornsby is a Non Executive
Director of Virginia Company Bank for which he received no fees
during the year; he received 3,000 stock options at $10 each on
appointment in 2006. Mr Hord is a Non Executive Director of
Investors Management Corporation for which the annual rate of his
fees was $19,500 (2006: $22,000). Mr Webster is a Non Executive
Director of Bradford and Bingley plc, for which the annual rate of
his fees is £70,000 (2006: £60,000).
Executive share ownership
A share ownership programme was introduced with effect from 
1 August 2004. It is designed to encourage all Directors and
members of the Executive Committee to build up a shareholding
with a value of 1.5 times annual base salary for the Group Chief
Executive; 1 times annual base salary for all other Executive
Directors; 1 times annual fees for all Non Executive Directors,
including the Chairman; and 0.5 times annual base salary for 
all Executive Committee members. For Executive Directors and
members of the Executive Committee this may be achieved by
retaining shares received as a result of participating in a Company
share plan, other than the shares sold to finance option exercises,
or to pay a National Insurance or income tax liability or overseas
equivalent. The programme specifically excludes the need for
executives to make a personal investment should awards not vest.
Normally these levels of shareholding should be expected to be
achieved within three to five years from the time the individual is
included in the programme. The committee has reviewed and
noted the progress which has been made towards meeting these
targets during the year. Directors’ current shareholdings are set 
out on page 53.
Policy on remuneration of Non Executive
Directors
The remuneration of Non Executive Directors during the year under
review was made up of a basic fee and an additional fee where 
a Non Executive Director acts as chairman of either the Audit 
or Remuneration Committees and for the Director nominated as 
Senior Independent Director. Fees are reviewed from time to time
by the Chairman and the Executive Directors of the Board. The
Non Executive Directors have letters of engagement rather than
service contracts and do not participate in any incentive plan, nor 
is any pension payable in respect of their services as Non Executive
Directors. The Board’s policy is that Non Executive Directors 
are normally appointed for an initial term of three years, which 
is then reviewed and extended for a further three-year period.
Appointments may, however, be terminated upon six months’
notice. There are no provisions for compensation in the event 
of termination. The terms and conditions of appointment of 
the Non Executive Directors are available for inspection at the
Company’s registered office during normal business hours 
and at the Annual General Meeting.
The Board of Directors of Wolseley plc has approved this
Remuneration report.

Group cash flow statement
Year ended 31 July 2007 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union, including interpretations
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’)
and its committees and with those parts of the Companies Act
1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The date of
transition to IFRS was 1 August 2004.
A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the
Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
is set out below.
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under
the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of
available for sale investments and financial assets and liabilities 
held for trading.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial information includes the results of the
parent Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 
31 July 2007.
The trading results of businesses acquired, sold or discontinued
during the year are included in profit on ordinary activities from 
the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale or discontinuance.
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains
and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated 
on consolidation.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s
subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the subsidiary undertaking
operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial
statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentational
currency of the Group and the functional currency of the parent
company.
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are
translated into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling
during the relevant financial period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the period
end. Exchange differences arising between the translation into
sterling of the net assets of these subsidiary undertakings at rates
ruling at the beginning and end of the year are recognised in the
currency translation reserve as are exchange differences on foreign
currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or
provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets.
Changes in the fair value and the final settlement value of derivative
financial instruments, entered into to hedge foreign currency net
assets and that satisfy the hedging conditions of IAS 39, are
recognised in the currency translation reserve (see the separate
accounting policy on derivative financial instruments).

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007

Year ended 31 July 2007
In the event that an overseas subsidiary undertaking is sold, the
gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement 
is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency
translation differences that are attributable to the subsidiary
undertaking concerned. As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected
to deem the cumulative currency translation differences of the
Group to be £nil as at 1 August 2004. As a result the gain or loss
on disposal of an overseas subsidiary undertaking will not include
currency translation differences arising before 1 August 2004.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates
of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling
at the balance sheet date. All currency translation differences are
taken to the income statement with the exception of differences 
on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to
finance or provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets as
detailed above. 
Revenue
Revenue is the amount receivable for the provision of goods and
services falling within the Group’s ordinary activities, excluding 
intra-group sales, estimated and actual sales returns, trade and
early settlement discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes.
Revenue from the provision of goods is recognised when the risks
and rewards of ownership of goods have been transferred to 
the customer. The risks and rewards of ownership of goods are
deemed to have been transferred when the goods are shipped to,
or are picked up by, the customer.
Revenue from services, other than those that arise from
construction service contracts (see below), are recognised 
when the service provided to the customer has been completed.
Revenue in respect of construction service contracts, where the
Group is providing framing lumber installation services to residential
property companies, is recognised using the percentage of
completion method, with the percentage complete being determined
by comparing the percentage of costs incurred to date with the
estimated total costs of the contract. Losses on these contracts, 
if any, are recognised in the period when such losses become
probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Revenue from the provision of goods and all services is only
recognised when the amounts to be recognised are fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes purchased goods, the cost of bringing
inventory to its present location and condition, and labour and
overheads attributable to assembly and construction services. Vendor rebates
The Group enters into arrangements with certain vendors providing
for inventory purchase rebates. These purchase rebates are accrued
as earned and are recorded initially as a reduction in inventory with
a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product 
is sold.
Business combinations
The Group has applied the purchase method in its accounting 
for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3
‘Business Combinations’ to acquisitions of subsidiaries that were
recognised before 1 August 2004 and as a result the carrying
amount of goodwill recognised as an asset under UK GAAP was
brought forward unadjusted as the cost of goodwill recognised
under IFRS as at 1 August 2004. IFRS 3 has been applied with
effect from 1 August 2004 and goodwill amortisation ceased 
from that date.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the
assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or
assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date,
irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the
Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded 
as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value 
of the Group’s share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, 
the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over
the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets 
of the acquired subsidiary undertaking at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings is included 
in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment 
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains 
and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount 
of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of
impairment testing. Each of those cash-generating units represents
the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill
is monitored for management purposes and are not larger than the
primary or secondary reporting segments determined in accordance
with IAS 14 ‘Segmental Reporting’.
Other intangible assets
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset
without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is
probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to
the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured
reliably. The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable
or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights.
Intangible assets, primarily brands, trade names and customer
relationships, acquired as part of a business combination are
capitalised separately from goodwill and are carried at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is calculated using the reducing balance method 
for customer relationships and the straight-line method for other
intangible assets. The cost of the intangible assets is amortised
over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Customer relationships 4-25 years
Trade names and brands 1-15 years
Other 1-4 years
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant
and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and
is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated
impairment losses. Costs include software licences, consulting
costs attributable to the development, design and implementation
of the computer software and internal costs directly attributable 
to the development, design and implementation of the computer
software. Costs in respect of training and data conversion are
expensed as incurred. Amortisation is calculated using the
straight-line method so as to charge the cost of the computer
software to the income statement over its estimated useful life
(three to five years).
Property, plant and equipment (‘PPE’)
PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses, except for land and assets in the
course of construction, which are not depreciated and are carried
at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the
items. In addition, subsequent costs are included in the asset’s
carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can 
be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are
charged to the income statement during the financial period in
which they are incurred.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method
to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its
estimated useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leaseholds 35-50 years
Short leaseholds over the period  
of the lease
Plant and machinery 7-10 years
Fixtures and fittings 5-7 years
Computers 3-5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
The residual values and useful lives of PPE are reviewed and
adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs attributable to assets under construction are
charged to the income statement in the period in which they 
are incurred.
74 Group accounting policies
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Group accounting policies
Year ended 31 July 2007 Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset
have transferred to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet
and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful
lives. The asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value and the
present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of
the lease. The capital elements of future obligations under finance
leases are included in liabilities in the balance sheet and analysed
between current and non-current amounts. The interest elements
of future obligations under finance leases are charged to the
income statement over the periods of the leases and represent a
constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding
in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. The cost
of operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor)
is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over 
the periods of the leases.
Assets held for sale
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will 
be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business.
For this to be the case, the asset must be available for immediate
sale in its present condition, management must be committed 
to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset which, when initiated, 
was expected to result in a completed sale within 12 months.
Assets that are classified as held for sale are not depreciated and
are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell. 
Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not
subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and
whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject 
to amortisation and assets under construction are tested for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount
is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value 
in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
identifiable cash flows.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or 
the average cost method as appropriate to the nature of the
transactions in those items of inventory. The cost of goods
purchased for resale includes import and custom duties, transport
and handling costs, freight and packing costs and other attributable
costs less trade discounts, rebates and other subsidies. It excludes
borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price
in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling
expenses.
Taxation
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable) 
on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into
account any adjustments arising from prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a
business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date
and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can
be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on
investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal
of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps 
and currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising
from the business activities of the Group and the financing of those
activities. There is no trading activity in derivative financial instruments.
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use 
of derivative financial instruments, the Group documents the
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument
together with its risk management objective and the strategy
underlying the proposed transaction. The Group also documents 
its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship
and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the
hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of
the hedged items.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and
liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
Where derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the criteria for
hedge accounting contained in IAS 39, changes in their fair values
are recognised in the income statement. 
Group accounting policies 75
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships
are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net
investment hedges. Where the hedging relationship is classified 
as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset 
or liability is adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value
attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is
recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the
hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of
the hedging instrument. Where the hedging relationship is classified
as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent
the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised directly in
equity rather than in the income statement. When the hedged item
is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains
and losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the income
statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, 
are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other 
post-retirement benefits are charged to the income statement 
as incurred.
For defined benefit pension schemes and other retirement benefits,
the cost is calculated annually using the projected unit credit
method and is recognised over the average expected remaining
service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the
recommendations of independent qualified actuaries. The current
service cost of defined benefit schemes is recorded within
operating profit. The total expected return from pension scheme
assets less the total interest on pension scheme liabilities is
recorded within finance revenue if a gain and finance costs if an
expense. Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are
recorded within operating profit and recognised on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the benefits have
vested. Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences
between the expected and actual returns on the scheme assets
and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised
in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the
period in which they occur. The defined benefit liability or asset
recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each
scheme of the present value of the benefit obligation at the balance
sheet date, less any past service costs not yet recognised, less 
the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
Where a scheme is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to 
the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present
value of any amount which the Group expects to recover by way 
of refunds or a reduction in future contributions. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method,
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the
original terms of the receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held 
at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities 
on the balance sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset
and no practice of net settlement with cash balances.
Share capital
The Company has only one class of shares, ordinary shares, which
are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares 
or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds,
net of tax.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share
capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any
directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from
equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares
are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are
subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of
any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related
tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s
equity holders.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the
consideration received net of transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value being recognised in the income statement over
the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
12 months after the balance sheet date.
Investments
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories:
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and
receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale
financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for
which the investments were acquired. Management determines the
classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates
this designation at every reporting date.
76 Group accounting policies
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Group accounting policies
Year ended 31 July 2007 (a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises financial assets held for trading which
have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the 
short term. Derivatives also fall within this category unless they are
designated as hedges and the hedge is effective for accounting
purposes. Assets in this category are classified as current.
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market
and with no intention of trading. They are included in current
assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the
balance sheet date, which are classified as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables
in the balance sheet.
(c) Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets
with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the
Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold
to maturity. They are included in non-current assets unless the
investment is due to mature within 12 months of the balance 
sheet date.
(d) Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets
that are either designated in this category or not classified in any 
of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets
unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 
12 months of the balance sheet date.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction
costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or
loss. Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash
flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred
and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards 
of ownership.
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans
and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are subsequently
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in
the fair value of the ‘Financial assets at fair value through profit or
loss’ category are included in the income statement in the period in
which they arise. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes
in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified as available-
for-sale are recognised in equity. When securities classified as
available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value
adjustments are included in the income statement as gains and
losses from investment securities.
Provisions
Provisions for environmental restoration, restructuring costs and
legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal 
or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely
than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Such provisions
are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate
of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at 
the balance sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the
present value reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions for insurance represent an estimate, based on historical
experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims and
claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s
executive share option, long-term incentive and share purchase
schemes. The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect 
of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards,
measured using Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation
methodologies. For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is
determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently remeasured
unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date 
of grant and is remeasured at each balance sheet date until the
liability is settled. Generally, the compensation cost is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are
made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting
period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market
performance conditions.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group applied IFRS 2 ‘Share-based
Payment’ retrospectively only to equity-settled awards that had 
not vested as at 1 August 2004 and were granted on or after 
7 November 2002 and cash-settled awards that had not vested 
as at 1 August 2004.
Dividends payable
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Group’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by
the shareholders of the company (generally in the case of the final
dividend) or paid (in the case of interim dividends).
Group accounting policies 77
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1. Critical accounting estimates 
and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS
requires management to make estimates and assumptions in
certain circumstances that affect reported amounts. The most
sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements are in the
areas of assessing the recoverability of receivables, the net
realisable value of inventory, the impairment of goodwill and 
long-lived intangible assets, the reserves in respect of self-insured
insurance, the consideration received from vendors, taxation and
the cost and liability for pensions and other post-retirement benefits.
Allowance for doubtful accounts
Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of
management may be impaired. Within each of the businesses,
assessment is made locally of the recoverability of accounts
receivable based on a range of factors including the age of the
receivable and the creditworthiness of the customer. The provision
is assessed monthly with a detailed formal review of balances and
security being conducted at the full year and half year. Determining
the recoverability of an account involves estimation as to the likely
financial condition of the customer and their ability to subsequently
make payment. If the Group is cautious as to the financial condition
of the customer the Group may provide for accounts that are
subsequently recovered. Similarly, if the Group is optimistic as to
the financial condition of the customer, the Group may not provide
for an account that is subsequently determined to be irrecoverable.
Furthermore, while the Group has a large geographically dispersed
customer base, a slowdown in the markets in which the Group
operates may result in higher than expected uncollectible amounts
and therefore higher (or lower) than anticipated charges for
irrecoverable receivables. In recent years Wolseley has not experienced
significant variation in the amount charged to the income statement
in respect of doubtful accounts, when compared to sales.
Wolseley held a provision for impairment of receivables at 31 July 2007
amounting to £55 million (2006: £41 million).
Inventories
For financial reporting purposes the Group evaluates its inventory 
to ensure it is carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Provision is made against slow moving, obsolete and damaged
inventories. Damaged inventories are identified and written down
through the inventory counting procedures conducted within each
business. Provision for slow moving and obsolete inventories is
assessed by each business as part of their ongoing financial
reporting. Obsolescence is assessed based on comparison of the
level of inventory holding to the projected likely future sales. Future
sales are assessed based on historical experience, and adjusted
where the manufacturer has indicated that it will no longer continue
to manufacture the particular item. To the extent that future events
impact the saleability of inventory these provisions could vary
significantly. For example, changes in specifications or regulations
may render inventory, previously considered to have a realisable
value in excess of cost, obsolete and requiring such inventory 
to be fully written off. The Group held allowances in respect of
inventory balances at 31 July 2007 amounting to £168 million
(2006: £134 million).
Impairment of long-lived assets
Wolseley periodically evaluates the net realisable value of long-lived
assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets and tangible fixed
assets, relying on a number of factors, including operating results,
business plans and projected future cash flows.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not
subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment and
whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to
amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less
costs to sell and value in use. The fair value is in most cases based
on the discounted present value of the future cash flows expected
to arise from the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates,
or from the individual asset or asset group. Estimates are used in
deriving these cash flows and the discount rate. 
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the
assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application 
of the intangible and tangible fixed asset accounting policies affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements. In particular, if
different estimates of the projected future cash flows or a different
selection of an appropriate discount rate were made, these
changes could materially alter the projected value of the cash flows
of the asset, and as a consequence materially different amounts
would be reported in the financial statements.
As disclosed in note 3 and note 11, the Group has charged 
£5 million in respect of the impairment of long-lived assets during
the year ended 31 July 2007 (2006: nil).
Self-insured insurance
The Group operates a captive insurance company, Wolseley
Insurance Limited, which is registered and operational in the Isle 
of Man. This company provides reinsurance exclusively to certain
companies within the Group, principally to cover US casualty and
property damage risks. Provision is made based on actuarial
assessment of the liabilities arising from the insurance coverage
provided. The actuarial assessment of the reserve for future claims
necessarily includes estimates as to the likely trend of future claims
costs and as to the emergence of further claims subsequent to 
the year end. An actuarial review of claims is performed annually.
To the extent that actual claims differ from those projected the provisions
could vary significantly. At 31 July 2007, the provision for claims
arising from this insurance was £48 million (2006: £47 million).
78 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements
Year ended 31 July 2007
  Consideration received from vendors
The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors
providing for inventory purchase rebates primarily upon achievement
of specified volume purchasing levels with many of these agreements
applying to sales in a calendar year. For certain agreements the
rebate rises as a proportion of purchases as higher quantities or
values of purchases are made. The Group accrues the receipt of
vendor rebates as part of its cost of sales for products sold, taking
into consideration cumulative purchases of inventory to date and
projected purchases through to the end of the qualifying period.
Rebates are accrued for each reporting period with an extensive
reassessment of the rebates earned being performed at the end of
the financial year and halfway through the financial year. The Group
has agreements with numerous and geographically dispersed
suppliers, but a slowdown in the markets in which the Group
operates, or a significant change in the profile of products purchased
may result in purchases for the remainder of the year differing
significantly from those projected. Consequently, the rebate actually
received may vary from that accrued in the financial statements.
Taxation
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make
judgements and estimates in relation to tax audit issues and
exposures. Amounts accrued are based on management’s
interpretation of country-specific tax law and the likelihood 
of settlement. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions
are probable of being sustained. Once considered to be probable,
management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether 
a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit 
on the basis of the potential settlement through negotiation and/or
litigation. All such provisions are included in creditors due within
one year. Any recorded exposure to interest on tax liabilities is
provided for in the tax charge.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the United
Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations that are accounted
for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate
costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements. These
actuarial assumptions include discount rates, assumed rates of
return, salary increases and mortality rates, and are disclosed in
note 27.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are
appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect 
the balance sheet and income statement. The Group considers
that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount rate and 
the expected return on plan assets. The Group has estimated the
sensitivity of the financial statements to changes in these assumptions
as follows:

Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements
Year ended 31 July 2007 The Group will prepare segmental disclosures in accordance with US GAAP and disclose them in its Form 20-F for the year ended 
31 July 2007. The disclosure requirements under US GAAP differ from those under IFRS, such that revenue, trading profit and operating
profit for North America will be further analysed by operating segment in the Form 20-F. In order to ensure consistency of information
disclosed to all investors, the following table is included in these financial statements.

The change in revenue and trading profit between the years ended 31 July 2006 and 2007 can be analysed into the effects of changes of
exchange rates, the effects of acquisitions made during the financial year, and the effect of taking in a full year’s revenue and trading profit
of businesses acquired part way through the previous year, with the remainder being organic change.

The final dividend will be authorised by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and is not included as a liability in these 
financial statements. 
8. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share of 73.52 pence (2006: 90.77 pence) is calculated on the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders 
of £474 million (2006: £537 million) on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by
Employee Benefit Trusts, of 644 million (2006: 592 million). As detailed in note 9 below, the Group believes that profit measures before 
the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements. Basic
earnings per share, before the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles, has, therefore, been presented in the following table.
2007 2006
Before amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 87.80p 98.90p
Add back: amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles (net of deferred tax) (14.28)p (8.13)p
Basic earnings per share 73.52p 90.77p
The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of shares 
in issue to 647 million (2006: 597 million) and therefore reduce basic earnings per share to 73.17 pence (2006: 90.02 pence). 
Diluted earnings per share before amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is 87.39 pence (2006: 98.08 pence).
9. Non-GAAP measures of performance
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and is a non-GAAP measure.
The current businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition. Operating profit includes
only the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles arising on those businesses that have been acquired subsequent to 
31 July 2004 and as such does not reflect equally the performance of businesses acquired prior to 31 July 2004 (where no amortisation
of acquired intangibles was recognised), businesses that have developed organically (where no intangibles are attributed) and those
businesses more recently acquired (where amortisation of acquired intangibles is charged). The Group believes that trading profit provides
valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing the Group’s performance since it provides information 
on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly able to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group. 
The Group uses trading profit, and certain key performance indicators calculated by reference to trading profit, for planning, budgeting
and reporting purposes and for its internal assessment of the operating performance of individual businesses within the Group.

All goodwill has arisen from business combinations. On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was
allocated to cash generating units (CGUs). These are independent sources of income streams, and represent the lowest level within the
Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at country, divisional, brand or regional
level. Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from
that business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections based
on five year financial forecasts approved by management. The key assumptions for these forecasts are those regarding revenue growth,
net margin and the level of working capital required to support trading, which management estimates based on past experience and
expectations of future changes in the market. To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are extrapolated after the 
five year period at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate for each market (ranging from 1 to 4 per cent), and discounted
back to present value. The key assumption is the discount rate, which uses an estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital,
based on the three month historic volatility of Wolseley shares and on benchmark interest rates, adjusted for the risk attributable to
individual CGUs. The pre-tax discount rate ranges from 11 to 14 per cent.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 July 2007.
At Stock Building Supply, the US building materials business, revenue and trading profit have been adversely affected by the depressed
US housing market and lower lumber and structural panel prices. The Group has announced branch closures in the midwest region 
and recognised an impairment loss in the year ended 31 July 2007 in respect of this CGU of £2 million relating to goodwill and £3 million
relating to other intangible assets.

There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling £43 million (2006: £43 million) that have not been recognised
on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain. All of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further £650 million (2006: £459 million) of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries
because the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the associated temporary deferred tax differences and it is probable
that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Year ended 31 July 2007 Interest rate swaps
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings. The fair value of interest rate
swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Group’s bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR. Certain interest rate swaps are designated
and effective as cash flow hedges, with the valuation gains being deferred in equity until realised.

The Group’s private placement borrowings are at fixed rates. Certain interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the fair values 
of these borrowings. The movement in fair value of these interest rate swaps has been analysed into a proportion that is effective as a
hedge, and a proportion that is ineffective: both portions have been charged to the income statement with the effective portion offsetting
the change in fair value of the hedged borrowings. The ineffective portion was less than £1 million.

Outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 July 2007 comprised fixed interest payable on notional principal of US$650 million 
and EUR 1,280 million (2006: US$650 million, a770 million and £7 million) and fixed interest receivable on notional principal of US$1,079 million
(2006: US$1,079 million). The contracts expire between September 2007 and November 2020 (2006: September 2006 and November
2020), and the gains deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement over that period. The fixed interest rates vary between 2.313
and 5.415 per cent (2006: 2.313 and 5.415 per cent).
Currency swaps
The Group uses currency swaps either to obtain the optimum return on its surplus funds or to hedge cash flows in respect of committed
transactions. The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts using market prices at the
balance sheet date.
There were no currency swaps held at fair value through the income statement at 31 July 2007. At 31 July 2006 the Group had entered
into certain short-term currency swaps amounting to assets of US$3 million and liabilities of £2 million which were held at fair value through
the income statement.

At 31 July 2007, £594 million of loans carried a fixed interest rate (2006: £651 million). The weighted average interest rate paid on 
fixed interest borrowings is 5.0 per cent (2006: 5.0 per cent). Interest receipts and payments on the floating rate assets and liabilities 
are determined by reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR.
The fair value of fixed interest rate loans payable after one year is £590 million, compared to their book value of £594 million 
(2006: £621 million compared to their book value of £626 million). The floating rate loans payable after one year generally attract 
variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR. Thus the fair value of these instruments approximates to their book value.
The Group’s undrawn committed facilities amount to £1,204 million (2006: £780 million). Further details of these centrally managed
facilities and the financial risk management activities of the Group are set out in the Performance review on pages 40 to 41.

Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims
and claims incurred but not reported on certain risks retained by the Group (principally US casualty and global property damage).
Environmental and legal liabilities include known and potential legal claims and environmental liabilities arising from past events where it is
probable that a payment will be made and the amount of such payment can be reasonably estimated. Included in this provision is an amount
of £35 million (2006: £31 million) related to asbestos litigation involving certain Group companies. This liability is fully covered by insurance and
accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in ‘Other receivables’ (note 17). The liability has been actuarially determined
as at 31 July 2007 based on advice from independent professional advisors. The provision and the related receivable have been stated on 
a discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 5.0 per cent (2006: 5.2 per cent). The level of insurance cover available significantly
exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
Restructuring provisions mainly relate to branch closure programmes at Stock Building Supply, the US building materials business, 
and at Wolseley UK. The majority of these obligations fall due within one year.
Other provisions relate to rental commitments on vacant properties, dilapidations on leased properties and warranties. The weighted
average maturity of these obligations is approximately five years.
27. Retirement benefit obligations
(i) Description of schemes
United Kingdom
The principal scheme operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on 
final pensionable salaries. The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. The scheme’s retirement benefits are funded by a
contribution from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies. The contribution rates paid by employees at 31 July 2007
are either 5 per cent or 8 per cent of earnings depending on the level of benefits that were accruing at that date. The Group and employee
contribution rates are calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
Outside the United Kingdom
North America
The principal scheme operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance with US 401k
rules. Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing schemes. Contributions are charged to the
income statement in the period in which they fall due. In the year to 31 July 2007 the cost of defined contribution schemes charged 
to the income statement was £24 million (2006: £23 million).
In addition, the Group operates three defined benefit schemes in the United States. In Canada a defined benefit scheme and a defined
contribution scheme are operated. Two of the US schemes and the Canadian scheme are funded; two schemes are closed to new
entrants. The majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies. The closed schemes
now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution scheme. The remaining schemes provide benefits 
based on final pensionable salaries. The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit (credit) Method as agreed with independent
consulting actuaries. 
Europe
Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated. Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in
accordance with actuarial advice. Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period in which they fall due.
The cost of defined contribution schemes charged to the income statement was £15 million (2006: £5 million).

The expected long-term rates of return for equities have been determined by reference to government bond rates (minimum risk rates) 
in the countries in which the schemes are based. To reflect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long-term rates of 
return on equities include a risk premium. These risk premiums are long-term assumptions and were set after taking actuarial advice and
considering the assumptions used by listed companies. The expected long-term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar
way, i.e. by using an appropriate risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country. For the principal UK scheme a premium
of 3.0 per cent per year as at 31 July 2007 (2006: 3.0 per cent) was applied to the expected return from government bonds. For the principal
overseas schemes in USA, Canada and Switzerland a similar approach was adopted with returns set by reference to long-term bond
rates after taking actuarial advice.
The Group’s investment strategy for its funded post employment schemes is decided locally by the Group and, if relevant, the trustees 
of the schemes, and takes account of relevant statutory requirements. The Group’s objective for investment strategy is to achieve 
a target rate of return in excess of the increase in liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long-term to deliver 
the target rate of return. Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention being that this will result in the
ongoing cost to the Group of the post employment schemes being lower over the long-term and be within acceptable boundaries of risk.
100 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements
Year ended 31 July 2007 For the principal UK scheme the policy is to invest approximately 75 per cent of the assets in equities, and 25 per cent in other asset
classes, principally bonds. The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Group. 
For the overseas schemes the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities with the remainder 
of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.

Year ended 31 July 2007 Employee Benefit Trusts
Three Employee Benefit Trusts have been established in connection with the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 and the Wolseley plc 2002
Long Term Incentive Scheme. During the year, one of these trusts purchased 2,188,522 ordinary shares of the Company, with a nominal
value of £1 million, for a cash consideration of £27 million. The market value of the 6,200,000 shares held by the employee benefit trusts
at 31 July 2007, which have a nominal value of £2 million, was £67 million (2006: £46 million) and none of them had been allocated to
employees or Directors at that date. Dividends due on shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts are waived in accordance with the
provisions of the trust deeds.
29. Share-based payments
The Group operates seven share option plans: the 1984 Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme 
and the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (collectively, the ‘Executive Option Schemes’); the Wolseley Employees Savings Related Share
Option Scheme 1981, the Wolseley Irish Sharesave Scheme 2000 and the Wolseley European Sharesave Plan 2001 (collectively, the
‘Employees Savings Option Schemes’); and the Wolseley Employee Share Purchase Plan 2001 (the ‘ESPP’). The Wolseley Employees
International Stock Appreciation Plan (the ‘SAP’) expired during the year ended 31 July 2006.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth 
in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period 
by at least 9 per cent and consequently vest over a period of three years. Awards granted under the Employee Savings Option Schemes
vest over periods ranging from three to seven years. Awards granted under the Employee Share Purchase Plan vest over a one year period.
Awards granted under the SAP vested over a period of five years.
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and the Wolseley Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’) for senior executives.
Under the LTIS, executives will be awarded a variable number of shares depending on the level of total shareholder return over the next
three years relative to that of a number of comparator companies. The vesting period is three years. The maximum award under the
scheme is determined at grant date, and then adjusted at vesting date in accordance with the market performance condition. Under the
RSP , executives are granted free shares. The vesting period is three years and there are no performance measures.

The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated by the binomial methodology for all schemes
except the LTIS, for which a Monte Carlo simulation was used. The fair value of shares granted under the RSP was calculated as the
market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were:
Executive Employee Long Term
Share Options Share Options Incentive Schemes
2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006
Risk-free interest rate 4.78% 4.45% 5.34% 4.52% 4.98% 4.40%

Expected life 5.7 years 5.7 years 1-7 years 1-7 years 3 years 3 years
*The initial assumption was for 2007 interim and final dividends of 10.84 pence and 21.51 pence respectively (2006: 9.68 pence and
19.36 pence respectively).
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term. Expected life has been estimated on the
basis of historical data on the exercise pattern.

A ‘share symmetry arrangement’ is an option scheme under which options are granted to an employee benefit trust, which exercises
them on behalf of employees. When rights vested under the stock appreciation plans, the parent company issued shares to the trust,
which then sold them in the market. From the Group’s point of view, shareholders’ equity only increased by the proportion of the sale
proceeds attributable to the original exercise price of the award, while the trust remitted the remaining amount to employees. The parent
company, however, is required by the UK Companies Act to credit the full issue proceeds to share capital and share premium account,
and consequently the proportion of the issue proceeds remitted to employees is accounted for as a capitalisation of distributable reserves.

The fair value adjustments shown above for the year ended 31 July 2007 are provisional figures, being the best estimates currently available.
Further adjustments to goodwill may be necessary when additional information is available concerning some of the judgmental areas.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the new markets and product ranges to which the
Group has gained access, and to additional profitability and operating efficiencies in respect of existing markets.
The acquisitions contributed £2,067 million to revenue, £132 million to trading profit and £80 million to the Group’s operating profit for the
period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax, as the Group manages
its borrowings as a portfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition. It is not practicable to disclose profit
attributable to equity shareholders, as the complexity of the Group’s tax arrangements is such that it cannot attribute an effective tax rate to
an individual acquisition.
If each acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue would have been £16,774 million and Group
trading profit would have been £930 million. It is not practicable to disclose profit before tax or profit attributable to equity shareholders, 
as stated above. It is not practicable to disclose operating profit as the Group cannot estimate the amount of intangible assets that would
have been acquired at a date other than the acquisition date.

have renewal options and rental escalation clauses, though the effect of these is not material. No arrangements have been entered into for
contingent rental payments.
The total minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 July 2007 is £18 million 
(2006: £8 million).
39. Contingent liabilities
The Group has quantifiable contingent liabilities under sundry guarantees, performance bonds and indemnities of £37 million 
(2006: £114 million) which arose in the ordinary course of business and which have not been provided in these accounts since no actual
liability is expected to arise.
At 31 July 2007, the Group has counterparty exposure of £232 million (2006: £497 million) in respect of unsettled currency swaps. These
currency swaps have a fair value of nil and further details are included in note 20.
As of 31 July 2007, cash deposits of Wolseley Insurance Limited amounting to £58 million (2006: £52 million) were charged in favour of
Lloyds TSB Bank plc to secure letters of credit provided by that bank.

In August 2007, the Group acquired 100 per cent of ProSource Building Supply, Western Air Systems & Controls, Inc., Davidson Pipe
Company, Inc., T&R Electrical Wholesalers Ltd and Proaktiv Bygglogistic i Stockholm AB for an estimated aggregate consideration of 
£86 million. The estimated net assets acquired were £34 million and estimated goodwill was £52 million. 
Both the cost of acquisition and the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired are estimates based on information available to the Group
at the date of approval of these financial statements. Further adjustments will be necessary when additional information is available. 
41. Parent company
Wolseley plc is a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United Kingdom. It operates as the
ultimate parent company of the Wolseley Group. Its registered office is Parkview 1220, Arlington Business Park, Theale, Reading RG7 4GA,
United Kingdom.
42. Accounting standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards not 
yet effective
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 August 2007 or later periods, but which the Group has not early adopted. The new standards
which are expected to be relevant to the Group’s operations are as follows:
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (effective from 1 August 2007) and amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures (effective from 1 August 2007)
IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures of qualitative and quantitative information about exposure to risks arising from financial instruments
including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, including sensitivity analysis to market risk. 
The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about the level of an entity’s capital and how it manages capital. Management 
is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 8 Operating segments (effective from 1 August 2009)
This IFRS specifies how an entity should report information about its operating segments in its financial statements. Generally, financial
information is required to be reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and 
deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments. Management is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 8 on the Group’s
financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs (effective from 1 August 2009)
This amendment requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs, to the extent they are directly attributable to the acquisition, production 
or construction of assets that need a period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale. Management is currently assessing the
impact of this amendment on the Group’s financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements (effective from 1 August 2009)
This amendment requires information in financial statements to be aggregated on the basis of shared characteristics and introduces a
statement of comprehensive income. Preparers will have the option of presenting items of income and expense and components of other
comprehensive income either in a single statement of comprehensive income with subtotals, or in two separate statements (a separate
income statement followed by a statement of comprehensive income). Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment
on the Group’s financial statements.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 109
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions (effective from 1 August 2007)
IFRIC 11 provides guidance on the application of IFRS 2 Share-based payments to transactions which are settled by the purchase of own
shares, and transactions in which employees of a subsidiary receive rights to shares of a parent company. Management does not expect
adoption of this interpretation to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements (effective from 1 August 2008)
IFRIC 12 clarifies how certain aspects of existing IASB literature are to be applied to service concession arrangements, which are
arrangements whereby a government or other body grants contracts for the supply of public services – such as roads, energy distribution,
prisons or hospitals – to private operators. Management does not expect adoption of this interpretation to have a significant impact on 
the Group’s financial statements.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes (effective from 1 August 2008)
IFRIC 13 addresses accounting by entities that grant loyalty award credits to customers who buy other goods or services. It requires 
the award to be accounted for as a separate component of the sale transaction, with the fair value of the award being deferred until 
the obligation to provide free or discounted goods or services has been redeemed. Management is currently assessing the impact of 
this interpretation on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 
(effective from 1 August 2008)
Paragraph 58 of IAS 19 Employee Benefits limits the measurement of the defined benefit asset in a pension plan to the ‘present value 
of economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.’ IFRIC 14 clarifies 
how to measure this limit in the case of plans subject to a minimum funding requirement. Management does not expect adoption of 
this interpretation to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements.
110 Notes to the consolidated financial statements
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notes to the consolidated

for the year ended 31 July 2007 which comprise the Group income
statement, the Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow statement,
the Group statement of recognised income and expense and the
related notes. These Group financial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial
statements of Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2007 and 
on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration report that is

Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not,
in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by 
our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group
financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ report is consistent with the Group financial statements.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.

consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’
report, the Directors’ Remuneration report, the Chairman’s statement,

An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements. 
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the Group
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of
the presentation of information in the Group financial statements.

Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
1. Company accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These Companies Act financial statements are prepared under the
historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK
accounting standards.
The principal accounting policies, as set out below, have been
applied consistently throughout the period. The amendment 
to the Financial Reporting Standard 26 ‘Financial Instruments:
Measurement’ (FRS 26) has been adopted by the Company for the
first time in these financial statements. The amendment requires a
financial guarantee to be recorded within the accounts at its fair value.
The impact on the restated Company’s reserves at 1 August 2006
of applying this new accounting policy is a decrease in reserves of
£8 million (1 August 2005: £11 million) and an increase in profit for
the year of £3 million (2006: £3 million).
Note 7 on page 86, note 27 on pages 98 to 102, note 28 on
pages 102 to 103 and note 29 on pages 103 and 104 of the
Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements form part of these
financial statements.
Under section 203(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company 
is exempt from the requirements to present its own profit and loss
account. Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 (revised 1996) the
Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare statements 
of cash flow as the Consolidated Statements have been published.
Foreign currencies
The cost of the Company’s investments in overseas subsidiary
undertakings is translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date
of investment.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates
of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date. All currency translation differences are
taken to the income statement with the exception of differences 
on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used 
to finance or provide a hedge against foreign currency investments.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are recorded at cost less provision 
for impairment.
Taxation
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable) 
on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into
account any adjustments arising from prior years.
Provision is made for deferred taxation in so far as a liability or
asset has arisen as a result of transactions that had occurred by
the balance sheet date and have given rise to an obligation to pay
more tax in the future, or the right to pay less tax in the future. 
An asset has not been recognised to the extent that the transfer 
of economic benefits in the future is uncertain. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities recognised have not been discounted. Provision is
made for UK or foreign taxation arising on the distribution to the 
UK of retained profits of overseas subsidiary undertakings where
dividends have been recognised as receivable.
Derivatives and financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, in particular, interest rate swaps
and currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising
from the business activities of the Company and the financing of
those activities. There is no trading activity in derivative financial
instruments.
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use of
derivative financial instruments, the Company documents the
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument
together with its risk management objective and the strategy
underlying the proposed transaction. The Company also documents
its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship
and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the
hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of
the hedged items.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and
liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
Where derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the criteria for
hedge accounting contained in FRS 26, changes in their fair values
are recognised in the income statement. 
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships
are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net
investment hedges. Where the hedging relationship is classified 
as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset 
or liability is adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value
attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is
recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the
hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of
the hedging instrument. Where the hedging relationship is classified
as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent
the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised directly 
in equity rather than in the income statement. When the hedged
item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated
gains and losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the
income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial
asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. 
Notes to the Company 
financial statements
Year ended 31 July 2007 Financial guarantees
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as assets and
liabilities measured at fair value as at the reporting date. Fair value
is estimated by discounting expected cash flows at a market rate.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
Pensions and post-retirement benefits
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other post
retirement benefits are charged to the income statement as incurred.
For defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits, the
cost is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method and
is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of
participating employees, in accordance with the recommendations 
of independent qualified actuaries. The current service cost of defined
benefit plans is recorded within operating profit, the expected return
from pension scheme assets is recorded within finance revenue and
the interest on pension scheme liabilities is recorded within finance
costs. Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are
recorded within operating profit and recognised on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the benefits have
vested. Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences
between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the
effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in
the statement of recognised gains and losses in the period in which
they occur. The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the
balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present
value of the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less any
past service costs not yet recognised, less the fair value of the plan
assets, if any, at the balance sheet date. Where a plan is in surplus,
the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised
past service costs and the present value of any amount which the
Company expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in
future contributions. 
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash at bank and in hand includes cash in hand, deposits held 
at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are
shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet
to the extent that there is no right of offset and practice of net
settlement with cash balances.
Share capital
The Company has only one class of shares, ordinary shares, which
are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the
issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction
from the proceeds, net of tax.
Where the Company or the Company’s employee benefit trusts
purchase the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration
paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of
tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity
holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any
consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity
attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the
consideration received net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value being recognised in the income statement over
the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at
least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the
Company’s executive share option, long-term incentive and share
purchase schemes. The Company recognises a compensation cost
in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the
awards, measured using Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo
valuation methodologies. For equity-settled schemes, the fair 
value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently
remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was 
granted are modified. For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is
determined at the date of grant and is remeasured at each balance
sheet date until the liability is settled. Generally, the compensation
cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures
during the vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service
conditions or achieve non-market performance conditions.
The Company has applied FRS 20 retrospectively only to equity-
settled awards that had not vested as at 1 August 2004 and were
granted on or after 7 November 2002 and cash-settled awards that
had not vested as at 1 August 2004.
Dividends payable
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Company’s
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are
approved by the shareholders of the Company (generally in the
case of the final dividend) or paid (in the case of interim dividends).

The Company participates in the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan. This is a defined benefit multi-employer scheme, the assets
and liabilities of which are held independently from the Group. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and
liabilities of the scheme and accordingly accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Information in respect of the
scheme is provided in note 27, on pages 98 to 102, to the Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements. The total contribution to the
defined benefit scheme in the year was £1 million (2006: £1 million)

settled share-based payment charge of £3 million in the year (2006: £3 million).

Interest rate swaps
The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings. The fair value of interest
rate swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Company’s bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR. Certain interest rate swaps are
designated and effective as cash flow hedges, and the valuation gains have been deferred in equity until realised.

Outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 July 2007 comprised fixed interest payable on notional principal of US$650 million 
and a1,280 million (2006: US$650 million and a770 million) and fixed interest receivable on notional principal of US$350 million 
(2006: US$350 million). The contracts expire between September 2007 and August 2011 (2006: September 2006 and August 2009), 
and the gains deferred in equity will reverse in the profit and loss account over that period. The fixed interest rates varied between 
2.313 per cent and 5.415 per cent (2006: 2.313 per cent and 5.415 per cent).
Currency swaps
The Company uses currency swaps either to obtain the optimum return on its surplus funds or to hedge the spot exchange rate risk of 
its assets and liabilities, principally loans. The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts
using market prices at the balance sheet date.

Year ended 31 July 2007 14. Contingent liabilities
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims and legal actions in progress. The Company takes legal advice 
as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice, 
that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
At 31 July the Company has a quantifiable contingent liability for value added tax of certain subsidiary undertakings of £8 million 
(2006: £5 million) which arose in the ordinary course of business and has not been provided in these accounts since no actual liability 
is expected to arise.
At 31 July 2007 the Company has counterparty exposure of £232 million (2006: £497 million) in respect of unsettled currency swaps.
These currency swaps have a fair value of nil and further details are included in note 12 on page 117.
In addition, the Company has given its principal UK bank authority to transfer at any time any sum outstanding to its credit against

Notes to the Company financial statements 119
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 We have audited the parent company financial statements of
Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2007 which comprise 
the balance sheet and the related notes. These parent company
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in 
the Directors’ Remuneration report that is described as having
been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2007.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration report and the parent company financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for
and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company
financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the
parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We report to you
whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report
is consistent with the parent company financial statements. We
also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is
not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company
financial statements. The other information comprises only the
Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration
report, the Chairman’s statement, the Group Chief Executive’s
review, the Performance review and the corporate governance
statement. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be
audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the
parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent company financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
company financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at
31 July 2007;
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with
the parent company financial statements.

pursuance of such offer or agreement as if the authority conferred
by this resolution had not expired.

Explanatory notes
Resolution 1
The Directors are required to present to the Meeting the audited
accounts and the Directors’ and auditors’ report for the financial
year ended 31 July 2007.
Resolution 2
The Directors’ report on remuneration includes the Company’s
policy on Directors’ remuneration for the next financial year and 
for the years subsequent to that, a table containing details of the
Directors’ emoluments and a line graph that shows total shareholder
return (‘TSR’) from 1 August 2002, together with the TSR for the
FTSE 100 index since that date.
Resolution 3
If Resolution 3 is approved by shareholders, the final dividend for 
the year ended 31 July 2007 will be paid on 30 November 2007 
to shareholders whose names appear on the register of members
at close of business on 5 October 2007.
Resolutions 4, 5 and 6 
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, one-third of 
the Directors are required to retire by rotation each year and, 
in addition, no Director may serve for more than three years 
without being re-elected by shareholders. Messrs Duff, Hornsby
and Murray will retire by rotation this year in accordance with the
Articles of Association and are proposed for re-election through
separate resolutions numbered 4, 5 and 6. Mr Duff is standing for
re-election as a Non Executive Director. Mr Duff is the Chairman 
of the remuneration committee and a member of the nominations
committee. Mr Duff does not have a service contract with the
Company but his appointment is terminable on six months’ notice.
Mr Hornsby is standing for re-election as an Executive Director. 
Mr Hornsby has a service contract with the Company terminable 
by not less than six months’ notice given by him or 12 months’
notice if given by the Company. Mr Murray is standing for re-election
as a Non Executive Director. He is Chairman of the audit committee.
Mr Murray does not have a service contract with the Company but
his appointment is terminable on six months’ notice. Biographical
details of all the Directors standing for re-election appear on pages
42 and 43 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Resolutions 7 and 8
Auditors have to be appointed at every general meeting at which
accounts are presented to shareholders. The current appointment
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s auditors will
end at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting and it has
advised its willingness to stand for reappointment. It is normal
practice for a company’s directors to be authorised to agree 
how much the auditors should be paid.
Resolutions 9 and 10
The Companies Act 1985 prevents Directors from allotting unissued
shares without the authority of shareholders in general meeting.
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Directors to allot
unissued shares but this power is subject to renewal by shareholders.
Resolution 9 empowers the Directors to allot shares of up to
£34,703,160 in nominal amount representing the authorised but
unissued ordinary share capital as at 24 September 2007, being a
date not more than one month prior to this Notice. The Directors
were last given this authority at the Annual General Meeting held in
2006 and it is intended that renewal of this authority will be sought
on an annual basis. Resolution 10 empowers the Directors to allot
shares for cash or sell/transfer shares out of treasury otherwise
than pro rata to existing shareholders but this power is limited to
allotments in connection with a rights issue and otherwise up to an
aggregate nominal amount of £8,264,842 (approximately 5 per cent
of the issued ordinary share capital as at 24 September 2007,
being a date not more than one month prior to this Notice). 
Save for the issue of shares pursuant to the Company’s various
employee share schemes and any share dividend alternatives, 
the Directors do not presently intend to allot any unissued shares.
Treasury shares and the regulations which came into force on 
1 December 2003 in relation to them, are more fully explained in the
note to Resolution 11. The authority conferred by these resolutions
will expire no later than 15 months from the date on which the
resolution is passed, or at the conclusion of the Annual General
130 Notice of meeting
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notice of meeting Meeting to be held in 2008, whichever is the sooner. Similar resolutions
have been approved by shareholders at each Annual General Meeting
since 1984.
Resolution 11
This resolution empowers the Directors to make limited on-market
purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares. The power is limited
to a maximum of 66,118,736 shares (10 per cent of the issued
share capital as at 24 September 2007) and details the minimum
and maximum prices that can be paid, exclusive of expenses. 
The authority conferred by this resolution will expire at the
conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting. 
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares)
Regulations 2003 came into force on 1 December 2003. These
regulations allow shares repurchased by the Company to be held
as treasury shares. Treasury shares may be cancelled, sold for cash
or used for the purpose of employee share schemes. The authority
to be sought by this resolution is intended to apply equally to shares
to be held by the Company as treasury shares. No dividends will 
be paid on shares which are held as treasury shares and no voting
rights will be attached to them. Shares held as treasury shares 
will be treated as if cancelled. The Company holds no shares in
treasury but the Directors currently intend that any shares which 
are repurchased will be held in treasury.
Resolution 12
This resolution enables the Directors to incur expenditure of up to 
a total of £125,000 in respect of the heads identified (including any
such expenditure by a subsidiary company) without unintentionally
breaching the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, which defines
political organisations and political donations in a broad manner.
The authority sought will, if granted, last until the conclusion of the
2008 Annual General Meeting of the Company when the Directors
intend to seek renewal of this authority. The policy of not giving 
any cash contributions to any political party will continue.
Resolution 13
The Articles of Association prescribe that the total amount of 
fees which may be paid to the Non Executive Directors shall not
exceed £750,000 per annum, unless the Company’s shareholders
otherwise resolve. In view of the increasing time commitment
involved and in line with market trends, the Board believes it is
appropriate to recommend an increase in the limit to £1,000,000
per annum in order to provide flexibility for the future. 
Amendments to the Articles of Association of the Company
The Companies Act 2006 (the ‘2006 Act’) received Royal Assent 
in November 2006. The 2006 Act represents a major reform of UK
companies’ legislation and is being brought into force on a staged
basis between January 2007 and October 2008. It is proposed
that, at this year’s Annual General Meeting, the Company amends
its Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’) to reflect certain changes 
in the law governing electronic communications and Directors’
conflicts of interest which have or will come into force as a result 
of the 2006 Act (see notes to Resolutions 13 and 14 below).
However, over the coming year, the Company (in conjunction with
its legal advisers) intends to conduct a further review of the Articles,
incorporating any further changes which are necessary or desirable
following the full implementation of the 2006 Act. Any proposed
amendments will be put to shareholders at the 2008 Annual
General Meeting. Copies of the current and proposed Articles 
(and comparison documents showing all the proposed changes 
to the Articles) are available for inspection during normal business
hours at the registered office of the Company and at the offices 
of its solicitors, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (65 Fleet Street, 
London EC4Y 1HS) until 28 November 2007 or upon request 
from the Company Secretary. Copies will also be available at the
Annual General Meeting from 11.15am until its conclusion. The
material differences between the current and the proposed Articles
are summarised below. Changes of a minor, conforming or purely
technical nature have not been mentioned specifically.
Resolution 14
Provisions relating to electronic communications
Currently, shareholders may elect for communications to be sent 
to them via email rather than receiving documents in hard copy
form. The 2006 Act contains new provisions relating to electronic
communications between companies and their shareholders 
which will enable companies to use electronic communications 
with shareholders as the ‘default’ position by placing documents 
on a website unless shareholders specifically elect to receive hard
copies. Shareholders may also elect to communicate with the
Company by electronic means where the Company has given an
electronic address in a Notice calling a meeting or in an instrument
of proxy. The Company proposes to amend its Articles to take
advantage of these provisions.
In any event, before implementing the ‘default’ provisions (as detailed
above), the Company would write to all shareholders to give them
the opportunity to exercise their choice as to whether they wish 
to continue to receive documents in hard copy form or via the
Company’s website.
Resolution 15
Provisions relating to conflicts of interest 
The 2006 Act sets out Directors’ general duties, which largely codify
the existing law, but with some changes. Under the 2006 Act, from
1 October 2008 a Director must avoid a situation where he has, or
can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may
conflict, with the Company’s interests. This requirement is very
broad and could apply, for example, if a Director becomes a Director
of another company or a trustee of another organisation. Currently,
Directors discuss such proposed positions with the Company before
taking them up and there are actions Directors can take to avoid 
a breach of their duties if an actual conflict arises. The 2006 Act
allows Directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and
potential conflicts, where appropriate, where the Articles of
Association contain a provision to this effect. The 2006 Act also
allows the Articles of Association to contain other provisions for
dealing with Directors’ conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of 
duty. This change to the Articles of Association, to take effect from 
1 October 2008, would give the Directors authority to approve 
such situations and to include other provisions to allow conflicts 
of interest to be dealt with in a similar way to the current position.
There are safeguards which will apply when the Directors decide
whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict. Firstly, only
Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered will
be able to take the relevant decision and secondly, in taking the
decision the Directors must act in a way they consider, in good
faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’s success. The
Directors will be able to impose limits or conditions when giving
authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
The Directors consider that each of the resolutions is in the best
interests of the Company and the shareholders as a whole and,
accordingly, recommend all shareholders to vote in favour of 
all resolutions, as the Directors intend to do in respect of their 
own shares.
Notice of meeting 131
Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Electronic communications
The Company is currently authorised to send shareholder
information, including Annual Reports, Notices of General Meetings
and Forms of Proxy to you electronically, provided only that you
agree to receive them in this format. 
This has a number of advantages, including: 
• Speedier delivery of documents; 
• Cost savings on the delivery of documents;
• Saving on environmental resources;
• Confirmation of receipt of proxy appointments.
To receive your shareholder documentation electronically, 
you need to register with our Registrars’ online service,
www.shareview.co.uk. This is a secure service enabling shareholders
to set up and view personal shareholding details. When you register
please have your shareholder reference number to hand (this can
be found on your share certificate or your proxy form). 
To encourage more shareholders to convert to ecommunications, 
if you make the choice to receive all future communications
electronically, we will arrange for a sapling tree to be planted 
in the UK to be dedicated to you. 
This offer and the provision of a facility to communicate with
shareholders electronically, does not discriminate between registered
shareholders of the same class. The facility is available to all
registered shareholders on equal terms and participation is made
as simple as possible. Please note that it is the shareholder’s
responsibility to notify our Registrars through www.shareview.co.uk 
of any change to their email address.
In the future, subject to the approval of the amendments to the
Articles of Association pursuant to Resolution 14, the Company will
be able to communicate with shareholders who have consented, 
or who have deemed to have consented, to receive documents
electronically, by placing shareholder documentation on a website
and notifying them in writing that such documents are available. 
The Company would, however, write to all shareholders before
doing so to give you an opportunity to exercise your choice as to
whether you wish to continue to receive documents in hard copy
form or via the Company’s website.
The next opportunity for us to notify you electronically will be for 
the Interim Report for 2008, which will be published in Spring 2008.
If you have registered, an email will be sent in March/April 2008
notifying you that the report has been published and this will
include a link to the relevant page on our website. A similar
procedure will be followed for future shareholder documentation.
There are no particular software requirements to view these
documents, other than those described and available on our
website www.wolseley.com. 
Before electing for electronic communication, shareholders should
ensure that they have the appropriate computer capabilities. The
Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure no viruses are
present in any communication it sends out, but cannot accept any
responsibility for loss or damage arising from the opening or use 
of any email or attachments from the Company and recommends
that shareholders subject all messages to virus checking procedures
prior to use. Please note that any electronic communication sent 
by a shareholder to the Company or the Registrar containing a
computer virus will not be accepted. 
The Company’s obligation is satisfied when it transmits an
electronic message. It cannot be held responsible for a failure in
transmission beyond its control. In the event that the Company
becomes aware that an electronic transmission is not successfully
transmitted, a paper notification will be sent to the shareholder 
at their registered address. The Company also reserves the right,
irrespective of your election, to revert to sending paper documentation
by post, whenever the Board considers it necessary or desirable 
to do so.

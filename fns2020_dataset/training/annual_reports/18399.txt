I am pleased to present our results 
for the financial year ended 30 
September 2015. The Group achieved 
positive like-for-like net income growth 
for each quarter and an increase of 
0.8% for the full year. The business 
has now delivered nine consecutive 
quarters of like-for-like net income 
growth. As a result, profit before tax 
and exceptional items for the 2015 
year was £122 million which delivered 
adjusted earnings per share of 19.4p, 
2.1% ahead of the previous year.
This strong performance has provided 
the platform for us to undertake 
the most fundamental review 
of our business model since the 
Company was established in 1991 . 
Work commenced on this review 
in April 2014 and the outcome was 
presented together with our Interim 
results in May 2015. Covering 
the next five years, it represents 
a sustainable long-term strategy 
that embraces different operating 
formats for our pubs in order to best 
serve our publicans, employees and 
communities in which our assets are 
located. It will also deliver significantly 
greater value to our shareholders by 
optimising the returns from each of 
our assets. Underlying the strategy 
is a comprehensive analysis of the 
consumer habits, demographics and 
competitive environment of each of 
our pubs, and a thorough evaluation 
of the best operating model for 
each pub, embracing fully managed 
all the way to free-of-tie, rent-only 
agreements. 
Since announcing the strategy in 
May, it has received widespread 
shareholder endorsement and 
support.
Execution is clearly critical and I am 
pleased to report good progress 
in this regard. Additional and 
experienced management has been 
added to the senior team; pub by 
pub analysis and planning is well 
underway and each of the new 
operating models has been created. 
Our intention is to keep the markets 
and our investors fully informed 
about our progress in executing the 
strategy, with key events planned 
over the coming years. 
Meanwhile, the past year has seen 
the successful implementation of 
many initiatives in our leased and 
tenanted estate, enhancing publican 
profitability and mitigating business 
failures. We have continued to 
dispose of under-performing assets, 
reinvesting the proceeds to drive 
like-for-like net income growth and 
improve the financial returns of our 
retained estate. In the new financial 
year we expect to generate around 
£65 million from the disposal of 
properties which we do not judge can 
deliver an adequate return, and plan 
to invest approximately £70 million in 
our retained assets, targeting growth 
projects. 
The Group continues to proactively 
manage its debt profile. At the 
beginning of the year we completed 
the partial refinancing of £249.5 
million of the 2018 corporate bonds 
and introduced a new revolving bank 
facility which helps to smooth and 
extend the debt maturity profile and 
reduce the cost of borrowings. Debt 
reduction has continued and in 2015 
we reduced net debt by a further 
£84 million, with total net debt at 30 
September 2015 of £2.3 billion.
In March 2015 the Small Business, 
Enterprise and Employment Bill 
received Royal Assent. This heralded 
the future introduction of a Statutory 
Code and an independent Adjudicator 
to regulate the relationship between 
a small number of large pub 
companies, including Enterprise, and 
their tied tenants. Royal Assent has 
brought some closure to a period of 
uncertainty and we remain engaged 
in the consultation process relating to 
the detail of that code. 
Dividend
We continue to use free cash flow 
to meet our debt repayments and 
to fund business growth in order to 
generate value for shareholders by 
sustaining operational progress and to 
deliver the new business strategy. The 
Board believes it is not appropriate to 
resume the payment of dividends at 
this time.
Board of directors
We welcomed Marisa Cassoni as a 
non-executive director on 1 April 2015. 
Marisa brings a wealth of financial 
experience with consumer-facing 
businesses, further strengthening the 
Board. 
Employees and publicans
Our engaged and hard-working 
employees and publicans are critical 
to our success. We conducted our 
second employee engagement survey 
in the year which reported a further 
increase in the overall satisfaction and 
engagement of our team. It is equally 
pleasing that publicans in our leased 
and tenanted estate continue to 
include many award winners. I would 
like to thank them all for their hard 
work during the past year.
Outlook
Trading in the new financial year is in 
line with expectations and we expect 
to maintain the growth momentum 
achieved in the last few years at the 
same time as delivering the longer 
term evolution of our business.

The Group’s pubs compete in the 
drinking out and eating out markets in 
the UK, which together represent an 
opportunity of circa £70bn in revenue. 
In addition to competition from other 
pub groups, we face increasing 
competition from restaurants, 
fast food outlets, and other retail 
operations such as high street coffee 
shops.
The UK pub sector has undergone 
significant changes in the last 
decade amid challenging market 
conditions, evolving customer 
habits and consolidation activities. 
Larger pub operators characterised 
by diversification of locations and 
formats, have been able to take 
advantage of the changing market 
environment and sustain steady 
growth often at the expense of 
smaller operators. 
The UK pub sector has also witnessed 
a steady decrease in sales of beer (by 
volume) over the last three decades 
with volumes of beer sales now 45% 
lower than 15 years ago. Changing 
preferences among consumers, 
increased anti-drink-driving law 
enforcement, the smoking ban and 
the increased availability of canned or 
bottled beer at lower prices in many 
off-licences and supermarkets are the 
reasons commonly credited for this 
decline. In response, many pubs have 
diversified their offerings, particularly 
by (i) offering a wide assortment of 
non-beer and non-alcoholic beverages; 
and (ii) an increased focus on food.
The UK pub sector has three distinct 
business models under which pubs 
are owned and operated: leased and 
tenanted pubs, managed pubs and 
individual (free trade) pubs.
 ■ Leased and tenanted pubs, such 
as those operated by the Group, 
are owned by a pub company or 
brewer but operated by a third 
party tenant or lessee, who pays 
rent to the owner and is normally 
contracted to purchase the majority 
of drinks products (in particular, 
beer) for resale from the owner, 
an arrangement known as the 
“tie”. Tied pub tenants typically 
enjoy a package of support and 
benefits from their landlord as 
part of the tied arrangement, 
whilst the landlord receives rent 
generally made up by an element 
of fixed dry rent and an element of 
variable wet rent (margin from sale 
of drinks). The pubs can also be 
traded without such a purchasing 
commitment, under what is 
commonly called a “free-of-tie” 
basis. 
 ■ Managed pubs are generally 
owned by a pub company or 
brewer and operated by a salaried 
staff employed by the owning 
company. The owner of a managed 
pub is responsible for the operating 
expenses of the pub and generally 
prescribes the entire range of 
products and detail of service 
style. 
 ■ Individual pubs are independently 
owned and operated by a private 
individual. The owner of an 
independent pub is free to decide 
which products to sell and from 
which suppliers to purchase them.
Regulatory and legislation
Over the past few years the market in 
which the Group operates has been 
subject to both positive and negative 
legislative changes. The largest impact 
in the recent past was the smoking 
ban, which heralded a revolution in 
pub culture, and pubs had to react 
to accommodate the changes. The 
latest legislation that represents the 
most significant change the leased 
and tenanted pub sector has ever 
seen is the introduction of a Statutory 
Code and a Market Rent Only 
(MRO) option. Whilst this has now 
passed into primary legislation, the 
Government is currently consulting 
on the secondary legislation, which is 
expected to become effective by June 
2016.

Our business has historically focused 
on leased and tenanted pubs, with 
Enterprise becoming the leading 
operator of leased and tenanted pubs 
in the UK. We have an extensive 
range of tied agreements available 
allowing more choice for publicans. 
We believe our leased and tenanted 
model makes running pub businesses 
more accessible than the purchase of 
a freehold, whilst providing the same 
feelings of ownership, autonomy and 
pride for our publicans that come from 
them building their own successful 
businesses. Together with providing 
the pub, we offer a range of Special 
Commercial or Financial Advantage 
(SCORFA) benefits to our publicans, 
including investment, training, 
business support and other business 
building and cost saving opportunities, 
and we will continue to develop these 
benefits for our tied tenants. When 
we work in partnership to drive sales, 
both Enterprise and the publican will 
benefit from higher volumes and 
potential profit.
However, we are acutely aware of the 
ever changing nature of the market, 
with consumers becoming more 
discerning, resulting in the need for 
publicans to evolve their retail offers 
away from the traditional wet-led 
pub businesses. Given this shift in 
the market, and with the impending 
Statutory Code in the industry, there 
are opportunities for us to reinvigorate 
our strategy.
Our business model has evolved 
and expanded in order to incorporate 
managed house and commercial 
property operating models within our 
strategy. Utilising each of these 
operating models will allow us to 
assess and implement the most 
appropriate approach to deliver the 
optimum value from every asset. We 
have developed a segmentation tool 
that helps us assess where each pub 
would be best positioned in order to 
generate the best returns, and we will 
look to apply this across every asset 
in the estate.

Current operating models
Following the conclusion of the Group’s strategic review 
in the year, we are now executing the strategy in order to 
optimise the returns from all of the assets in our estate. 
As discussed previously, this involves analysing how 
the Group can extract the best returns from each of its 
properties, whether this be through letting the pub on a 
tenancy agreement, directly managing the pub, letting on a 
free-of-tie commercial lease or disposal. 
If the best outcome for a property continues to be as a 
pub, extending the range of operating models available 
to the Group gives optionality and serves to increase the 
ability of the Group to respond more quickly to changing 
markets, consumer needs and regulation.
Enterprise fully recognises that implementing this strategy 
for over 5,000 individual assets will take time, which is 
why we have established a five year plan to transition the 
estate to its future profile.
The core operating model of tied leases and tenancies is currently supplemented by 213 commercial free-of-
tie leases. The commercial leases trade both as pubs, where the Group has assessed it will achieve greater 
returns on a free-of-tie lease basis, or non-pub conversions, such as convenience stores.
Our Strategy
Extending the range of operating models available to the Group gives 
optionality and serves to increase the ability of the Group to respond 
more quickly to changing markets, consumer needs and regulation.

Indicative operating models 
2020
The diagram above and left shows the Group’s current 
estate and how this is operated, by number of properties. 
The positioning of the circles on the axes represents 
where each of the segments predominantly target their 
offer, determining food versus drink and premium versus 
value.
The second diagram above shows our indicative plan for 
2020 following the implementation of our new strategy.
Asset optimisation
 ■ Every asset put to its optimal use
 ■ Returns focused assessment
 ■ Disposals to optimise returns
Our strategy for the estate is to have a broader mix of operating models, offering flexibility in order to 
optimise value. Tied leases and tenancies will still make up the majority of the future estate, but these will 
be supplemented by additional commercial properties and directly controlled managed houses within our 
managed mainstream, managed community and managed expert operating models.

Reinvigorated leased and tenanted
Our leased and tenanted estate continues to be our 
core business, with over half of our pubs expected to 
still be in this segment in 2020. We believe that the 
leased and tenanted pub operating model offers the 
opportunity for entrepreneurs to run their own pub, 
with very little upfront cash investment. With our size 
and scale, we are able to offer both those new to the 
industry and more experienced publicans SCORFA 
benefits which they may not be able to get without our 
support, and we are continually looking at our offer to 
ensure it meets the needs of our publicans and the 
markets they operate within. 
Commercial property
Our commercial property estate has two components, 
the first being pubs and the second being non-pub 
commercial operations. Whilst our assets have originated 
from a pub estate, there are occasions when our returns 
can be optimised by converting the asset to an alternate 
use, such as a convenience store, which we will let under 
a conventional commercial property lease. Additionally 
some pubs are best operated on a commercial free-of-tie 
basis, typically when there is a high proportion of food in 
the offer such that the trade can cover the higher fixed 
rents payable. 
Operating segments 
Over the next five years the Enterprise estate will transition to be 
more than just leased and tenanted pubs. A reinvigorated leased 
and tenanted estate will remain at its core. However, at one end 
of the property spectrum, the Group intends to hold some assets 
as commercial properties, whilst at the other end the Group 
will directly manage the operation of some pubs within three 
managed house operating models.

Heading One
Managed expert
We have some pubs in the estate where we believe there 
is significant upside potential which has yet to be realised. 
We recognise that this is often due to the pub needing a 
specialist offering from an experienced operator in order 
to release the optimum value.  For these sites, we are 
looking to partner with some of the most experienced 
operators in the pub industry in order to tap into their 
expertise.  Our first managed expert partnership, with 
Rupert Clevely as Hippo Inns Limited, opened its first site 
in Forest Hill, London just after the year end, on 8 October 
2015, following a transformational capital investment 
project.
Managed mainstream
Bermondsey Pub Company
Our mainstream managed operating model within 
Bermondsey Pub Company targets a mix of food and drink 
sales across two retail propositions, Friends and Family 
and Meeting House. Friends and Family works best in 
our larger sites that are at the heart of their communities, 
and delivers a welcoming mid-market offering to attract 
those looking for a great local pub to have a quality meal 
and drinks. Meeting House pubs are generally in urban 
locations, and hope to attract a passing trade, as well as 
being an excellent place for locals to catch up.
Managed community
The Craft Union Pub Company
The Craft Union Pub Company extends our own Beacon 
offering, and aims to be the pub of choice for locals to 
meet up and watch their favourite sports. These pubs are 
generally smaller with no food offering, but have excellent 
audio visual equipment, with sports and entertainment 
being footfall drivers.

Our Strategy
Enterprise has defined a four-stage process through which all of the 
assets in the estate will pass at the appropriate point over the next 
few years. This is outlined below, and will ultimately ensure the smooth 
and effective transition of our estate of today into our estate of 2020.
Aim
To comprehensively understand the consumer 
marketplace in which each of our pubs is located 
and determine which retail propositions most 
effectively meet the needs of those consumers.
This uses the segmentation tool that has been 
developed for Enterprise to plot where each pub 
should be in the food/drink and premium/value 
offering space.

Progress
So far the tool has been trialled to support the 
choice of retail offer for many of our managed 
pubs. It is now being rolled out to the wider 
leased and tenanted field teams, who are all 
being fully trained how to optimise its use. This 
will identify, and focus on, those pubs where 
there is the greatest differential between current 
and optimal operating performance.
Aim
To match each of our pubs with the retail 
proposition that should enable its success. 
Taking the recommendations from the 
segmentation tool, the proposed pub offer is 
then matched up with the most  
suitable retail offer.
Progress
It is very early stages, but for our managed 
houses indications show that generally, where 
we have used the segmentation process to 
determine the selected retail offer, the site is 
performing well.

Aim
To select the best operating model to support 
the delivery of the chosen retail proposition.
This considers which operating model can 
deliver the best returns for a particular retail 
proposition in a particular site, and looks at a 
variety of measures to determine the correct 
model.
Aim
To implement the operating model and retail 
proposition to deliver the greatest value from 
each asset.
This is about executing the plan for each 
individual asset at the optimum time for the 
Group to deliver the greatest returns.
Progress
The Group endeavours to select the correct 
operating model and is using a recently 
established Asset Optimisation Panel, which 
includes representation from all areas of the 
business, to apply a consistent and thorough 
evaluation process.
Progress
There has been some progress on execution 
in the year, evident in the growth of both the 
commercial property and managed house 
businesses. We fully expect this to continue, 
such that we can achieve our vision for 2020.

Heading One
Maintaining growth 
momentum
We are pleased to report our full 
year results for the year ended 30 
September 2015, during which period 
we have delivered EBITDA before 
exceptional items of £296 million, 
down £6 million on the comparative 
period primarily as a result of 
planned asset disposals. Profit before 
taxation, excluding exceptional 
items, increased by £1 million to 
£122 million as lower interest costs, 
resulting from debt reduction, have 
offset the decline in EBITDA. With a 
lower effective tax rate the increased 
profits before taxation deliver adjusted 
earnings per share, before exceptional 
items, of 19.4p, an increase of 2.1% 
on the previous year. 
The earnings growth momentum 
has been delivered through an 
improvement in like-for-like net 
income achieved from our leased, 
tenanted and free-of-tie estate. We 
have grown our like-for-like net income 
in every quarter of the year with the 
full year growing by 0.8%. We are 
pleased with this outcome particularly 
as the previous year, which included 
the FIFA World Cup, represented a 
strong comparative period. As with 
last year, all geographies across our 
estate reported year-on-year stability 
of income, but it was the South 
where the growth was once again 
most significant. Trading in the 661 
pubs based in the Greater London 
region remained particularly strong 
with like-for-like net income up by 
3.1%. We have a strong core of our 
estate trading very well with the 
top 90% (4,532 pubs), in terms of 
income earned, showing like-for-like 
net income growth of 2.6% on the 
previous year.
Like-for-like net income growth has 
been derived from increased rental 
income and growth in the net income 
from the sale of beer and other 
products to our publicans. The strong 
rental income performance is driven 
by returns from our capital investment 
supplemented by reductions in 
the level of business failures and a 
return to rental increases achieved 
at rent reviews, particularly in the 
South, which provide reassurance 
with regard to the stabilisation of 
trading for us and our publicans. The 
growth in net income from the sale 
of beer and other products reflects 
a “wet-led” business revival fuelled 
by the provision of deeper discounts 
to our publicans complemented by 
the availability of the widest range 
of product choice in the market, 
including craft and local beers.

Chief Executive’s Review
Supporting our publicans
We have seen an improvement in 
consumer confidence and the broader 
economic environment through the 
year which has provided a more 
stable backdrop for our publicans 
and this has been enhanced by the 
successful implementation of our 
many initiatives aimed at enhancing 
publican profitability. The continued 
provision of discounted services such 
as WiFi, sports TV packages and food 
offerings, combined with training 
programmes and product marketing 
services, are aimed at assisting 
publicans to grow sales and reduce 
costs.
We also continue to offer direct 
financial assistance where it is 
deemed appropriate, to aid publicans 
to sustain their businesses through 
“In May of this year 
we announced 
our new strategy 
for the business, 
which enables 
us to unlock the 
embedded value 
in every one of  
our assets”

more difficult trading periods, and 
have spent £6 million in the year 
(2014: £7 million) on such assistance. 
As a consequence of the successful 
application of this support framework 
we have further reduced the level 
of business failures, by 18%, during 
the year compared to the previous 
year. We actively monitor our estate 
for the signs of potential business 
failure and proactively manage the 
process of publican change when it is 
unavoidable. Approximately 8% (2014: 
9%) of the estate has seen a change 
of publican due to failure during the 
financial year but more significantly 
only 2% of the estate (2014: 3%) has 
seen a change due to an unplanned 
failure rather than a managed 
transition. 
During the next year we will move 
into a new regulatory environment 
with the expected introduction of 
the Market Rent Only (MRO) option. 
While this is likely to present some 
challenges to the stability of the tied 
estate it may also offer opportunities 
for us to re-evaluate the optimal use 
of each asset and its retail proposition 
to enhance shareholder value in 
accordance with our strategic plans. 
Optimising returns  
from the estate
Our capital re-investment strategy 
is an important contributor to the 
delivery of like-for-like net income 
growth. We actively identify 
opportunities to invest in our estate, 
often alongside our publicans, in 
order to enhance returns from our 
assets by providing local communities 
and consumers with well invested, 
attractive retail offerings. During the 
year we re-invested £69 million (2014: 
£66 million) in our estate with 44% 
(2014: 41%) directed toward income 
enhancing opportunities. We target 
Return on Investment (ROI) in excess 
of 15% on our growth oriented capital 
expenditure and have achieved an 
average ROI of 19% on such schemes 
completed in the last 12 months. 
We are using market analysis to 
identify the optimum use of our 
assets and to identify the priorities for 
capital investment. The segmentation 
analysis applies an understanding of 
demand and supply characteristics 
of the local market for every 
property to identify the optimum 
retail proposition for the property 
and the most appropriate operating 
model to deliver that proposition. The 
segmentation analysis is increasingly 
used to identify assets that are 
under-performing and which have 
challenging local market conditions 
such that disposal becomes the 
optimum outcome so that cash can 
be realised and re-invested in the 
retained estate. During the year we 
disposed of 260 (2014: 230) assets 
realising £75 million (2014: £73 
million) of net proceeds. 
Enhancing  
shareholder value
In May of this year we announced 
our new strategy for the business, 
which enables us to unlock the 
embedded value in every one of 
our assets and ensures that we are 
ready to respond to the potential 
implications of impending regulatory 
changes. The strategy aims to bring 
about an evolution of our business 
model, utilising consumer insight, to 
develop a plan for every pub in order 
to maximise value for shareholders. 
We are pleased with the progress we 
have made with the implementation 
of this strategic plan.
Implementation of our new strategy 
will further strengthen the highly cash 
generative nature of our business. 
In the current year we delivered 
£265 million (2014: £278 million) of 
cash flow from operating activities 
which, after net interest costs, yields 
£108 million (2014: £111 million) of 
free cash flow. Our re-investment 
strategy of funding capital investment 
requirements broadly through the 
disposal of under-performing assets 
leaves free cash flow available for 
allocation. 
We operate a disciplined approach to 
the allocation of this free cash flow. 
Currently the most appropriate use 
of our free cash flow is to meet our 
debt repayment obligations, primarily 
through the scheduled amortisation of 
the Unique securitisation notes.
Outlook
Trading in the first six weeks of the 
new financial year has been in line 
with our expectations and continues 
to maintain the growth momentum 
of last year. We aim to deliver positive 
like-for-like net income in our leased, 
tenanted and free-of-tie estate for the 
full financial year.

Chief Executive’s Review
Regulatory 
During 2014, the then Government 
published its proposals, contained 
within the Small Business, Enterprise 
and Employment (SBEE) Bill, to 
introduce a Statutory Code of 
Practice, to be overseen by an 
independent Adjudicator, for all 
companies with over 500 pubs 
operating under tied leased and 
tenancy agreements in England 
and Wales. In November 2014, the 
proposals were amended to include 
a tenant’s right, under certain limited 
circumstances, to change the 
freely-negotiated commercial terms 
of their agreement to a new MRO 
contract. This MRO option enables 
some occupational tenants to elect 
to opt-out of the supply tie at certain 
points or after certain exceptional 
events during the term of their lease 
agreement and therefore occupy the 
premises on a standard commercial 
property lease, paying rent only. In 
the event that a tenant elected to 
invoke this option, whilst our income 
derived from the supply of tied drinks 
products would be partially offset by 
increases in rent, it is possible that 
our total income from that property 
would be adversely affected.
The SBEE Bill received Royal 
Assent on 26 March 2015 and 
has therefore become primary 
legislation. Further work is now 
taking place to finalise the detail 
of the new regulatory regime. The 
Government has advertised the 
position of the Adjudicator and it has 
launched the first tranche (of two) of 
its Consultation on the wording of 
the statutory Pubs Code, which is 
expected to come into effect on 26 
May 2016. We continue to participate 
in the process to develop the Pubs 
Code and associated guidance 
and shall respond formally to both 
tranches of the Consultation. 
We already operate effective policies 
and procedures in order to satisfy 
the existing industry code of practice 
framework and we have recently 
recruited additional compliance 
resource to ensure that we satisfy 
any additional requirements of the 
statutory Pubs Code.
While the unintended consequences 
of the SBEE Act will only become 
clear over time, we are prepared 
for the implementation of the 
legislation and its potential impact 
on our business. The impact will 
be phased over five years from the 
implementation of the Act, as MRO 
events are largely expected to arise 
through the cycle of five yearly rent 
reviews and renewals. 
Subject to the date of implementation 
of the MRO option, we anticipate 
that in our 2016 financial year we 
will have approximately 200 events 
that may potentially constitute an 
MRO event under the new regulatory 
regime and some 600 such events 
per year thereafter. We have already 
started to address outstanding rent 
reviews and renewal discussions 
with publicans and have introduced 
strategies to mitigate potential MRO 
risks, as this often enables us to 
make assets available for alternative 
operating models where our returns 
can be optimised. Resolution can take 
many forms and can include renewals 
where the MRO risk has not been 
removed but has most likely been 
delayed until the next trigger event, 
usually five years later. 
In our management of these 
potential MRO events it is clear 
that many publicans recognise the 
value of working with us as our 
partner and appreciate the support 
and operational simplicity the tied 
tenanted model offers. 
Additionally they recognise the 
increased risk to their business 
associated with MRO as their 
operational gearing is significantly 
higher and their working capital 
funding needs increased.
OPERATIONAL & 
STRATEGIC REVIEW 
Our pubs operate in a dynamic 
marketplace. We have set out to 
improve our capability in retailing, 
developing our understanding and 
usage of consumer and competitor 
insights to help us to identify the 
most appropriate retail proposition for 
each pub, to inform our subsequent 
investment decisions and to 
determine the appropriate operating 
model with which to optimise the 
pub’s performance and deliver greater 
shareholder value as a result.
Reinvigorated tied 
tenanted business
Against a background of fragile 
economic recovery, intense 
competition and legislative 
uncertainty, the performance of our 
leased and tenanted pub estate 
has been transformed over the last 
two years, demonstrating improved 
underlying stability and growth 
momentum. This has been achieved 
as a result of the quality of the 
publicans who occupy our pubs, 
and the hard work of our operational 
teams who help our publicans 
grow their sales and improve their 
profitability. We have continued 
to extend the range of goods and 
services available to our publicans, 
to help them reduce costs, and were 
pleased to commence a strategic 
partnership with the Booker Group 
to provide high quality food services 
to Enterprise publicans at extremely 
competitive prices.

Enterprise Inns AR2015 Front.indd   14 07/12/2015   17:24:42 24341 .04    7 December 2015 5:10 PM    Proof 7
We have pursued a sales-led recovery, 
ensuring that we provide an extensive 
range of drinks, comprising over 
1,745 beers, lagers and ciders, and 
utilising discounts to ensure that 
the drinks offer in our pubs is both 
attractive and competitive. This has 
been demonstrably successful in 
our Beacon tenancies, and it has 
been encouraging to see this sales-
led recovery translated into like-for-
like growth in rental income during 
2015, a key indicator of stability 
which demonstrates the improving 
prospects and profitability of our 
pubs.
Our support and proactive 
intervention in businesses facing 
financial difficulty has also led to the 
further reduction in business failures, 
and to the majority of the changes 
of publican associated with those 
failures being managed in a planned 
and less costly manner. We disposed 
of 260 individual pubs during the year 
that, in the main, we did not believe 
could be sustainably profitable in the 
long-term, ensuring that we maintain 
our focus on those assets and 
businesses where we can generate 
optimal returns.
We have developed, with the support 
of LEK Consulting and Deloitte, a 
comprehensive segmentation model 
which allows our operational teams 
to assess the supply and demand 
dynamics of the local markets in 
which every one of our pubs is 
located. We have now started to 
utilise these consumer insights to 
inform recruitment and investment 
decisions, and to determine the 
optimal retail format in which each of 
our pubs could potentially operate.
The forthcoming secondary 
legislation, which is due to be 
implemented during 2016, has created 
uncertainty as to the returns that 
might be generated from some pubs 
on certain types of agreement, and is 
likely to lead to some pubs becoming 
unattractive to the Group. We are 
unlikely to invest in businesses on 
leases where our returns are unclear, 
and we will only grant long-term, tied 
leases in exceptional circumstances. 
We remain committed to the 
successful partnerships that can 
be created between the landlord 
company and tenant. Their success is 
clearly evident within the tied model 
operated by Enterprise, and we will 
be re-launching the Enterprise tied 
offer prior to the implementation of 
the new legislation. This will ensure 
that every Enterprise publican 
understands the merits of the tied 
agreement under which they occupy 
their pub, and can accurately and 
comprehensively compare their 
agreement with that which would be 
available to them if they were to elect 
to take up the MRO option.
Expanded  
managed business
Our strategy to build capability in 
the direct management of pubs is 
progressing well, and while it remains 
early days, we are pleased that 
the majority of the 35 pubs trading 
in this model are performing well 
and in line with our expectations. 
Greater operational control, complete 
transparency of all sales and cost 
lines and the use of consumer 
insights are giving us greater certainty 
over the returns we can generate 
from these pubs, together with the 
opportunity to leverage best practice 
across the wider Enterprise estate. 
We have demonstrated how such 
attributes can be applied to great 
effect in smaller, wet-led pubs in 
our Beacon estate over the last few 
years, and are now applying these 
disciplines more widely.
Furthermore, we now have the 
opportunity to occupy our properties 
at the expiry of a lease agreement, 
where previously we might have 
renewed such agreements regardless 
of whether the performance of 
the pub was being optimised. 
This approach enables us to take 
possession of underperforming assets 
and allows us to create additional 
value for our shareholders.

Chief Executive’s Review
Recognising that the operation of 
managed houses requires different 
skills and capabilities from our 
historical leased and tenanted 
business, we have developed three 
managed house operating models 
that are designed to secure maximum 
operational control while mitigating 
the execution risks associated with 
such operating models.
Managed expert
We have developed a partnership 
“Expert” model whereby we can 
work with expert managed house 
operators in order to utilise their retail 
flair and capability in pubs with retail 
complexity and exceptional profit 
potential, thereby optimising the 
value of such sites. In this model, the 
operational resource and expertise are 
provided by our retail partners.
Our first variant of the Expert model 
is a partnership with Rupert Clevely, 
founder of Geronimo Inns and 
most recently with Youngs & Co, to 
operate premium, mixed food and 
drink outlets in central London in a 
subsidiary called Hippo Inns.
Hippo opened its first pub, The Signal 
in Forest Hill, on 8 October 2015. The 
pub is trading well, in line with our 
expectations, offering craft beers, 
ales, select wines and cocktails 
alongside high quality, well-priced 
food. We have identified a further four 
sites which will convert to the Hippo 
trading format over the next year.
We are aiming to establish, at least, 
a further three Expert partnerships 
during 2016, with the objective of 
having around 8 to 12 sites in total 
operating in the Expert model by 30 
September 2016. The experience 
we have gained in working with 
Rupert in the design and execution 
of the model gives us confidence 
that this approach provides us with 
the optimum means with which to 
operate sites with exceptional profit 
potential.
We also recognise that we require 
tailored agreements which suit 
the particular circumstances of 
our operating partners, and have 
therefore designed three variants of 
the commercial agreement to allow 
us to partner with both start-up and 
established businesses and to enable 
us to work alongside other investors.
Bermondsey  
Pub Company
Fourteen of our current managed 
houses are operated by our 
Bermondsey Pub Company. We have 
recruited and resourced our own team 
and are using our segmentation work 
to identify those pubs into which we 
can most effectively install a managed 
operating model utilising one of two 
preferred choices of retail proposition. 
As demonstrated by our experience 
in existing sites, this managed model 
is best suited to a mainstream offer 
which has a mix of food and wet 
sales. 
We currently have eight of the 
Bermondsey Pub Company sites 
operating in our “Meeting House” 
format, an upper mid-market, mixed 
food and drink offer. Four of these 
sites are in London and the South 
East. Our “Friends and Family” format 
is currently operating six sites in the 
mid-market, mixed food and drink 
segment, predominantly in the North.
Our average capital investment in 
these sites has been £159,000 to 
date, and the sites are currently 
achieving average weekly takings 
of £11,000. It remains early days for 
many of these investments as we 
build sales and capability, but we 
expect to deliver returns in excess of 
our 15% ROI hurdle rate across this 
estate.
We have recently recruited an 
Operations Director for Bermondsey 
Pub Company who is formerly 
of Mitchells & Butlers and an 
experienced multi-site operator 
who will ensure that these two 
trading formats are tightly defined 
and executed, and able to evolve 
as market opportunities arise. We 
anticipate operating approximately 
25 to 35 sites in Bermondsey Pub 
Company by 30 September 2016, and 
have identified a pipeline of suitable 
conversions to meet this aspiration.
The Craft Union  
Pub Company
In addition to the 14 managed 
sites operated by Bermondsey 
Pub Company we are currently 
operating 21 managed sites within 
The Craft Union Pub Company, 
which has developed a wet-led, 
good value, community pub offer 
operating in predominantly urban 
and neighbourhood locations. This 
model allows us to attract the 
entrepreneurial flair of great 
managers, who seek the opportunity 
to enjoy the support and protection 
of our managed business, whilst 
retaining some freedom to co-evolve 
our retail offer in order to best meet 
the needs of their local communities.
Conversion to this trading format 
is relatively straightforward and we 
are pleased with the performance 
of these outlets to date. Capital 
investment upon conversion has 
averaged £105,000, with a significant 
proportion of the expenditure directed 
16
Enterprise Inns AR2015 Front.indd   16 07/12/2015   17:24:45 24341 .04    7 December 2015 5:10 PM    Proof 7
towards high quality installations 
of sports-viewing audio visual 
equipment, and we are currently 
generating average weekly takings 
of £7 ,000 and returns on investment 
ahead of our 15% ROI hurdle rate.
We have identified a strong pipeline 
of future conversions and anticipate 
operating 60 to 80 outlets in this 
model by 30 September 2016. 
Quality commercial 
property portfolio
Where appropriate, our high quality, 
well-located, estate of sites are 
suitable for letting under standard 
commercial property agreements. 
The capital expenditure requirement 
in this estate is low, and the overhead 
required to manage the portfolio is 
extremely low.
Under such agreements, our 
predominant source of income 
is rent, paid quarterly in advance 
and reviewed every five years on 
an upwards-only basis, and the 
properties are let on a fully repairing 
and insuring basis, in common 
with standard commercial property 
agreements. The majority of such 
sites continue to operate as pubs, 
and the operators may choose to 
procure their drinks requirements 
from us, taking advantage of the 
extensive range we offer. We now 
have four pubs within our commercial 
property estate operating on turnover-
related rental agreements where 
we receive a fixed monthly rent and 
a supplementary share of turnover, 
allowing the Group to share in the 
upside of sales growth in such sites. 
We have grown our commercial 
property estate from 185 sites at 
12 May 2015 to 213 sites at 30 
September 2015, adding a net 28 
sites at an average rent of £89,000 
during this period, demonstrating the 
high quality of the assets converted, 
and the quality and covenant strength 
of the occupational tenants in situ. 
The average rent in the whole 
commercial property estate has 
therefore increased from £53,000 in 
May 2015 to £56,000 by the year-end. 
This estate is currently 100% let with 
94% on substantive agreements with 
an average length of lease of 18 years 
and average length of agreement 
remaining of 13 years. The quality 
of tenure in this estate is high, with 
minimal overdue balances or bad debt 
history.
Our total income (annualised) in the 
commercial property estate is £12 
million, and the estate is currently 
valued at £142 million, implying a 
yield of 8.4% or a multiple of 12 times 
earnings.
We anticipate growing our 
commercial property estate to 300-
350 sites by 30 September 2016, and 
we are committed to maintaining the 
high quality of the characteristics of 
the properties in this estate. When we 
believe that the scale and economics 
of the portfolio are optimal, we 
hope to be in a position to secure 
the potential benefits of conversion 
to REIT status, were the Board to 
determine that it was in the best 
interests of shareholders to make 
such election at the relevant time.
Where publicans who are currently 
on tied agreements transfer to 
the MRO model, the sites will be 
managed by our commercial property 
team, but will only be transferred to 
our commercial property estate on 
a permanent basis if they meet our 
strict quality criteria, in order that the 
underlying quality of the estate is 
not compromised. Sites that fail to 
meet the quality criteria, and where 
we believe that the MRO outcome is 
unattractive, will be run as commercial 
properties until such time as an 
opportunity arises to generate optimal 
returns through conversion to an 
alternative model. 
Enhancing our team
Our continuing operational 
momentum is due, in no small part, 
to the quality and tenacity of the 
Enterprise team. While our strategy 
requires new skills and capabilities, 
we are committed to developing and 
redeploying the necessary talent from 
within, wherever possible, in order to 
facilitate the effective execution of our 
plans.
However, we have identified the 
requirement to recruit new expertise, 
particularly in such areas as retail 
operations, concept development, 
change programme management and 
systems and financial reporting. We 
are very pleased to have been able 
to attract high quality, experienced 
recruits into all of these areas in order 
to underpin the effective delivery 
of our strategy and drive returns to 
shareholders.
As our strategic execution grows in 
pace and scale, we expect to grow 
our central overhead in a disciplined, 
but forward-looking manner, and 
anticipate costs to increase from £37 
million to £39 million in 2016, with 
similar increases in each of 2017 and 
2018.

EBITDA before exceptional items for 
the year ended 30 September 2015 
is £296 million, £6 million lower than 
the previous year primarily due to 
disposals of underperforming assets. 
Like-for-like net income represents 
like-for-like pub level profits from 
our leased, tenanted and free-of-tie 
estate, defined as pre-exceptional 
EBITDA stated before property 
costs of £29 million, administrative 
expenses of £37 million, unallocated 
other costs and income of £4 million 
and excluding £4 million of net 
income relating to disposals or non-
licensed premises. We have seen our 
like-for-like net income for the year 
grow to £362 million (2014: £359 
million). The growth in our like-for-like 
net income has been derived from a 
£1 million increase in rental income, 
a £1 million increase in income 
from beer supply as pricing and mix 
benefits, net of discounts, have offset 
volume decline and £1 million saving 
on discretionary support costs. 
Pre-exceptional net finance costs 
of £158 million are £7 million lower 
than the previous year as a result of 
our strategy of debt reduction, the 
primary savings being a significantly 
reduced average drawn debt on the 
bank facilities and reduced costs in 
relation to the Unique securitisation 
notes following scheduled 
repayments totalling £71 million 
during the year. This equates to an 
average interest rate in the year of 
6.7% (2014: 6.7%).
The effective tax rate on the pre-
exceptional trading profits arising in 
the year was 20.5%, lower than the 
previous year (2014: 21 .5%) primarily 
due to a reduction in the statutory 
corporation tax rate.
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 
19.4p, was up 2.1% on the previous 
year. Basic EPS was a loss in the 
year of 13.0p compared to earnings 
of 5.9p in the previous year, driven 
predominantly by the impact of the 
annual property valuation. 
Exceptional items
Total pre-tax exceptional charges 
are £193 million (2014: £85 million) 
comprising a charge of £26 million 
(2014: £nil) in respect of debt 
refinancing charges; a £163 million 
(2014: £75 million) charge in respect 
of a reduction in the value of the 
estate of which £120 million (2014: 
£42 million) arose from the annual 
valuation exercise and £43 million 
(2014: £33 million) arose from the 
revaluation of assets on transfer to 
non-current assets held for sale; 
an £8 million (2014: £7 million) 
charge relating to goodwill allocated 
to disposals; a £nil (2014: £10 
million) provision for a settlement 
charge in respect of our pension 
obligations; £1 million (2014: £3 
million) of exceptional administrative 
charges and £nil (2014: £2 million) of 
exceptional net finance costs. These 
exceptional charges are partly offset 
by the profit on disposal of property, 
plant and equipment (before goodwill 
allocation) of £5 million (2014: £12 
million). 
The exceptional tax credit of £31 
million (2014: £20 million) primarily 
relates to the deferred tax credits on 
the movement in the valuation of the 
pub estate.

The annual revaluation resulted in 
a write down of the total estate 
of £101 million or 2.7% (2014: £75 
million or 1 .9%) of which £120 million 
(2014: £42 million) was charged 
to the income statement and £19 
million credited (2014: £33 million 
charged) to other comprehensive 
income. Each year we undertake 
a full revaluation of the total asset 
portfolio using a combination of 
internal and external qualified valuers. 
This year we appointed a new valuer, 
Colliers International, to value the 
entire Unique estate. Previously this 
estate was largely valued internally 
with a representative sample of 200 
assets valued by Christie & Co. The 
basis of valuation remains consistent 
with previous years but with the 
appointment of Colliers, 92% of the 
total Group estate is now valued 
externally compared to 47% in 
previous years. 
Balance sheet
Our balance sheet remains strong 
with a total net asset value of 
£1 .35 billion (2014: £1 .40 billion). 
Gross property assets are the most 
significant assets in the balance sheet 
and are recorded at £3.7 billion (2014: 
£3.9 billion) of which 92% (2014: 
47%) is valued on an annual basis by 
external, independent valuers. Group 
net debt includes the most significant 
liabilities in the balance sheet and has 
reduced to £2.3 billion (2014: £2.4 
billion) during the year. 
The share price at 30 September 
2015 of £1 .08 (2014: £1 .24), which 
equates to an equity value of £541 
million, compares to a net asset value 
per share of £2.70 (2014: £2.80). The 
differential between net asset value 
and market value reflects current 
market sentiment but does not, we 
believe, reflect the underlying value of 
the Group.
Cash flow
Net cash flow from operating 
activities at £265 million (2014: £278 
million), was down primarily due 
to the reduction in pre-exceptional 
operating profits of £6 million, a cash 
outflow of £4 million from working 
capital and a £5 million increase in 
tax paid in respect of a settlement 
agreement with HMRC regarding a 
long outstanding tax matter. 
Net cash flows from investing 
activities generated £6 million in the 
year (2014: £7 million) as disposal 
proceeds of £75 million (2014: £73 
million) were used to fund capital 
investment of £69 million (2014: £66 
million).
Financing cash flows primarily reflect 
interest paid of £158 million (2014: 
£167 million), net loan repayments 
of £77 million (2014: £129 million) 
and £28 million paid on the bank and 
bond refinancing completed during 
the year. In addition, the Group has 
paid £5 million during the year (2014: 
£nil) to buy back shares in order to 
satisfy outstanding share awards. No 
Unique securitisation notes have been 
purchased and cancelled in the year 
(2014: £10 million). 
Capital structure
We have a long-term, secure, flexible 
and tax efficient financing structure 
comprising bank borrowings, 
securitised notes and corporate 
bonds. We are a cash generative 
business and have used excess 
cash flows to reduce debt. During 
the current financial year we have 
reduced net debt to £2.3 billion (2014: 
£2.4 billion) and at the year end we 
have property assets, with an up 
to date value in our balance sheet 
at £3.7 billion (2014: £3.9 billion), 
representing a loan to value ratio of 
63% (2014: 62%).
To align our capital structure with our 
operational strategy we are today 
launching a proposal to the holders of 
our Enterprise corporate bonds which 
will align the permitted business 
within the bond definitions to facilitate 
our new business strategy. In addition 
we are in the process of reviewing 
the Unique securitisation structure 
to identify enhancements that could 
be proposed which would further 
facilitate the delivery of our strategic 
objectives. 
Corporate and  
convertible bonds 
As at 30 September 2015 we had 
£1,125 million (2014: £1,125 million) 
of secured corporate bonds which are 
non-amortising, secured against ring-
fenced portfolios of freehold pubs and 
attract fixed interest rates averaging 
approximately 6.4% (2014: 6.5%). 
On 7 October 2014, we completed 
a partial refinancing of our 2018 
corporate bonds lowering interest 
cost and extending debt maturity. 
Prior to the refinancing, £600 million 
of secured corporate bonds due in 
2018 were outstanding with a coupon 
of 6.5%. We received and accepted 
tender instructions for £249.5 million 
of these bonds at a cash purchase 
price of 108.75% of their principal 
amount. In connection with this partial 
refinancing we issued a new £249.5 
million secured corporate bond 
due in October 2023 at a coupon 
of 6.0%, resulting in a reduction of 
the corporate bonds due in 2018 
to £350.5 million. The new issue 
benefits from a security package on 
substantially the same terms as the 
2018 bonds.

Financial Review
In addition to the corporate bonds, 
we have an unsecured seven year 
convertible bond that was issued in 
September 2013 for gross proceeds 
of £97 million. The convertible bond 
has a coupon rate of 3.5% and is 
convertible at a share price of £1 .91 
into 50.8 million ordinary shares.
Bank borrowings 
At 30 September 2015 our drawn 
bank borrowings net of Enterprise 
cash were £50 million (2014: £46 
million), broadly in line with the 
previous year as cash generated 
from the business has been used to 
meet scheduled amortisation of the 
securitised notes and to fund the 
costs of the 2018 bond refinancing. 
On 7 October 2014 we replaced 
our bank facilities with a new £138 
million non-amortising revolving credit 
facility which is available through 
to September 2018. This extended 
the maturity of our previous facility 
and benefits from improved terms, 
simplified covenants and lower pricing 
with a new interest rate of 300 basis 
points above LIBOR. 
The total cash outflow arising from 
the bank and bond refinancing was 
£28 million, being £22 million in 
respect of the repurchase premium 
on the bond, which has been charged 
as an exceptional item, and total fees 
and disbursements of £6 million, of 
which £4 million has been charged 
as an exceptional item and £2 million 
deferred over the life of the new debt 
instruments. 
Securitised notes 
During the year we have repaid 
scheduled amortisation of £71 million 
of the Unique class A3 and A4 
securitised notes, leaving £1 .2 billion 
outstanding at the year end. The notes 
amortise over a period to 2032 and 
attract interest rates of between 5.7% 
and 7.4%. At 30 September 2015 the 
Group was £74 million ahead of the 
amortisation schedule of the class 
A securitised notes through early 
repayment and market purchases. 
Although we have not purchased 
any notes during the current year, 
we still remain one year ahead of 
our amortisation schedule which will 
require us to make payments of £74 
million during 2016, £78 million in 
2017 and £82 million in 2018.
We intend to issue a trading update 
to coincide with our Annual General 
Meeting on 11 February 2016.

Corporate Social Responsibility
We remain committed to operating our business in an ethical and 
responsible manner and to manage those responsibilities effectively.
We continue to evolve our Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) agenda 
and recognise that it can play a 
significant part in recruitment, leading 
and influencing our publicans as well 
as our own people and operations, 
more so now that we have adopted 
new operating models and are able to 
more closely translate our own values 
onto the retail side of the business.
This report does not contain 
information about any policies of the 
Group in relation to human rights 
issues since it is not considered 
necessary for an understanding of the 
development, performance or position 
of the Group’s business activities. 
We have continued to make positive 
progress on our CSR agenda during 
the year and are recognised by 
inclusion in the FTSE4Good Index 
which is designed to objectively 
measure the performance of 
companies that meet globally 
recognised corporate responsibility 
standards.
Our CSR delivery framework is based 
on strategic drivers which ensure we 
make a real and sustainable difference 
to our people and publicans and the 
communities in which our pubs are 
located. These drivers are community, 
people, publicans, responsible 
retailing and environment.
Community
With over 5,000 pubs across 
England and Wales, Enterprise has 
the opportunity to touch a sizeable 
number of local communities, offering 
employment opportunities and 
amenities that meet the needs of 
local people. The most effective way 
to do this is through partnerships with 
our publicans, as they are the people 
that live within the communities 
and should work at building lasting 
relationships within the local areas, 
and remaining sensitive to local 
issues. The best pubs provide a 
friendly, safe, inclusive and controlled 
environment, and make a positive 
contribution to the local population. 
We work with publicans, local 
authorities and other local community 
interest groups to ensure that 
licensing hours and conditions 
attached to pub premises licenses 
are appropriate and take account of 
the opportunities and interests of 
all parties. Through our membership 
of the British Beer and Pub 
Association (BBPA), we engage with 
Government departments to promote 
understanding of, and compliance 
with, the licensing regime. Each of 
the pubs we own or operate is unique 
and we and our publicans aim to 
provide a distinctive service to attract 
a broad range of customers and 
community groups. All pubs aim to 
create a congenial atmosphere and to 
promote the prevention of crime and 
disorder, the preservation of public 
safety, prevention of public nuisance 
and protection of children from harm 
and must operate so that commercial 
initiatives do not override the core 
values.
Pub is The Hub
We continue to support the 
philosophy and ethos of The Prince of 
Wales’s ‘Pub is The Hub’ campaign, 
encouraging rural publicans to 
diversify and deliver a wide range of 
services to the communities they 
serve. This helps to secure the longer 
term success of the pub and to keep 
it at the heart of local communities. 
A number of our publicans have 
developed a range of community 
services including village shops and 
community cafes or operate as sub 
post offices where there have been 
branch closures and loss of local 
amenities. 
Supporting industry trade 
bodies and associations
We are committed to supporting 
a number of key trade bodies and 
associations including the BBPA, the 
leading body representing Britain’s 
brewers and pub companies who 
strive to promote and protect one 
of the nation’s most iconic and 
important industries. We work with 
the Federation of Licensed Victuallers 
Associations (FLVA), an organisation 
looking after the business interests 
of self-employed licensees in the 
licensed trade. The British Institute 
of Innkeeping (BII) is the professional 
body for the licensed retail sector 
with charitable status and a remit to 
raise professional standards. We work 
closely with the BII on a variety of 
initiatives that support our publicans 
and the industry; the FLVA and BII 
attend our Recruitment Super Events 
and entepriselive event to discuss the 
benefits of membership with both 
potential and existing publicans. We 
assist all new Enterprise publicans 
with their first year’s subscription to 
either the BII or FLVA.

Community Heroes
Our Community Heroes Awards 
were established four years ago to 
recognise those publicans who make 
a real difference to the communities 
they serve. The awards are about 
going above and beyond the call of 
duty and having a positive impact at 
the heart of the community.
This is a long-term project for the 
Company and we are investing £1 
million over a ten year period to fund 
our Community Heroes Awards. We 
have changed the award structure and 
prize level tiers this year in order to 
more widely recognise the fantastic 
impact so many of our publicans are 
having on their communities. All of 
the many nominations for the awards 
make a significant and positive impact 
on the communities they serve. The 
national annual award winner now 
receives £6,000 to spend on local 
initiatives, the national runner up 
receives £5,000, with the other 52 
regional finalists each receiving up 
to £3,000 towards local causes and 
activities of their choice. 
Charity
Enterprise is committed to supporting 
and encouraging our employees to 
give something back by leading or 
participating in charitable events. 
The Group operates a charity 
committee consisting of employee 
representatives. One of the roles of 
the committee is to agree Enterprise 
donations to sponsor employees in 
their individual challenges. Some 
examples of these challenges include 
the London to Paris bike ride, Cancer 
Research UK’s Race for Life and the 
Great Birmingham Run. We have 
donated a total of £3,000 over the 
course of the year for these events.
The committee also organises 
fundraising events at its Head Office 
including bake sales, treasure hunts, 
raffles and quizzes, which have 
together raised another £4,000 
benefitting organisations including 
Comic Relief, Macmillan and the Royal 
British Legion. Enterprise are taking 
their support for the British Legion 
further, and have launched, together 
with Charles Wells, a beer called 
‘Poppy’, for which the Legion will 
receive 10 pence for each pint sold. 
In addition, Enterprise employees had 
the opportunity to donate selection 
boxes at Christmas time, for which 
nearly 200 were collected and 
distributed to three local charities.
COMMUNITY

The Cellar House, Norwich  
Victoria MacDonald 
The Cellar House, in its own words, 
aims to be “a bustling ‘Community 
Pub’ that offers great beers, regular 
events such as live music nights and 
quizzes, supports local clubs and 
teams, and happens to be a great 
place to eat” . The publican, Victoria 
MacDonald, allows a number of clubs 
to use the pub facilities for free, 
including the local ukulele club, whilst 
sponsoring a number of local sports 
teams. 
The pub has close links with the Eaton 
Village Resident’s Association (EVRA) 
and has plans to widen their current 
beer festival into a larger village fete 
next year. The EVRA also recently 
approached Victoria, asking her to 
consider applying to offer a local 
post office service once the current 
post master retires. This application 
has just been accepted, which will 
serve to further put the pub at the 
heart of the community. The fabulous 
community work done and spirit 
demonstrated by Victoria and her 
team impressed the panel of industry 
experts judging this year’s awards and 
led her to being crowned Enterprise’s 
Community Heroes winner for 2015.

Across the pub estate, a large number 
of Enterprise publicans supported 
Cancer Research UK’s second national 
fundraising BBQ weekend, and 
together raised over £8,000. 
In June 2015 we entered into a 
Primary Authority Scheme partnership 
with West Midlands Fire Service. 
Our contribution of £15,000 per year 
to support this partnership is used 
to promote the charity Safeside. 
Safeside has experiential learning 
centres in Eastside and Handsworth 
in Birmingham which provide 
innovative, interactive and enjoyable 
learning environments inspiring 
visitors to think and act safely. The 
centres are used extensively by 
school groups, vulnerable adults and 
the elderly. 
Through our managed business we 
have sought to align our ethos of 
being involved in and supporting the 
communities in which we operate, 
and are participating in the Stride 
venture which introduces young 
people in local schools to business 
and enterprise skills. We will be 
supporting Stride with their “putting 
young minds to work” programme for 
200 pupils within a three mile radius 
of four of our managed pubs in the 
south east, committing £20,000 to 
this venture.
People
Employee  
engagement survey
We seek to create an inspiring 
working environment where 
everyone is engaged and motivated. 
In 2014 we conducted our first 
Group wide employee engagement 
survey, “My Opinion” . We were 
then able to identify a number of 
drivers of engagement to focus on. 
These included increased internal 
communication, the introduction of 
new business equipment to improve 
field team efficiency and quarterly 
training events. 
In 2015 we completed our second 
survey and achieved an outstanding 
93% response rate. The outcome 
demonstrated that the actions 
taken since the previous survey 
had proved to be successful, with 
scores improving in the appropriate 
questions. Again we have identified 
our priorities for 2015/16 and will 
reassess next year. 
National Living Wage
We are already building the 
implications of the living wage into 
our expansion plans in our managed 
business. In the short-term this 
will have a small impact given the 
numbers of managed houses in the 
portfolio but as that increases we will 
continue with our labour investment. 
Paying the living wage supports our 
aim of attracting and retaining great 
people to operate our businesses 
and it will reduce staff turnover and 
improve motivation and productivity. 
Retaining employees enables us 
to improve service standards by 
providing on-going training and 
through engaged and motivated 
teams.
This also supports the Group’s 
objectives of offering career 
development by internal progression 
opportunities and recognised industry 
qualifications.
Management 
Development Programme
In 2015 we launched our internal 
Management Development 
Programme (MDP). The MDP has 
been developed to support employees 
who want to progress into senior 
leadership roles within the business. 
PEOPLE
Management 
Development 
Programme
In 2015 we launched a 
Management Development 
Programme to support our 
internal employees from 
across the business who have 
aspirations to move into a 
senior management role. The 
programme was delivered 
over a 12 month period and 
consisted of a number of 
internally and externally delivered 
courses covering topics such 
as impact and influencing, 
employee engagement and 
presentation skills. Alongside 
these, each delegate worked on 
a strategically aligned business 
project which culminated in a 
presentation to our Executive 
Management Group. Feedback 
from delegates included;
“I have found the experience 
thoroughly beneficial to not 
only how I work, but how I 
interact with other employees, 
departments and customers. 
The content has been both 
refreshing and motivational and I 
would definitely recommend this 
to other employees looking to 
develop in their current role. ”

Corporate Social Responsibility
Health and wellbeing
We encourage our people to adopt a 
healthy lifestyle. Enterprise offers a 
flexible benefits scheme to members 
of staff, including benefits such as 
the cycle to work scheme, leisure 
club membership, private medical 
and dental insurance, flexible 
holiday benefits, a health screening 
service and a confidential employee 
assistance programme.
Employment policies
The Group’s employment policies and 
procedures are described in detail in 
its staff handbook, which is available 
to all employees on our intranet. This 
handbook takes account of relevant 
employment legislation and best 
practice. New policies, procedures 
and related training are developed as 
required. The Group’s anti-bribery and 
corruption code of conduct sets out 
how Group employees, publicans and 
suppliers must act to ensure that our 
zero tolerance approach to bribery and 
corruption is upheld.
Diversity
We are committed to equal 
opportunities and the creation of an 
entirely non-discriminatory working 
environment and operate within our 
policy to ensure that all employees 
are recruited, developed, promoted 
and remunerated on the basis of their 
skills and job suitability and ensure no 
individual is treated less favourably 
because of, amongst other matters, 
gender, marital status, race, age, 
sexual preference, religion, belief or 
disability. The Group is dedicated to 
undertaking its business operations 
in a way which respects individual 
human rights, diversity and equality 
and treats individuals with dignity and 
allows freedom of association.
We give full consideration to 
applications for employment 
from disabled persons where the 
requirements of the job can be 
adequately fulfilled by them. We 
endeavour to retain the employment 
of, and arrange suitable retraining for, 
any employee who becomes disabled 
during their employment as well as 
providing training, career development 
and promotion to disabled employees 
wherever appropriate.
Training
At Enterprise we place great 
importance on developing skills and 
potential in order to support all our 
employees to harness talent and 
therefore drive business performance. 
Wherever possible we endeavour 
to fill our vacancies through internal 
progression, however where people 
join us externally we aim to provide 
the best possible start with structured 
induction plans in place for everyone. 
Training is provided in a number of 
ways, through on the job coaching, 
formal training courses, e-learning and 
mentoring. E-learning is particularly 
effective in providing regular training 
and process updates to all our field 
based employees. We also sponsor a 
number of employees in studying for 
appropriate professional qualifications. 
In recognition of our internal 
development we have achieved 
Development Partner status with the 
Chartered Institute of Management 
Accountants (CIMA) and Approved 
Employer status with the Association 
of Chartered Certified Accountants 
(ACCA). We are currently trialling 
internal apprenticeships at our head 
office and intend to implement an 
apprenticeship scheme within our 
managed estate.
All-employee share 
schemes
Enterprise encourages employee 
ownership of Company shares 
through the provision of a Save As 
You Earn Scheme (SAYE) and a Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP). 
In recognition of our employment 
policies, we have attained the 
prestigious accolade of both Investors 
in People (IIP) Gold and Champion. 
This recognises our position as a role 
model for the IIP community and the 
wider business population.

Publicans
Enterprise is committed to fair, 
transparent and lawful dealing with 
our publicans. Our Code of Practice, 
accredited by the BII, sets out 
and governs how we manage our 
relationships with our publicans. We 
also commit to providing various 
levels of support as part of our 
agreements with publicans: 
 ■ Business support and training – 
We want to ensure new publicans 
are as prepared as possible to 
run their pub. We require all new 
publicans to complete the Pre-
Entry Awareness T raining course 
run by the BII. We have an industry 
leading induction programme called 
“100 Days” to offer intensive help 
and support to our new publicans. 
All our publicans can also benefit 
from free business development 
and training courses. 
 ■ Mentoring – We have a publican 
mentoring service for publicans 
who need additional help and 
support to establish their business. 
This invaluable support is available 
to new publicans and is provided 
by experienced BII accredited 
mentors.
 ■ Finder’s fee – We also offer a 
finder’s fee which is paid to our 
publicans for the successful 
introduction of a new publican on 
a tenancy agreement.  In addition, 
we pay £500 to a charity of the 
publican’s choice which is typically 
a local charity supported by the 
pub, and in the last financial year 
made charitable donations under 
this scheme of more than £13,000.
 ■ Marketing Support – Throughout 
the year we offer our publicans 
special deals and online ordering 
promotions.
 ■ Gaming – Gaming and leisure 
machines are an integral part of 
the business for many pubs. We 
ensure that our publicans are 
aware of both their legal and social 
responsibilities under the Gambling 
Act 2005.
 ■ Retail standards – Our regional 
managers work with our publicans 
to help them ensure they offer the 
highest levels of retail standards to 
their customers and provide a safe 
and welcoming environment at all 
times. As beer is such an intrinsic 
part of a pub offer, Enterprise 
works closely with Cask Marque 
an independent body that assesses 
the quality of beer served by 
member pubs.
 ■ Apprenticeships – 
Apprenticeships provide a vital 
platform for young people who 
want to develop an exciting career 
within our industry. We currently 
have more than 100 learners on an 
apprenticeship programme within 
our leased and tenanted estate.
PUBLICANS
New publican 
support
The Butcher’s Arms, Brimington  
Nicky Claxton and Trevor Marples 
New publicans Nicky Claxton and 
Trevor Marples took on The Butcher’s 
Arms, Brimington, near Chesterfield 
in July 2015 on a five year retail 
partnership agreement following 
capital spend of £80,000 carried out 
by Enterprise to refurbish the internal 
trading areas. As new publicans they 
received training support, with Nicky 
attending a three day “Building your 
Business” course and the “ Award in 
Beer & Cellar Quality” , both of which 
were funded by Enterprise to help 
them get their new business venture 
up and running. 
Nicky and Trevor were also the first 
to go live with a brand new publican 
support initiative we launched in 
July – Pub websites, whereby every 
new publican taking on an Enterprise 
pub on a long-term tenancy can 
now receive a tailored website to 
help kick-start and promote their 
business. The websites are supported 
by professional photography, and 
include information such as opening 
hours, location details, events listings, 
menus, images, contact details and 
social media links. 90 new publicans 
have taken advantage of this support 
during the first five months since they 
were introduced.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Responsible retailing
The irresponsible consumption 
or retailing of alcohol can have 
detrimental effects on the social 
structures of local communities. 
Publicans, supermarkets, off-licences, 
the Government and the consumer 
all have responsibilities towards the 
promotion and management of a 
responsible drinking environment. 
We seek to be responsible by the 
following means:
 ■ Drinkaware – The Company is a 
sponsor of the Drinkaware Trust. 
Drinkaware promotes responsible 
drinking and finds innovative ways 
to challenge the national drinking 
culture to help reduce alcohol 
misuse and minimise alcohol-
related harm. This independent 
UK-wide charity is supported by 
voluntary donations from across 
the drinks industry and provides 
people with accessible, evidence-
based information about alcohol 
and its effects. It works alongside 
the medical community, third 
sector organisations, Government 
and drinks manufacturers and 
retailers to promote responsible 
drinking.
 ■ Proof of age – We actively 
promote various proof of age 
schemes to all publicans, providing 
details of a variety of schemes 
to new publicans enabling 
them to operate a scheme in 
their premises. We promote 
the industry’s Challenge 21 and 
Challenge 25 campaigns and have 
provided campaign materials to 
every pub.
 ■ National alcohol harm reduction 
strategy – Through membership 
of the BBPA, we have actively 
participated in discussions with the 
Government in the fulfilment of its 
National Alcohol Harm Reduction 
Strategy.
 ■ Addressing consequences of 
alcohol misuse – We continue 
to work proactively with local 
authorities and have made 
commitments to provide support 
for schemes such as Best Bar 
None and Pubwatch to develop and 
implement policies and strategies 
which are designed to address the 
potential consequences of alcohol 
misuse whilst not penalising the 
majority of responsible publicans 
and their customers.
 ■ Drug awareness – It is the 
responsibility of all publicans to 
create and maintain a safe, secure 
and relaxing environment for 
their customers. We support our 
publicans through free training and 
help and advice to ensure they can 
fulfil these obligations.
 ■ Drinks range – We supply our 
publicans with an extensive range 
of products including many low 
and no alcohol alternatives and in 
our own managed pubs offer a full 
range of products. 
 ■ Drink labels – We support 
suppliers who have introduced 
sensible drinking messages on 
their products. 
 ■ Responsibility deal – We support 
the Government’s Public Health 
responsibility deal and encourage 
our publicans to embrace 
responsible retailing and enjoyment 
of alcohol, especially in the safe 
and sociable environment of the 
pub. We continue to proactively 
communicate units of alcohol by 
measure to ensure our publicans 
can easily inform their customers 
and operate our managed 
businesses in the same way. 
The managed business
Where we now have operational 
control of our estate of managed 
pubs with that direct control we are 
able to influence how best to manage 
waste disposal, recycling and energy 
efficiency. As our managed business 
grows we will grow our capabilities 
to deliver sustainable operating 
procedures which are mindful of the 
environment and the local community.
In particular we have engaged with 
a specialist independent energy 
consultancy for expert advice 
and guidance on energy saving 
opportunities and efficiencies. They 
are providing detailed energy surveys 
and recommendations to improve 
efficiency and energy management 
which allow us to focus investment 
where annual savings have attractive 
short and long-term payback periods 
and improve energy ratings for the 
properties. In the longer-term we 
intend to take these initiatives to 
the leased and tenanted estate 
and include them in our investment 
considerations, harnessing greater 
efficiencies across the wider estate.
In the managed estate we do not 
operate any 24 hour licenses and 
are able to directly promote age 
appropriate supplies and directly 
engage with local communities 
where we are also able to recruit local 
employees for the retail business. 
Supply chain 
management
In 2015 we revisited the need for an 
ethical purchasing policy. We have 
now formed a dedicated procurement 
team who will work in the coming 
year with our key supplies to ensure 
they share similar values to our own, 
to ensure sustainability is considered 
as part of the procurement process 
and that suppliers have the highest 
standards of ethical business 
decisions and practices.

Health and safety
Enterprise takes the health and 
safety management of its employees, 
publicans and supply chain partners 
very seriously. To ensure the health 
and safety function is best placed 
to meet the evolving needs of the 
business, we operate two groups 
which deal with strategic safety and 
also operational issues. These are 
designed to ensure that every area 
and function of the organisation 
can contribute to the development 
of relevant safety systems and 
procedures.
Safety Management Group (SMG) – 
meets on a quarterly basis to review 
any day-to-day operational safety 
challenges, demands and required 
solutions for the organisation. This 
includes developing any changes to 
our policies or procedures. 
These are designed to maintain 
safety with minimum impact on 
our operational and commercial 
objectives. Any breaches of our 
policies or procedures are also 
reviewed by this group.
Strategic Safety Group (SSG) – meets 
on a monthly basis to oversee the 
strategic direction of safety within the 
business. This group is specifically 
tasked with a governance role to 
discuss the business’s performance, 
operational targets, and objectives 
and performance in relation to safety.
Primary Authority (PA) – the Company 
continues to participate in the 
Government’s Primary Authority 
Scheme (PAS) and regularly interacts 
with regulators. The Company has a 
relationship with Westminster City 
Council for health and safety, West 
Midlands Fire and Rescue Service for 
Fire Safety, and is currently exploring 
a relationship with Milton Keynes 
Borough Council for Food Safety 
and related enforcement. The PAS 
arrangement ensures a company 
trading across council boundaries 
is guaranteed access to robust and 
reliable advice in relation to regulatory 
responsibilities.
Environment
We recognise our responsibilities 
to achieve good environmental 
practice and to continue to strive 
for improvement in areas of 
environmental impact. Our approach 
is to work through education, 
communication and direct action 
wherever possible. 
Distribution efficiencies
Wherever possible we combine 
all drinks deliveries into a single 
vehicle drop to reduce road miles, 
congestion, fuel and costs.
Packaging waste
Enterprise continues to fulfil its 
obligations imposed by the Packaging 
Waste Regulations based on all 
recyclables sold to publicans, an 
annual total of approximately 2,600 
tonnes. In 2015, Enterprise changed 
its membership to the SUSTAIN 
Drinks Packaging Partnership, a pub 
industry initiative led by the BBPA, 
which will provide an improved waste 
packaging consultancy service and 
lowest cost compliance. SUSTAIN 
will also help us prepare for the 
more complex obligations required 
for our managed pubs, including 
food packaging waste and all our 
managed pubs have the facilities to 
recycle 100% of the glass used in the 
business.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Carbon reduction 
During the course of this year we 
have progressed initiatives relating 
to carbon reduction. These are led by 
employee representatives and we are 
assisted by a specialist independent 
energy consultancy. Our work is 
focused on maintaining compliance, 
providing advice and education to 
all staff across the head office, the 
leased and tenanted estate and the 
new managed businesses, as well 
as assessing the feasibility of energy 
saving investments. Utilising the 
industry standard measures of Scope 
1 and Scope 2 of the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol (GHG Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard Revised 
Edition 2004) we aim to engender 
a carbon saving culture across all 
stakeholders in the organisation. 
Head office
At our head office we have previously 
invested in the installation of passive 
low-energy lighting and energy 
reduction equipment known to 
provide voltage optimisation. These 
initiatives continue to contribute to a 
CO
2
 reduction. 
To ensure we have a meaningful 
comparison we are utilising our prior 
years’ submissions as a baseline 
alongside a combined submission 
which incorporates our managed 
businesses. This will allow us to 
monitor and track the improvement. 
As our head office facility is a 
significant contributor to our overall 
emissions we commissioned 
an energy audit by an energy 
consultancy company and a number 
of recommendations have been 
highlighted to assist with further 
reducing CO
2
 output. In addition 
we have already commissioned a 
feasibility study to assess the impact 
of upgrading our current heating, 
ventilation, air conditioning and 
lighting systems to energy efficient 
alternatives.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Waste reduction 
To reduce waste we are targeting 
a minimum 75% of all waste being 
recycled. This has already been 
achieved at the head office and to 
ensure this is attained within the 
managed estate our approved supply 
chain has been instructed that our 
policy is to return all packaging to 
source for recycling. We will monitor 
and manage this process to ensure 
adherence.
Car fleet
It is recognised that business travel is 
a significant contributor to our Carbon 
Footprint. 
To mitigate this we have already 
invested in large screens and 
conferencing telephony in all meeting 
rooms and encourage web-based 
meetings and conference calls 
where feasible. In addition we are 
proactively promoting to our staff the 
potential alternatives for each journey 
undertaken including public transport, 
car sharing and cycling. We are also 
working with company car drivers to 
ensure they operate their vehicles in 
the most efficient way possible. To 
this end we are currently reviewing 
the use of driver training courses to 
help educate them in the most safe, 
economical and efficient way to drive.
We have also undertaken a 
comprehensive review of our 
company car fleet. In response to this 
review we have already amended 
the Car Fleet Policy to ensure all new 
cars procured are subject to CO
2
 
restrictions. Our car option choices 
have been extended in each of the 
company car bandings to include 
at least one super hybrid/ECO car. 
To demonstrate our commitment 
to reducing CO
2
 associated with 
transport we intend to monitor and 
track our progress on an annual 
basis utilising the Greenhouse Gas 
Emission (GHG) statement detailed 
below.
Energy Performance 
Certificates (EPC)
We continue to make good progress 
towards compliance with the 
Minimum Energy Performance 
Standards Regulations to ensure that 
where in our portfolio leases and 
tenancies are approaching expiry they 
are appropriately rated for energy 
performance prior to deadlines set for 
2018. We are proactively managing 
the future requirements of EPCs and 
where low efficiencies are identified 
we are seeking to prioritise those by 
investing in remedial works. 
Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme 
(ESOS)
The Energy Savings Opportunity 
Scheme Regulations 2014 (ESOS 
Regulations) promoted by the 
Environment Agency applies to large 
undertakings like ourselves, and it 
is estimated that it will lead to £1 .6 
billion net benefits to the UK, with 
the majority of these being directly 
felt by businesses as a result of 
energy savings. We confirm that we 
will be fully compliant with reporting 
requirements by the 5 December 
2015 deadline. Furthermore we have 
embraced this initiative and fully 
intend to take advantage and assess 
the feasibility of all of the energy 
saving opportunities highlighted in the 
ESOS report.
Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions (GHG) 
Statement
The greenhouse gas emissions 
statement (GHG) below provides 
a summary of Enterprise’s 
greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions 
from 1 October 2014 to 30 September 
2015. It gives a summary of 
emissions from fuel combustion and 
the operation of our facilities which 
include our offices, managed houses 
and company cars (Scope 1), and 
from our purchased electricity used 
during the year (Scope 2). 
We have adopted the operational 
control approach, as defined in 
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (Revised Edition), 2004. 
Therefore, emissions associated with 
our tenanted pubs are not included in 
this statement as they are considered 
to be outside of our operational 
control. Emissions associated with 
our new managed houses are 
included this year for the first time 
(excluded in the prior year on the 
grounds of materiality) and for ease 
of comparison the GHG statement is 
set out in two parts; an assessment 
breakdown for the head office only 
with the baseline year 2013 and the 
total combined emission statement 
(head office and managed houses) 
with the baseline year of 2015.

During the year the process of risk identification and evaluation 
including assurance effectiveness has been enhanced and is explained 
further in the Audit Committee Report.
The Board formally reviews the principal risks identified through this 
process and ensures that these are appropriately managed by the 
executive management team. 
The Board retains ultimate 
responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management framework, including 
the on-going monitoring and review 
of its effectiveness, however it has 
delegated responsibility for annually 
reviewing the overall effectiveness of 
the risk management programme to 
the Audit Committee, who formally 
report back to the Board. 
The internal audit function provides 
assurance to the Audit Committee 
on the effectiveness of the internal 
control procedures through 
completion of the annual internal audit 
plan, which takes into account current 
business risks.

Considered as part of 
viability assessment
The table below sets out the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and how 
we mitigate them. This is not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of all the risks the 
Group may face. 
The new strategic direction being taken by the Group as explained in the ‘Our Strategy’ 
section has been considered when reviewing risks and consequently there are some 
changes to the risks the Group faces. These are explained in more detail below.
Description and potential impact Mitigation processes
Strategy and business model
Regulation of the tied pub model 
The Small Business, Enterprise and Employment (SBEE) Bill 
received Royal Assent on 26 March 2015 and has therefore 
become primary legislation. Further work is now taking place 
to finalise the detail of the new regulatory regime, however the 
key proposals were to establish a Statutory Code of Practice, 
to be overseen by an independent Adjudicator, and to provide 
a tenant’s right, under certain circumstances, to change the 
freely-negotiated commercial terms of their agreement to a 
new Market Rent Only (MRO) contract.
The Government has since launched the first tranche (of two) 
of its Consultation on the wording of the statutory Pubs Code, 
which is expected to come into effect by 26 May 2016. 
Although this removes some of the uncertainty in the sector, 
until the parliamentary process is complete and the final 
detail is known, the potential costs of implementation and 
the operation of the regime could have an impact upon our 
profitability, our operational strategy and our relationships with 
our publicans.
In addition, there is a risk that other changes to the regulations 
relating to the sale of alcohol could have an impact on the 
Group’s business and the ability of our publicans to operate 
their pubs. 
These risks include changes to licensing legislation, increases 
to alcohol duties imposed by the Government and the impact of 
social responsibility issues on the industry in general.
The Group is committed to the tied pub model and works 
closely with a number of stakeholders to support the pub sector, 
evolve the tied pub model and ensure it operates an appropriate 
and legally binding Code of Practice to promote a mutually 
beneficial relationship with its publicans. 
The Group actively engages with the Government, trade bodies 
and other stakeholders and has contributed to and continues to 
participate in the Government consultation process. 
Whilst we remain of the view that the flexible industry-owned 
framework of self-regulation is working and is the best solution 
for all interested parties, we recognise the intent of a statutory 
regime and are working with the relevant bodies as part of the 
process to develop the Pubs Code and associated guidance and 
shall respond formally to both tranches of the Consultation.
We already operate effective policies and procedures in order to 
satisfy the existing industry code of practice framework and we 
have recently recruited additional compliance resource to ensure 
that we satisfy any additional requirements of the statutory Pubs 
Code.
In order to mitigate any potential impact to total income, the 
Group is developing the necessary operational flexibility and 
capabilities to enable it to apply alternative operating models to 
the pubs in the estate that could potentially be affected by MRO.
We also work closely with Local Authorities as necessary 
to ensure licensing requirements are dealt with whenever 
appropriate.
The Group is a member of a number of trade bodies and 
associations, is a contributor to the Drinkaware Trust, and 
works closely with these organisations to promote responsible 
drinking practices. Further details can be found in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website at 
www.enterpriseinns.com.
Litigation
The Group operates in a heavily regulated industry and may be 
involved in legal or statutory proceedings in relation to our pubs 
or publicans. The impact of such litigation may be immaterial in 
value but may result in harm to the Group’s reputation.
The Group employs an in-house solicitor and other specialists to 
ensure we comply with legislation and to manage any litigation 
with our publicans.
The Group will work with Local Authorities as necessary 
whenever any statutory issues are raised in relation to its pub 
estate. Where appropriate, the Group takes legal proceedings 
against publicans to ensure compliance with their agreements.
Due to the introduction of MRO during the current year  
the risk of regulation to the business has increased.
The Board believes there is no change to this risk.

Risks and Uncertainties
Description and potential impact Mitigation processes
Strategy and business model
Health and safety
A health and safety incident could result in serious injury to the 
Group’s employees, publicans or customers.
The Group has developed an effective health and safety 
management system to ensure compliance with all legal 
duties placed on the organisation by health and safety law. All 
systems are subject to regular review with training provided as 
appropriate.
These measures have been expanded to ensure effective 
control of the managed house operations as well as continued 
appropriate focus on the issues facing the leased and tenanted 
estate.
The Group employs a Health and Safety Manager and a Fire 
Safety Manager to maintain the health and safety management 
system along with the identification and remediation of 
specific risks and ensuring employees are aware of regulatory 
requirements. 
The Group operates a strategic and operational health and safety 
regime and operates within a Primary Authority Scheme with 
Westminster City Council and also with the West Midlands Fire 
Service.
Implementation of new strategy
There is a risk that there is not enough expertise, resource 
or time to build the necessary support infrastructure to 
successfully execute the new strategy in the desired 
timeframe. In addition, there is a risk that assets are 
not allocated to the most optimum area, impacting the 
effectiveness of the strategy.
The Group has started developing the necessary infrastructure 
to support the new strategy, including the recruitment of high 
quality, experienced individuals into areas of the business such 
as retail operations, concept development, change programme 
management and systems and financial reporting. The Group 
also uses outsourced resources where required. 
The Group strategy includes a diverse portfolio of operating 
approaches, including ensuring that we utilise external specialist 
operating experience, for example in the partnership “Expert” 
model, where their retail flair and capability in pubs with retail 
complexity and exceptional profit potential will allow us to 
optimise the value of such sites.
Although there is a small change to this risk due to an increase in  
the number of managed houses, the Board believes that this does 
not significantly affect the Group.
This is a new risk to the business this year following the  
announcement of the new strategy.

Description and potential impact Mitigation processes
Strategy and business model
General economic conditions 
The Group’s business operations are sensitive to economic 
conditions and the general economic outlook remains 
uncertain. In addition, changes in interest rates and other 
economic factors could lead to an increase in the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital (WACC), or could impact 
profitability either of which could lead to an impairment in the 
value of goodwill carried on the Balance Sheet.
The Group regularly monitors its key income streams and 
publicans’ performance to ensure the Group is competitively 
placed in the market, including regularly reviewing financial 
forecasts to assess the impact of economic conditions on its 
budget, strategic plans and its publicans. Careful consideration 
is given to all publicans’ requests for additional operational and 
financial support as well as assessing appropriate investment 
in the development of our pubs to ensure that we remain 
competitively placed in the market.
The Group continues to foster mutually beneficial relationships 
with key suppliers to ensure the impact of any price increases is 
minimised wherever possible.
The Group regularly reviews its WACC in line with the capital 
structure, and compares to its competitors. It annually reviews 
the carrying value of goodwill and would write down the value 
if it deemed an impairment was necessary. Any goodwill that 
is allocated to pubs that are disposed, is written off during the 
year.
Pub operations
People
The Group is reliant on the ability to attract, train and retain 
the best employees, publicans for its leased and tenanted 
pubs as well as managers and team members for its managed 
pubs. Failure to do this could impact on the Group’s strategic 
objectives.
The Group is committed to providing appropriate employee 
training, retention and reward policies and has attained the 
prestigious accolade of “Champion” status for Investors in 
People. An e-learning training programme is also in place to 
support our employees’ on-going development. As outlined 
in the Corporate Social Responsibility section on page 25, we 
conduct an annual staff engagement survey which is used 
to identify issues and opportunities to improve the working 
environment. 
The Group’s publican recruitment and training programme and 
its variety of tenancy and lease agreements are designed to 
attract the best quality people. We offer an industry leading 
range of flexible agreements, funding options, tailored deals for 
appropriate applicants and award winning training courses.
The Group has also established a robust programme for the 
recruitment, induction and training for all of the managers and 
team members of each of its managed pub operations.
The Board believes there is no change to this risk.

Risks and Uncertainties
Description and potential impact Mitigation processes
Pub operations
Supply chain management
The Group places reliance on key suppliers and distributors to 
ensure that there is a continuous supply of drinks and other 
products to its publicans. The Group is exposed to interruption 
or failure of these key suppliers and distributors which could 
result in such products not being delivered to publicans on 
time.
The Group works closely with its key suppliers and distribution 
partners to ensure good working relationships, as well as 
taking reasonable steps to try to ensure that key suppliers and 
distributors have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place to 
maintain continuity of supply.
The Group also has its own contingency plans to minimise the 
disruption of any external interruption to supply.
Property management
Property valuations
Valuations of the Group’s property portfolio have been 
affected by general economic conditions and resulting 
downwards pressure on maintainable income streams. These 
circumstances could continue and therefore reduce the 
valuation of the portfolio over time. There is a risk that future 
changes in the UK property market and general economic 
conditions could impact the value of our portfolio and the ability 
to dispose of underperforming pubs and the realisations from 
such disposals. Property valuations also have an implication 
for the overall value of the Group and impact on financial 
covenants.
The Group ensures that every pub in its portfolio is valued 
annually at market value by qualified external and internal valuers 
in accordance with RICS Valuation Standards (8th Edition). 92% 
of the estate is now valued by independent, external valuers. 
These valuations comply with the requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards.
We conduct a full estates review on an annual basis which 
allows us to set a future strategy for each pub in the estate. This 
review also guides our investment in capital expenditure, allows 
us to consider possible alternative uses or to dispose of those 
pubs which no longer fit our strategy.
We invested £69 million on developing and improving our pubs 
during the year.
The Board believes there is no change to this risk.

Description and potential impact Mitigation processes
Capital structure
Liquidity risk
The Group has a flexible financing structure comprising bonds 
issued from the Unique securitisation (securitised bonds), 
corporate bonds issued by the Company and bank borrowings. 
The bank borrowing facility of £138 million (£75 million 
drawn at 30 September 2015) is fully committed through to 
September 2018. 
The next scheduled bond repayments are the £350.5 million 
which mature in December 2018.
The primary liquidity risks are the requirement to meet all 
on-going finance costs, repay the principal amounts of the 
securitised borrowings as they amortise and the corporate 
bonds as they fall due, ensuring there are sufficient funding 
facilities in place to enable the business to meet all cash 
flow requirements as they fall due and meeting the financial 
covenants associated with the financing structure.
The Board regularly reviews detailed financial forecasts 
to ensure there is sufficient cash available to meet the 
requirements of the Group. These reviews include the ability to 
meet restricted payment conditions in the securitised bonds in 
order that cash can be released by the payment of dividends 
through the securitisation structure to the Company.
There are a number of options available to the Group to manage 
its financing commitments including the disposal of pubs, 
reducing capital expenditure on the estate as well as raising new 
capital through a bank facility or issuing new corporate bonds. 
Throughout the year the Group tests all of the financial 
covenants and forecasts are prepared during the budgeting 
process. The Board regularly reviews detailed financial forecasts 
of the Group to ensure there is sufficient headroom on all 
covenants. 
On 7 October 2014 the Group completed a refinancing which 
effectively moved £249.5 million of the £600 million debt that 
was due to be repaid in 2018 to a later maturity of 2023. At the 
same time the bank facility was extended to 2018. Other than 
the on-going amortisation of the securitised bonds, these are 
the next scheduled repayments facing the Group.
Information technology
Systems failure
The Group’s daily operations are reliant on its information 
technology systems for accounting, reporting and 
communication. There is a risk that serious disruption could 
result if these systems fail for an extended period of time.
A business continuity plan is in place to ensure the business 
could continue to function in the event of a major systems 
failure. This plan is regularly tested.
There are comprehensive controls in place to protect information 
technology systems, including anti-viral software and the back 
up and off-site storage of data.
Cyber risk
Increasing levels of cyber-crime represent a threat to every 
business with the potential to cause a loss of system 
availability, which could have a consequential financial loss.
The threats facing IT are regularly monitored as part of the 
on-going review by the IT Steering Committee, which regularly 
reports to the Executive Management Group.
IT disaster recovery and business continuity plans exist and 
are tested regularly to ensure the business could continue 
to function in the event of a major systems failure. There are 
comprehensive controls in place to protect IT systems, including 
anti-viral software and the back up and off-site storage of data.
A review of security was completed by an external consultant 
during the year, which rated our security as substantially better 
than the majority of similar organisations.
The Board believes there is no change to this risk.
The Board believes there is no change to this risk.
The Board believes there is no change to this risk due to  
the refinancing in the year that has reduced the corporate  
bonds due in 2018.

Risks and Uncertainties
Viability statement
In accordance with the revised 
UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Group over a period 
significantly longer than 12 months 
from the approval of the financial 
statements. 
The Board has concluded that the 
most relevant time period for this 
review should be the three year 
period of the normal business 
forecasting cycle, however given that 
the Group is in the early stages of a 
strategic plan that will evolve over a 
five year period and the occurrence 
of specific financing events over that 
same period, the assessment this 
year has been carried out over the five 
year period to 2020.
The Board took part in a strategic 
business review during the current 
year following which a strategy 
of asset optimisation has been 
announced. This review considered 
the current position, strategy and 
market of the Group along with the 
risks and opportunities. 
In addition, as in prior years, the 
Group has continued to assess 
the key risks and mitigating factors 
that could impact the Group. This 
assessment has been further 
enhanced to ensure that the current 
and future risks, controls and 
assurances available have been fully 
analysed and documented, resulting 
in a clear picture of the risk profile 
across the whole of the business. This 
has been reviewed and the principal 
risks agreed by the Board are detailed 
on pages 32 to 37. 
Those risks that could affect the 
future viability of the Group over the 
next five years were identified, as 
highlighted on pages 32 to 37 in Risks 
and Uncertainties, and the resilience 
of the Group to the occurrence of 
these risks in severe yet plausible 
scenarios has been evaluated.
This evaluation has included 
consideration of the likelihood and 
impact of refinancing the £350.5 
million corporate bonds, that are 
due for repayment in 2018, and the 
directors draw attention to the key 
assumption that there is a reasonable 
expectation, based on the refinancing 
that occurred during the year, that the 
Group will be able to refinance these 
bonds.
For the reasons stated above, the 
directors confirm that they have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation, 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due, 
over the period of the assessment.
Strategic Report approval
The Strategic Report, on pages 02 to 38, incorporates the Highlights, the Chairman’s Statement, Our Market, 
Our Business, Our Strategy, the Chief Executive’s Review, Key Performance Indicators, the Financial Review, the 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report, the Risks and Uncertainties and the viability and going concern statements.
By order of the Board
L T ogher 
Company Secretary
16 November 2015
Going concern statement
The directors have considered the 
Group’s financial resources including 
a review of the medium-term financial 
plan, which includes a review of the 
Group’s cash flow forecasts for the 
period of at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of these financial 
statements. 
The directors have also considered 
the impact of the Small Business, 
Enterprise and Employment Act 
which includes the introduction of 
a Statutory Code of Practice for the 
sector and a Market Rent Only option 
for certain leased pubs including 
the current anticipated timetable for 
implementation and the alternative 
actions available to the Group in 
response to the legislation.
Based on the outcome of the above 
consideration the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the 
period under review. For this reason 
the directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements.

Directors’ Report
The directors submit the statutory financial statements for 
the Group for the year ended 30 September 2015.
The Governance Report on pages 46 to 50, and the 
Corporate Social Responsibility Report (with regard to 
information about the employment of disabled persons, 
employee involvement, share schemes and greenhouse 
gas emissions) are also incorporated into this Report by 
reference.
The Company has chosen, in accordance with section 414 
C(11) of the Companies Act 2006 to include the disclosure 
of likely future developments in the Strategic Report (see  
pages 02 to 38).
Results and dividends
The Group’s loss for the year, after taxation, amounted to 
£65 million (2014: profit of £30 million). 
The directors are not recommending the payment of 
any dividend on its ordinary shares for the year ended 
30 September 2015 (2014: nil) but will consider future 
dividend policy in the light of results from the business 
going forward.
Share capital
As at 30 September 2015, the Company’s issued share 
capital was 555,977 ,435 ordinary shares of 2.5 pence each 
as set out in note 29 to the accounts on page 133. 
Authority of the directors to allot shares
The Company was authorised by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting held on 5 February 2015 to allot 
shares and to grant rights to subscribe for, or convert 
securities into, shares up to a maximum nominal amount 
of £8,423,957.24. 
This authority will expire at the 2016 AGM and the 
directors will be seeking a new authority for the directors 
to allot shares, and to grant subscription and conversion 
rights, to ensure that the directors continue to have the 
flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders, when 
opportunities arise, by issuing new shares or granting such 
rights. There are no current plans to issue new shares 
except in connection with employee share schemes and 
on conversion of the convertible bonds.
Purchase of own shares by  
the Company
The Company was authorised by shareholders at the AGM 
held on 5 February 2015 to purchase up to a maximum 
of 14.99% of its ordinary shares in the market. The price 
per ordinary share that the Company may pay is set at 
a minimum amount (excluding expenses) of 2.5 pence 
per ordinary share and a maximum amount (excluding 
expenses) of the higher of: (i) 5% over the average of the 
previous five business days’ middle market prices; and 
(ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade 
and the highest current independent bid on the trading 
venue where the purchase is carried out. No shares 
were purchased under this authority during the period 
under review. This authority will expire at the 2016 AGM 
and the directors will be seeking a new authority for the 
Company to purchase its ordinary shares, which will only 
be exercised if market and financial conditions make it 
advantageous to do so. Further details are set out in the 
explanatory notes to the Notice convening the AGM on 
pages 156 to 157.
Treasury shares and the Employee 
Benefit Trust
As at 30 September 2015, the Company held 50,000,000 
shares in Treasury as set out in note 29 to the accounts 
on page 133. There has been no change to the number of 
shares held in Treasury during the period under review.
In addition, 6,568,286 shares are held by the Company’s 
Employee Benefit Trust and movements during the year 
are set out in note 29 to the accounts on page 133. These 
shares are held to satisfy awards made under the various 
incentive and employee share schemes, details of which 
are set out in note 30 to the accounts on pages 133 to 137.
Issue of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
relating to authority to allot shares and pre-emption 
rights, and any resolution of the Company in a general 
meeting, all unissued shares of the Company shall be at 
the disposal of the directors and they may allot (with or 
without conferring a right of renunciation), grant options 
over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons, at 
such times and on such terms as they think proper.

Directors’ Report
Articles of Association
The Articles (adopted in substitution for and to the 
exclusion of all existing articles by a special resolution 
passed on 20 January 2011) may only be amended 
by special resolution at a general meeting of the 
shareholders. A copy of the Articles is available on our 
website. 
Significant agreements: change  
of control
All of the agreements in relation to bank borrowings, 
convertible bonds and corporate bonds, to which the 
Company is party, contain provisions that allow the 
counterparties to terminate funding to the Company in 
certain circumstances where there has been a change 
of control of the Company. These are detailed within the 
financial instruments note to the accounts on pages 119 to 
127.
Rights and obligations attaching  
to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares 
are set out in the Articles.
Voting rights attaching to shares
On a show of hands, every member who is present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote. On a poll, every 
member who is present in person or by proxy shall have 
one vote for every share of which they are the holder.
Where shares are held by the Trustee of the Employee 
Benefit Trust and the voting rights attached to such shares 
are not directly exercisable by the employees, it is the 
Company’s practice that such rights are not exercised by 
the Trustee. Shares purchased by employees, along with 
matching shares, held in a SIP Trust are capable of being 
voted through a direction to the Trustee by the relevant 
employee.
Under the Companies Act, members are entitled to 
appoint a proxy, who need not be a member of the 
Company, to exercise all or any of their rights to attend 
and to speak and vote at a general meeting. A member 
may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a general 
meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise 
the rights attached to a different share or shares held by 
that member. A member that is a corporation may appoint 
one or more individuals to act on its behalf at a general 
meeting as a corporate representative.
Restrictions on voting rights attaching  
to shares
No member shall, unless the directors otherwise 
determine, exercise any voting rights either personally 
or by proxy at a general meeting if any call or other sum 
presently payable by him/her to the Company in respect 
of any share or shares remains unpaid. Otherwise, the 
Company is not aware of any arrangements between 
shareholders that may result in a restriction on voting 
rights attaching to shares.
Deadlines for exercising voting rights 
attaching to shares
Votes are exercisable at a general meeting of the 
Company in respect of which the business being voted 
upon is being heard. Votes may be exercised in person, 
by proxy, or by corporate representatives (in relation to 
corporate members). The Articles provide a deadline for 
the submission of proxy forms (electronically or by paper) 
of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the 
holding of the meeting or the adjourned meeting.
Shares in uncertificated form
Directors may determine that shares may be held in 
uncertificated form and title to such shares may be 
transferred by means of a relevant system or that shares 
should cease to be so held and transferred. 
Variation of rights attaching to shares
The Articles provide that rights attached to any class of 
shares may be varied with the written consent of the 
holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of 
the issued shares, or with the sanction of an extraordinary 
resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the 
holders of those shares. At every such separate general 
meeting, the quorum shall be two persons holding or 
representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value 
of the issued shares (calculated excluding any shares held 
in treasury). The rights conferred upon the holders of any 
shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in 
the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be 
varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking 
pari passu with them.
Transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares 
in the Company other than:
 ■ restrictions which may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading 
laws);
42
Enterprise Inns AR2015 Back.indd   42 07/12/2015   17:24:19 24341 .04    7 December 2015 5:19 PM    Proof 7
 ■ restrictions pursuant to the Company’s share dealing 
code whereby the directors and certain employees 
require approval of the Company to deal in the 
Company’s shares; and
 ■ where a person with an interest of at least 0.25% in the 
Company’s certificated shares has been served with a 
disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company 
with information concerning interests in those shares.
The Company is not aware of any arrangements between 
shareholders that may result in a restriction on the transfer 
of ordinary shares.
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the 
Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time 
declare dividends not exceeding an amount recommended 
by the directors. The directors may pay interim dividends 
whenever the financial position of the Company, in the 
opinion of the Board, justifies such payment. The Board 
may withhold payment of all or any part of any dividend or 
other monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares 
from a person with an interest of at least 0.25% if such a 
person has been served with a disclosure notice and has 
failed to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be provided by the 
Companies Act.
Appointment and replacement  
of directors
Unless determined by ordinary resolution of the Company, 
the number of directors shall not be less than two but 
is not subject to a maximum number. While a director is 
not required to hold any shares in the Company by way 
of qualification, the Company has adopted shareholding 
guidelines for executive directors which require them to 
build up and retain a holding of shares. Executive directors 
are expected to build up the required shareholding by the 
fifth anniversary of them joining the Board. Further details 
on directors’ shareholdings are contained in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 78.
The Board may appoint any person to be a director and 
such director shall hold office only until the next AGM, 
when he or she shall then be eligible for reappointment 
by the shareholders. The Articles provide that, at each 
AGM, all those directors who have been in office for three 
years or more since their election or last re-election shall 
retire from office. However, in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, all directors of the Company 
are subject to annual re-election.
Further details of the directors’ service contracts can be 
found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 80.
Powers of directors
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act and any 
directions given by special resolution, the business of the 
Company is managed by the Board who may exercise all 
of the powers of the Company to, for example: borrow 
money; mortgage or charge any of its undertaking, 
property and uncalled capital; and issue debentures and 
other securities, whether outright or as collateral security 
for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company.
The Company was authorised by shareholders at the AGM 
held on 5 February 2015 to allot, issue and make market 
purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares. This authority 
will expire at the 2016 AGM and the directors will be 
seeking a new authority for the Company to allot, issue 
and make market purchases of the Company’s ordinary 
shares. Further details are set out in the explanatory notes 
to the Notice convening the AGM on pages 156 to 175.
Directors’ indemnities
The Articles permit the Board to grant the directors 
indemnities in relation to their duties as directors, including 
third party indemnity provisions (within the meaning of 
the Companies Act) in respect of any liabilities incurred by 
them in connection with any negligence, default, breach of 
duty or breach of trust in relation to the Company. No such 
indemnities have been granted.
Compensation for loss of office
There are no agreements between the Company and its 
directors or employees providing for compensation for 
loss of office or employment that occurs as a result of a 
takeover bid. Details regarding change of control provisions 
in respect of share plan awards and other related 
agreements are included with the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. Further details of the directors’ service contracts 
can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
page 80.

Enterprise Inns AR2015 Back.indd   45 07/12/2015   17:24:23 Dear Shareholders,
Over the past two years, the Board’s priority has 
been to successfully execute the Chief Executive 
succession in February 2014, when Simon Townsend 
was appointed, and the addition of two non-executive 
directors, following planned retirements from the 
Board. This process was completed with the addition 
to the Board of Marisa Cassoni in April this year. We 
consider that the Board now has the appropriate 
skills and experience to challenge and support the 
execution of the Company’s five year strategy that was 
presented in May 2015.
It was also timely to commission an external Board 
evaluation this year, which concluded that the Board is 
performing very effectively.
The Board’s initiative of nominating individual non-
executive directors (including the Chairman) to 
mentor key executives below Board level, and their 
businesses, continues to be highly successful. The 
external evaluation concluded that we were a Board 
that “rolls up its sleeves” and keeps up to speed 
on business issues and change. We continued with 
our programme of holding Board meetings “on the 
road” to give the Board an extra opportunity to meet 
with key suppliers and advisers; meetings were 
also conducted in the operating regions to engage 
with publicans, to inspect investment schemes and 
consider commercial opportunities. For the coming 
year the Board’s overwhelming priority is to monitor, 
challenge, and encourage the successful execution 
of the Company’s five year plan. Each member of the 
senior executive team will attend Board meetings to 
update on delivery of key parts of the strategic plan.
Robert Walker 
Chairman

Governance Report
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014
The UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (Code) sets 
out guidance in the form of main principles and specific 
provisions on how companies should be directed and 
controlled to follow good governance practice. The rules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require listed 
companies incorporated in the UK to disclose, in relation 
to the Code, how they have applied those principles 
and whether they have complied with the provisions 
throughout the financial year.
The Company reviews its compliance with the Code 
regularly and considers that it has fully complied with 
the provisions of the Code that are applicable to it for the 
whole of the year ended 30 September 2015.
The Audit Committee Report on pages 51 to 57 , the 
Nomination Committee Report on page 58 and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 59 to 82 are 
also incorporated into this Report by reference. For further 
details on the Company’s compliance with the Code and 
the terms of reference for each of its Committees, see the 
Company’s website (www.enterpriseinns.com).
Leadership
Role of the Board
The Board has a collective responsibility for the 
effective oversight of the Group and its business and to 
promote the long-term success of the Company for its 
shareholders. Its role includes reviewing and approving 
key policies and decisions of the Company, particularly 
in relation to Group strategy and operating plans, 
governance and compliance with laws and regulations, 
business development, major investments and disposals 
and, through its Committees, financial reporting and risk 
management.
The Board has established a schedule of matters reserved 
for Board decision. This schedule details key aspects of the 
affairs of the Company which the Board does not delegate, 
including key strategic, operational and financial issues. A 
copy of the schedule of matters reserved can be found on 
the Company’s website.
The Board delegates to management the day-to-day 
operation of the business, subject to appropriate risk 
parameters. Board meetings are scheduled to coincide 
with key events in the Company’s financial calendar, 
including interim and final results and the AGM. Other 
meetings during the year will review the Company’s 
46
Enterprise Inns AR2015 Back.indd   46 07/12/2015   17:24:24 24341 .04    7 December 2015 5:19 PM    Proof 7
strategy and budgets for the next financial year and the 
Company’s key risks as well as reviewing each of the main 
operating functions (financial, commercial, operational and 
property).
Board Committees
Subject to those matters reserved for its decision, 
the Board has delegated to its Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees certain authorities. The 
terms of reference for each of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees are published on the 
Company’s website. Separate reports for each of these 
Committees are included in this Annual Report and 
Accounts from page 51 .
Role of the Chairman
Robert Walker is the Chairman and is responsible for the 
leadership and effectiveness of the Board, taking into 
account the interests of stakeholders and promoting 
the highest standards of governance. A summary of the 
Chairman’s responsibilities has been agreed by the Board, 
is set out in writing and is available on the Company’s 
website. In accordance with the Code, the Chairman met 
with the non-executive directors six times during the year, 
without the executive directors being present, to discuss 
in detail matters which they believed to be relevant for 
the purposes of the strategic business review, including 
key operational and financial issues, performance of the 
CEO and overall feedback arising from the external board 
performance evaluation process.
Role of the Senior Independent Director 
(SID)
David Maloney is the SID. He is available to shareholders, 
provides a sounding board to the Chairman and 
serves as an intermediary for the other directors if 
necessary. The SID’s role includes responsibility for the 
Chairman’s appraisal and succession. A summary of the 
responsibilities of the SID has been agreed by the Board, 
is set out in writing and is available on the Company’s 
website. In compliance with the Code, the SID met with 
the other non-executive directors during the year in a 
forum that did not include the Chairman or the executive 
directors.
Role of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
Simon Townsend is the CEO. The CEO is responsible 
for the preparation, evaluation and implementation of 
the Company’s strategic goals and in leading the senior 
management team. The role is distinct and separate to that 
of the Chairman and clear divisions of accountability and 
responsibility have been agreed by the Board, are set out 
in writing and are available on the Company’s website.
Role of the Company Secretary
Loretta Togher is the Company Secretary. The role of the 
Company Secretary is to develop, implement and sustain 
good governance practices. This includes supporting 
the Chairman and non-executive directors as necessary, 
managing Board and Committee meetings, facilitating the 
induction of new directors, ensuring appropriate directors’ 
and officers’ insurance is in place and that the Group 
is compliant with statutory and regulatory governance 
requirements. The written responsibilities of the Company 
Secretary have been agreed by the Board, are set out in 
writing and are available on the Company’s website.
Independence of directors
The Board has a strong independent element and at the 
date of this report currently comprises, in addition to the 
Chairman, two executive directors and four non-executive 
directors. The Chairman and all of the non-executive 
directors throughout the year are considered to be 
independent in character and judgement; they satisfied 
the criteria in the Code on appointment and continue to 
satisfy the criteria. The non-executives have a wide range 
of skills and experience; they constructively challenge 
management; help develop the Company’s strategy and 
have satisfied themselves as to the integrity of the Group’s 
financial information, controls and risk management 
strategy. Further information about how they have 
achieved this can be found in the Audit Committee Report 
on pages 51 to 57 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 59 to 82.
All directors may take independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense. There is a formal written 
procedure, available on the Company’s website, 
concerning independent professional advice and setting 
out clear guidelines which have been agreed by the Board.
At the date of this report David Maloney has been on 
the Board for over seven years and his reappointment 
is subject to a rigorous review. Peter Baguley and Adam 
Fowle have been on the board for three and two years 
respectively and their reappointment is also subject 
to rigorous review. Marisa Cassoni was appointed to 
the Board on 1 April 2015 and is, therefore, subject 
to reappointment at the forthcoming AGM. The Board 
believes that David Maloney, Peter Baguley, Adam Fowle 
and Marisa Cassoni continue to display all of the qualities 
of independence as set out in the Code.

Governance Report
Effectiveness
Meetings and attendance
The Board held eight scheduled meetings in the year under review. In addition, a strategic business review was held ‘off 
site’ at which high level strategic issues, including future business direction and its financial and operational implications, 
were reviewed and debated. The Board has an agreed approach for dealing with conflicts of interest in relation to matters 
which are scheduled for Board consideration, although no such conflicts arose during the year under review. If directors 
are unable to attend meetings in person then they are consulted prior to the meeting and their views made known to the 
other directors and/or they may attend the meeting or part thereof by telephone or other conference facility.
A monthly ‘board pack’ is prepared at the end of each financial period which includes an update on key performance 
targets, trading performance against budget and includes detailed financial data and analysis including a review of 
applicable financial covenants. Board papers are generally circulated seven days prior to meetings to ensure directors 
have sufficient time to review papers ahead of the meeting. Attendance at scheduled meetings is set out below:

(v) The executive directors have attended meetings of the Nomination Committee by invitation.
Training and development
The Company’s directors have a wide range of expertise 
as well as significant experience in strategic, financial 
and operational matters. All new directors receive a 
personalised induction programme designed to develop 
their knowledge and understanding of the Group, its 
culture and operations. On her appointment, Marisa 
Cassoni undertook such an induction, which included 
meetings with senior management across the Group and 
third party advisers such as the Company’s stockbrokers 
and legal advisers as well as visiting pubs and meeting 
publicans with regional management. New directors also 
participate in the mentoring programme described below.
All directors have access to management and to the 
advice of the Company Secretary, who regularly updates 
the Board on material governance and compliance issues.
The training and development needs of directors are 
reviewed and assessed by the Chairman as part of the 
annual Board performance evaluation process.
Business mentoring by non-executives
As mentioned briefly in the introduction, the Board 
continues with the allocation of operating sectors and 
central functions to non-executive directors, including 
the Chairman. Effectively, “putting the Board to work” . 
Each year non-executive directors are allocated an 
operating sector and/or central functions such as property, 
commercial or HR. The non-executive director is then 
encouraged, on their own initiative, to organise a series of 
regular contacts, meetings and visits throughout the year 
with his/her respective assignment. We then rotate these 
assignments every year.

This initiative continues to be highly successful; in effect 
integrating the Board more closely with the business, its 
field operations, new business and commercial activities.
Board evaluation
The Company commissioned an external Board evaluation 
during the year which was conducted by Duncan Reed of 
Condign Board Consulting. This process was led by the 
Chairman and Mr Reed. Each director took part in one-
to-one meetings with Mr Reed which covered headings 
circulated in advance and included:
 ■ overall impression of the Board including its dynamics, 
culture, climate, cohesion and quality;
 ■ organisation including agendas, meeting frequency, 
formal and informal processes, strategy sessions, 
information and support materials;
 ■ roles and contributions of individual members;
 ■ composition including size and balance, skill sets, 
independence, rotation, succession planning and talent 
management;
 ■ involvement and engagement including level of 
knowledge, relationship and mentoring and induction;
 ■ communications including with shareholders, investors 
and analysts;
 ■ overall effectiveness, including fulfilment of duties, 
broader expectations and checks and balances; and
 ■ performance of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees.
The one-to-one sessions were all conducted in confidence 
by Mr Reed, who then prepared a report for the whole 
Board. The results of the review (including progress against 
the previous year’s recommended actions) were delivered 
by Mr Reed, summarised by the Chairman and considered 
in detail by the whole Board. This year’s review, the first 
external evaluation commissioned by the Company, was 
primarily to cover the requirements of the Code but 
also encompassed a forward looking, constructive and 
developmental exercise. The evaluation found that the 
prior year’s actions had been fully implemented; that 
performance of the Board and its Committees continued 
to be effective in dealing with both day-to-day and on-
going strategic issues; that there was a strong desire to 
work through issues effectively and pragmatically; that 
the Board and Committee structure ensured that the 
governance requirements of the business were met and 
the internal processes were efficient and effective.
The CEO is responsible for regularly reviewing other 
executive directors’ performance against objectives and 
the CEO’s performance is assessed by the Chairman in 
consultation with the non-executive directors. In addition, 
the Remuneration Committee regularly reviews executive 
director performance in connection with their personal 
performance objectives. The Chairman’s performance 
is appraised by the SID in consultation with the non-
executive directors, taking into account the views of the 
executive directors, and the non-executive directors’ 
performance is reviewed by the Chairman. As a result 
of these individual reviews, it is considered that the 
performance of each director continues to be effective and 
that each director demonstrates sufficient commitment to 
their role. Consequently, the Chairman can confirm that 
each director is suitable for re-election or reappointment at 
the forthcoming AGM.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for proactively 
reviewing and refreshing the Board’s composition and 
further information about the roles and responsibilities of 
this Committee can be found on page 58.
Election of directors
The directors comply with the requirements of the Code 
and submit themselves for re-election every year, if 
they wish to continue serving and are considered by the 
Board to be eligible. Accordingly, the whole Board will be 
proposed for re-election or, in the case of Marisa Cassoni, 
reappointment at this year’s AGM.
Service agreements
The service agreements of the executive directors and 
copies of the letters of appointment of the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection during business 
hours on any weekday (excluding public holidays) at the 
registered office of the Company and will be available for 
inspection for fifteen minutes prior to, and during, the 
AGM.
External appointments
The executive directors may accept outside appointments 
provided that such appointments do not in any way 
prejudice their ability to perform their duties as executive 
directors of the Company. None of the executive directors 
currently hold any such outside appointments.
The role of non-executive director requires a time 
commitment in the order of 15 days per annum plus 
additional time as necessary to properly discharge their 
duties. There is no restriction on outside appointments 
provided that they do not prevent the director from 
discharging their responsibilities effectively.

Governance Report
Accountability
The Board should present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s position 
and prospects, maintain sound risk management and 
internal control systems and manage an appropriate 
relationship with the Company’s auditor.
Further information about how these principles have been 
applied is detailed in the Audit Committee Report on pages 
51 to 57.
Remuneration
Levels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract, 
retain and motivate directors of the quality required to run 
the Company successfully, whilst avoiding paying more 
than is necessary for this purpose, and there should be a 
formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on 
executive remuneration.
Further information about how these principles have been 
applied is detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 59 to 82.
Relations with shareholders
We are committed to, and place a great deal of importance 
on, having an active dialogue with our investor base. 
The Company maintains constructive engagement with 
its key stakeholders including institutional shareholders. 
During the year, our CEO and Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO) met with a number of our leading shareholders to 
discuss issues relating to the performance of the Group, 
strategy and new developments. In addition, the Chairman 
engaged with the majority of our top ten shareholders 
on a range of governance matters. The SID and the other 
non-executive directors are available to shareholders to 
discuss any matter they wish to raise. As part of changes 
planned for remuneration arrangements, during the year 
major shareholders were informed in advance and had 
the opportunity to discuss these with the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.
As regards governance issues, the Chairman aims to 
meet with most of our major shareholders shortly after 
each AGM. These meetings with shareholders are timed 
early in the process so that the Board has enough time to 
consider, and respond to, any shareholder concerns well 
in advance of the next year’s Annual Report. The Chairman 
normally contacts as many major shareholders as possible, 
and not simply the very largest, to ensure the widest 
consultation possible and also to ensure that the views of 
any shareholder who has substantially increased its stake 
during the year, have been fully taken into account.
Following the announcement of results, an investor 
relations report is produced for the Board which 
summarises feedback from shareholders and ensures 
the Board has a balanced view from our major investors. 
This was particularly key this year when we announced 
the outcome of the strategic review, enabling us to unlock 
the embedded value in every one of our assets, using 
the most appropriate operating model for each asset 
to secure the optimum level of income. The strategy 
evolves our business model, utilising consumer insight, 
to develop a plan for every pub in order to maximise value 
for shareholders. In addition, the Board receives a monthly 
updated analysis of the shareholder register and material 
movements in holdings.
The Company ensures that any price-sensitive information 
is released to all shareholders at the same time in 
accordance with regulatory requirements. All major 
presentations are available to shareholders through the 
Company’s website.
Shareholders may choose to receive the Annual Report 
either in paper form or electronically. This Report, along 
with a wide range of shareholder information including the 
interim report, is also available on the Company’s website. 
Additional information for shareholders can be found on 
page 158.
AGM
Shareholders receive at least 20 working days’ notice 
of the AGM. The AGM offers the opportunity for the 
Board, including the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees, to communicate the 
Company’s progress directly to shareholders. The Board 
aims to ensure that all members of the Board, including 
in particular the Chairmen of the Board committees, are 
available to answer questions at the AGM. To encourage 
shareholders to participate in the AGM process, the 
Company offers electronic proxy voting through the CREST 
service and all resolutions are proposed and voted on at 
the meeting on an individual basis by shareholders or their 
proxies. Voting results are announced on the same day 
as the meeting through RNS and made available on the 
Company’s website.
Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM to 
be held on 11 February 2016 can be found in the Notice 
convening the AGM on pages 152 to 153.

Audit Committee Report
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to present the report on the activities of the 
Audit Committee for the year ended 30 September 2015, 
and to be able to confirm, on behalf of the Board, that 
the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable.
In September 2014, the UK Financial Reporting Council 
(FRC) updated the Corporate Governance Code (the Code), 
applying to all companies with shares listed on the London 
Stock Exchange for financial reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 October 2014. Therefore Enterprise has 
applied the Code during the year ending 30 September 
2015.
The principle behind this updated guidance is to ensure 
that risk management and internal control are embedded 
in the business process by which a company pursues its 
objectives. 
While the Committee believes that the Group’s existing 
risk assessment process was sufficiently robust to 
comply with these latest guidelines, we have undertaken 
an additional exercise during the year which reviewed 
and improved our risk management processes. The 
exercise was undertaken with the assistance of external 
advisers, who were able to advise on current best practice 
on the format of documentation and reporting on risk 
management. 
As a result of this review we have enhanced the detailed 
documentation of the key risks to the business and 
sources of assurance on the effectiveness of the internal 
controls related to those risks, creating a Key Risks 
Register and Assurance Framework. This document has 
enabled us to focus on those areas of risk and controls 
that need to be considered on an on-going basis across 
the business; those principal risks and uncertainties that 
are of sufficient significance to be disclosed in the Annual 
Report; and also those material residual risks, that could 
still pose a significant threat to the viability of the business 
as a whole, so need to be fully considered as part of the 
viability statement process. As a direct consequence, 
we established a formal management risk committee to 
consider risks throughout the year going forward, have 
undertaken more detailed challenging of the risks and 
associated assurance sources and have also ensured that 
the Internal Audit focus can be directed to the most critical 
controls.
The Committee therefore ensures that the identification 
and management of all key risks is embedded across 
all areas of the business, with regular assessments to 
highlight the risks and to monitor the progress and status 
of the controls in place to mitigate that risk. This has also 
been embedded into the annual strategic review process 
to ensure that throughout the implementation of our new 
five year strategy, the risks associated with the changes 
are appropriately considered and controlled. We have 
ensured that this process has already commenced and all 
workstreams relating to the new strategic approach are 
appropriately considering the risk relating to those areas. 
Accordingly, going forward we will hold an additional 
Committee meeting to coincide with, and consider the 
output from, the annual strategic review process.
In line with prior years, the members of the Committee 
have spent time with the operations and property teams 
in the field and have also participated in key discussions 
on areas of financial judgement, such as the valuation 
meetings between the external auditor and professional 
valuers, so that we can better understand the risks and 
challenges facing the business.
We are satisfied that the business has maintained robust 
risk management and internal controls and that the internal 
audit programme is appropriately formulated to confirm 
that those controls are effective. The Company’s principal 
risks and uncertainties are set out on pages 32 to 38 and 
have been reviewed in detail by the Committee to ensure 
that we are comfortable that the business has addressed 
them appropriately within its on-going operating model 
and priorities.

Composition
The Committee was chaired during the year by myself, as 
the Board considers that, by virtue of my former executive 
and current non-executive director positions (full details of 
which are set out on page 44), I have current and relevant 
financial experience. The other non-executive directors, 
being Peter Baguley, Adam Fowle and Marisa Cassoni 
(from her appointment on 1 April 2015), form the rest of 
the Committee and the Board considers that the entire 
Committee is independent.
Roles and responsibilities
The Committee has been assigned with advising the Board 
in respect of its responsibility for ensuring the Annual 
Report and Accounts, when taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.
In addition, while the Board has ultimate responsibility 
for maintaining a robust framework of internal controls 
and risk management and for overseeing, reviewing 
and ensuring the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems, it has 
delegated the monitoring and review of this framework to 
the Committee.
The Committee therefore met three times during the year 
to consider all relevant information to enable it to assess 
and confirm that:
 ■ the interests of shareholders are protected in relation to 
financial reporting and internal control by monitoring the 
integrity of the annual and interim financial statements, 
monitoring any formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s financial performance and reviewing and 
challenging as necessary the judgements and actions of 
management in relation to the financial statements;
 ■ there is a sufficiently robust and effective external 
audit. Specifically, the Committee considers the 
independence of the external auditor, the appointment 
and reappointment of the external auditor and all 
reports from the external auditor in respect of the 
auditor’s review of the interim results, the audit plan 
for the year and the results of the annual audit. These 
reports included the scope of the interim review and 
annual audit, the approach to be adopted by the auditor 
to address and conclude upon key estimates and other 
key audit areas, the basis on which the auditor assesses 
materiality, the terms of engagement for the auditor 
and an on-going assessment of the impact of future 
accounting developments on the Group. To monitor its 
independence, the Committee annually reviews the 
remuneration, terms of engagement and objectivity of 
the external auditor, including its appropriateness to 
undertake non-audit work;
 ■ the internal audit programme is sufficiently robust to 
confirm the effectiveness of the Group’s controls. This is 
achieved by reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control and risk management 
systems, including the internal audit function, reviewing 
the Group’s systems and controls for preventing and 
detecting fraud and bribery and reviewing the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the Group’s arrangements for 
its employees to raise concerns about possible 
wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters. As 
part of the implementation of the new strategy, this 
included reviewing the evolving focus of the Internal 
Audit programme, which now includes retail audit 
resource focused on the controls in managed pubs;
 ■ the interim and year end results, preliminary 
announcements and the Annual Report and Accounts 
are fair, balanced and understandable to the Board. 
This involves reviewing the documents to ensure that 
the description of the business agrees with our own 
understanding, the risks reflect the issues that concern 
us, appropriate weight has been given to the ‘good 
and bad’ news, the discussion of performance properly 
reflects the ‘story’ of the relevant period and that there 
is a clear and well-articulated link between all areas of 
disclosure. This included extra consideration this year of 
the new Group strategy, announced in May 2015;
 ■ the principal risks and uncertainties have been 
appropriately identified and assessed, including 
reviewing internal processes used to identify and 
monitor all key risks and associated controls. The 
Committee reviewed those key risks and the quality 
of the assurance on the effectiveness of the controls 
that mitigate those risks, allowing it to conclude on the 
principal risks for disclosure and what, if any, material 
residual risks remain so that they could be factored into 
the assessment of Going Concern and the Group’s on-
going viability;
 ■ all key control policies and procedures in the business 
remain appropriate, including an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s whistleblowing policy; and
 ■ the Committee continues to operate appropriately for 
the circumstances of our business. As part of this, we 
review our terms of reference, we ensure that there is 
sufficient expertise and resource in the Committee’s 
composition for us to fulfil our responsibilities 
effectively and we perform an annual review of the 
Committee’s performance.

The Committee reports to the Board on how we have 
discharged our responsibilities. The full terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website, or on request 
from the Company Secretary.
Significant issues considered in relation 
to the financial statements
During the year the Committee, management and the 
external auditor considered and concluded on what 
the significant issues were in relation to the financial 
statements and how these would be addressed.
Valuation of the estate
The Group has a policy of accounting for its licensed 
estate at fair value based on an annual revaluation exercise 
performed by two independent valuation firms and an 
internal team of RICS qualified chartered surveyors. For 
this year’s exercise we decided to obtain a full external 
valuation of the Unique estate. This change means that 
approximately 92% of the Group’s estate, by value, is 
now being valued by external valuers, compared to 47% 
in prior years. The selection of the new valuation firm, 
Colliers International, was reviewed and approved by the 
Committee.
The value of property, plant and equipment is the 
largest number on the balance sheet and the resultant 
movements following the annual revaluation are also 
significant. The valuation of the pub estate, including 
assets held for sale, against the backdrop of continued 
difficult economic conditions is a key consideration. The 
Committee therefore focuses attention on understanding 
and challenging the valuation, and the appropriate 
accounting approach and disclosures, by reviewing the 
planned approach, the key assumptions, the valuation 
reports and other documentation analysing the outcome of 
the process.
In addition, I again attended the meeting held between 
the external auditor and each of the external independent 
professional valuers and the internal professional valuers. 
The purpose of the meeting is for the external auditors 
and myself, on behalf of the Committee, to understand 
and challenge (if appropriate) any assumption or material 
changes in valuation. To assist the discussion, detailed 
analysis is prepared by both management and EY which 
explores the underlying basis of, and conclusions reached 
in respect of, the annual valuation of the Group’s pub 
assets (further details of which are set out in note 17 to 
the accounts on pages 107 to 115). Any outliers in the 
valuation were also analysed in further detail.
Going concern and viability review
The Group has to comply with a number of financial 
covenants that relate to the financing structure of the 
Group as set out in note 23 on pages 119 to 127 of the 
accounts. Reaching a conclusion on the reliability of the 
budgets prepared by management is considered important 
to the Committee to ensure that covenants will not be 
breached and the Group will remain a going concern.
The Committee therefore reviewed, challenged and 
concluded upon the Group’s going concern review 
including giving due consideration to the appropriateness 
of key judgements, assumptions and estimates underlying 
the budgets that underpin the review and a review of 
compliance with key financial covenants. This also included 
a comprehensive review of the key risk factors impacting 
the Group and the assessment of the internal controls 
that mitigate this risk, together with reviewing how the 
risks have been considered in the assessment of going 
concern.
This process enabled the Committee, on behalf of the 
Board, to assess whether any material residual risks 
remained that could pose a significant threat to the 
viability of the business as a whole. The Committee also 
assessed over what period such a viability review would 
be appropriate. The impact of those risks that could affect 
the future viability of the Group over the next five years 
was then reviewed and the resilience of the Group to 
the occurrence of these risks, in severe yet plausible 
scenarios, evaluated. As a result of this analysis, the 
disclosures detailed in the Viability Statement, on page 38, 
were recommended to, and approved by, the Board.
Goodwill impairment review
In conjunction with the assessment of going concern 
and the Group’s future viability, the Committee reviewed 
and approved the Group’s impairment review in respect 
of its tangible and intangible fixed assets. Following the 
strategic review in the year the Group now allocates 
its goodwill across the operating segments identified, 
requiring impairment to be tested by operating segment. 
Included in the key assumptions underlying the 
impairment review was the discount rate utilised in such 
calculations in relation to last year and those used by other 
companies in the industry (see note 15 on pages 105 and 
106 of the accounts). The Committee concluded it would 
not be appropriate to change the rate at the current time.

Deferred tax
The provisioning for deferred tax remains a complex 
area requiring the Group to reflect the interaction 
between multiple elements of tax legislation and the 
specific requirements of IFRS. The application of these 
requirements to a pub estate comprising in excess of 
5,000 individual assets, introduces further risks which are 
addressed through the use of detailed tax models against 
information held on an asset by asset basis.
The Committee ensures that adequate resource is 
dedicated to the on-going maintenance of these tax 
models, that the output of these models is subject to 
robust and rigorous internal review and that, where 
necessary, management have validated the manner in 
which tax legislation and/or IFRS should be applied with 
our external tax adviser and, where appropriate, the 
external auditor.
Approach to appointing the external 
auditor and how objectivity and 
independence are safeguarded relative 
to non-audit services
The Company’s policy on the independence of auditors 
is consistent with the ethical standards published by 
the Audit Practices Board. We also comply with the 
Competition and Markets Authority Order 2014 relating to 
audit tendering and the provision of non-audit services, as 
discussed further below.
Independence safeguards and the 
reappointment of the external auditor
The reappointment of EY as the Group’s external auditor 
(incumbent since the Company started trading in 1991) 
was reviewed during the year. The audit was put out to a 
market tender during 2012, with EY chosen to continue 
with the audit services and KPMG appointed for taxation 
services. As the Group will be required to tender the audit 
for the year ending 30 September 2021, in accordance 
with recent EU regulations, it is planned to initiate a 
tender process ahead of time to allow for the audit to 
be moved to another firm of auditors for that financial 
year. These plans will be kept under annual review and if 
legislation changes, or there are any concerns as to EY’s 
independence, the quality of their audit or the service 
levels, then the audit tender might be undertaken sooner.
In accordance with best practice and professional 
standards, external auditors are required to adhere to a 
rotation policy whereby the audit engagement partner 
is rotated after five years. The most recent audit partner 
rotation was in 2011 and the current audit partner’s five 
year term ends at the forthcoming AGM. EY will therefore 
rotate their audit partner ahead of the 2016 audit and the 
Committee is satisfied that the new engagement partner 
has the experience and industry knowledge to be the lead 
audit partner.
Independence and non-audit services
A key issue that could impair auditor independence, and 
the auditor’s objective opinion on the Group’s financial 
statements, is the engagement of the external auditor for 
the provision of non-audit services.
The Group’s policy on engaging the external auditor for 
non-audit services is therefore designed to ensure that 
such engagements do not result in the creation of a 
mutuality of interest between the auditors and the Group, 
that a transparent process and reporting structure is 
established to enable the Committee to monitor policy 
compliance and that unnecessary restrictions on the 
engagement of auditors for non-audit services are avoided 
where the provision of advice is commercially sensible and 
is more cost effective than other providers.
The policy specifies:
 ■ services that are specifically not permitted – this 
includes work relating to accounting records that 
will ultimately be subject to external audit, valuation 
services, remuneration advice for key management 
and the provision of strategic advisory or consultancy 
services;
 ■ services that are permitted with prior approval of the 
CFO – this includes accounting advice and reviews of 
accounting standards and advice, due diligence matters 
as required by debt prospectuses, assurance work in 
respect of tax matters including tax compliance, routine 
tax planning and tax advisory services; and
 ■ services that are permitted with prior approval of the 
Committee – this includes any new engagement for an 
individual service or specific project other than defined 
within the above two categories.

The CFO reports to the Committee annually outlining all 
proposals considered during the year and the decisions 
taken, any proposals which the Committee is or has been 
requested to approve and the current level of expenditure 
for non-audit fees.
The total fees paid to the external auditor during the year 
under review amounted to £250,000. Of this amount, 
£12,000 related to non-audit services, being work 
associated with our financing activities. This is work 
that would normally only be performed by the external 
auditor as it requires confirmations to third parties, such 
as Trustees, as to the correct extraction of data from our 
accounting records. Full details are set out in note 17 to 
the accounts on pages 107 to 115.
Independence and performance 
assessment by the Committee
The Committee has assessed the independence of the 
external auditor and is satisfied that their independence 
is not impaired due to the fact that the audit engagement 
partner rotation policy has been complied with; the level 
and nature of the fees paid for non-audit services was of 
a level that does not present any on-going threat to their 
independence and a separate external firm is appointed for 
taxation advisory services.
The Committee has authority to take independent advice 
as it determines necessary in order to resolve issues on 
auditor independence. No such advice was required during 
the year and there are no contractual restrictions over 
choice of auditor.
The Committee also reviewed the external auditor’s 
performance, taking into account input from management, 
consideration of responses to questions from the 
Committee and the audit findings reported to the 
Committee. As part of the process, the Committee 
reviewed the auditor’s performance against criteria 
consistent with that adopted in the prior year.
In addition to the above, I, on behalf of the Committee, 
met with the external auditor and with the Director of 
Internal Audit without the presence of management 
during the year and I have had regular contact with the 
audit engagement partner during the year. Robert Walker 
also had two private meetings with the audit engagement 
partner during the year.
Based on all of this information the Committee concluded 
that the external audit process was operating effectively, 
that EY remains sufficiently independent and that it 
continued to prove effective in its role as external auditor. 
The Committee has therefore recommended to the Board 
to propose to shareholders the reappointment of EY as 
auditor until the conclusion of the AGM in 2017. Full details 
are set out in the Notice convening the AGM on pages 152 
to 153.
Role of internal audit
Internal audit is independent of business operations, 
undertaking an on-going programme to provide assurance 
on the adequacy of internal control and risk management 
processes across the Group’s operations. It is responsible 
for reviewing and reporting on the effectiveness of internal 
controls and risk management systems to the Committee 
and, ultimately, the Board. The Director of Internal Audit 
attends Committee meetings to present the findings of 
such reviews at regular intervals throughout the year and 
reports on internal audit’s performance against the agreed 
annual internal audit plan, such plan being agreed during 
the year by the Committee.

Audit Committee Report
Effective risk management and internal 
control
The system of internal controls is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Operating policies and controls are in place, and have been 
in place throughout the year under review, and cover a 
wide range of issues including financial reporting, capital 
expenditure, information technology, business continuity 
and management of employees. Detailed policies ensure 
the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements including the 
consolidation process. The key elements of the Group’s 
on-going processes for the provision of effective internal 
control and risk management systems include:
 ■ established organisational structure with clearly defined 
lines of responsibility and levels of authority;
 ■ documented operational and controls policies and 
procedures;
 ■ regular Board meetings to consider matters reserved 
for directors’ consideration;
 ■ an annual Board corporate strategy review to assess 
the appropriateness of the current business strategy 
and any potential changes to the future Group strategy. 
In future years this process will also include an Audit 
Committee meeting to incorporate a formal review of 
material business risks and uncertainties facing the 
business. This additional Committee meeting will be 
facilitated by third party risk consultants to ensure that 
the Board can consider the latest best practice risk 
management advice and approaches;
 ■ regular review by the Board of financial budgets, 
forecasts and covenants with performance reported to 
the Board monthly;
 ■ regular management reporting, providing a balanced 
assessment of key risks and controls;
 ■ a detailed investment process for major projects, 
including capital investment coupled with a post-
investment appraisal analysis;
 ■ the establishment of a formal management risk 
committee during the year, responsible for on-going 
maintenance of the risk register and evaluation of 
controls and assurances, reporting its findings back to 
the Committee. The initial meeting of this management 
risk committee considered the year end reporting 
position, recommending the appropriate disclosures 
on the principal risks and uncertainties, and will meet 
quarterly in future years; and
 ■ an internal audit function which implements the annual 
internal audit plan and provides independent assurance 
to executive management, the Committee and the 
Board on the effectiveness of internal controls and risk 
management. This includes evolving the internal audit 
plan to ensure that it focuses, where relevant, on the 
highest risk areas identified in the Key Risk Register and 
Assurance Framework.
In reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control the Committee has:
 ■ received six-monthly self-assurance statements 
completed by key senior managers confirming that 
controls and risk management processes in their 
business units have operated satisfactorily. These 
returns are reviewed in detail by the Director of 
Internal Audit and challenged where appropriate by the 
management risk committee, which updates the risk 
register;
 ■ received and reviewed the risk register, including 
detailed analysis of the key financial and accounting 
controls that provide assurance to mitigate the key 
risks, and proposed principal risks and uncertainties 
disclosures, which were then approved for use in the 
Annual Report and Accounts; and
 ■ met with the Director of Internal Audit, without 
management being present to discuss their remit and 
any issues arising from internal audits carried out, 
reviewed all the internal audit reports and monitored 
management’s responsiveness to the findings and 
recommendations of those reports.
In respect of Group financial reporting, the finance 
department is responsible for preparing the Group financial 
statements using a well-established consolidation process 
and ensuring that accounting policies are in accordance 
with IFRS. All financial information published by the Group 
is subject to approval by the Committee. There have been 
no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting during the year under review that has materially 
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the

Following advice from the Committee, the Board has 
confirmed that it is satisfied that we have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. As a result it has 
concluded that an effective system of internal controls 
and risk management processes are in place which 
enable the Company to identify, evaluate and manage key 
risks and which accord with the FRC’s Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting 2014.
While the Committee believes that the Group’s risk 
management process was sufficiently robust from the 
start of the financial year and up to the date of approval 
of the accounts, we have been reviewing and improving 
the processes and documentation during the year. Further 
details of risk management frameworks and the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the business can be found 
on pages 32 to 38.
Anti-bribery and corruption code of 
conduct
The Group is committed to conducting its business with 
the highest degree of integrity, including a zero tolerance 
approach towards all forms of bribery, corruption, fraud 
and theft and procedures within the Company have been 
designed to minimise these risks. The Group has in place 
an anti-bribery and corruption code of conduct which has 
been formally approved by the Board and extends to all of 
the Group’s business dealings and transactions involving 
its directors, officers, employees or third parties including, 
but not limited to, agents, advisers, contractors, publicans 
or suppliers engaged in business with the Group. 
Engaging in fraud, bribery or corruption is unlawful and 
any employee, director or officer found to have breached 
the code of conduct will be liable to disciplinary action 
which may result in dismissal or other serious sanctions. 
Breaches of the code of conduct by third parties may 
result in immediate termination for breach of all contracts 
with the Group. A copy of the code of conduct is available 
on the Company’s website. There have been no recorded 
instances of bribery or corruption during the period under 
review.
Whistleblowing
The Group has in place a whistleblowing policy, which is 
reviewed annually, that encourages employees to report 
any malpractice or illegal acts or omissions or matters of 
similar concern (whether in the UK or elsewhere) by other 
employees or former employees, contractors, publicans, 
suppliers or advisers using internal mechanisms for 
reporting. The policy acts as a mechanism to report any 
ethical wrongdoing or malpractice or suspicion which may 
amount to ethical wrongdoing or malpractice. Examples 
of ethical wrongdoing or malpractice include bribery, 
corruption, fraud, dishonesty and illegal practices which 
may endanger employees or other parties. There have 
been no material instances of whistleblowing during the 
year under review.
Accountability
The Board is required to present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s financial 
position and prospects. The responsibilities of the directors 
and external auditor are set out on pages 83 and 150. As 
set out in the Directors’ Report, the directors consider the 
Company’s business is a going concern.

Nomination Committee Report
Dear Shareholders,
The Nomination Committee is responsible for monitoring 
the performance, appropriateness and future succession 
of the Company’s executive and Board talent. Following 
planned executive and non-executive retirements and 
successful replacements to the Board, we are now in a 
position of having both the appropriate mix of skills and 
experience, as well as future stability, to monitor the 
execution of the Company’s ambitious five year strategy. 
The Committee’s main focus in 2015 was therefore 
completing the addition of Marisa Cassoni as a non-
executive director to the Board as well as planning and 
supporting management in identifying experienced and 
high quality new talent for the senior management team. 
Continuing to ensure the Company has the right senior 
talent in place to execute the Company strategy will 
remain a priority of the Committee for the coming year.
Robert Walker 
Chairman, Nomination Committee
Composition
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Committee was composed of all of the non-executive 
directors, being Robert Walker, David Maloney, Peter 
Baguley, Adam Fowle and Marisa Cassoni (from date of 
appointment).
Roles and responsibilities
The key roles and responsibilities of the Committee are:
 ■ identify and nominate for Board approval, candidates 
to fill Board vacancies having regard to, amongst other 
things, the benefits of diversity including gender, as and 
when they arise;
 ■ act proactively, recognising it is important to plan Board 
succession well in advance and for all scenarios;
 ■ ensure that the Company’s Board and executive 
leadership skills are fully aligned to the Company’s long-
term strategy;
 ■ succession planning for directors and other senior 
executives taking into account the challenges and 
opportunities facing the Company; and
 ■ ensure any appointees have sufficient time to undertake 
their role.
In planning the appointments, the Committee prepares a 
full description of the role, skills and capabilities required; 
appoints external search firms, each time reviewing 
available options, and ensuring that the firm selected has 
signed up to the relevant industry codes (for example, on 
diversity) and has no connection with the Company; and 
finally, engages from time-to-time with the Group’s major 
shareholders on future skills requirements and ideas for 
potential candidates.
In addition, the Committee takes care to ensure that there 
is a continuous pipeline of high-performing executive 
talent beneath Board level who are nourished. In this 
sense the Nomination Committee provides a broader 
human resources planning role and the Chairman of the 
Committee continues a mentoring role (see page 48) with 
the senior manager responsible for human resources. The 
effectiveness of the Committee was considered as part of 
the external Board evaluation process.
What the Committee did in 2015
The main focus of the Committee’s work in 2015 included:
 ■ completing, with the support of an independent third 
party executive search firm, the search for a non-
executive director with extensive financial experience 
in line with succession planning strategy culminating 
in the appointment of Marisa Cassoni on 1 April 
2015. Marisa is a chartered accountant and finance 
professional with 40 years experience and is currently 
a panel member of the Competition and Markets 
Authority and thus ensuring that there is a clear 
succession plan as regards financial reporting. In this 
search process, the Committee paid due attention to 
gender diversity;
 ■ continuing to review the senior management structure 
and talent below Board level and senior appointments 
to the business as part of accommodating the 
requirements of the new strategy and organisation 
structure to deliver that with a focus on people 
development and the attraction, retention and 
management of talent in general; and
 ■ reviewing the Committee’s terms of reference, and 
conducting the annual review of the Committee’s 
performance.
Diversity
We pursue diversity, including gender diversity, throughout 
the business, and the Board endorses the aspirations 
of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills 
and Lord Davis of Abersoch’s agenda for more Women 
on Boards. While we are not committing to any specific 
targets for the number of women on the Board we 
continue to consider and make appointments based on 
merit with the overriding objective of appointing the best 
candidate. As part of our early non-executive succession 
planning, we focused our search on suitably qualified 
and experienced women who may be available for a 
future appointment, but who would also be eligible to be 
appointed on merit. We use executive search firms who 
have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct setting 
out the seven key principles of best practice to abide by 
throughout the recruitment process and we continue to 
follow a policy of appointing talented people at every level 
to deliver high performance. In addition, 43% of the total 
workforce in the Company are female, including 6 out of 
17 senior managers.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Information not subject to audit: 
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to introduce our Remuneration Report for the 
2015 financial year.
Business performance and  
incentive impact
In the year under review the business completed the 
stabilisation of the leased and tenanted estate via 
operational improvements demonstrated by positive 
like-for-like income growth delivered for the second 
consecutive year. In February 2015 shareholders approved 
the structure of new share plans relating to executive 
directors annual bonus and Long-Term Incentive 
arrangements together with a new policy on Directors’ 
Remuneration. In May 2015 we announced the outcome 
of a strategic review which aims to unlock the embedded 
value in every asset within our property portfolio, using the 
most appropriate operating model to secure the optimum 
level of income. Every asset within the portfolio will either 
be operated within the tied tenancy model, diverted to 
our new managed business, let as commercial premises 
or, where the route to optimal value is disposal, will be 
earmarked for future sale. This represents a complete 
overhaul of our business model. The Chief Executive 
Officer and his management team have worked closely 
with the Board to launch the new strategy and with it 
the clearly stated goal to deliver a new business with 
significantly improved earnings potential and growth in 
shareholder value. 
The Company is making good progress implementing 
the strategic plan. Work has continued to reinvigorate our 
core tied leased and tenanted business, introducing more 
flexibility and continuing to attract ambitious publicans to 
run their own businesses in our estate. The operational 
focus has continued to be on improving publican 
profitability which has helped deliver an 18% reduction in 
business failures in the year under review. The expansion 
of the managed business progresses well with 35 trading 
pubs at 30 September 2015 and a pipeline in place going 
forward which should accelerate the growth. The growth 
in the commercial property portfolio has continued where 
we incur minimal overhead and require lower capital 
expenditure. 
The Group is committed to working in partnership with its 
publicans to unlock the potential of every one of its pubs, 
which will be achieved by ensuring each pub is at the heart 
of the community it serves, and providing the right retail 
offer for its customers and under the optimal operating 
model for the location.
Overall performance has generated annual bonus pay-outs 
for the executive directors in respect of the 2015 financial 
year in the range of 61% to 63% of weighted average 
base salary, compared with for the current executives 
between 71% to 73% in the prior year. Further details 
are provided on page 74 on how performance under the 
annual bonus targets translated into bonus payments. 
The performance and matching awards granted under the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) in respect of plan year 
2011 met the threshold total shareholder return (TSR) 
target and vested in full in January 2015. In accordance 
with the applicable regulations, we are required to show 
the full award in the single figure of remuneration table in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration, although only one-
third of the awards became exercisable in January 2015; 
the remaining two-thirds will become exercisable in equal 
tranches in January 2016 and January 2017 , subject to the 
continued employment of the executives. The LTIP awards 
granted in respect of plan year 2012, which are based on 
TSR performance to December 2015, will be measured at 
the end of the performance period.
Incentive review
The Remuneration Committee’s (the Committee) key 
focus is to reward management appropriately but not 
excessively and to incentivise them to deliver the primary 
target for our shareholders – that of improved shareholder 
return. Our 2020 strategy represents the most significant 
change in the history of our business and the core 
focus for management over the next five years. As a 
consequence, the Committee has taken a fresh look at 
the remuneration policy in light of the new strategy and 
has reviewed the incentive arrangements to ensure that 
they are aligned with the new strategy. If the strategy is 
delivered effectively, the outcome will be a smaller estate, 
comprising higher quality assets, generating a greater 
level of average EBITDA and resulting returns per asset. 
The overall objective is to progressively reduce the gap 
between our share price and net asset value to deliver 
increased shareholder value. We have been through a 
rigorous process, supported by our advisers, to arrive at 
what we consider to be a robust and commercial approach 
to take us to 2020.
Given the changes proposed to the incentive 
arrangements the Company will be seeking a binding vote 
at its forthcoming AGM on a new policy to implement the 
2020 reward structure, which is to take effect from the 
date of the AGM. Shareholder approval will also be sought 
for an amendment to the rules of the 2015 LTIP , necessary 
to reflect that reward structure and policy. The changes are 
described in this report and have been developed following 
consultation with our major shareholders.

In summary, these changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy are as follows
Policy change Rationale
Incentive opportunity: quantum and time horizon
Annual bonus and LTIP
Annual bonus potential to be increased to 150%  
of salary for each of the Company’s 2016, 2017 and  
2018 financial years (compared to a current policy  
limit of 125% and a maximum bonus opportunity for 2015 of 
100%). 
50% of any bonus earned above target will continue to be 
deferred into shares for three years. 
LTIP opportunity for the Company’s 2016 financial year to be 
increased to 175% of salary (compared with a current policy 
limit of 150% of salary and 2015 grants of 125% of salary) 
based on up to a three month average share price up to the 
date of grant. 
That number of shares will then be fixed for the grants in 
respect of the Company’s 2017 and 2018 financial years. 
Awards will continue to vest after a three year performance 
period and be released in three tranches on the third, fourth 
and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
The increased incentive opportunity is positioned between upper 
quartile and median for the LTIP and around upper quartile as 
regards the annual bonus opportunity (compared to the FTSE 250). 
The Committee strongly believes this to be appropriate given:
 ■ the significant ambition in the 2020 strategy as outlined above; 
 ■ the fact that the increase in quantum is also being combined 
with additional stretch in performance required to deliver this 
quantum, (as discussed below); and
 ■ this also recognises that we are recruiting at our Executive 
Management Group level to ensure that we have the skill set 
we need internally to deliver on our strategy and we need 
to be confident that we can continue to attract high calibre 
management and, importantly, to retain the existing strong 
management team to deliver the 2020 strategy. 
The fixed number of LTIP shares for the 2017 and 2018 awards 
aligns the executives with shareholders by reference to movement 
in the share price. For the avoidance of doubt, the number of 
shares will not be increased if the share price falls.
The Company intends to seek shareholder approval for a new 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy no later than its 2019 AGM, and 
anticipates that policy would revert to market median levels of 
incentive opportunity. 
Incentive opportunity: metrics
Annual bonus and LTIP
In accordance with the 2015 bonus opportunity, a bonus of 
up to 80% of salary may be earned based on EPS targets 
and up to 20% of salary subject to individual personal and 
strategic targets. Up to an additional 50% of salary may be 
earned based on strategic goals aligned to the achievement 
of the 2020 strategy. 
LTIP awards will vest based on stretching targets relating to 
relative TSR, Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and Free 
Cash Flow (FCF). 
The strategic goals aligned to the 2020 strategy on which the 
additional annual bonus opportunity are based will be key lead 
indicators and the Committee firmly believes these will have a good 
line of sight for the management team. 
TSR and ROCE remain relevant performance metrics for the 
Company. FCF is added as a performance metric to provide a 
key measurement of the output of the 2020 strategy as well as 
providing a link to debt reduction and opportunity to deliver value to 
shareholders.

Policy change Rationale
Incentive opportunity: targets
LTIP targets have been calibrated so that management will 
not receive substantially more for delivering the same level of 
performance as under the current policy.
The threshold level of vesting for LTIP awards has been 
reduced from 25% of maximum opportunity to 20% of 
maximum opportunity. 
Delivering stretch TSR performance (upper quartile) and 
stretch ROCE performance (budget + 1%) in line with the 
2015 LTIP , and achieving stretch FCF targets delivers the 
same value as under the maximum 2015 LTIP award (125% 
of salary). 
Additional stretch for the maximum enhanced LTIP 
opportunity will be based on delivering upper quintile TSR 
performance and additional stretch FCF performance. 
Reducing the threshold level of vesting maintains broadly the same 
vesting percentage of salary at threshold as under the 2015 LTIP 
awards. 
Participants will not receive substantially more for delivering the 
same level of performance. 
The additional stretch targets for the increased LTIP opportunity 
to vest reflect the ambitious strategy and are considered a real 
challenge to deliver. 
Base salary
It is intended that any increases in executive directors’ base 
salaries would not exceed increases awarded to the wider 
workforce, and any increase awarded would be based on 
merit. 
This commitment was made to shareholders as part of our dialogue 
with them in formulating the new policy. 
Shareholding guidelines
Increase the required shareholding policy to 200% of salary 
for the CEO and 150% of salary for the CFO. 
Further aligns the interests of executive directors with those of 
shareholders and promotes long-term stewardship. 
The Committee believes these changes are in the 
best interests of the Company and fully support the 
execution of our new strategy. 
We remain firmly committed to a responsible 
approach in respect of executive pay. Salary reviews 
for the executive directors have not yet been 
conducted for the financial year ending 30 September 
2016. Any reviews will be effective on 1 January 2016 
and I anticipate increases, if any, would be modest, as 
they were last year, and as referred to above they will 
be in line with the Group’s average pay increase and 
prevailing market conditions. Other benefits, including 
pension provision, will be maintained at existing levels 
or by reference to existing percentages of base salary 
as applicable.
The Committee recognises the expectations of our 
shareholders on executive pay and we were pleased that 
the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report received a 99.96% 
vote in favour at the last AGM and the policy report a 
97.82% vote in favour, along with good support for the new 
share plans at the 2015 AGM. At the AGM to be held on 
11 February 2016, shareholders are invited to approve the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the amendment to the rules of the 2015 LTIP 
necessary to reflect the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

Role of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for considering and making recommendations to the Board on the:
 ■ general policy on executive and senior management remuneration;
 ■ overall remuneration packages for executive directors including base salary, pensions, benefits and performance-
related short-term and long-term incentives;
 ■ Chairman’s remuneration; and
 ■ design and operation of the Company’s share incentive plans.
The Committee reports to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities and operates within agreed terms 
of reference, a copy of which is available on the Company’s website or on request from the Company Secretary. 
Details of the members of the Committee and of the advisers to the Committee are provided in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 72.
POLICY ON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION
The Committee regularly reviews the executive directors’ 
remuneration packages to ensure that they take account 
of the Company’s specific circumstances and are aligned 
to the Company’s key strategic objectives as set out in 
the Strategic Report on pages 02 to 38. In formulating the 
remuneration policy, the Committee:
 ■ considers market practice (both in terms of the size and 
structure of executive remuneration);
 ■ takes into consideration pay practices elsewhere within 
the Group;
 ■ encourages open dialogue and consults with major 
shareholders when looking to make material changes to 
the remuneration policy;
 ■ ensures that incentive structures for executive directors 
do not raise any environmental, social or governance 
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
behaviour; and
 ■ ensures with regard to the overall remuneration 
structure, there is no restriction on the Committee 
which prevents it from taking into account 
environmental, social or governance matters or indeed 
any other operational/financial risks that relate to the 
Company’s business.
The Committee continues to believe that the policy and 
approach (described more fully in the policy table) allows 
the Company to operate the remuneration arrangements 
in a way which promotes the long-term success of the 
Company and remains both relevant and appropriate in 
terms of the balance between:
 ■ fixed and variable pay, ensuring a significant proportion 
of the overall remuneration package is performance-
related; 
 ■ short-term and long-term incentive pay; and
 ■ cash-based and share-based remuneration.
The Committee also believes that the performance-related 
elements provide rewards which reflect an appropriate 
balance between the performance of the Group and 
individual performance and aligns the rewards of executive 
directors with the long-term interests of the shareholders 
and the Company’s strategic goals.
Directors’ remuneration policy
This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 
of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended). 
This report sets out the Company’s remuneration policy 
for 2016 and beyond. A binding resolution to approve this 
policy will be put to shareholders at the AGM.
How the views of shareholders are taken 
into account
The Committee takes into account the views of 
shareholders. This year the Committee Chairman has 
discussed the proposed changes to the policy, relevant 
metrics and proposed uplift in the level of awards with 
major shareholders and governance bodies. The response 
and feedback has helped to formulate the design, level 
and metrics of the new proposed policy. Details of votes 
cast for and against the resolutions to approve last year’s 
Remuneration Report and Directors Remuneration Policy 
and the new share plans approved at the 2015 AGM are 
provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 
80 and 81 . 
How employees’ pay is taken into 
account
The Committee liaises with senior managers in the 
Group, in particular the HR Director, to ensure pay and 
employment conditions (e.g. base salary levels and 
reviews, pension provision, the structure of annual 
bonuses and long-term incentive provision and other 
benefits) of the wider Group as a whole are taken into 
account when framing the executive remuneration policy. 
However, the Committee has not specifically consulted 
with employees when drawing up the policy or used any 
remuneration comparison measures between directors 
and employees.

The charts illustrate the potential rewards available under the remuneration policy for the 2016 financial year as 
summarised in the table above. The values assume a constant share price and do not take into account share price 
fluctuation or dividends/dividend equivalents that may be received on the share awards. Therefore the amounts that 
ultimately vest to directors under the deferred shares and LTIP arrangement may be higher or lower than set out above. 
The potential monetary rewards available for performance in line with expectations under the annual bonus and LTIP 
are provided for illustration only and do not reflect formal policy decisions that these amounts are received. Although 
the percentage of salary delivered for performance in line with expectations is greater under the policy for 2016 than 
under the policy for 2015, the Committee has calibrated the performance targets such that management will not receive 
substantially more under the 2016 policy for delivering the same level of performance. 
Salary levels (on which other elements of the package are calculated) are based on those applying from 1 January 2015 
onwards (£464,600 for Simon Townsend and £378,750 for Neil Smith). The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost 
of supplying those benefits (as disclosed in the table on page 73) for the year ended 30 September 2015. 
The executive directors can also participate in all-employee share schemes on the same basis as other employees. 
The value that may be received under these schemes is subject to limits specified in the relevant tax legislation. For 
simplicity, the value that may be received from participating in these schemes has been excluded from the above charts.

Base salary Core element of fixed 
remuneration reflecting 
the individual’s role and 
experience. 
Salaries are ordinarily reviewed annually, with any changes normally taking effect from 
1 January each year.
There is no maximum salary level set. For directors in office 
as at the date of approval of this policy, it is intended that any 
increases in base salary would not exceed increases awarded 
to the wider workforce, and any increase awarded would be 
based on merit. When considering salary levels and whether

account a variety of factors including: Company performance, 
individual performance, experience and responsibilities, 
promotion, relevant market information and the % level of 
increase being offered to the wider workforce. 
Not applicable.
Benefits To provide a market 
competitive reward 
package and promote the 
well-being of employees.
Benefits normally comprise a car allowance or use of a motor car, fuel, private medical, 
travel, accident and legal expenses insurance, directors’ and officers’ insurance and 
life assurance. The benefit provision is reviewed periodically. Other benefits may be 
provided based on individual circumstances, which may include relocation costs.
No maximum value is set but the Committee periodically 
monitors the overall value of the benefits package and 
provides benefits at a level which the Committee considers 
to be appropriately positioned taking into account relevant 
market levels based on the nature and location of the role and 
individual circumstances.
Not applicable.
SIP and 
SAYE
All-employee offers to 
motivate and to facilitate 
share ownership.
The SIP and SAYE schemes are reviewed annually and if offered are offered to all 
eligible employees. 
An executive director can participate by paying up to £500 
per month (or such other limit as may be permitted under the 
relevant legislation) (SAYE) and £1,800 per annum (or such 
other limit as may be permitted under the relevant legislation) 
(SIP) into these tax advantaged all-employee schemes. Under 
the SIP the Company may match the shares up to a 2 for 
1 basis or such other basis as may be permitted under the 
relevant legislation.
Matching shares granted under the SIP are subject to a holding 
period prescribed under relevant legislation and continued 
employment, but no other performance conditions.
Pension To aid retention and to 
remain competitive in the 
market place. 
Contribution to a personal pension arrangement or cash in lieu of pension by way of a 
salary supplement (or a combination thereof). 
25% of salary. Not applicable.

To motivate executives 
and incentivise the 
achievement of key 
financial and strategic 
goals and targets over the 
financial year. 
Deferral of part of the 
bonus into shares 
provides alignment with 
shareholders.
Performance targets are reviewed annually and any pay-out is determined by the 
Committee after the year end based on targets set for the year. 
The Committee has discretion to amend the pay-out should any formulaic output not 
reflect the Committee’s assessment of overall business performance.
50% of any bonus earned above the bonus earned for target performance will be 
deferred into shares for three years (Deferred Share Award), although the Committee 
may determine not to defer any amount of a bonus earned where the amount to be 
deferred is so small as to make, in the opinion of the Committee, the application of 
deferral unduly administratively burdensome. Directors may be permitted to defer a 
greater proportion of any bonus into a Deferred Share Award. Dividend equivalents 
may be paid on vested shares under Deferred Share Awards as described in the 
“Opportunity” column. 
Deferred Share Awards may vest early in the event of a change of control or other 
relevant corporate event or on cessation of employment, as described on pages 68 
and 70.
Clawback may be applied, at the discretion of the Committee, in the event of 
material misconduct, material misstatement of results, a calculation error and/or poor 
information used when calculating the reward outcome. 
In addition, in the case of Deferred Share Awards granted in respect of bonuses 
from 2015 onwards, at any time prior to the third anniversary of the award date, the 
Committee may reduce or cancel a Deferred Share Award or impose further conditions 
on such an award in the event of material misstatement of results, a material failure of 
risk management or serious reputational damage. 
The maximum bonus potential is 150% of salary for the CEO 
and the CFO in respect of each of the Company’s 2016, 2017 
and 2018 financial years. 
Dividend equivalents (in cash or shares) may be paid on 
vested shares under Deferred Share Awards in respect of 
dividends that would have been paid on vested shares in 
respect of dividend record dates occurring between the grant 
date and the date of vesting. The dividend equivalents may 
assume the reinvestment of dividends.
The bonus is normally based on a mix of financial targets and 
individual strategic and/or personal objectives, with financial 
performance normally accounting for a majority of the overall bonus 
opportunity. No bonuses will be payable unless a minimum level of 
financial performance has been achieved.
Notwithstanding the achievement of the performance targets, any 
bonus payable will be determined by the Committee in accordance 
with the plan rules, including the Committee’s right to exercise its 
discretion fairly and reasonably in any circumstances which the 
Committee considers it appropriate to do so. 
The element of the bonus subject to financial measures will 
be earned between 0% and 100% for performance between a 
“threshold” level of performance (the minimum level of performance 
that results in any pay-out) and maximum performance, with 50% of 
the maximum opportunity for target performance. 
Vesting of the bonus in respect of strategic and individual objectives 
will be between 0% and 100% of the maximum opportunity for 
those elements based on the Committee’s assessment of the extent 
to which the relevant objective has been met.
Details of the performance targets set for the year under review and 
performance against them are provided on page 74 of the Annual 
Report on Remuneration, together with details of the bonus metrics 
to be used for the forthcoming financial year.

and incentivise delivery 
of performance over the 
long-term and to facilitate 
share ownership. 
Annual awards of performance shares are made which are based on performance over 
three years and vest after three, four and five years in equal tranches. 
The performance awards will be granted in accordance with the rules of the LTIP , as 
approved by shareholders, and the discretions contained therein. 
Dividend equivalents may be paid on vested shares under LTIP awards as described in 
the “Opportunity” column.
Clawback may be applied, at the discretion of the Committee, in the event of 
material misconduct, material misstatement of results, a calculation error and/or poor 
information used when calculating the reward outcome.
In addition, at any time prior to the third anniversary of the end of the period over 
which the applicable performance condition is measured, the Committee may reduce 
or cancel an award or impose further conditions on an award in the event of material 
misstatement of results, a material failure of risk management or serious reputational 
damage. 
An LTIP award may be granted to an executive director 
in respect of each of the Company’s 2016, 2017 and 2018 
financial years over a fixed number of shares. The number 
will be such number of shares as have a market value at the 
date of the awards in respect of the 2016 financial year equal 
to 175% of the executive director’s base salary. For these 
purposes, the market value of a share will be determined by 
the Committee which may calculate the number of shares 
by reference to an average share price over a period of up to 
three months. The number of shares over which an award 
may be granted in respect of any financial year may be varied 
by the Committee to take account of any variation in the 
Company’s share capital, demerger or other similar event 
which in the opinion of the Committee may affect the market 
value of the shares.
Dividend equivalents (in cash or shares) may be paid on 
vested shares under LTIP awards in respect of dividends 
that would have been paid on vested shares in respect of 
dividend record dates occurring between the grant date and 
the date of vesting. The dividend equivalents may assume 
the reinvestment of dividends.
Performance measures for LTIP awards granted in respect of the 
Company’s 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years will be based on 
ROCE, TSR and FCF . 
Awards will vest at 20% of maximum for threshold performance, 
increasing to 100% of maximum for maximum performance. 
No vesting will occur in respect of the relative TSR measure where 
performance is below median.
The performance measures for awards to be granted under the 2015 
LTIP in respect of the Company’s 2016 financial year are set out on 
pages 81 and 82. 
Ordinarily, LTIPs are subject to continued employment and vest in 
equal tranches after three, four and five years.

Ordinarily, the Chairman and non-executive directors’ remuneration takes the form 
solely of fees. The Chairman’s fee is approved by the Board on the recommendation 
of the Committee. Fees for the non-executive directors are approved by the Board, 
on the recommendation of the Chairman and the executive directors. The Chairman 
and non-executive directors may be eligible to be reimbursed for any reasonable hotel 
and travel expenses and other reasonable expenses incurred in performance of their 
duties.
The non-executive directors are not involved in any discussion or decisions about their 
own remuneration.
Additional fees, over and above the base fee for the non-executive directors, are 
payable to the Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and to the Senior 
Independent Director. 
Details of the current fee levels are set out in the Annual

Notes to the policy table:
The application of the policy for 2016 is set out on pages 81 to 82.
Legacy share plans
Executive directors hold awards under the 2005 and 2015 LTIP , the 2005 and 2015 Annual Bonus Plan, the 2005 SAYE 
and the 2005 SIP . 
Share plan Operation Opportunity Performance measures
2005 LTIP Used for long-term incentive 
awards up to 2014. 
Awards of performance shares 
which are based on performance 
over three years and vest after 
three, four and five years in equal 
tranches. 
In addition, investment shares 
(worth up to 25% of salary) 
received by the executive directors 
through the annual bonus plan or 
acquired through other funds are 
eligible for a matching share award. 
No further awards are granted 
under the 2005 LTIP . 
Performance share awards and 
matching share awards held by 
executive directors are set out in 
the table on page 76.
The performance measures 
applying to outstanding 
performance share awards and 
matching share awards held by the 
executive directors under the 2005 
LTIP are summarised on page 76.

and 2005 SIP
All-employee share plans used for 
awards up to 2014. 
Since the end of 2014 no further 
awards are granted under the 2005 
SAYE and 2005 SIP . 
Outstanding awards or options held 
by the executive directors are set 
out on page 77.
Not applicable.
Operation of share plans
The Committee will operate its current and legacy share plans in accordance with their rules. Share awards under the 
2015 LTIP and Deferred Share Awards may be made in the form of conditional share awards, options (including nil cost 
options) or forfeitable share awards. Awards granted over shares may be settled in cash. In the event of a variation of the 
Company’s share capital or a demerger, special dividend or other event which, in the Committee’s opinion may affect the 
price of shares, the Committee may alter the terms of awards under its share plans and the number of shares subject to 
those awards in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan. 
Subject to approval at the 2016 AGM the remuneration policy will be amended, as referred to below, when compared 
with the policy approved by shareholders at last year’s AGM. 
 ■ the maximum annual bonus opportunity will be increased to 150% of salary; and
 ■ the maximum award under the LTIP will be increased to 175% of salary and grant of awards over a fixed number of 
shares, as described in the policy table above. 
The rationale for the changes is set out in the letter from the Committee Chairman on pages 59 to 62.
Change of control
In the event of a change of control of the Company or other relevant corporate event, unvested share awards will usually 
vest. In the case of any LTIP award for which the performance period has not ended, the number of shares in respect 
of which the award vests shall be determined by applying the performance conditions and, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise, time prorating by reference to the period from grant to early vesting as a proportion of 36 
months. Any LTIP award for which the performance period has ended will vest in respect of all the shares subject to 
it, subject to satisfaction of the performance condition. Deferred Share Awards shall vest in respect of all of the shares 
subject to them. 
68
Enterprise Inns AR2015 Back.indd   68 07/12/2015   17:24:43 24341 .04    7 December 2015 5:19 PM    Proof 7
Awards under the Company’s all-employee share plans will vest early in the event of a change of control of the Company, 
in accordance with the rules of those plans. 
If a demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event is proposed which, in the opinion of the Committee would affect 
the price of shares in the Company, the Committee may permit awards under the LTIP and Deferred Share Awards to 
vest early in whole or in part. 
Choice of performance measures
The annual bonus is based on a mix of financial and individual strategic targets as regards a bonus of up to 100% of 
salary, with measures based on the financial, operational and strategic priorities of the business which may vary from 
year to year as appropriate to reflect the changing needs of the business. A sliding scale of targets is set for the financial 
measures so as to drive significant improvements in business performance. A bonus of up to a further 50% of salary 
may be earned based on strategic goals aligned to the achievement of the 2020 strategy. Following the determination of 
the bonus by reference to the targets for the relevant financial year, the proportion deferred into a Deferred Share Award 
is not subject to any further performance condition. 
Subject to shareholder support the performance measures for awards to be granted under the 2015 LTIP in respect of 
2016, 2017 and 2018 will be based on:
 ■ Relative TSR – this is well understood by all stakeholders and clearly aligns management’s objectives with those of 
shareholders. Relative TSR is a broad measure of the extent to which our strategy is considered appropriate by the 
market as well as the extent to which it is being well-implemented. Targets will be set based on a “point to point” 
measurement, by comparing the three month average TSR ending on the first/last day of the performance period.
 ■ ROCE – a key driver of shareholder value and which reflects the Group’s planned further enhancement of a quality 
estate. The introduction of ROCE alongside relative TSR therefore fully supports strategy. In our view, this is a critical 
and challenging objective in the context of declining returns over many years in the pub sector as a whole.
 ■ FCF – this provides a key measurement of the output of the 2020 strategy as well as providing a link to debt 
reduction. 
The weightings and targets for the awards to be granted in respect of 2016 are set out on pages 81 and 82. 
The Committee may vary any performance measure if an event occurs which causes it to determine that it would be 
appropriate to do so, provided that any such variation is fair and reasonable and (in the opinion of the Committee) the 
change would not make the measure less demanding. If the Committee were to make such a variation, an explanation 
would be given in the next Remuneration Report. 
SAYE options and awards under the SIP are not subject to performance conditions in line with the treatment of such 
awards for all employees and in accordance with the applicable tax legislation. 
Interaction with the policy for employee pay
There are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the executive directors (as set out 
above) compared with that for other employees within the organisation. This reflects differing levels of seniority and 
responsibility. For example, there is an increased emphasis on performance related pay for executive directors through 
a higher annual bonus opportunity and participation in the LTIP . This aligns the interests of directors with the long-term 
performance of the Company and the interests of shareholders. In 2015 for the first time the LTIP was extended to the 
next tier of management and it is intended to continue to include that tier in LTIP awards going forward.
Service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that, ordinarily, the period of notice for executive directors will not exceed 12 months and 
accordingly, the employment contracts of the executive directors are terminable on 12 months’ notice by either party. 
The Company may terminate a director’s employment without notice or compensation in the event of gross misconduct.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Payments for loss of office
In the event of a director’s departure, the Company’s policy on termination payments is as follows:
 ■ the Company will pay any amounts it is required to in accordance with or in settlement of a director’s statutory 
employment rights;
 ■ the Company may pay salary, benefits and pension in lieu of notice and observe the other contractual entitlements of 
a director;
 ■ the Company will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is warranted in each individual case and where 
appropriate, the Company will seek to apply the principles of mitigation to any proposed payment;
 ■ there is no entitlement to bonus following notice of termination (or cessation of employment) and ‘bad leavers’ will 
not receive any bonus in such circumstances. However, the Committee’s normal policy is that where the individual 
is considered a ‘good leaver’, a performance-related bonus may be paid which would typically be prorated for time. 
The performance measures used to determine the bonus payment may be on a different basis to that applying to 
the other executive directors depending on the timing and circumstances of the director’s departure. Time prorating 
will usually be based on the proportion of the bonus year for which the individual is employed and the bonus (if any) 
will usually be paid at the normal time, although the Committee retains discretion to pay it earlier in appropriate 
circumstances. If at the time the bonus is paid, the individual is under notice or has left employment, all of the bonus 
may be payable in cash; and
 ■ in the event of a director’s departure, any outstanding share awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant 
plan rules, as follows:
Plan T reatment on cessation
2005 LTIP and 
2015 LTIP
Awards will ordinarily lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, in some circumstances such as death, injury, retirement (at the discretion of the Committee in the case 
of the 2015 LTIP), sale of the employer out of the Group and any other circumstances at the discretion of the 
Committee (taking into account the individual’s performance and reasons for their departure), ‘good leaver’ status 
may be applied. In the case of a good leaver:
(i) unvested LTIP awards where the performance period has already ended will fully vest on leaving unless, in 
the case of an award granted under the 2015 LTIP the Committee determines it should vest on the originally 
anticipated vesting date; and
(ii) unvested LTIP awards where the performance period has not already ended will vest either at the end of 
the performance period or on the date of cessation as determined by the Committee or, if the Committee so 
determines in the case of an award granted under the 2015 LTIP , on the originally anticipated vesting date. A 
good leaver will normally receive a prorated proportion of any outstanding LTIP awards (prorated from the date 
of grant to the date of cessation of employment), normally subject to performance over the usual three year 
period. The Committee may decide to measure performance over a shorter period to the end of employment 
and may waive in whole, or in part, prorating, but this would only be in exceptional circumstances.
Deferred  
Share  
Awards
Awards will ordinarily lapse on cessation of employment if cessation is before the third anniversary of the date  
of grant. 
However, in some circumstances such as death, injury, retirement (at the discretion of the Committee in the 
case of the 2015 annual bonus plan), sale of the employer out of the Group and any other circumstances at the 
discretion of the Committee (taking into account the individual’s performance and reasons for their departure), 
‘good leaver’ status may be applied. In the case of a ‘good leaver’ unvested Deferred Share Awards will vest 
in full on cessation or, if the Committee so determines in the case of an award granted under the 2015 Annual 
Bonus Plan, on the originally anticipated vesting date. 
All-employee 
share plans 
(SAYE and SIP)
Awards will vest in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan, which do not permit the exercise of any 
discretion by the Committee. 
Where appropriate the Company may enable the provision of outplacement services to a departing director and make 
payments in respect of accrued holiday and legal fees.

The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith in 
discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement 
or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a director’s office or employment. 
Where a “buyout” or other award is made outside the Company’s existing share plans as referred to below, the leaver 
provisions would be determined at the time of the award. 
The contracts of the executive directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of 
the Company or for liquidated damages. 
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new executive director will typically be set in accordance with the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy as set out on pages 64 to 67 , subject to the discretions below. 
The salary level for a new appointment will be set taking into account the individual’s experience, the nature of the role 
being offered and their existing remuneration package.
The maximum level of variable remuneration that may be granted in connection with recruitment (excluding any 
“buyout” award as referred to below) will be in line with the Company’s approved directors’ remuneration policy (i.e. an 
LTIP award over a number of shares determined in accordance with that policy and an annual bonus of up to 150% of 
salary).
If an executive director is appointed at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long-term 
incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance, subject to the limit on variable 
remuneration, the quantum in respect of months employed during the year may be transferred to a subsequent year so 
that reward is provided on a fair and reasonable basis. 
In relation to long-term incentive and bonus awards, different performance targets, performance periods and vesting 
periods may be set to those applying to the other executive directors in the first year of appointment, if the Committee 
determines that the circumstances of the appointment merit such alteration.
In addition, the Committee may offer further cash, benefits and/or share–based elements (including awards under 
9.4.2(R) of the Listing Rules) as necessary to secure an appointment and “buyout” remuneration arrangements forfeited 
on leaving a previous employer – any such payments would take account of the remuneration relinquished when leaving 
the former employer, for example, reflecting the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that 
remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. 
For an internal appointment, any variable pay or benefit element granted in respect of the prior role may be allowed to 
pay out or be provided according to its terms. 
Relocation expenses or allowances may be paid as appropriate.
Chairman and non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment, the terms of which take into account best practice. Their 
respective appointments continue on an annual basis from AGM to AGM, subject to re-election. There are no special 
provisions in the non-executive directors’ letters of appointment for compensation in the event of loss of office. A 
summary of the letters of appointment for non-executive directors is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on 
page 80.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous 
Remuneration Reports. Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration as they arise as required under the regulations.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This Annual Report on Remuneration sets out how the Company’s remuneration policy for directors was implemented 
during the year under review. This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(as amended) and 9.8.8R of the Listing Rules. An advisory resolution to approve this report will be put to shareholders at 
the forthcoming AGM. The information on pages 73 to 78 as indicated has been audited. 
Composition of the Committee
The Committee has been constituted and operated throughout the year in accordance with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The Committee comprised the following non-executive directors: 
 ■ Peter Baguley, Chairman
 ■ David Maloney
 ■ Adam Fowle 
 ■ Robert Walker
 ■ Marisa Cassoni, appointed on 1 April 2015
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters being decided. The Company’s CEO 
attends meetings by invitation of the Committee except where his own remuneration is being discussed. The Committee 
receives assistance from the Company Secretary as appropriate and the Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
Committee. 
Advisers
During part of the year under review, the Committee received external advice on directors’ remuneration matters from 
Deloitte LLP , appointed by the Committee in 2014, as its independent adviser. Deloitte also provided services in relation 
to estate segmentation modelling. 
Deloitte is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily operates under its Code of 
Conduct in relation to executive remuneration in the UK. During the year the Chairman of the Committee reviewed the 
performance of Deloitte, in terms of the quality and independence of advice, the potential for conflicts of interest (which 
are actively managed within Deloitte) and its knowledge and understanding of market practice. Having reviewed these 
factors, the Committee chose to continue to retain Deloitte as its adviser in 2016.
The total fees paid to Deloitte were £38,000. The fees charged for major projects are normally negotiated in advance of 
the work being undertaken. However, an element of the fees relates to sundry on-going advice, in line with Deloitte’s 
role to provide on-going support to the Committee over the entire remuneration year and are predominantly charged on a 
‘time spent’ basis. 
Fees for the Chairman and non-executive directors
The fee policy for the Chairman and non-executive directors for the year under review from 1 January 2015 was as 
follows:
 ■ Chairman – £204,000
 ■ Base Board fee – £56,610
 ■ Additional fees for chairing the Audit or Remuneration Committee – £6,120
 ■ Additional fees for the Senior Independent Directorship – £2,040

(i) Taxable benefits include car allowances or use of a motor car, fuel, private medical, travel, accident and legal expenses insurances.
(ii) This comprises either direct contributions to personal pension arrangements or cash in lieu of directors’ pension contributions (these sums are not 
included in any bonus or share incentive award calculations). Of the amounts shown, the element for 2015 relating to salary supplements in lieu of 
contributions are £115,000 (2014: £83,000) for Simon Townsend, £94,000 (2014: £70,000) for Neil Smith.
(iii) The 2015 bonuses were payable based on EPS performance and individual personal and strategic targets. Bonus pay-outs ranged from 61% to 63% 
of salary (2014: 71% to 83% including former directors). Half of any award over target performance (50% of salary) is deferred into shares. Simon 
Townsend deferred a sum equivalent to 9% of his bonus (5.5% of salary) into deferred shares (2014: 40% of bonus) and Neil Smith deferred a sum 
equivalent to 10% of his bonus (6.5% of salary) into deferred shares (2014: 40% of bonus). Deferred shares ordinarily vest after 3 years and are not 
subject to any further performance conditions. Details of the bonuses earned are set out on page 74. 
(iv) The performance period for the 2011 performance and matching awards ended on 3 January 2015. The award was subject to a TSR performance 
condition and the Company’s TSR performance was in the upper quintile of the comparator group of the FTSE 250 at the date of grant. The awards 
were achieved in full, and vest in 3 equal tranches in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Simon Townsend and Neil Smith have both exercised the first tranche. The 
second and third tranches are not subject to any further performance condition. Accordingly, in the LTIP figure in the above table, the value of the full 
award has been included, calculated using the share price on the date of vesting of 110.2 pence.
(v) The SIP is an all-employee share plan under which in December 2014 the Company matched on a 1:1 basis shares purchased up to a value of £1,500. 
The 1:1 basis used values the matching shares at the date of grant at £1,500. Continued employment and a three year holding period apply to the 
matching element. In accordance with HMRC requirements no performance conditions are set. 
(vi) Adam Fowle was appointed to the Board on the 6 February 2014.
(vii) Marisa Cassoni was appointed to the Board on 1 April 2015.
(viii) Ted Tuppen retired from the board on 6 February 2014 and remained an employee until 19 May 2014. From May 2014 until November 2014 (12 months 
after his notice of intention to retire) he was paid in lieu of notice on a monthly basis. In the Company’s 2015 financial year Mr Tuppen was paid £87 ,000 
in lieu of notice (2014: £416,000 of salary or salary in lieu of notice), together with taxable benefits of £6,000 (2014: £30,000) and salary supplement in 
lieu of pension contributions of £22,000 (2014: £104,000) no bonus was payable (2014: £150,000).

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual bonus 2015
Awards under the plan are subject to demanding performance targets. For the year under review, 80% of Simon 
Townsend and Neil Smith’s bonus was subject to a sliding scale of challenging adjusted basic EPS targets, with 20% 
subject to challenging individual personal and strategic targets, although no bonus is payable under this element of the 
bonus plan unless a threshold level of adjusted EPS performance is delivered. 
Executive directors defer 50% of any bonus earned over target into shares with the remainder paid in cash (executive 
directors can choose voluntarily to defer more of the award into shares if they so wish). 
A ‘clawback’ provision exists under which the Committee can seek appropriate means of redress in the event of 
material misconduct, material misstatement of results, an error in the calculation or due to poor information used when 
calculating the reward outcome. Redress can be sought through: (i) the lapsing of unvested Deferred Share Awards, 
which may result in a corresponding lapse of matching share awards under the 2005 LTIP; (ii) a reduction in future bonus 
pay-outs; and (iii) the reclaim of previously paid bonuses (net of tax). 
EPS targets
The adjusted EPS targets for the bonus plan were set at the beginning of the year and reflected the outlook at that time 
taking into account the Company’s plans to generate cash and pay down debt. 
The targets for the proportion of the bonus based on EPS are set out in the table below. For performance between the 
EPS targets specified, a straight–line sliding scale applies. 
Award level
(% weighted 
annual salary) EPS
Below threshold 0% Less than 18.3p
Target 40% 19.3p
Maximum 80% 20.3p
Actual performance 44% 19.4p
Personal and strategic targets
Each executive director was given a number of different personal and strategic objectives individually tailored to their 
role and the needs of the business in the year now under review. Different weightings were applied to each objective. 
The precise objectives and weightings are considered by the Company to be commercially sensitive. In summary 
the objectives included conclusion and delivery of the strategic review of the five year strategy to 2020, managing 
transitional and preparatory arrangements in readiness for the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act, leading 
improvements in employment and customer engagement, driving reductions in business failures, routing capital 
expenditure towards growth projects, road mapping IT development and delivery of a consumer based segmentation 
model. The weightings applied were broadly distributed over the objectives. The objectives and achievements were 
carefully considered by the Committee and weightings given to each individual component. Achievement was above 
target and in total payments of between 17% and 19% of salary were generated (out of a maximum of 20% of weighted 
average base salary).
Overall bonuses earned
The total bonuses earned for the year (out of a maximum bonus potential of 100% of average weighted salary) were as 
follows:
Simon T ownsend 61% of salary (2014: 71%)
Neil Smith 63% of salary (2014: 73%)
50% of any bonus earned above 50% of salary (the bonus earned for target performance) is deferred into shares. Simon 
Townsend has deferred an amount equivalent to 5.5% of his salary and Neil Smith has deferred an amount equivalent to 
6.5% of his salary.

(i) Face value is calculated as the value of the shares on the respective date of grant of each award, except as noted in (iii) below. 
(ii) This reflects the actual number of shares granted on 12 December 2014. As explained in the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report, this figure was 
previously based on an estimated market value of shares. 
(iii) The share price at which the number of deferred shares granted under the bonus plan is calculated will not be confirmed until after the date of 
approval of the accounts. The number of deferred shares awarded for the 2015 financial year is therefore estimated by using the closing mid-market 
price of the shares on 30 September 2015, being 108.20 pence. The number of shares granted along with the actual grant and exercise dates will 
therefore be revised to reflect the result on the actual date of grant, when an announcement will be made to shareholders. 
Deferred shares ordinarily vest after 3 years and are not subject to any further performance conditions.
£1 in aggregate is payable on the exercise of each year’s award under the bonus plan.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP has been operated from 2005 to 2014 under the 2005 LTIP and since 2015 under the 2015 LTIP . Under the 2005 
LTIP two types of award could be made: 
 ■ an award of ‘performance shares’, worth up to 150% of salary each year; and
 ■ an award of ‘matching shares’ linked to the co–investment of up to 25% of salary in ‘investment shares’, which were 
then matched on a 2:1 basis.
Shares that counted as ‘investment shares’ were: 
 ■ shares subject to a Deferred Share Award under the bonus plan; and 
 ■ shares acquired by participants using their cash bonus or other funds, up to a maximum of 25% of salary. 
Under the 2015 LTIP there is no matching share element.

(i) The 2011 LTIP awards were based on TSR performance and vested in full in January 2015. One-third of the award became exercisable in January 2015 
and the remaining two-thirds will become exercisable in equal tranches in January 2016 and January 2017 , subject to continued employment.
(ii) The 2012, 2013 and 2014 LTIP awards are based on a policy of using a five day average share price (following the date of the announcement of the 
results for that year) to determine the number of shares comprising the LTIP award. This was 76.3 pence for those granted in December 2012, 148.1 
pence for those granted in December 2013 and 108.4 pence for those granted in February 2015 in respect of 2014. The 2011 LTIP award is based on a 
notional share price of 86.1 pence.
(iii) Plan Years 2011-2013, the performance conditions applying to these awards are solely based on relative TSR performance, which compares the 
Company’s TSR performance over the three year performance period with the TSR of the FTSE 250 as follows: 
Company’s TSR ranking v the FTSE 250  
over the three year performance period 
Percentage of performance share  
award that vests
Level of matching share award  
(matching award shares: investment shares)
Below median 0% 0:1
Median 0% 0:1
Upper quintile 100% 2:1
(iv) Plan Year 2014 – The performance conditions applying to these awards are based on relative TSR (as regards 70% of the award) and ROCE 
performance (as regards 30% of the award) as set out in the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
 Straight-line vesting will occur if the Company’s TSR ranking is between the median and upper quintile/quartile (as appropriate) and for ROCE 
performance between threshold and maximum. As with previous LTIP awards, vesting occurs in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth 
anniversaries of the grant. In addition, irrespective of the Company’s TSR or ROCE performance, awards will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that 
the TSR or ROCE result is reflective of the Company’s underlying financial performance over the relevant period. 
£1 in aggregate is payable on the exercise of each year’s LTIP award.

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
During the year under review, Simon Townsend purchased 1,405 shares under the SIP at 106.8 pence per share (2014: 
1,094 at a price of 137.0 pence per share). These shares were matched by the Company on a 1:1 basis (2014: 2:1) 
conditional upon continued employment. The face value of the shares awarded under the matching arrangement was 
£1,500 (2014: £3,000). Details of the total partnership and matching shares held under the SIP are included in the table 
of directors’ interests below. 
Dilution limits
Whilst the Company has authority and retains discretion to issue new shares and/or treasury shares under its 
employees’ share plans, since 1 October 2004 the Company’s policy has been to satisfy all awards and options granted 
under the Company’s executive share schemes and all-employee share incentive plans using existing shares purchased 
in the market by the Trustees of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust). At 30 September 2015 no new shares 
or treasury shares have been issued to satisfy awards or options granted in the previous ten years under any of the 
Company’s employee share incentive plans and, as at 30 September 2015, the total number of shares held in the Trust 
was 6,568,286 equivalent to 1 .3% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company, excluding treasury shares.
Directors’ share interests 
Since 2011 share ownership guidelines have existed for the executive directors which require them to build up and retain 
a holding of shares equal in value to their base salaries. Subject to the approval of the new Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy at the 2016 AGM, these requirements will be increased to two times’ salary for the CEO and one and a half 
times’ salary for the CFO. Executives are expected to build up the required shareholding by the later of: (i) the fifth 
anniversary of the introduction of the guidelines in 2011 (or, as regards any additional element following the revision of 
the guidelines in 2016, the fifth anniversary of that revision); and (ii) the fifth anniversary of them joining the Board; and 
they are required to retain 50% of the net of tax vested awards under the LTIP and/or Deferred Share Awards until the 
guidelines are met. The directors either already hold the required shareholdings under the guidelines or are not yet at the 
anniversary dates for them to do so.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
The interests of the directors who held office during the period from 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015 in the 
ordinary shares of the Company are as set out in the table below:

(i) Beneficial share interests include partnership and matching shares held under the SIP of 38,626 shares for Simon Townsend at 30 September 2015 
(2014: 35,816 shares).
(ii) Full details of LTIP awards, including performance conditions and exercise periods, are set out in the table on page 76.
(iii) Full details of Deferred Share Awards, including exercise periods, are set out in the table on page 75. The calculation of the deferred shares awarded 
for 2015 is estimated by using the closing mid-market price of the shares on 30 September 2015, being 108.2 pence. The number of shares granted, 
along with the exercise dates will therefore be revisited to reflect the result on the actual date of grant, when an announcement will be made to 
shareholders. The 2014 disclosure above has been similarly adjusted.
In respect of directors serving at 30 September 2015, save for contributions to the SAYE scheme, there have been no 
other changes in share interests from 30 September 2015 to the date of this report.
The directors are not permitted to hold their shares in hedging arrangements or as collateral for loans without the 
express permission of the Board. None of the directors currently holds their shares in such an arrangement. 
The following information has not been subject to audit:

compared with movement of the average remuneration (per head) for all Group employees. As noted in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2014, the salary, benefits and bonus figures for the CEO for 
2014 are calculated on the basis of the salary, benefits and bonus of the former CEO for the period he was CEO until 
6 February 2014 and for Simon Townsend his prorated salary from 6 February 2014, benefits and bonus (which are all 
attributable to the period he was CEO to 30 September 2014).

benefits, pension, bonus and SIP of the former CEO for the period he was CEO until 6 February 2014 and for Simon 
Townsend his prorated salary from 6 February 2014, benefits, pension and bonus (which are all attributable to the period 
he was CEO from 6 February 2014).
The total remuneration includes the full value of the LTIP which vested in the year, one-third of which was exercised and 
the second and third tranches are exercisable in 2016 and 2017 and are not subject to any further performance condition.

Application of the policy for 2016
Base salaries and fees
At the date of this report the Committee has not reviewed the salaries for the executive directors which take effect on 
1 January 2016. It is anticipated that any increase will be modest, would not exceed the increases awarded to the wider 
workforce and would be based on merit. 
Also at the date of this report the fees for the Chairman and non-executive directors effective from 1 January 2016 have 
not been reviewed. The fee policy is as set out on page 72. 
The two all-employee share plans, SAYE and SIP , will be considered on an annual basis and may be offered subject to the 
limits permitted under the relevant legislation.
Annual bonus 2016
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2016 AGM the maximum bonus opportunity for the 2016, financial year will 
be increased to 150% of salary for all executive directors: an award of up to 80% of salary may be earned subject 
to the achievement of a sliding scale of adjusted basic EPS targets; up to 20% of salary may be earned subject to 
personal and strategic targets; and up to a further 50% of salary may be earned subject to the achievement of specific 
strategic milestones connected to the delivery of the new strategy. The Committee considers that the forward looking 
EPS targets, the personal strategic objectives and the strategic targets based on the 2020 strategy are commercially 
sensitive at this time and has therefore chosen not to disclose them in advance. Details of the EPS targets will 
be set out retrospectively in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration, and we are committed to disclosing the 
strategic measures and performance against them on a retrospective basis. The personal measures are focused 
on three to four lead indicators of performance and the strategic targets based on the 2020 strategy will include 
measurable targets based on: number of new experts under our managed model; number of managed sites; number of 
commercial properties; and average rents. All targets are considered to be demanding in the context of the Company’s 
circumstances. 
LTIP awards 2016
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2016 AGM the LTIP opportunity for 2016 will be increased to 175% of salary. The 
market value of a share for the purposes of determining the number of shares subject to an award will be determined by 
the Committee based on the average share price over the period of up to three months up to the date of grant. 
The awards will vest subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets based on relative TSR, ROCE and 
FCF as set out in the table below. Given the increase in quantum to 175% of salary (compared to the limit of 150% of 
salary in the policy approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM and the 2015 award of 125% of salary) the threshold 
level of vesting has been decreased and the level of stretch for maximum performance has been increased. In addition, 
the targets have been calibrated as follows such that management will not receive substantially more for delivering the 
same level of performance.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
 ■ The threshold level of vesting has been reduced from 25% of maximum to 20%, which maintains broadly the same 
percentage of salary pay-out at threshold.
 ■ Up to 125% of salary, 50% of the award is based on relative TSR with the remaining 50% split equally between 
ROCE and cumulative FCF targets. This reflects that relative TSR and ROCE remain relevant performance metrics 
for the Company but the addition of FCF provides a key measurement of the output of the 2020 strategy as well as 
providing a link to debt reduction. 
 ■ For delivering stretch performance in line with the 2015 LTIP awards (i.e. upper quartile TSR, budget +1% ROCE and 
with cumulative FCF of £345 million), 125% of salary would vest.
 ■ The Committee has sought to ensure that the additional stretch targets for the maximum LTIP to vest reflect the 
ambitious strategy. Recognising that the ROCE budget + 1% target is already significantly stretching and that FCF is 
key to delivery of the strategy, the additional stretch for the maximum enhanced LTIP opportunity will be based on 
delivering upper quintile TSR performance and cumulative FCF of £360 million. Both the relative TSR and FCF targets 
are considered to be a real challenge to deliver. To deliver cumulative FCF of £360 million would require a significant 
step change in performance compared to the historic flat FCF performance.
In the table below we have shown the vesting schedule for the awards proposed in respect of 2016 and, for the 
purposes of comparison, the vesting schedule that applies for the awards granted in 2015.

T otal 35.0% 125.0% 175.0%
There will be straight line vesting between the points and no reward below threshold performance. 
TSR has been set against a comparator group of the FTSE 250 as the Remuneration Committee recognises that a 
bespoke pool of competitors is small and could produce results which do not reflect the Company’s performance. We 
therefore believe that a wider comparator group is a more robust and realistic way of measuring how shareholders value 
the Company. The Committee considers that disclosing the forward looking three year ROCE budget is commercially 
sensitive and has therefore chosen not to disclose it in advance. 
In addition to the TSR, ROCE and FCF targets, the Remuneration Committee will require that awards will only be earned 
if underlying financial performance supports it. 
The weightings for each measure have been set to balance what the Remuneration Committee considers to be the 
focus for management in its day to day direction of the business with its ultimate responsibility to shareholders.
Performance is measured over three years; however, awards vest after three, four and five years in equal tranches. 
Approval 
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
in relation to the Group and Company Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the directors to  
prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the Group and Company 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU. Under 
company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
 ■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 ■ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 ■ state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
 ■ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain  
the Company’s and the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report (including the Corporate Governance Report), 
Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including the 
Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are disclosed on pages 44 and 45, confirms that, to the best of their 
knowledge:
 ■ the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and result of the Group; and 
 ■ the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of 
the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Having 
taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers the report and accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

1. General information
The consolidated financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2015 were authorised 
for issue by the Board on 16 November 2015. Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company incorporated and 
registered in England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
2. Presentation of Financial Statements
Statement of compliance
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU).
Basis of preparation
The financial information for the year ending 30 September 2015 has been prepared in accordance with the 
accounting policies set out in note 3 and is presented in pounds sterling. Amounts are shown in millions, unless 
stated otherwise. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc and its 
subsidiaries. Consolidated financial statements are drawn up to 30 September each year and adjustments are made 
to the financial statements of the subsidiaries where necessary to bring the accounting policies used in line with 
those used by the Group.
Subsidiaries are those controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an enterprise taking into account any potential voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred out of the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s 
equity in those subsidiaries. Profit or loss and each component of Other Comprehensive Income are attributed to 
the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests.
Result of the Parent Company
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to 
publish the Parent Company individual Income Statement and related notes.
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, including a description of its financial position, cash flows, debt and borrowing 
facilities, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 02 to 38, along with a summary of factors likely to affect the 
Group’s future development and performance.
Further details on the Group’s financial instruments and risks can be found in note 23 of the accounts on pages 119 
to 127.
The directors have considered the Group’s financial resources including a review of the medium-term financial plan, 
which includes a review of the Group’s cash flow forecasts for the period of at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of these financial statements. 
The directors have also considered the impact of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act which 
includes the introduction of a Statutory Code of Practice for the sector and a Market Rent Only option for certain 
leased pubs including the current anticipated timetable for implementation and the alternative actions available to 
the Group in response to the legislation.
Based on the outcome of the above considerations the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period under review. For this reason the directors 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

2. Presentation of Financial Statements (continued)
Exceptional items
The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the 
Income Statement. Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or 
nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
Exceptional items are explained further in notes 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13.
New standards and interpretations adopted
During the year the Group and the Parent Company have adopted the following new standards, interpretations and 
amendments:
 ■ Amendment to IFRS 2: Share Based Payments - Definition of vesting conditions
 ■ IFRS 13: Fair Value Measurement - Short term receivables and payables
 ■ Amendments to IAS 24: Related Party Disclosures - Key management personnel
 ■ IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation - Offsetting financial assets and liabilties
 ■ IFRIC 21: Levies
 ■ IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial Statements
 ■ IFRS 11: Joint Arrangements
 ■ IFRS 12: Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities
The adoption of the standards outlined above has not had a material impact on the financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
As at 30 September 2015 there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations in issue (some of 
which have not yet been adopted by the EU) with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the 
dates disclosed below and which have not been early adopted by the Parent Company or Group. 
 ■ IFRS 9: Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
 ■ IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018
 ■ IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016
 ■ IAS 1: Disclosure initiative 1 January 2016
IFRS 15 should be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard should be 
applied in full for the year of adoption, including retrospective application to all contracts that were not yet complete 
at the beginning of that period. Implementation of this standard may have an impact on the financial statements 
of the Group and Parent Company and an assessment of the impact of this standard is being carried out. The 
Group and Parent Company are presently unable to quantify the potential impact until this assessment has been 
concluded.
The other new standards and amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.

3. Accounting policies 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in 
a business combination. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill is stated at cost less 
any impairment. On disposal of a property, an attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of 
profit or loss on sale. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are 
consistent with the Groups operating segments. As pubs move between segments the associated goodwill will 
also be transferred.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves and has not been 
subsequently reversed. Any such goodwill is not included in determining the profit or loss on disposal. 
Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments in the Parent Company Balance Sheet are initially recognised at fair value and then held at 
this value subject to an annual impairment test.
Property, plant and equipment (PPE)
Licensed land and buildings, comprising of pub assets and non-pub assets, are held at their fair value and landlord’s 
fixtures and fittings and other assets are held at cost. 
‘Pub’ refers to land and buildings held for operation as a licensed public house, excluding movable landlord’s fixtures 
and fittings. ‘Non-pub’ refers to land and buildings previously held as a pub but are now leased for another use e.g. 
as a convenience store.
The Group’s licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued each year by 
external valuers or employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations.
Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken through Other Comprehensive Income to the revaluation 
reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset previously recognised as 
an expense in the Income Statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken through Other 
Comprehensive Income to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same 
asset. Any further decrease in value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their 
carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at 
each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlord’s fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long life landlord’s fixtures and fittings and short life 
landlord’s fixtures and fittings. Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of 
additions in the form of long life landlord’s fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and additions to 
short life landlord’s fixtures and fittings have been calculated at 5 years. Depreciation is charged on a straight line 
basis to write off the total cost less residual value over the useful economic life. 
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease 
term and their useful economic life of 50 years. 
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight line 
basis to residual value.
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. Where any indicators are identified, 
assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less 
than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to dispose and value 
in use. Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same 
asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement. 
92
Enterprise Inns AR2015 Back.indd   92 07/12/2015   17:24:48 24341 .04    7 December 2015 5:19 PM    Proof 7
3. Accounting policies (continued)
Non-current assets held for sale
Properties identified for disposal which are classified in the Balance Sheet as non-current assets held for sale 
are held at the lower of carrying value on transfer to non-current assets held for sale, as assessed at the time of 
transfer, and fair value less costs to dispose. The fair value less costs to dispose is based on the net estimated 
realisable disposal proceeds (ERV) which are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell 
the properties. Licensed land and buildings and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they 
have been identified for disposal by the Group. They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition 
and the sale should be highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the 
property or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Licensed land and buildings 
held for sale are not depreciated and operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised. 
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net 
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset within non-current assets held for sale at the date of disposal. 
Leases
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Properties acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value 
of future minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease 
payable. Properties held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income 
Statement. 
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis to the Income Statement 
over the lease term. The fair value attributed to properties acquired as part of business combinations that are held 
as operating leases are classified in the Balance Sheet as intangible assets: operating lease premiums within non-
current assets and are amortised over the lease term. 
The Group has previously entered into sale and leaseback transactions where licensed land and buildings have been 
sold and the Group has immediately entered into a lease agreement with the acquiror. These land and buildings 
have been classified as operating leases. They are no longer included within property, plant and equipment and the 
rentals paid are charged on a straight line basis to the Income Statement over the lease term.
Repairs and maintenance
Repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Income Statement as incurred. 
Assignment premiums
Where an amount is paid to a publican in order to take the assignment of a lease or to break a lease at any point 
other than at renewal, the payment made is expensed through administrative costs. During the period of our 
strategic change, this will be treated as exceptional.
Where an amount is paid to a publican in order to regain control of the property at the point of lease renewal in 
order that the Group can operate the site as a directly managed outlet, the amount is linked to a capital investment 
project in order to reposition the property for the managed offering, and the premium paid is capitalised and 
depreciated in line with the project spend.
Financial instruments
a) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand. Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months 
or less are classified as cash equivalents.

3. Accounting policies (continued)
b) Borrowings
Borrowings which include bank borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds are measured at amortised 
cost. This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the 
amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings 
across the life of the instrument based on the estimated cash flows and the contractual terms of the agreement.
When borrowings are refinanced the Group reviews whether the arrangement constitutes an extinguishment of the 
original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability or a modification of the terms of the existing 
financial liability. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability 
any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment and written off through 
exceptional finance costs. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as a modification any costs or fees 
incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining life of the modified loan.
c) Convertible financial instruments
The gross proceeds received from the issue of a convertible bond are split between a liability element and an equity 
component at the date of issue. The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market 
interest rate for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond 
and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing any embedded option to convert the liability 
into equity of the Group, is included in equity and is not remeasured. The liability component is carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method until extinguished upon conversion or the instrument’s maturity date. Issue 
costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bond based on their relative 
carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against 
equity.
The difference between the interest expense calculated under the effective interest rate method and interest paid 
to bondholders is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bond.
d) Equity instruments
Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Parent Company, are recorded at the fair value of the 
proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs. The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in called up share 
capital and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in share premium. 
e) Trade receivables and trade payables
Trade receivables and trade payables are held at amortised cost.
Fair value measurement
The Group measures licensed land and buildings, within property, plant and equipment and non-current assets held 
for sale, at fair value and provides disclosure information in respect of the financial assets and liabilities.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset 
or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The 
principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use provided that use was physically possible, legally permissible and 
financially feasible to access. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and 
for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
94
Enterprise Inns AR2015 Back.indd   94 07/12/2015   17:24:49 24341 .04    7 December 2015 5:19 PM    Proof 7
3. Accounting policies (continued)
IFRS 13 requires that all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Other techniques whereby the inputs are either directly or indirectly derived from market data.
Level 3 – Inputs used in the valuation are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
Net debt
Net debt is the total book value of all financial assets and liabilities (not including trade receivables, trade payables 
and the equity component of the convertible bond) less cash. Underlying net debt is the nominal value of all 
financial assets and liabilities (not including trade receivables, trade payables and the equity component of the 
convertible bond) less cash.
Taxation
The tax expense comprises both the tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred tax. Deferred 
tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying 
value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. No deferred tax is 
recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised 
amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be 
settled net or simultaneously. 
Tax is charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to 
Other Comprehensive Income. Similarly tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity. Otherwise tax is charged in the Income Statement. Tax is calculated using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably 
estimated. If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amount of the 
provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the 
obligation.

Pension obligations
The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements. 
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees’ own pension plans is charged to the Income 
Statement as incurred. 
As described in note 28, the Group entered into a bulk annuity policy that is a qualifying insurance policy in respect 
of the defined benefit section of the pension scheme. Prior to entering into the bulk annuity policy, in respect of the 
defined benefit pension scheme the amount recognised in the Balance Sheet comprised the difference between 
the present value of the scheme’s liabilities and the fair value of the scheme’s assets determined by qualified 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method, the current service cost and past service cost were charged 
to operating profit and the financing charge was determined by applying the discount rate used to measure the 
defined benefit obligation to both the scheme liabilities and plan assets, and was recognised within net finance 
costs. Remeasurement gains and losses were recognised in full in the period in which they occur in Other 
Comprehensive Income. Settlements are recognised in the Income Statement in the period when the Group has 
committed to the settlement.
Having entered into the bulk annuity policy, the scheme liabilities continue to be valued on the projected unit credit 
method. The value of the annuity policy is stated as equal to the amount ascribed to the plan liabilities covered by 
the policy. Actuarial movements in the value of the scheme liabilities and the interest costs on scheme liabilities 
are matched by equivalent movements in the scheme asset. To the extent that the Group is committed to deferred 
premiums or future administration costs in respect of the annuity policy or the scheme these are recorded as an 
additional liability within the pension deficit at the net present value of future premiums. The interest paid on the 
bulk annuity policy is charged as a finance cost. The plan obligations will be derecognised on final settlement of the 
plan.
Treasury shares
The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until 
the shares are cancelled, re-issued or disposed of. Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders’ equity. No 
gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is the fair value of consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal 
course of business, net of discounts, volume rebates and VAT . Revenue from drink and food is recognised at the 
point at which the goods are provided. Property rental income is recognised on a straight line basis over the life of 
the lease. Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates. 
Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees. Share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of the award. This value is subsequently updated at each Balance 
Sheet date for management’s best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service 
and performance (vesting conditions), other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the 
Parent Company (market conditions). Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to 
become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, 
non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value. The fair value is recognised 
as an expense over the vesting period by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the 
cumulative expense in the Income Statement. A corresponding entry is made to equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional 
upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or 
non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.

3. Accounting policies (continued)
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Operating profit
Operating profit as referred to in the Income Statement is defined as being profit generated from normal trading 
activities before net profit/(loss) on sale of property, plant and equipment, movements in valuation of the estate and 
related assets, finance costs and taxation.
Exceptional items
The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the 
Income Statement. Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or 
nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and include the following:
a) Exceptional items recognised in operating profit
Exceptional costs relating to regulatory matters, reorganisational costs and the charge for future settlement of the 
defined benefit pension scheme have been recognised in the administrative costs line.
In addition, during the period of our strategic change, assignment premiums where an amount is paid to a publican 
in order to take the assignment of a lease or to break a lease at any point other than at renewal the payment made 
would be treated as exceptional.
b) Net profit/(loss) on sale of property, plant and equipment
Net profit/(loss) arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment less goodwill allocated to disposals.
c) Movements in valuation of the estate and related assets
Any revaluation that causes the book value of a property to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in the 
Income Statement. If that same property later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the 
increase in value is credited to the Income Statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognised. Where 
properties identified for disposal are revalued immediately prior to transfer to non-current assets held for sale, the 
revaluation movement is recognised on the same basis. The remaining impact of the annual revaluation exercise or 
the identification of properties for disposal is accounted for in Other Comprehensive Income.
d) Net finance costs
The gain or loss on purchase of own debt is calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the debt 
purchased less the aggregate of the consideration and related transaction costs paid. The Group has elected to take 
the gain or loss on the settlement date.
Exceptional finance costs are recognised in relation to fees written off following the commitment to extinguish 
borrowings.
e) Taxation
A deferred tax liability has been recognised on the Balance Sheet relating to the estate. On transition to IFRS, 
the Group elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions from 1 January 1999. This led to an increase in 
goodwill in respect of this deferred tax. As this pre-acquisition liability changes due to capital gains indexation 
relief and changes in the rate of UK tax, a debit or a credit is recognised in the Income Statement. This has been 
classified as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense 
recognised in the Income Statement in the same period. All other movements in respect of this deferred tax liability 
are accounted for in the same performance statement as the gross item to which it relates.

3. Accounting policies (continued)
The effect of changes in the enacted rate of tax used to calculate deferred tax is reflected in Other Comprehensive 
Income to the extent it relates to revaluation surpluses therein and in exceptional profit/loss for all other elements 
of deferred tax.
The tax effect of all other exceptional items is also included within the exceptional items column in the Income 
Statement. 
Use of accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The estimates and assumptions that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below:
a) Property, plant and equipment (PPE)
Licensed land and buildings are revalued annually to fair value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation 
Manual published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and IFRS 13. The valuation is based on 
an assessment of the income generating potential of the properties, and applying an appropriate multiple. The 
highest and best use for the licensed land and buildings is assumed to be their current use by the Group, principally 
due to the legal restrictions imposed by the agreement with the publican, planning regulations and the financial 
implications of a change of use given those restrictions and the Group’s business model. However, consideration 
is given to an alternative highest and best use if there are factors that indicate that such an alternative use exists 
which is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.
Further information about the valuation of the estate is provided in note 17 of these financial statements.
The Group estimates the useful economic life and residual value of PPE and these estimates influence the 
depreciation charged each year. For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting policy for PPE. 
b) Testing goodwill for impairment
The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. Management makes judgements to allocate 
goodwill to individual operating segments and in calculating the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the 
operating segments that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which 
require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate. 
Details of the tests and carrying value of the asset are shown in note 15.
c) Taxation 
Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot 
be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Tax benefits are not 
recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a 
liability will arise. The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting 
treatment.
d) Finance costs
When borrowings are refinanced with substantially the same lender, the Group uses judgement when reviewing 
whether the arrangement constitutes an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a 
new financial liability or a modification of the terms of the existing financial liability. As described in note 23 the 
Group has replaced its existing forward start facility with a new revolving credit facility. In contrast to the forward 
start facility, the revolving credit facility is non-amortising, has reduced covenant tests, fewer restrictions and a 
significantly lower interest rate. As the commercial features of the borrowings have fundamentally changed, the 
Group classified this as an extinguishment. The impact of this judgement is explained in note 12.
e) Materiality of operating segments
The Group uses judgement when concluding that the commercial property segments and managed segments are 
not material, either individually or in aggregate, to be required to be disclosed as an other operating segment.
98
Enterprise Inns AR2015 Back.indd   98 07/12/2015   17:24:49 24341 .04    7 December 2015 5:19 PM    Proof 7
4. Segmental analysis
Following the announcement of the outcome of the Group’s strategic review during the year ended 30 September 
2015 the Group now has five (2014: one) distinguishable operating segments being leased and tenanted, 
commercial property, managed mainstream, managed community and managed expert which reflect the different 
nature of income earned, types of property and profile of customers. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) 
is represented by the Board of Directors of the parent company and the five segments have been identified as the 
CODM regularly reviews discrete financial information relating to them with regard to gross margin. Group assets 
are not segmented.
Operating segments are aggregated when they have similar economic characteristics and therefore the three 
managed operating segments have been combined as they represent income earned from the direct operation of 
pubs albeit through differing trading styles.
This results in three reportable segments being:
1) Leased and tenanted Rental income and revenue from drinks supplies and gaming machines
2) Commercial property Rental income
3) Managed Income from food, drink, accommodation and gaming machines
The Group has concluded that its commercial property segment and managed segment do not meet, either 
individually or collectively, the quantitative thresholds to constitute reportable segments as defined by IFRS 
8. Rather than being shown as ‘all other segments’ they have been combined within the leased and tenanted 
segment as the Group is currently in the early stages of estate segmentation and therefore the results are not 
currently material. The following notes 5 and 6 disclose this combined information down to operating profit which 
forms the basis of the information reviewed by the CODM.

During the year the Group has changed the presentation of costs and the prior year has been restated accordingly. 
This has no impact on the results of the Group in either year.

Of the non-audit fees above of £12,000 (2014: £156,000), £12,000 (2014: £82,000) represents work required to be 
performed by the auditor under law, regulation or the terms of the Group’s financing arrangements. Excluding these 
amounts, the ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees was nil (2014: 37%).
Group audit fees include £174,000 (2014: £165,000) paid to the auditor for the audit of the Parent Company. Fees 
paid to the auditor in respect of non-audit services provided to the Parent Company are not required to be disclosed 
because the Group financial statements are only required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
8. Exceptional items
An exceptional charge of £1 million has been recognised in the year relating to costs incurred in respect of 
assignment premiums paid. The prior year charge of £13 million includes £10 million in relation to the charge for the 
future settlement of the defined benefit pension scheme (see note 28) and £3 million relates to reorganisational 
costs, primarily costs associated with the retirement of the former Chief Executive Officer, a fundamental 
reorganisation of the Group’s operations team and costs incurred in respect of one-off regulatory matters.
Included within accruals and deferred income is £nil (2014: £1 million) in relation to the operating exceptional items.
A tax credit of £nil (2014: £3 million) has been recognised on these exceptional items.
All other exceptional items are explained in notes 9, 10, 12 and 13.

9.  (Loss)/profit on sale of property, plant and equipment including goodwill 
allocation (continued)
During the year 260 properties (2014: 230 properties) and various other plots of land with a book value of £68 
million (2014: £61 million) were disposed of generating gross proceeds of £82 million (2014: £80 million) which, 
after taking account of disposal costs resulted in an overall profit of £5 million (2014: £12 million).
Of the £8 million (2014: £16 million) of profits on sale of property, plant and equipment in the year, £2 million (2014: 
£3 million) related to 11 properties (2014: 4 properties) and various plots of land with a ‘special interest’ value to 
particular buyers, £2 million (2014: £3 million) related to the sale of 5 properties (2014: 8 properties) classified as 
operating leases and £4 million (2014: £2 million) arose on the remaining 174 properties (2014: 78 properties) sold at 
an average profit of £23,000 (2014: £27 ,000) per property. In the year ended 30 September 2014 a further £8 million 
of profit on sale of property, plant and equipment resulted from the sale of 74 pubs held in non-current assets held 
for sale at 30 September 2013 transferred prior to the adoption of IFRS 13.
The remaining 70 properties (2014: 66 properties) sold during the year made a loss.
In accordance with IAS 36 purchased goodwill is allocated to operations disposed of, based on the relative value of 
the disposal to operations retained. Accordingly, goodwill of £8 million (2014: £7 million) has been allocated to the 
260 properties (2014: 230 properties) disposed of during the year.

The £26 million exceptional finance costs recognised in the year ended 30 September 2015 relates to the bank 
and bond refinancing that is explained in more detail in note 23. The total cash outflow arising from this refinancing 
was £28 million, being £22 million in respect of the repurchase premium on the extinguished bond, which has 
been charged as an exceptional item, and total fees and disbursements of £6 million, of which £4 million has been 
charged as an exceptional item and £2 million arising on the new bond has been deferred over the life of the new 
debt instruments.
The exceptional finance costs incurred in the prior year included interest accrued on tax provisions and finance 
arrangement fees written off following the Group’s commitment to the new revolving credit facility.
The total interest charge under the effective interest rate method (which excludes the exceptional finance costs 
relating to the bank and bond refinancing) is £158 million (2014: £167 million).

*  On transition to IFRS under IAS 12, a deferred tax liability was recognised on the Balance Sheet relating to the revaluation of the estate and gains 
previously rolled over, or due to be rolled over into other assets. The deferred tax liability that would have been in place at the time of business 
combinations that have occurred since 1 January 1999 resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill of £330 million as the fair value of the net 
assets acquired had been reduced. As this pre-acquisition liability changes due to capital gains indexation relief and disposals, the movement has 
been recognised in the Income Statement. The exceptional indexation charge for the year ended 30 September 2015 is £7 million (2014: credit of 
£2 million). This has been classed as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in 
the Income Statement in the same period.

14. Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year 
divided by the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year after excluding shares held by 
trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury.
Adjusted earnings per share, which the directors believe reflects the underlying performance of the Group, is based 
on earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders adjusted for the effects of exceptional items, net of tax divided by 
the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating 
to employee share options and shares held in treasury.

14. Earnings per share (continued)
For the year ended 30 September 2015 any potential ordinary shares to be included when considering diluted 
earnings per share are anti-dilutive. As a result there is no difference between basic earnings per share and basic 
diluted earnings per share, or between adjusted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share. For 
the year ended 30 September 2014 diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year divided by the 
weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year adjusted for dilutive ordinary shares relating 
to share options. The potential adjustment in relation to the convertible bonds was anti-dilutive to the calculation 
of basic diluted earnings per share and was therefore not included in the calculation for both basic diluted and 
adjusted diluted earnings per share. The 30 September 2014 basic diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share 
have been amended on this basis.

Allocation to disposals
In accordance with IAS 36 goodwill is allocated to operations disposed of, based on the relative value of the 
disposal to operations retained. Accordingly, goodwill of £8 million (2014: £7 million) has been allocated to the 260 
properties (2014: 230 properties) disposed of during the year.
Impairment testing
Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment. At 30 September 2015 the goodwill 
has been allocated to the operating segments identified following the strategic review. Within these segments the 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of each segment to the carrying amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to dispose and value in use. As at 30 September 2014 
the goodwill was allocated to the total estate.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the leased and tenanted operating segment was £315 million with the 
balance allocated across the commercial property (£13 million) and managed segments (£2 million). The following 
disclosures have therefore been made in relation to the goodwill allocated to the leased and tenanted operating 
segment because the remaining balance is not material to the total value of goodwill.

15. Goodwill (continued)
Value in use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA and forecasts of cash flows over a three year period, as prepared 
for the Board, adjusted to reflect the current segmentation of the estate. The three year cash flows continue to be 
risk adjusted to reflect a conservative outlook. They include the impact of the reduction in consumer spending as 
a result of the difficult economic conditions and have also been adjusted to reflect the forecast level of disposals. 
The key assumptions in these estimates are trading margin, rent projections and levels of working capital required 
to support trading. Key assumptions have been assigned values by management using estimates based on past 
experience and expectations of future changes in the market. These assumptions have been reviewed by the Board 
and are believed to be reasonable. Cash flows beyond three years are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate in 
operating income (2014: 2%) which was selected as prudently below the Group’s estimate of the long-term average 
growth rate. The key driver to maintaining the growth rate is management’s focus on selecting and supporting the 
best publicans, whilst meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand. The forecast cash flows are then 
discounted to give a value in use.
The discount rate used is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which has been risk 
adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flows. In making 
this adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and the cost of equity by 
using an average of the highest four market risk premiums and Company betas obtained from five advisers at the 
year end date. The cost of equity has been further inflated by using a theoretical share price derived from peer 
group data. The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the testing at 30 September 2015 was 8.0% (2014: 
8.0%). 
As at 30 September 2015, the total headroom on the impairment test is £718 million, the pre-tax adjusted discount 
rate could increase to 9.2% before any impairment would be required. Management have considered the volatility 
in the current economic climate within the risk adjusted cash flow and the growth rate of any cash flows beyond 
the budget period would need to fall by 1 .5% before any impairment would be required. There is no impairment to 
goodwill in the period.

Fair value measurement of property, plant and equipment
In determining the appropriate classes of asset to present for fair value purposes, the company has considered 
the nature, characteristics and risks of the assets. This has resulted in determining two separate classes of assets, 
‘pub’ and ‘non-pub’ as described in note 3.
Revaluation of property, plant and equipment 
Valuations are carried out on an annual basis at each year end date. With the exception of properties identified for 
disposal and transferred to non-current assets held for sale, the Group’s pub and non-pub assets were revalued 
as at 30 September 2015 by GVA Grimley Limited or Colliers International Property Advisers UK LLP , independent 
Chartered Surveyors, or by the internal Asset and Valuation Director, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor. For 
further analysis of the pubs valued by valuer see table below.
All valuations of assets have been assessed as being level 3 valuations, as there are no directly comparable market 
observable inputs. 
The pub assets were valued using fair maintainable trade income (FMT) capitalised at an appropriate rate of return 
(as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards ‘Red Book’) or an equivalent multiple. This method of 
valuation involves making an assessment of the fair maintainable rent, wholesale and machine income that can be 
generated from the property assuming they are run by a reasonably efficient operator, taking into account future 
trading potential. This assessment of profit is then capitalised at an appropriate multiple to reflect the risks and 
rewards of the property. In determining the multiple to use, the valuers consider evidence of comparable market 
transactions. The resulting fair value of the pub represents the land and buildings and any fixed landlords fixtures 
and fittings.
The non-pub assets, which are predominantly blue-chip let convenience stores, are let to the operators at open 
market rents. These assets have been valued adopting the investment method of valuation. By reference to the 
rents fixed, lease terms and market conditions, an appropriate multiple based on comparable market transactions is 
applied, discounting future rental receipts back to present value.
Both classes of asset are, under IFRS 13, required to be valued at highest and best use. IFRS 13 prescribes that 
the Group’s current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or other factors suggest that 
a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset. In doing their valuations, the valuers 
consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be reflected in the fair value 
where applicable. This is on an asset by asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate that there may be a 
higher and better use. In the current year the highest and best use of all the property assets in property, plant and 
equipment has been assessed as their existing use.

The table below presents, by class of property, the income and multiple bandings within which the properties 
have been valued, and the number of properties that have been valued in each of the bandings. In determining 
the bandings to use, the Group has considered a variety of options including size and location of property, but 
has concluded that the value of the property is principally driven by FMT and multiple, so this forms the most 
appropriate disclosure.

Sensitivity analysis table
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy of the Group’s estate are FMT and a multiple. There is a limited amount of interrelation between the 
variation in these inputs.
A change in either of these assumptions could have a significant effect on the overall valuation of the estate. 
Sensitivities around these assumptions that are deemed to be reasonably likely based on the experience of the 
valuers are illustrated below:

Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group is exposed to a small amount of 
credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances. The Group’s objective is to minimise 
this risk by carrying out credit checks where appropriate. The amount of trade and other receivables included in the 
Balance Sheet are net of a bad debt provision, which has been determined by management following a review of 
individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the Balance Sheet date after 
taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits. Receivables are written off against the bad debt 
provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
At 30 September 2015 the value of deposits held by the Group is £32 million (2014: £32 million) and by the Parent 
Company is £21 million (2014: £21 million). This balance is held on the Balance Sheet in other payables.

There are no indications as at 30 September 2015 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect 
of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the Balance Sheet that are neither past due nor impaired. The 
maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables. The Group’s credit risk on 
liquid funds is limited because the Group only invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.

During the year to 30 September 2014 an enquiry by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) in relation to a discounted 
convertible loan note issued in the accounting period ended 30 September 2004 was formally resolved and closed. 
The closure of this enquiry resulted in a settlement agreement with HMRC of £9 million plus interest, which was 
to be paid over a two year period. The final instalment will fall due to be paid in January 2016 and therefore the 
full current tax payable is shown as a current liability. This has been fully provided for in the accounts since the 
inception of the loan note.

‘Bank borrowings’ refers to the revolving credit facility and previously the forward start facility (see table below).
‘Corporate bonds’ refers to secured bonds and an unsecured convertible bond (see table below).
‘Securitised bonds’ refers to secured bonds (see table below).
Fair values
The corporate bonds and securitised bonds were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone, 
independent valuers. The fair value of the corporate bonds and securitised bonds is measured at market price and 
are therefore evaluated to be level 1 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 33. 
Management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current 
liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial liabilities, obligations under finance 
leases, as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates 
currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
The fair value of the Group’s bank borrowings, evaluated to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 
33, is not deemed to be materially different to the nominal value if it had been determined by using the DCF 
method using discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The own 
non-performance risk as at 30 September 2015 was also assessed to be insignificant.

The bank borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds are held at amortised cost. Finance lease payables 
represent the present value of future minimum lease payments. Other categories of financial instruments include 
trade receivables and trade payables. However there is no difference between the book value and fair value of 
these items.
Bank borrowings
On 7 October 2014 a new £138 million non-amortising revolving credit facility was agreed, which is available 
through to September 2018 which replaced the forward start facility. This extended the maturity compared to the 
former current forward start facility and also benefitted from improved terms, simplified covenants and lower 
pricing with a new interest rate of 3% over LIBOR.

23. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
Corporate bonds
On 10 September 2013 Enterprise Funding Limited (the Issuer) issued a £97 million 3.5% guaranteed convertible 
bond due 2020 (the bond) at par. The Parent Company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due 
and punctual performance by the Issuer of all of its obligations (including payments) in respect of the bond. The 
obligations of the Parent Company, as guarantor, constitute direct, unsubordinated, unconditional and unsecured 
obligations of the Parent Company. 
Subject to the terms, the bond is convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which are automatically 
transferred to the Parent Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Parent Company. The bond converts at 
a premium of 35% to the share price on 10 September 2013 of 141 .5p, which means that the bond is convertible 
based on an exchange share price of 191 .0p into 50.8 million ordinary shares. The exchange share price is adjusted 
on the happening of certain events, including the payment of a dividend. 
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for convertible financial instruments, the proceeds received from 
the convertible bond issue were split, with an initial £75 million recorded as a liability and £22 million recorded 
within equity, stated net of costs of £2 million and £1 million respectively. The difference between the effective 
interest charged and the actual interest paid is added to the liability element over the life of the convertible bonds.
On 7 October 2014 the Group completed a partial refinancing of the secured bond - issued 3 March 2003 due for 
repayment in 2018 (£600 million 2018 corporate bonds). The partial refinancing has resulted in a lower interest 
cost and an extended debt maturity. Prior to the refinancing £600 million of 2018 secured corporate bonds were 
outstanding with a coupon of 6.5%. The Group received and accepted tender instructions for £249.5 million 
of these bonds at a cash purchase price of 108.75% of their principal amount. In connection with this partial 
refinancing the Group issued new £249.5 million secured corporate bonds due in October 2023 at a coupon of 
6.0%, resulting in a reduction of the corporate bonds due in 2018 to £350.5 million. The new issue benefits from a 
security package on substantially the same terms as the original £600 million 2018 bonds. 
Securitised bonds
During the year the Group has made scheduled repayments on the Unique A3 and A4 securitised bonds leaving 
£1,150 million outstanding at the year end. At 30 September 2015 the Group was £74 million ahead of the 
amortisation schedule through early repayment and market purchases.
Intercompany
The amount owed to subsidiary undertakings relates to the issue of the convertible bonds in Enterprise Funding 
Limited, these proceeds have been on-loaned to Enterprise Inns plc on the same terms with an amount recorded in 
equity and an amount recorded as a liability.
Financial instruments and risk
The Group’s financial instruments comprise bank borrowings, corporate bonds, securitised bonds and cash. The 
main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. There is no 
currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of 
these risks and they are summarised as follows:

23. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
Liquidity risk
The Group has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due. The 
Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank 
borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds.
This objective is achieved through the following processes:
 ■ regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function;
 ■ regular review of the Group’s debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile; and
 ■ maintenance of undrawn bank facilities.
The proportion of nominal value of borrowings (excluding finance lease payables and intercompany balances)

23. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
Interest rate risk
The Group borrows its corporate bonds and securitised bonds at a fixed rate. Bank borrowings and cash balances 
attract interest at a floating rate. The Group’s objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. This 
exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates on the majority of its debt. At 30 September 2015, the Group’s 
borrowings were 97% fixed with an average interest rate of 6.3% for 8 years (2014: 97% fixed at an average rate 
of 6.3% for 8 years). The Parent Company’s borrowings were 94% fixed with an average interest rate of 6.3% for 8 
years (2014: 93% fixed at an average rate of 6.5% for 8 years).
Interest rate sensitivity
In estimating the sensitivity of the financial instruments we have assumed a reasonable potential change in interest 
rates. The method used assumes that all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before 
tax. The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying 
transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, 
and further developments in global financial markets. As such the below should not be considered as a projection of 
likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments.
If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points the interest receivable in the Group would increase by £1 
million (2014: £1 million) and the interest payable would increase by £1 million (2014: £1 million). If interest rates 
were to decrease by 50 basis points the interest receivable in the Group would decrease by £1 million (2014: £1 
million) and the interest payable would decrease by £1 million (2014: £1 million).
If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points the interest receivable in the Parent Company would increase 
by £2 million (2014: £2 million) and the interest payable would increase by £1 million (2014: £1 million). If interest 
rates were to decrease by 50 basis points the interest receivable in the Parent Company would decrease by £2 
million (2014: £2 million) and the interest payable would decrease by £1 million (2014: £1 million).
Security
The bank borrowings are secured by a security deed entered into by the companies which comprise the Group, 
excluding Enterprise Inns Holding Company Limited and its subsidiaries, Unique Pubs Limited and its subsidiaries 
and Enterprise Funding Limited. The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such 
Group companies. The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the corporate bonds.
The total value of assets within the Group secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2015 
is property, plant and equipment £3,638 million (2014: £3,809 million), operating lease premiums £10 million 
(2014: £10 million) and non-current assets held for sale £33 million (2014: £30 million). The value of assets within 
the Parent Company secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2015 is property, plant and 
equipment £1,877 million (2014: £1,944 million), operating lease premiums £4 million (2014: £4 million) and non-
current assets held for sale £13 million (2014: £13 million).

23. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
The security pledged for the Group’s debt is summarised below:
Debt instrument Security
Bank borrowings – 1st floating charge over the balance of properties in the Parent Company not already 
secured by a 1st fixed charge created by the corporate bonds.
– 2nd floating charge over the properties secured by a 1st fixed charge created by the 
corporate bonds.
– Share pledge over Unique Pubs Limited.
Corporate bonds (excluding the 
unsecured convertible bond)
– 1st fixed charge over the 1,987 properties in the Parent Company valued by GVA Grimley 
Limited (see note 17).
– 2nd floating charge over the balance of properties in the Parent Company.
Securitised bonds – Collectively over the whole Securitisation the security incorporates a 1st fixed charge in 
favour of the Trustee over the Issuer’s right, title, interest and benefit, present and future to 
all properties, cash, eligible investments and income generated by Unique Pub Properties 
Limited.
Covenants
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities. There are three covenants that 
relate to the bank borrowings, which are tested quarterly. There is one leverage covenant and two asset valuation 
covenants. There is sufficient headroom on all three of these covenants. 
There are two covenants that relate to the corporate bonds (excluding the unsecured convertible bond); an asset 
value covenant and a net annual income covenant. At the year end there is an annual valuation of the estate and 
a review of the annual income for the properties secured under each of the corporate bonds. The valuation is 
undertaken by a firm of independent chartered surveyors. The directors certify the net annual income as part of an 
annual compliance exercise. In the event that property values or incomes have fallen, there may be a requirement 
to add more properties to the security of the corporate bonds and any addition of new properties must be 
completed within 90 days of the year end. There is sufficient headroom on both of these covenants.
There are two covenants that relate to the securitised bonds which are tested at each quarter end. These covenants 
are based solely on the assets held within the securitised bonds and comprise a net asset covenant and a debt 
service cover covenant. There is sufficient headroom in both of these covenants.
The Group tests all of the above covenants on a regular basis and forecasts are prepared during the budgeting 
process. These are reviewed at Board level.

(i) any person or persons acting in concert becoming interested in more 
than 50% of the shares of the Company; or
(ii) any person or group of connected persons acquiring control of the 
Company; or

24. Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt
The capital structure is managed to support the Group’s objective of maximising long-term shareholder value 
through ready access to debt and capital markets, cost effective borrowing and flexibility to fund business and 
acquisition opportunities whilst maintaining appropriate leverage to optimise the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group is based upon management’s judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key 
elements of its financial strategy in order to meet the Group’s operational and strategic requirements. This includes 
a strategy on dividends, share buy-backs and monitoring liquidity risk. The overall financing strategy of the Group is 
presented to the Board annually as part of the budgeting exercise.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of a net debt ratio, being net debt divided by net debt plus equity. Net debt 
is defined as the book value of the Group’s debt less cash. Equity is defined as total shareholders’ funds.

The UK Government reduced the rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20% effective from 1 April 2015. Deferred 
taxation has been calculated based on the current substantively enacted rate of 20%. 
130
Enterprise Inns AR2015 Back.indd   130 07/12/2015   17:24:56 24341 .04    7 December 2015 5:19 PM    Proof 7
27 . Deferred tax (continued)
In July 2015, the UK government announced its intention to further reduce the corporation tax rate to 18% by 2020, 
this has been substantively enacted since the year end. The forecast effect of this further reduction in rate by 2020 
in the Group would be to decrease the net deferred tax liability by £23 million. A £5 million credit is expected to 
be recognised in the Income Statement and a credit of £18 million in Other Comprehensive Income. The forecast 
effect of the further reduction in rate by 2020 in the Parent Company would be to decrease the net deferred 
tax liability by £12 million. £nil is expected to be recognised in the Income Statement and £12 million in Other 
Comprehensive Income.
The deferred tax provision for the unrealised surplus on the revaluation of fixed assets in the Group has moved 
during the year as follows:
£m
Opening provision at 1 October 2014 191 
Reduction in deferred tax liability due to indexation debited to the Income Statement 7 
Reduction in deferred tax liability due to movements from revaluation of the estate and disposals recognised in 
the Income Statement (28)
Reduction in deferred tax liability recognised in Other Comprehensive Income 7 
Closing provision at 30 September 2015 177 
The Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings 
of subsidiaries on the basis that under current enacted law, no tax is payable on dividends payable and receivable 
within the Group. 
28. Pension
The Group and the Parent Company make defined contribution payments to employees’ own pension plans and 
these payments are charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
RetailLink Management Limited (a subsidiary company that has now been liquidated as part of a Group 
reorganisation) established a pension plan for its employees in January 1999. The plan has defined contribution and 
defined benefit schemes. The plan is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits.
The plan is governed by the employment laws of the United Kingdom which require final salary payments to be 
adjusted for the consumer price index upon payment during retirement. The level of benefits provided depends on a 
member’s length of service and salary at retirement age. The fund has a legal form of foundation and is governed by 
the Board of Pension Trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for 
the definition of the investment strategy.
In April 2014, the Trustees of the RetailLink Management Limited pension plan (the Plan) and the Company 
committed to a bulk annuity buyout of the defined benefit section of the Plan, crystallising a liability of £10 million 
payable through a deferred payment schedule over a four year period. The initial stage of this process involved the 
Trustees using the Plan’s defined benefit section assets to purchase a bulk annuity policy from Legal & General 
Assurance Society Limited (LGAS). The policies commenced with effect from 30 April 2014 and will be held for 
the time being as investments of the Plan. Once the deferred premiums have been paid, the Trustees intend to 
ask LGAS to issue individual annuity policies to defined benefit section members and then wind-up the Plan, after 
which the Company will no longer retain any responsibilities or obligations to the members of the Plan. As a result 
of the above arrangements, a provision for a settlement charge of £10 million was recognised within exceptional 
administration costs in the prior year. The deferred payment plan attracts interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%.

The mortality tables used to value the plan’s liabilities are S1NA light tables adjusted for CMI improvements subject 
to a minimum annual long-term improvement of 1 .25% p.a. for current pensioners and for future retirees (with a -1 
year age adjustment for females). These tables give a life expectancy as set out above.
Due to the nature of the pension deficit being the deferred payment plan outstanding for the bulk annuity policy 
sensitivy analysis is not relevent and has therefore not been disclosed.
The Company will not be making any contributions to the defined benefit plan in future years following the bulk 
annuity buyout.

At 30 September 2015, the Group owned 50 million (2014: 50 million) of its own shares as treasury shares with a 
nominal value of £1 million (2014: £1 million) and a market value of £54 million (2014: £62 million). In addition, at 
30 September 2015 the Group held 6,568,286 shares with a nominal value of £0.2 million and a market value of £7 
million (2014: 4,645,712 shares, nominal value £0.1 million, market value £6 million). These shares are held by the 
Employee Benefit Trust and are shares used to satisfy awards made under the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans and 
other share option schemes (note 30).
30. Share-based payments
The Group operates share-based payment schemes for both directors and other employees. Details of the Deferred 
Share Award and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which form part of the remuneration of the executive directors are 
given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 59 to 82. 
The Group also operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP), an Employee Share Option Scheme (ESOS), and a Save As 
You Earn Scheme (SAYE).
A total expense of £2 million (2014: £2 million) has been incurred in the year in relation to share-based payments. 
This expense relates wholly to the equity-settled schemes described above.
Share Incentive Plan
The SIP is open to all employees. At times determined by the Parent Company, employees may allocate the lower 
of £1,800 or 10% of pre-tax salary to purchase shares out of their salary. The Board may also decide to award 
matching shares. The shares are held in trust on behalf of the employee. If shares are removed from trust within 
three years, any allocation of matching shares may be lost. Shares can be transferred tax-free to employees after a 
period of five years. Matching shares were awarded every year from 2005 to 2015.
The cost of the matching shares is being spread over the three year vesting period of the scheme.

Employee Share Option Scheme 
The ESOS is open to all employees. Share options are awarded to employees at the discretion of the Board. 
Options will normally vest after three years if an employee remains in service and if EPS targets are met. There 
were no options granted during the current or prior year. Options may normally only be exercised during the period 
of seven years commencing on the third anniversary of the date of grant of the option. Options will usually be 
settled using ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust.

SAYE scheme
The SAYE scheme is open to executive directors and employees at the discretion of the Board. Participants contract 
to save a fixed amount each month with a savings institution for a period of five years (previously a seven year 
scheme has also been offered). At the end of the savings term, participants are given the option to purchase shares 
at a price set before the savings began. The option price will be not less than 80% of the market value of a share on 
the date that participants are invited to take part in the scheme, or the nominal value of a share, if higher. Options 
will usually be settled using ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust and will usually be exercisable for 
six months after the fifth or seventh anniversary of the commencement of the savings contract.

The share price at which the number of shares granted under the Deferred Share Award scheme is calculated, is 
not confirmed until after the date of the approval of the accounts. The maximum number of Deferred Share Award 
shares granted during the year is therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2015. The 
number of shares granted in 2014 has been amended to show the actual number granted in 2014.
Where the conditions are not met the shares are released in the forfeited/released line.
Directors and other members of the management team eligible to participate in the Deferred Share Award pay £1 
to exercise awards granted under the Deferred Share Award and the LTIP . This is a one-off charge. All of the shares 
outstanding at 30 September 2015 are not yet exercisable.
The weighted average fair value of shares granted during the year under the Deferred Share Award was £1 .10 (2014: 
£1 .08 restated for actual number of shares granted in 2014) and under the LTIP was £0.47 (2014: £0.76).
The weighted average share price on exercise of shares and share options under all schemes during the year was 
£1 .07 (2014: £1 .51).
Fair value of share schemes
The fair value of equity-settled share options and share awards granted is estimated at the date of grant using share 
option valuation models. The ESOS, SAYE and Deferred Share Award schemes are valued using the Black-Scholes 
model. The element of the LTIP scheme that relates to non-market conditions is valued using the Black-Scholes 
model. The element of the LTIP that includes market conditions is valued using the Monte-Carlo Simulation model. 
The following tables list the inputs to the models for options and shares granted during the year:

  The share price at which the number of shares granted under the Deferred Share Award scheme is calculated is not confirmed until after the date 
of the approval of the accounts. The maximum number of Deferred Share Award shares granted during the year is therefore estimated using the 
closing share price on 30 September 2015. The 2014 weighted averages have been amended to reflect the actual number of shares granted in 
2015.

  The Deferred Share Award for the executive directors vests in 4 years, the Deferred Share Award for the executive management vests in two equal 
tranches after 2 and 3 years and the Deferred Share Award for the other members of the senior team vests after 3 years.
* The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after 3, 4 and 5 years.
Expected share-price volatility is based on historic volatility over the same period of time as the vesting period of 
the option. For the LTIP the expected life of an option is based on historical data.
The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met. This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria 
has therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP . These 
conditions have been incorporated into the Monte-Carlo Simulation model which is used to fair value the TSR 
element of the scheme.

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the Members of Enterprise Inns plc
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2015 which comprise:
Group Parent company
Group balance sheet Company balance sheet 
Group income statement 
Group statement of comprehensive income Company statement of comprehensive income 
Group statement of changes in equity Company statement of changes in equity 
Group cash flow statement Company cash flow statement 
Related notes 1 to 33 to the financial statements Related notes 1 to 33 to the financial statements
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our opinion on the financial statements 
In our opinion: 
 ■ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
30 September 2015 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended; 
 ■ the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and for the Parent Company as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 ■ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality ■ Overall Group materiality of £6.0 million (2014: £6.0 million) which represents 5% (2014: 5%) of pre-
exceptional profit before tax.
Audit scope ■ We performed an audit of the complete financial information of four (2014: four) full scope components and 
performed audit procedures in respect of ten (2014: eight) review scope components, four (2014: two) of 
which were established to hold the Group’s managed house operations. 
 ■ The components where we performed full scope audit procedures accounted for over 99% of pre-
exceptional profit before tax, revenue and total assets. 
 ■ The components subject to review scope audit procedures covered the remainder (less than 1%) of pre-
exceptional profit before tax, revenue and total assets.
Risks of material 
misstatement 
 ■ Valuation of the estate (principally pubs), including assets held for sale, impact of diversifying the business 
model and the wider implications of the market rent only (MRO) option (£3.7 billion (2014: £3.9 billion)); 
 ■ Goodwill impairment review, including the impact of the new operating segments;
 ■ Going concern assessment, including compliance with debt covenants and the impact of the partial 
refinancing of the 2018 £600 million corporate bonds and the whole of the forward start facility (FSF); and
 ■ Deferred tax on the valuation of the estate.

The scope of an audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the 
Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our 
report. 
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing the audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining 
the nature and extent of our audit procedures. (ISA 320)

Materiality of £6m (5% of £122m)
  We determined materiality for the Group to be £6 million  
(2014: £6 million), which is 5% (2014: 5%) of pre-exceptional profit 
before tax. We use pre-exceptional profit before tax as reported by 
the Group to exclude the impact of exceptional items which do not 
reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group. This avoids 
inappropriate variations in our materiality as a result of non-
recurring items and fluctuations in the carrying value of the estate 
which can be significant compared to underlying trading 
performance. 
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds 
materiality. (ISA 320)
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our 
judgement was that performance materiality should be set at 75% (2014: 50%) of materiality, the top end of our range, 
namely £4.5 million (2014: £3 million); although we reduce our testing threshold in areas of significant risk to appropriately 
reflect our assessment of risk of material misstatement and focus on the key judgements and estimates. We have 
increased our assessment of performance materiality from 50% to 75% as a result of limited historical audit findings in 
prior years and reflecting the results of our testing of the underlying systems and processes operated by the Group. 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial. (ISA 450)
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of 
£0.3 million (2014: £0.3 million), which is set at 5% of materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our 
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and 
in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the Members of Enterprise Inns plc
Scope of our audit for the year ended 30 September 2015
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine the 
audit scope for each component within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the financial 
statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide 
controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing 
the level of work to be performed at each component. 
The Group continues to operate from a single office in the UK and has common financial systems, processes and 
controls covering the vast majority of its operations, other than its managed house operations two of which were 
established and two of which commenced trading during the current financial year. In assessing the risk of material 
misstatement to the financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts 
in the financial statements, of the 14 (2014:12) reporting components of the Group, we selected four (2014: four) 
components, which represent the principal business units within the Group. These components account for in excess 
of 99% (2014: virtually 100%) of the Group’s pre-exceptional profit before tax, revenue and total assets, one being 
the Parent Company (“the Company”) itself, and all of which were subject to full scope audits. The audits of these 
entities are performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of the Group materiality appropriate 
to the relevant scale of the business concerned. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to 
components was £1 .7 million (2014: £1 .1 million) to £3.0 million (2014: £3.0 million). 
The financial records for the 4 (2014: 2) managed house operations are maintained by third party managers. In total 
these entities represent less than 1% of (2014: negligible) pre-exceptional profit before tax, revenue and total assets. 
These entities have been subject to review scope audit procedures based on performance materiality of £0.5 million. The 
remaining 6 (2014: 6) components contain no transactions or balances external to the Group and we have validated that 
all transactions/balances eliminate on consolidation.
The audit of all the components within the Group is undertaken by one audit team. Due to the nature of the main risk 
areas noted below, the audit team includes tax specialists and is supported by specialists in property valuations and the 
evaluation of the weighted average cost of capital.
Our assessment of the risks of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall 
audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing 
these risks, we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements 
as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas.

Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to 
the Audit Committee
Valuation of the estate (principally 
pubs), including assets held for 
sale, plus the impact of diversifying 
the business model and the wider 
implications of the market rent only 
(MRO) option (£3.7 billion (2014: £3.9 
billion))
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(from page 51); Accounting policies (from 
page 90); and note 17 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements (from page 107)
This is the largest estimate within 
the financial statements, prepared on 
an asset by asset basis. Whilst the 
valuation is performed by a combination 
of internal and external appropriately 
qualified valuers (as described in note 
17) there remains a risk that, as a result 
of individual assets being over or under 
valued, there is a material error in the 
valuation of the overall estate such that it 
is not suitable for inclusion in the financial 
statements.
The risk of management override in 
respect of the valuation has decreased 
in the year through the decision to 
increase the extent to which the valuation 
has been performed by third party 
independent valuers such that in the 
current year the external valuers were 
responsible for 92% of the valuation 
(by value) (2014: 47%) although the 
introduction of new external valuers has 
increased the risk that the underlying 
circumstances of the property may not 
be properly reflected, as a new valuer 
has less experience of the assets. 
The existence of impending legislation 
surrounding MRO also increases the risk 
that the valuation may fail to accurately 
reflect the circumstances of individual 
assets. 
As the requirements of IFRS 13 “Fair 
Value Measurement” were implemented 
last year, we consider that the risk of 
incomplete or inappropriate disclosures, 
or failure to consider the requirement to 
value assets on a highest and best use 
basis has diminished in the year.
Having considered the over-riding trading and valuation trends 
in the UK pub market, together with the specific factors 
affecting the Group as noted in column 1, our approach was 
to understand and challenge the valuation process adopted, 
perform detailed testing, conclude on our results and ensure 
appropriate disclosures as required under IFRS 13.
We identified, documented and confirmed our understanding 
of the controls operated by the Group surrounding the valuation 
process.
We performed detailed testing of a sample of assets whereby 
individual movements in their asset values were investigated 
and validated to the individual property valuations. The whole of 
the estate is covered by the components subject to full scope 
audits. 
In order to select a sample focused on those asset valuations 
we considered to be most at risk of misstatement, we analysed 
features including the trading performance of the individual 
asset, the nature of the rent agreement and management’s 
qualitative grading of assets within the overall estate. This 
analysis which utilised bespoke analytics of the whole estate, 
sorted by valuer, highlighted those classes of assets, or 
individual assets, where the movement in value was not 
consistent with our expectations.
In addition, together with our internal property valuation 
specialists, we met with the Group’s internal and external 
valuers to discuss and challenge the method adopted, the 
derivation of the key inputs of fair maintainable trade and 
earnings multiple (as described in note 17) and the nature and 
extent of the work they performed in preparing the valuations. 
We sought explanations for the movement in the value of the 
estate as a whole, movement in the value of appropriate sub 
divisions of the estate, and where necessary, movement in 
the value of individual assets, satisfying ourselves that the 
explanations were reasonable and supported by appropriate 
evidence.
For valuations by the new valuer (see note 17) we tested 
a sample of assets with unusual year on year movements, 
extending similar verfication tests undertaken by management. 
We discussed the nature and extent of the additional disclosures 
made by the Group in order to address the requirements of IFRS 
13, including obtaining the views of the internal and external 
valuers. We made enquiries of the Group and the external 
valuers to ensure that the asset’s highest and best use was 
reflected in the asset’s valuation within property, plant and 
equipment at the year end, or where applicable, immediately 
prior to transfer to non-current assets held for sale.
That the valuers, 
including the new 
valuers retained in 
the year, had adopted 
an approach to the 
valuation of the estate 
which was appropriate, 
consistent, and in 
accordance with 
applicable guidance. 
That the result of the 
estate valuation was 
suitable for inclusion 
in the financial 
statements.

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the Members of Enterprise Inns plc
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to 
the Audit Committee
Goodwill impairment review, 
including the impact of the new 
operating segments
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(from page 51); Accounting policies 
(from page 90); and note 15 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
(from page 105)
As discussed in note 15 the Group 
has identified five operating segments 
(2014: one). As a result, a new risk 
exists in the current year due to the 
requirement for the Group to allocate 
goodwill between operating segments 
and test impairment for each segment.
The impairment review of goodwill with 
a total carrying value of £330 million 
(2014: £338 million) is considered to be 
a risk area due to the reliance of the 
impairment review on the accuracy of 
forecast cash flows, and the sensitivity 
of the review to the key assumptions of 
discount rate and long-term growth as 
described in note 15. 
Whilst the risk surrounding the 
impairment review has increased in 
the year, due to the requirement to 
perform the review for each operating 
segment, it is further increased by the 
lack of historical trading information for 
the new segments upon which to base 
forecasts. However, due to the relative 
size of these segments, the amount 
of goodwill allocated to them at 30 
September 2015 is relatively small at 
£15 million.
Goodwill was included wholly within 
that part of the audit subject to full 
scope procedures.
We identified, documented and confirmed our understanding 
of the controls operated by the Group surrounding the goodwill 
allocation and impairment process.
We challenged the basis on which goodwill had been allocated 
to operating segments and recalculated the allocation in respect 
of a sample of the assets moved into the new segments 
established in the year to ensure that the basis adopted had 
been applied correctly.
On a segment by segment basis, we examined the Group’s 
forecast cash flows which underpin the goodwill impairment 
review. We challenged the reasonableness of those forecasts 
by testing the underlying models, including analysis of the 
underlying assumptions, and by reference to the accuracy 
of previous forecasts and the historic evidence supporting 
underlying assumptions. Where forecasts related to newly 
formed segments for which no prior year experience existed, 
we considered their accuracy in respect of actual performance 
in the year ended 30 September 2015 and, for commercial 
property, their consistency with contractual rent agreements.
The reasonableness of the key assumptions of discount rate 
and long-term growth rate underlying the goodwill impairment 
review were challenged through a combination of testing the 
Group’s detailed calculations, benchmarking the output against 
comparator companies and, in respect of the discount rate 
assumption, an independent assessment by our specialists 
based on general market indicators. We also considered 
whether any reasonably possible change in these key 
assumptions required disclosure under IAS 36 – “Impairment of 
Assets” .
That the allocation 
of goodwill to 
operating segments 
was appropriate 
and in line with the 
requirements of IAS 
36.
That the forecasts 
used were a 
reasonable basis 
upon which 
to prepare the 
impairment review.
That the assumptions 
used for discount 
rates, although 
towards the lower 
end of our view of 
an acceptable range 
are consistent with 
comparator groups 
and appropriate.
That the assumption 
for long-term growth 
was consistent with 
comparator groups 
and appropriate.
That the sensitivity 
disclosures made by 
the Group in respect 
of break even points 
for key assumptions 
were correctly 
established.
As a result, we 
agreed that no 
impairment of 
the goodwill was 
required.

Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to 
the Audit Committee
Going concern assessment, including 
compliance with debt covenants, and 
the impact of the partial refinancing 
of the 2018 £600m corporate bonds 
and the whole of the forward start 
facility (FSF) 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(from page 51); Accounting policies 
(from page 90); and note 23 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
(from page 119)
The Group has to comply with a range 
of covenants in respect of its corporate 
bonds, securitised bonds and bank 
borrowings as described in note 23; 
compliance with which form a key 
part of the Group’s going concern 
assessment. These borrowings are 
all included within the components 
subject to full scope audits. 
The Group’s forecast cash flows, 
discussed above under goodwill, 
also underpin the going concern 
assessment.
The judgement that the refinancing 
of the FSF represented an 
extinguishment, as established during 
the 2014 audit, and along with the 
partial refinancing of the £600 million 
corporate bond together created a 
risk that costs arising as a result of 
the refinancing may be accounted for 
incorrectly.
We identified, documented and confirmed our understanding 
of the controls operated by the Group surrounding their 
assessment of going concern and the recognition of costs 
arising as a result of the refinancing.
The Group’s forecasts were subject to review, as noted above.
We also recalculated the forecast compliance with the terms of 
the covenants to which the Group and subsidiaries are subject, 
taking account of the relevant terms of the securitised debt 
structure. 
We ensured that the accounting arising as a result of the 
refinancing, and specifically the treatment of that element of the 
refinancing categorised as an extinguishment (established and 
audited in the prior year) was correctly reflected in the financial 
statements.
That we concur with 
the going concern 
assumption used by 
management in the 
financial statements.
That, as reported in 
the prior year, the 
FSF refinancing in 
October 2014 was 
properly categorised 
and disclosed as an 
extinguishment. 
That as a result of 
the refinancing an 
exceptional finance 
cost of £26 million 
has been correctly 
recorded.

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the Members of Enterprise Inns plc
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to 
the Audit Committee
Deferred tax on the valuation of the 
estate
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(from page 51); Accounting policies 
(from page 90); and note 27 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
(from page 130)
The calculation of the deferred tax 
provision in respect of that element 
of the provision associated with the 
valuation of the estate is complex, 
involving the interaction of accounting 
standards and multiple elements of tax 
legislation. 
This element of the deferred tax 
provision, which totals £177 million 
(2014: £191 million), has to be 
calculated in respect of circa 5,000 
individual assets using a bespoke tax 
model.
The deferred tax is wholly within the 
components subject to full scope 
audits. 
We identified, documented and confirmed our understanding of 
the controls operated by the Group surrounding the recognition 
of deferred tax arising on the valution of the estate.
Through the consideration of known and predictable scenarios 
for a randomly selected sample of assets across the estate, 
the tax specialists in our team re-performed the calculation 
of deferred tax to validate the ability of the model utilised by 
the Group to accurately calculate deferred tax on the estate 
valuation. This ensured that the model has been correctly 
established to apply current tax legislation and enacted tax 
rates. 
We also reperformed the overall proof of tax prepared by 
management on a performance statement basis and ensured 
movements in the year were in line with our expectations. We 
investigated any unexplained movement.
That, the process for 
deriving the deferred 
tax in respect of 
the estate held 
at valuation has 
resulted in provisions 
which are fairly 
stated.
The above risks are the same as in the prior year, unless stated otherwise. Revenue recognition and the risk of fraud 
arising from management override of internal controls in other areas of the audit to the matters described above, being 
significant risks prescribed by ISA ’s, are not included above, as they were not areas of greatest audit effort.

Special Resolutions
To consider and, if thought fit, to pass the following resolutions, which 
will be proposed as special resolutions:
15. To empower the Directors pursuant to section 570 of the 
Companies Act 2006 to allot equity securities (as defined in 
section 560(1) of that Act) for cash pursuant to the general 
authority conferred on them by resolution 13 above and/or to sell 
equity securities held as treasury shares for cash pursuant to 
section 727 of that Act, in each case as if section 561(1) of that 
Act did not apply to any such allotment or sale, provided that this 
power shall be limited to:
a) any such allotment and/or sale of equity securities in 
connection with an offer or issue by way of rights or other 
pre-emptive offer or issue, open for acceptance for a period 
fixed by the Directors, to holders of ordinary shares (other 
than the Company) on the register on any record date fixed 
by the Directors in proportion (as nearly as may be) to the 
respective number of ordinary shares deemed to be held by 
them, subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as 
the Directors may deem necessary or expedient in relation 
to fractional entitlements, legal or practical problems arising 
in any overseas territory, the requirements of any regulatory 
body or stock exchange or any other matter whatsoever; and
b) any such allotment and/or sale, otherwise than pursuant to 
paragraph (a) above, of equity securities having an aggregate 
nominal amount or, in the case of other equity securities, 
giving the right to subscribe for or convert into relevant 
shares having an aggregate nominal amount, not exceeding 
the sum of £1,389,943.59.
This authority shall expire, unless previously revoked or renewed 
by the Company in general meeting, at such time as the general 
authority conferred on the Directors by resolution 13 above 
expires, except that the Company may at any time before such 
expiry make any offer or agreement which would or might 
require equity securities to be allotted or equity securities held 
as treasury shares to be sold after such expiry and the Directors 
may allot equity securities and/or sell equity securities held as 
treasury shares in pursuance of such an offer or agreement as if 
the power conferred by this resolution had not expired.
16. To authorise the Company generally and unconditionally to make 
market purchases (as defined in section 693(4) of the Companies

pence each in aggregate; 
b) pays not less than 2½ pence (excluding expenses) per 
ordinary share of 2½ pence each; and

shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily 
Official List for the five business days immediately before 
the day on which it purchases that share; and (ii) the price 
stipulated by Article 5(1) of the Buy-back and Stabilisation 
Regulation (EC 2273/2003) or (as the case may be) EU 
Commission-adopted Regulatory Technical Standards

This authority shall expire fifteen months after the date of the 
passing of this resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2017 , 
except that the Company may, if it agrees to purchase ordinary 
shares under this authority before it expires, complete the 
purchase wholly or partly after this authority expires.
17. To authorise the Directors to call a general meeting of the 
Company, other than an Annual General Meeting, on not less

Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting
1. A member who is an individual is entitled to attend, speak and 
vote at the meeting or to appoint one or more other persons as 
his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights on his behalf. Further 
details of how to appoint a proxy, and the rights of proxies, are 
given in the paragraphs below. A member that is a company 
can appoint one or more corporate representatives (such as a 
director or employee of the company) whose attendance at the 
meeting is treated as if the company were attending in person, 
or it can appoint one or more persons as its proxy to exercise 
all or any of its rights on its behalf. In each case, a person 
attending the meeting will need to provide the Company or its 
registrars, Computershare Investor Services PLC, with evidence 
of their identity and, if applicable, their appointment as a proxy 
or corporate representative with authority to vote on behalf of a 
member. 
2. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the 
Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is appointed 
to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares 
held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a shareholder of 
the Company. To appoint a proxy or proxies, shareholders must 
complete: (a) a form of proxy, sign it and return it, together with 
the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it 
is signed, or a notarially certified copy of such authority, to the 
Company’s registrars, Computershare Investor Services PLC, 
The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS99 6ZY; or (b) a CREST 
Proxy Instruction (as set out in paragraph 11 below); or (c) an 
online proxy appointment at www.investorcentre.co.uk/eproxy 
(you will need to enter the Control Number, together with your 
unique PIN and Shareholder Reference Number printed on your 
personalised form of proxy), in each case so that it is received no 
later than 11 .00 a.m. on 9 February 2016. To appoint more than 
one proxy, you will need to complete a separate proxy form in 
relation to each appointment. A personalised form of proxy for 
use in connection with the Annual General Meeting is enclosed 
with this document. If you do not have a personalised form of 
proxy and believe that you should, please contact the Company’s 
registrars, Computershare Investor Services PLC, on 0370 889 
4080 or at Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, 
Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS99 6ZY . 
3. You will need to state clearly on each proxy form the number of 
shares in relation to which the proxy is appointed. A failure to 
specify the number of shares each proxy appointment relates to, 
or specifying a number of shares in excess of those held by the 
member, will result in the proxy appointment being invalid.
4. The return of a completed proxy form, other such instrument or 
any CREST Proxy Instruction (as described in paragraph 11 below) 
will not prevent a shareholder attending the Annual General 
Meeting and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so. 
5. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint 
holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is 
determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders 
appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the 
joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).
6. Any person to whom this Notice is sent who is a person 
nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to 
enjoy information rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an 
agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/
she was nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have 
someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General 
Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment 
right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such 
agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as 
to the exercise of voting rights. 
7. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the 
appointment of proxies in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above does 
not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights described in these 
paragraphs can only be exercised by shareholders of the 
Company.
8. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001, the Company gives notice that only those 
shareholders included in the register of members of the 
Company at 6.00 p.m. on 9 February 2016 or, if the meeting is 
adjourned, in the register of members at 6.00 p.m. on the day 
which is two days before the day of any adjourned meeting, will 
be entitled to attend and to vote at the Annual General Meeting 
in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at 
that time. Changes to entries on the share register after 6.00 
p.m. on 9 February 2016, or, if the meeting is adjourned, in the 
register of members at 6.00 p.m. on the day which is two days 
before the day of any adjourned meeting, will be disregarded 
in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the 
Annual General Meeting.
9. As at 9.00 a.m. on 7 December 2015, the Company’s issued 
share capital comprised 555,977 ,435 ordinary shares of 2½ 
pence each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a 
general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number 
of voting rights in the Company as at 9.00 a.m. on 7 December 
2015 is 555,977 ,435. After excluding treasury shares, which 
cannot be voted, the total number of voting rights in the company 
as at 9.00 a.m. on 7 December 2015 is 505,977 ,435.
10. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through 
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so 
for the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) of the 
meeting by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual 
(available via www.euroclear.com/CREST). CREST personal 
members or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed a service provider(s), 
should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), 
who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
11. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the 
CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in 
accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications, 
and must contain the information required for such instruction, 
as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless 
of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an 
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed 
proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be 
received by the Company’s agent (ID 3RA50), by the latest time 
for receipt of proxy appointments set out in paragraph 2 above. 
For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time 
(as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the 
CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent is 
able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner 
prescribed by CREST . After this time, any change of instructions 
to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to 
the appointee through other means.

12. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors 
or voting service providers, should note that Euroclear UK & 
Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in 
CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and 
limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST 
Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member 
concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal 
member, or sponsored member, or has appointed any voting 
service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to 
ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST 
system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST 
members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting 
service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of 
the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST 
system and timings.
13. Under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, members 
meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section 
have the right to require the Company to publish on a website 
a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of 
the Company’s accounts (including the Auditor’s Report and the 
conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General 
Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of 
the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at 
which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with 
section 437 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company may not 
require the shareholders requesting any such website publication 
to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a 
statement on a website under section 527 of the Companies Act 
2006, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor 
not later than the time when it makes the statement available on 
the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual 
General Meeting includes any statement that the Company has 
been required under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to 
publish on a website.
14. Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask 
questions. The Company must answer any such question relating 
to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such 
answer need be given if: (a) to do so would interfere unduly 
with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of 
confidential information; (b) the answer has already been given 
on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or (c) it is 
undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of 
the meeting that the question be answered.
15. If you have sold or otherwise transferred all your ordinary shares 
in the Company, please forward this Annual Report and Accounts 
to the purchaser or transferee or to the stockbroker, bank or 
other person through whom the sale or transfer was effected for 
transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
16. The service agreements of the executive directors and copies 
of the letters of appointment of the non-executive directors are 
available for inspection during normal business hours on any 
weekday (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) at 
the registered office of the Company and will be available for 
inspection for fifteen minutes prior to and during the Annual 
General Meeting.
17. You may not use any electronic address provided in this 
Notice, or any related documents including the proxy form, to 
communicate with the Company for any purposes other than 
those expressly stated.

Enterprise Inns AR2015 Back.indd   155 07/12/2015   17:25:00 24341 .04    7 December 2015 5:19 PM    Proof 7
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to 
be held on 11 February 2016 is set out on pages 152 to 153 of 
the Annual Report and Accounts. The following notes provide an 
explanation as to why the resolutions set out in the Notice are to 
be put to shareholders.
Resolutions 1 to 14 are ordinary resolutions. These resolutions 
will be passed if more than 50% of the votes cast for or against 
are in favour.
Resolution 1 — Laying of accounts
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 2006 to present to the 
shareholders of the Company at a general meeting the reports of the 
Directors and Auditor, and the audited accounts of the Company, for the 
year ended 30 September 2015. The reports of the Directors and the 
audited accounts have been approved by the Directors, and the report 
of the auditor has been approved by the auditor, and a copy of each of 
these documents may be found in the Annual Report and Accounts. 
Resolutions 2 and 3 — Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is now divided into two parts: 
(1) an annual statement, which is shown on pages 59 to 62 of the 
Annual Report and Accounts, and an annual report on remuneration, 
which starts at page 72 of the Annual Report and Accounts (together 
the “annual remuneration report”), and (2) where a vote on the 
remuneration policy is proposed, the proposed directors’ remuneration 
policy (the “remuneration policy”) starts at page 62 of the Annual 
Report and Accounts.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Company to seek shareholder 
approval of the annual remuneration report on an annual basis. This is 
sought in resolution 2.
The Companies Act 2006 also now requires the Company to have 
received shareholder approval of a remuneration policy for its 
directors. This is a binding policy and, after it takes effect, the Directors 
will not be entitled to remuneration unless such remuneration is 
consistent with the approved policy from time to time or shareholders 
otherwise approve the remuneration. The Company obtained 
shareholder approval for a policy at its AGM in February 2015 and 
while, ordinarily, it would not need to seek fresh approval from its 
shareholders for its policy until its AGM in February 2018, the review 
of remuneration policy for the directors which has occurred over the 
past year, has led the Company to propose a new remuneration policy 
for its directors. Approval of the new policy is sought in resolution 3 
and, if approved, the policy will take effect from the end of the AGM 
and will replace the policy approved by shareholders in February 2015.
Resolutions 4–9 — Re-election of directors
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all of the 
Directors of the Company will stand for re-election. Biographical 
information for the Directors is shown on pages 44 and 45 of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. Details of why the Board believes 
that the relevant directors should be re-elected are included in the 
Governance Report in the Annual Report and Accounts, starting at 
page 46.
Resolution 10 — Director appointed since the 
last Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Articles of Association require that directors appointed 
by the Board must seek re-appointment at the next following AGM. 
Accordingly, Marisa Cassoni is retiring and is seeking re-appointment. 
Biographical information for Marisa Cassoni is shown on page 44 of 
the Annual Report and Accounts. Details of why the Board believes 
she should be re-appointed are included in the Governance Report in 
the Annual Report and Accounts, starting at page 46.
Resolution 11 — Auditor’s re-appointment 
The Companies Act 2006 requires that an auditor is appointed at each 
general meeting at which accounts are laid, to hold office until the 
next such meeting. The resolution seeks shareholder approval for the 
re-appointment of Ernst & Young LLP . The Audit Committee keeps 
under review the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, 
further information on which can be found in the Annual Report and 
Accounts on pages 54 and 55. After considering relevant information, 
the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that Ernst & Young 
LLP be re-appointed.
Resolution 12 — Auditor’s remuneration
This resolution gives the Directors the authority to determine the 
remuneration of the Auditor for the audit work to be carried out by 
them in the next financial year. The amount of the remuneration paid 
to the Auditor for the next financial year will be disclosed in the next 
audited accounts of the Company.
Resolution 13 — Authority to the directors to allot 
shares
The Companies Act 2006 provides that the Directors may only allot 
shares if authorised by shareholders to do so. Resolution 13 will, if 
passed, authorise the Directors to allot shares and to grant rights 
to subscribe for, or convert securities into, shares up to a maximum 
nominal amount of £8,432,957.24, which represents an amount which 
is approximately equal to two-thirds of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company as at 7 December 2015 (excluding treasury 
shares), the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the 
Notice. The Company did not issue any shares during the period under 
review but, pursuant to the terms of convertible bonds previously 
issued by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, it has agreed to 
issue up to 50,800,000 shares on conversion of the bonds.
As provided in paragraph (a) of the resolution, up to half of this 
authority (equal to one-third of the issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company) will enable the directors to allot and issue new shares 
in whatever manner (subject to pre-emption rights) they see fit. 
Paragraph (b) of the resolution provides that the remainder of the 
authority (equal to a further one-third of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company) may only be used in connection with a rights 
issue in favour of ordinary shareholders. As paragraph (a) imposes no 
restrictions on the way the authority may be exercised, it could be 
used in conjunction with paragraph (b) so as to enable the whole two-
thirds authority to be used in connection with a rights issue.
The authority will expire at the earlier of the date that is fifteen months 
after the date of the passing of the resolution and the conclusion of 
the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Passing resolution 13 will ensure that the Directors continue to 
have the flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders, when 
opportunities arise,by issuing new shares. There are no current plans 
to issue new shares except in connection with employee share 
schemes and on conversion of the bonds.
As at 7 December 2015, the latest practicable date prior to the 
publication of the Notice, the Company had 555,977 ,435 ordinary 
shares of 2½ pence each in issue and held 50,000,000 treasury 
shares, which is equal to approximately 9.88% of the issued share 
capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at that date.

Resolution 14 — Approval of amendments to the 
Enterprise Inns 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(the “2015 LTIP”)
The Company obtained shareholder approval for the 2015 LTIP at its 
AGM in February 2015. As referred to in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report set out on pages 59 to 82 of the Annual Report and Accounts, 
the Company is proposing amendments to its Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy and shareholder approval for a revised policy is sought at the 
Annual General Meeting as referred to in resolution 3. To reflect the 
revised Directors’ Remuneration Policy, it is proposed that amendments 
are made to the 2015 LTIP . The rules of the 2015 LTIP marked-up to 
show the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the 
office of Deloitte LLP (Company Secretarial Department), 2 New Street 
Square, London EC4A 3BZ on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and 
public holidays excluded) until the close of the Annual General Meeting, 
and will also be available at the place of the Annual General Meeting for 
at least 15 minutes before and during the meeting. The amendments 
proposed are to the individual limit on participation, as follows. 
Current 
individual limit 
on participation Proposed individual limit on participation
Awards may not 
be granted to 
a participant in 
respect of any 
financial year 
over shares with 
a market value 
(as determined 
by the 
Remuneration 
Committee) in 
excess of 150% 
of salary. 
In respect of the Company’s 2015/2016 financial 
year, awards may be granted to a participant over 
shares with a market value (as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee) of up to 175% of salary. 
In respect of each of the Company’s 2016/2017 
financial year and the Company’s 2017/2018 financial 
year, a participant may be granted awards over a 
number of shares equal to the maximum number 
of shares over which he could have been granted 
an award in respect of the 2015/2016 financial 
year. This number of shares may be adjusted by 
the Remuneration Committee in the event of any 
variation of the Company’s share capital, demerger 
or other similar event which, in the opinion of the 
Remuneration Committee, affects the market value 
of a share. 
Resolutions 15–17 are special resolutions. These resolutions will 
be passed if not less than 75% of the votes cast for or against are 
in favour.
Resolution 15 — Partial disapplication of 
statutory pre-emption rights
The Companies Act 2006 requires that, if the Company issues new 
shares for cash or sells any treasury shares, it must first offer them 
to existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings. It is 
proposed that the directors be authorised to issue shares for cash 
and/or sell shares from treasury up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £1,389,943.59 (representing approximately 10% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary capital as at 7 December 2015, the latest practicable 
date prior to the publication of this Notice) without offering them 
to shareholders first. In accordance with the Pre-Emption Group’s 
Statement of Principles, the directors confirm that, to the extent that 
this part of the authority is used for an issue of shares representing 
more than 5% of the Company’s issued share capital at that date, the 
directors intend that such authority will only be used in connection 
with an acquisition or specified capital investment that is announced 
contemporaneously with the issue, or that has taken place in the 
preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of 
the issue. This part of the authority is designed to provide the directors 
with the flexibility to raise further equity funding and to pursue 
acquisition opportunities as and when they arise. The other part of the 
authority disapplies statutory pre-emption rights to deal with legal, 
regulatory or practical problems that may arise on a rights or other 
pre-emptive offer or issue. For example, the Company having to offer 
shares to shareholders in certain jurisdictions can result in significant 
compliance obligations and compliance with such obligations may be 
time consuming and costly. If resolution 15 is passed, this authority 
will expire at the same time as the authority to allot shares given 
pursuant to resolution 13.
The directors consider this authority necessary in order to give them 
flexibility to deal with opportunities as they arise, subject to the 
restrictions contained in the resolution.
Resolution 16 — Purchase of own shares by the 
Company
If passed, this resolution will grant the Company authority for a period 
of up to fifteen months after the date of passing of the resolution to 
buy its own shares in the market. The resolution limits the number of 
shares that may be purchased to 14.99% of the Company’s issued 
share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 7 December 2015, the 
latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice. The price 
per ordinary share that the Company may pay is set at a minimum 
amount (excluding expenses) of 2½ pence per ordinary share and a 
maximum amount (excluding expenses) of the higher of: (i) 5% over 
the average of the previous five business days’ middle market prices; 
and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the 
highest current independent bid on the trading venue where the 
purchase is carried out. This authority will only be exercised if market 
conditions make it advantageous to do so.
The Directors’ present intention is that shares purchased pursuant to 
this authority will be cancelled immediately on purchase. Alternatively, 
the shares may be held in treasury, sold for cash or (provided Listing 
Rule requirements are met) transferred to an employees’ share 
scheme. The effect of any cancellation would be to reduce the number 
of shares in issue. For most purposes, while held in treasury, shares 
are treated as if they have been cancelled (for example, they carry no 
voting rights and do not rank for dividends). The Directors will only 
make purchases under this authority if they believe that the effect of 
such purchases (where such shares are purchased for cancellation) 
would result in increased earnings per share, and would be in the 
interests of the shareholders generally.
As at 7 December 2015, the latest practicable date prior to the 
publication of the Notice, the total number of options to subscribe 
for ordinary shares of 2½ pence each in the Company was 7 ,340,638, 
representing approximately 1 .45% of the issued share capital of the 
Company (excluding treasury shares) at that date. If the proposed 
market purchase authority were to be used in full and all of the 
repurchased ordinary shares were cancelled (but the Company’s 
issued share capital otherwise remained unaltered), the total number 
of options to subscribe for ordinary shares at that date would 
represent approximately 1 .71% of the Company’s issued share capital 
(excluding treasury shares).
Resolution 17 — Approving the notice period for 
General Meetings
In order to maintain its ability to call general meetings (other than an 
Annual General Meeting) on 14 clear days’ notice, the Company must 
offer all shareholders the ability to appoint a proxy electronically (via 
the website of the Company or its registrars) and must obtain the 
approval of its shareholders by means of a special resolution passed 
each year. Resolution 17 seeks such approval. It is intended that a 
similar resolution will be proposed at future Annual General Meetings.

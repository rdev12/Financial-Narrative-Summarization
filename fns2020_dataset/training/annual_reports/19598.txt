CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Introduction
The Group is pleased to announce 
the results for the year ended 
31 March 2015. We have again seen 
significant improvement to the Group’s 
pre-tax profitability, adjusted net asset 
value per share and market capitalisation 
this year, leading to Sirius not only being 
included in the FTSE AIM 100 Index for 
the first time but, at the time of this 
report, ranking 38
th
 in that table.
On 5 December 2014, Sirius completed 
its secondary listing on the JSE and, at the 
same time, successfully raised €40 million to 
support the expansion of its portfolio 
through the acquisition of four business 
parks for €70.9 million. These assets were 
purchased with an European Public Real 
Estate Association (“EPRA”) net initial yield 
of 8.1% and three of them have been 
financed with a five year €36 million bank 
facility with a 2.85% fixed interest rate. 
With an initial yield spread of greater than 
5.2% and plenty of value-added opportunities 
within the sites, these acquisitions are 
expected to be very accretive to earnings 
going forward, initially delivering a 
cash-on-cash yield of 12.9%. The JSE 
listing also further diversifies the Company’s 
shareholder base, providing existing and 
new South African investors with an 
opportunity to participate in the Company’s 
income and value generation potential. 
This increased liquidity and tradeability 
of the Company’s shares will further help 
Sirius grow in the future.
The intensive capex investment programme 
aimed at delivering organic growth has seen 
some encouraging results in the period. 
The programme commenced in January 2014 
and is focused on around 100,000 sqm of 
previously unlettable or under-rented space 
that was either vacant or significantly 
under-rented at the time the initiative 
commenced. The space targeted represented 
approximately 50% of the vacant space 
of the core portfolio. As at 31 March 2015, 
we have fully transformed 37,860 sqm 
of this space, of which 74% is let and is 
already contributing €1.96 million of 
rental income to the Group.
The value of our property portfolio has 
grown to €550.0 million as at 31 March 2015 
(31 March 2014: €445.5 million*), with 
€76.2 million of the increase attributable 
to the acquisitions (cost plus revaluation) 
and €28.3 million coming from revaluation 
uplift on the pre-acquisitions portfolio. 
The uplift on the latter is largely due to rental 
growth and improvement in service charge 
irrecoverability and we have as yet only 
seen a small amount of yield compression. 
We report a €5.3 million revaluation uplift 
on the recently acquired properties, which 
is a direct result of our ability to find properties 
to acquire at a discount to valuation. We are 
confident that there is potential for further 
uplifts on the total portfolio in the coming 
years from our asset management initiatives, 
especially as a result of our ongoing capex 
investment programme.
* Adjusted for disposals.
Financial results
The Company has seen further 
improvement in profitability in the 
period; recurring profit before tax* 
including acquisitions was €12.6 million 
and excluding the impact of acquisitions 
was €11.8 million (2014: €9.4 million^). 
As the acquisitions were completed near the 
end of the financial year, the contribution to 
these results is limited, but they will materially 
increase earnings in the coming financial year. 
The improvement from the pre-acquisitions 
portfolio has largely come from increased 
rental income from our organic growth 
initiatives, as well as some further improvement 
from our recovery of service charge costs. 
Total income on the entire portfolio was 
€45.4 million of which €43.9 million was 
derived from the pre-acquisitions portfolio 
(2014: €42.8 million^), and profit before 
tax for the period was €32.7 million 
(2014: €31.0 million), which includes the 
property revaluations. Annualised gross 
rent roll of the 33 business parks increased 
by 21% to €50.0 million (31 March 2014: 
€41.3 million) in the twelve month period, 
of which €6.4 million (15.4%) has come from 
the addition of the four acquisitions and 
€2.3 million (5.6%) has come from organic 
growth of the pre-acquisitions portfolio.
Funds From Operations** FFO increased to 
€14.3 million (2014: €11.2 million) and FFO 
per share was 2.6c*** (2014: 2.8c). 
Adjusted EPS* was 2.10c as at 31 March 2015 
(31 March 2014: 2.26c^), whilst EPS was 
4.84c (31 March 2014: 6.83c^).
*  Excludes property revaluation, related deferred tax, 
non-controlling interests, profits on disposals, 
change in fair value of derivative financial 
instruments and non-recurring items.
**  See note 25 to the financial statements 
for explanation.
^  Adjusted for surrender premium and disposals 
to get a like-for-like comparison.
*** Based on average number of shares in issue 
throughout the period. This is lower than the 
prior year owing to more shares in issue through 
equity raises and acquisitions only completing 
towards the end of the year. DPS is calculated 
on actual shares in issue and not average 
shares in issue.
In summary:
 » We have again seen significant improvement to the Group’s  
pre-tax profitability, adjusted net asset value per share and 
market capitalisation this year
 » The value of our property portfolio has grown to €550.0 million 
as at 31 March 2015
 » Sirius has completed the refinancing of all banking facilities

CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Portfolio valuation and net asset value continued
The revaluation uplift on the pre-acquisitions portfolio as at 31 March 2015 was €28 million, representing a 6.4% increase in the twelve 
month period. The revaluation uplift on the acquisition portfolio of €5.3 million (€9.5 million offset with €4.2 million of acquisition costs) 
represents a 7.5% increase on what was paid for the assets. This is now the fourth valuation in succession where values have increased and, 
once again, most of the increases are due to rental income improvements rather than yield compression. The €33.6 million total valuation 
uplift translates to a €25.4 million gain in our books as shown in the table below and is driven largely from the returns experienced from the 
deployment of €3.1 million of our capex investment programme, our ability to purchase assets at discounted prices, as well as achieving 
further improvements in rent roll and service charge recovery during the period through properties and other asset management initiatives.

(31 March 2014: 9.2%) and a net yield of 8.2% (2014: 8.3%). The average capital value per sqm is €547.10 (31 March 2014: €479.10), 
which remains significantly below replacement cost.

Dividend
In September 2014, the Board resolved to 
increase the dividend payable to shareholders, 
due to stronger cash generation from 
operations as a result of the capex investment 
programme and growth in rental income. 
The dividend policy was enhanced to 65% 
of FFO, rather than the previously announced 
policy that referred to recurring profit 
after tax.
I am therefore pleased to confirm the Board 
has declared a final dividend of 0.84c per 
share making a total dividend for the year 
of 1.61c per share. The ex-dividend date 
will be 8 June 2015 for shareholders on the 
JSE register and 11 June 2015 for shareholders 
on the LSE register. The record date will be 
12 June 2015 and the dividend will be paid 
on 10 July 2015.
Sirius continues to offer shareholders the 
ability to receive dividends in scrip rather 
than as a cash alternative, for which there 
was a 29% scrip take-up on the dividend 
paid on 31 December 2014. Details of the 
scrip offer for the final dividend will be 
mailed to shareholders shortly. The latest 
date the scrip election form can be accepted 
is expected to be 26 June 2015. 
Funding
Sirius has completed the refinancing of 
all banking facilities and the Group has 
now secured borrowings of €255.3 million 
with four different lenders, representing an 
LTV ratio of 46.8% based on book value. 
As previously announced it is the Board’s 
intention to reduce the LTV ratio to 40% 
in the near term through a combination 
of debt amortisation as well as further 
improved valuations driven by our capex 
investment programme and other asset 
management initiatives. The bank debt 
expiry dates on the four outstanding 
facilities range between January 2017 
and July 2023 with an average unexpired 
term of 4.4 years. The first facilities due 
for renewal are the two Macquarie facilities, 
repayable in January 2017. These two 
facilities, with €56 million outstanding, 
bear interest at a blended rate of 
approximately 7% and are subject to a full 
cash sweep. Refinancing these two facilities 
at the currently available rates would result 
in a significant improvement to the Group’s 
profitability and cash flow and the Board 
is currently in discussions with a number 
of financial institutions on this.
German SME market
Market conditions in the German economy 
continue to improve and we believe that 
the SME sector in particular is in a strong 
position when compared to the previous 
twelve months. Gross domestic product, 
capital investment and exports have all 
increased in the three months from 
December 2014. The weaker euro exchange 
rate continues to lift German exports and, 
with the oil price declining, energy costs 
have fallen sharply. This has provided a 
significant boost to the German SME 
sector, which is a key market from which 
Sirius attracts its tenant base, particularly 
for our higher end SmartSpace products.
The European Central Bank recently 
launched an outright quantitative easing 
programme to stave off deflation, keep 
interest rates low and weaken the euro. 
As a consequence long-term Eurozone 
government bond yields, a proxy for the 
cost of capital, have declined significantly. 
Small to medium-sized German businesses 
now have more access to cheaper capital 
and so are more inclined to invest in 
expanding their businesses; Sirius offering 
of good quality, good value flexible workspace 
is proving to be very attractive.
Outlook
The Company continues to trade in line 
with expectations, and with the SME market 
in Germany continuing to improve, we are 
confident that demand for conventional 
and flexible workspace will remain strong 
across our core sites.
The capex investment programme, 
targeting 50% of our vacant space, is 
now nearing 40% completion and we are 
already seeing excellent rental returns from 
the previously unlettable or under-rented 
areas that have now been transformed. 
This, together with the recently acquired 
earnings enhancing sites, should impact 
positively on rental income, earnings 
and dividends going forward.

CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE’S 
REPORT
Introduction
In a successful period of new acquisitions, 
capital raising and organic growth, Sirius is 
pleased to report a strong twelve months 
of trading. The Group continues to measure 
its success in asset management through 
total returns generated by both increased 
income returns and improvement in capital 
returns. In this financial year, Sirius saw its 
recurring profit before tax increase by 26% 
on a like-for-like basis of the pre-acquisitions 
portfolio, driven largely by increased rental 
income across the board. Adjusted NAV per 
share has also seen a like-for-like increase 
of 10.5% during the year, after adjusting 
for the December 2014 equity raise and 
is now 47.5c as at 31 March 2015. Total 
NAV return, including dividends paid, was 
13.0%. Whilst this is a positive movement, 
we believe there remains further scope to 
improve the value of the Group’s portfolio 
of assets through the Group’s investment 
and asset management initiatives. This has 
been a significant contributor to the Group 
trading at a stronger share price, but the 
shares also appear to be benefiting from 
greater liquidity through the dual listing 
in Johannesburg as well as it now being 
one of the largest companies on AIM.
During the twelve months, Sirius has 
increased the portfolio from 30 business 
parks to 33 (29 of which are deemed to 
be core assets). The four acquisitions in 
the period have all been earnings enhancing 
and the intensive capex investment 
programme, aimed at transforming 
previously unlettable or under-rented space, 
is showing a positive return. The Sirius 
business model remains very much focused 
on organic growth and we will continue 
to leverage our operating platform and the 
experience of our management team as we 
scale up our portfolio. Ultimately, by having 
a relatively fixed overhead cost base spread 
over a larger estate, we are well positioned 
to harvest the economic benefits that a 
larger scale brings to the business.
Whilst we have increased our flexible products 
such as SmartSpace (Office, Storage and 
Workbox) and Flexilager, which offer higher 
yields than conventional lets, our core anchor 
tenant base remains strong, with our top 
50 tenants generating 54% of the rent roll. 
Operations
Strong market conditions mean that 
demand for our flexible and conventional 
workspace from the German SME market 
continues to be high. In particular, 
SmartSpace is progressing well with high 
demand for our SmartSpace Office and 
SmartSpace Storage products in our core 
locations. Whilst the returns from offering 
flexibility in the SmartSpace product range 
are particularly good at the moment, the 
Group continues to recognise the benefit 
of having a stable base with strong covenanted 
blue-chip anchor tenants, as well as mid-term 
conventional SME tenants. This asset 
management focus is as much directed 
towards strengthening the quality and 
security of this core income stream as it is 
on the higher yielding flexible income stream.
The diversity of our tenant base ensures that 
we can maximise the yield whilst preserving 
the covenant quality within each park, so 
that our assets will always remain attractive 
from both an investment and a financing 
perspective. The table below illustrates 
the current tenant mix across the entire 
portfolio including the new acquisitions:
In summary:
 » The Sirius business model remains very much focused on organic growth 
and we will continue to leverage our operating platform and the experience 
of our management team as we scale up our portfolio.
 » Strong market conditions mean that demand for our flexible and 
conventional workspace from the German SME market continues to be high.
 » The capex investment programme continues to be a strong driver of rental 
income growth.

Operations continued
Our SmartSpace product range across the entire portfolio currently represents 75,663 sqm or 6.8% of the total lettable space of the portfolio 
and we would expect our capex investment programme to increase that to around 8% or more in the next twelve months. With rental rates 
of more than €10 per sqm being achieved on the latest SmartSpace office and storage products in our key locations, we are encouraged 
that this product range will continue to grow, especially given the locations of our recent acquisitions. The capex investment programme 
is also directed at converting our cheaper, lower-quality Flexilager product into both the higher-quality SmartSpace storage product or, 
in some instances, back to higher-quality conventional space. The demand and level of rental rates being achieved on these products 
continues to improve and the price point that we are achieving for newly created SmartSpace is now up to three times that achieved 
by the pre-conversion usage. This is being achieved despite our products often being priced at half that of our main competitors.

Capex investment programme
The capex investment programme continues to be a strong driver of rental income growth, aimed at transforming approximately 100,000 sqm 
of previously unlettable or under-rented space over a three year period through both a major projects and a light investment programme. 
As of 31 March 2015, 15 months after the commencement of the initiative, €3.1 million of the total €8.9 million budget has been invested, 
transforming 37,860 sqm of space, which is already generating €1.96 million of rental income on an occupancy of 74%. Sirius has also 
successfully transformed this space under budget with the investment on this space coming in lower than expected. The progress of the 
major projects element of this initiative can be seen in the table below:

Once the full capex investment programme is completed, the Group expects that space with an estimated rental value of €5.5 million 
will have been created and, with an occupancy rate of 80%, should contribute close to €4.0 million towards the Group’s total rental income. 
Considering the recurring profit level of the Group at the time this commenced, this initiative represents a material improvement in the 
Group’s profitability over the programme’s life. As the programme is focused on converting previously unusable or under-rented space, 
which has limited value attributed to it in the property valuations, this investment is also expected to have a positive impact on the value 
of the portfolio.
Disposals
Our objective is to fund our capex investment programme, as far as possible, with the disposal of non-income producing land as well 
as cash flow from operations. In the twelve month period, the Group disposed of 34,800 sqm of non-income producing land across sites 
in Bremen, Bonn and Berlin, generating proceeds of €4.55 million. Going forward we have identified four non-core (two of which are 
unencumbered) low-income producing business parks and a further 105,000 sqm of surplus land as potentially available for disposal. 
As these assets generate little profit, have low or no occupancy, and are conservatively valued on our balance sheet, recycling the capital 
from these disposals would both streamline the portfolio whilst providing funds that can be invested with much higher rates of return.

Acquisitions
During the period, Sirius completed the 
acquisition of four multi-let business parks 
for a total consideration of €70.9 million. 
Located in and around Berlin, our Mahlsdorf 
and Potsdam assets, with a total lettable 
area of 65,444 sqm, were the first two sites 
acquired in December 2014, adding further 
presence in a core market for Sirius where 
demand for both conventional and flexible 
workspace solutions is high. Acquired for 
a total consideration of €49.1 million, these 
sites will initially contribute €4.1 million 
to the business in annualised rental income 
on an occupancy of 85% and €3.8 million 
in net operating income.
In February 2015, the Group acquired two 
further sites in Aachen and Bonn with a 
total lettable area of 35,153 sqm for a total 
consideration of €21.8 million. These sites 
provide an initial annualised rental income 
of €2.3 million on an occupancy of 76% 
and €2.0 million of net operating income.
The four acquisitions were funded by 
the net proceeds from the Company’s 
€40 million private placement in December 
along with a drawdown from the new 
€36 million five year debt facility with 
BerlinHyp. This facility is secured over three 
of the four assets and bears interest at 
a fixed rate of 2.85% per annum. These 
assets were acquired on an EPRA net initial 
yield of 8.1%, with opportunities to drive 
further returns from the vacant space. 
With demand for available space seen so 
far being encouraging, these acquisitions 
provided immediate improvement in 
profitability, a sustainable and growing 
income stream and ample opportunity 
to generate high long-term total returns.
New lettings and move-outs
In the twelve month period, there were new 
lettings of 119,992 sqm at an average rate of 
€5.02 per sqm and move-outs of 93,087 sqm 
at an average rate of €4.18 per sqm. For the 
year ended 31 March 2014 we reported 
new lettings of 113,784 sqm at an average 
rate of €5.16 per sqm and move-outs of 
112,956 sqm at an average rate of 
€4.42 per sqm. This further occupational 
improvement has contributed to the 
pre-acquisitions portfolio occupancy 
increasing to 78% (2014: 76%) and rate 
per sqm increasing to €4.58 (2014: €4.46). 
We are continuing to see new lettings at 
a higher rate per sqm than the portfolio 
average and the rate of existing tenants. 
This can be partly attributed to having more 
SmartSpace available through the capex 
investment programme but it is also indicative 
of the strength of the market we operate 
in. Given the breadth of our tenant base we 
will always have move-outs in the portfolio 
but we are confident that the strength of 
our sales and marketing platform will once 
again result in move-ins exceeding move-outs 
in the next financial year.
Operational efficiencies
Our level of service charge recovery 
continues to be above industry standards 
and we have made further progress this 
financial year. Most aspects of the service 
charge recovery area are controlled by our 
employees and the systems that we have 
developed, which is why we are able to 
contract and allocate service charge costs in 
a more detailed and sophisticated way than 
our competitors. This, combined with using 
our consolidated purchasing power, means 
we are able to provide a cost efficient and 
transparent service to our tenants which 
they are beginning to really appreciate. 
What this has meant to Sirius is an 
unprecedented level of cost recovery, which 
has been one of the main profit drivers 
for the Group over the last few years.
Portfolio analysis
The table below shows the key details of 
the core portfolio of 29 assets and the four 
assets that are for sale. The core portfolio 
is currently valued on a gross yield of 8.9% 
and a capital value of €547.1 per sqm.
Outlook and the years ahead
We would like to thank the management 
team and all the staff for their tremendous 
work this year. We have secured four 
excellent new sites to add to our portfolio 
and we are confident that the management 
team has the experience to fully capitalise 
on the opportunities available. We will 
continue to explore further opportunities 
to increase the value of the existing estate, 
recycle non-core and mature assets and 
improve the Group’s financing terms and 
expand our sources of lending. The capex 
investment programme continues to generate 
strong returns on investment, largely due 
to the effectiveness of our asset management 
activities, and we are hopeful to see further 
increases in our rent roll, occupancy and 
capital value of the portfolio over the years 
to come.

Dear shareholder,
This has been another excellent year 
for the business. 
The successful capital raise which facilitated the acquisition 
of four business parks in excellent locations in Germany, 
was accompanied by a successful secondary listing on the 
Johannesburg Stock Exchange, further diversifying our 
shareholder base. In addition, the capex investment programme 
that we introduced in 2014 continues to show a high return 
on investment. This programme, the acquisitions and other 
asset management initiatives have contributed to a significant 
improvement in our annualised rental income, earnings 
and adjusted net asset value per share.

  Directors’ remuneration report
Remuneration Policy
This part of the Report sets out the 
Remuneration Policy for the Company. 
The policies for the Executive Directors 
and the Non-executive Directors are 
determined by the Committee (members 
detailed on page 13) and the Committee 
approves any adjustments to Director fees, 
salary and bonus and scheme awards. 
The Committee also sets the parameters 
for the remuneration packages of the 
Senior Management Team of the Company, 
which reports to the Executive Directors. 
Authority is delegated to the Chief Executive 
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to 
implement all other salary adjustments and 
scheme and bonus awards for staff within 
agreed parameters. The Committee decides 
on all awards under the Company’s LTIP 
and approves the operation of the 
Company’s Share Matching Plan (“SMP”).
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that 
the remuneration packages are sufficiently 
competitive to attract, retain and motivate 
individuals of the quality required to achieve 
the objectives of the Group and thereby 
enhance shareholder value. The Committee 
also aims to ensure that all employees receive 
rewards that fairly reflect their seniority, level 
of work and contribution to the Group.
Executive Director and senior 
management policy
The summary of the remuneration policy 
for the Company’s two Executive Directors 
and eight-member Senior Management 
Team is set out below:
Salary
Purpose and link to strategy
To provide an appropriate salary level to 
support retention and recruitment of staff 
and ensure that staff are appropriately 
rewarded in relation to their role 
and responsibilities.
Operation
Reviewed annually on 1 April.
Salary increases are defined in the 
executive’s service contracts and are linked 
to the average German CPI inflation rate 
in the period.

Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present 
the Directors’ remuneration report (the“Report”) 
for the year ended 31 March 2015.
The Committee agreed a remuneration package including the Long 
Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for the Executive Directors and the Senior 
Management Team at the time of the internalisation in January 2012 
and review the package and plan each year. The existing LTIP expired 
at the end of March 2015 and certain awards have been made 
pursuant to this.
The Committee does not propose that the Report should be subject 
to shareholder vote as this is not required given the Company’ s status as an 
AIM-listed company and it does not believe that this is appropriate at this 
stage given the Company’ s current size and structure. We would, however, 
greatly appreciate shareholder feedback on the Remuneration Policy.
The Report is divided into two sections:
 » the Policy report, which sets out the current Remuneration Policy; and
 » the Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out details of the 
operation of the Remuneration Committee and details of the Directors’ 
remuneration packages for the year ended 31 March 2015.
The Committee aims to ensure that remuneration is linked to the 
performance of the Company and believes that the LTIP , which is based 
on specific targets and growth in net asset value per share adjusted for 
dividends, ensures that management is aligned with shareholders. 
The Committee is satisfied that the incentives and remuneration 
paid during the financial year under review are appropriate. 
In respect of the current financial year, the Committee will be adopting 
a new LTIP to replace the existing LTIP that expired on 31 March 2015, 
initial details of which appear in this Report. It does not propose any other 
changes to the Remuneration Policy, which is laid out on the following 
pages. The Committee will ensure that the Company’ s Remuneration Policy 
and practices are kept under review to ensure that they remain appropriate 
for the Company at its stage of development and that they incentivise 
management to generate a balance of attractive total returns to 
shareholders while not encouraging any unnecessary risk taking 
by the Executive Team.
Yours sincerely
Wessel Hamman
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Sirius Real Estate Limited

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy
To provide a competitive and 
comprehensive range of benefits to assist 
in attracting and retaining the calibre of 
staff required for the delivery of corporate 
and strategic objectives.
Operation
The benefits package for the 
Executive Directors includes private medical 
insurance, death in service insurance and 
travel accommodation. These are reviewed 
every year to ensure that the level of rates 
and cover remains competitive.
Pension
Purpose and link to strategy
To provide an appropriate level of pension 
contribution for executives whilst 
minimising the administrative burden 
for the Company.
Operation
An annual contribution equal to 10% of 
basic salary for Executive Directors is made 
to a private or Group pension plan.
Annual bonus
Purpose and link to strategy
To reward the achievement of annual 
targets as set by the Committee.
Operation
Objectives are set at the start of the 
financial year.
The Executive Directors and the Senior 
Management Team are normally treated 
as one team in respect of target setting.
Where applicable bonuses are paid in cash 
after the financial year end audit has been 
completed and are subject to retention (for 
the financial year ending 31 March 2015 
the retention was 35% for Executive Directors 
and 15% for the members of the Senior 
Management Team) for twelve months. 
Performance hurdles are agreed for the 
subsequent year in order for the retention 
to be released.
Annual bonus caps linked to agreed 
multiples of salary are applied that limit the 
annual bonuses of the Executive Directors 
and the Senior Management Team. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
Purpose and link to strategy
To support alignment with shareholders 
through setting specific performance 
objectives, with awards enhanced by the 
Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) 
per share based on dividends and growth 
in (“NAV”) per share.
Operation
Awards for the LTIP for the three year 
period ending 31 March 2015 granted 
by the Committee in 2012 will be paid out 
with shares in the Company at zero cost 
to the participant following the publication 
of this Report, of which the value earned 
by the Executive Directors is detailed in 
the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The terms of a new scheme were in principle 
agreed by the Committee on 8 May 2015 
and are currently being finalised and 
documented. The scheme will again include 
the Executive Directors and the Senior 
Management Team and will be paid out 
with shares in the Company at zero cost 
to the participant at the end of a three year 
cycle, although the Company may pay out 
part of the awards in cash to the extent 
that is required by the participating individual 
in order to meet their tax liability arising 
from the vesting of the awards. The new 
scheme will award a number of shares 
based purely on the Company’s TSR at 
various levels between 5% and greater 
than 15%p.a. with the award then being 
adjusted for the following two parameters:
a)  the Sirius share price movement relative 
to NAV per share movement, with the 
share award increasing if total share 
price return exceeds total NAV return 
and vice versa, subject to a cap; and
b)  the Sirius share price movement relative 
to the share price movement of the 
Company’s peers, with the share award 
reduced if the Sirius share price has 
underperformed relative to a specific 
peer group by a certain percentage.
The shares awarded under this scheme, 
if any, will vest after the completion of 
the audit of the Company’s 31 March 2018 
Statutory Accounts and a minimum holding 
period post vesting will apply, as well as 
a clawback in the event of the Executive 
Directors committing certain significant 
breaches of their service contracts. The LTIP 
will contain provisions for vesting of part of 
the LTIP awards should a change of control 
occur during the LTIP period. 
Share Matching Plan
Purpose and link to strategy
To encourage share ownership in 
the Company.
Operation
The Executive Directors and the Senior 
Management Team are offered the 
opportunity to participate in the SMP 
whereby the Company will issue the 
participant a share at no cost for every 
share that the participant acquires in the 
Company during the year. This includes 
shares received through election to receive 
shares by way of scrip dividend, but 
excludes shares acquired pursuant 
to the LTIP .
The value of shares that can be issued 
is subject to a cap equal to 50% of the 
participant’s basic salary. Each participant 
is liable for any personal income tax that 
becomes payable as a result of any shares 
issued from this scheme and minimum 
holding periods apply.
Non-executive Director policy
The Company’ s Articles of Association provide 
that the Committee can determine the level of 
fees to be paid to the Non-executive Directors 
within limits set by the shareholders. The policy 
for the Chairman and the Non-executive 
Directors is as follows:
Fees
Purpose and link to strategy 
T o provide a competitive level of fees that will 
attract and retain high calibre Directors with 
the range of skills and experience required 
to support the Executive Directors and assist 
the Company in delivering its objectives.
Operation
The fees for the Chairman and the 
Non-executive Directors are determined 
by the Committee as a whole with Directors 
absenting themselves from discussions 
regarding their own remuneration.
The Board has regard to the level of fees 
paid to the non-executive directors of 
other similar sized companies and the 
time commitment and responsibilities 
of the role and reviews these annually.
Neither the Chairman nor the Non-executive 
Directors participate in any of the Company’s 
share schemes. Governance

which have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting

enactment for the time being in force 
and are in agreement with accounting 
records, which have been properly kept

the payment of a regular dividend paying 
an initial dividend of 0.30c per share in

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Treasury operations 
and financial instruments 
The Group’s policy in relation to financial 
risk management and use of financial 
instruments is set out in note 21 to 
the financial statements.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are required by the 
Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial period which give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group as 
at the end of the financial period and of its 
profit or loss for that period. Under the law 
they have elected to prepare the financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law. 
In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 » select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
 » make judgements and estimates which 
are reasonable and prudent;
 » state whether applicable accounting 
standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 » prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records that disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
(Guernsey) Law 2008 and are in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Corporate governance
The Board of Directors
The Directors are responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. The risk 
management process and systems of 
internal control are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve the Group’s objectives. Any such 
system of internal control can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Audit Committee
The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
is Wessel Hamman. The Audit Committee 
may examine any matters relating to the 
financial affairs of the Group and the Group’ s 
audits. This includes reviews of the interim 
and annual financial statements and 
announcements. The Audit Committee 
is also responsible for the appointment, 
independence, terms of reference and 
fees of external auditors.
The membership of the Audit Committee 
comprises three Directors, Wessel Hamman, 
Robert Sinclair and James Peggie. The external 
auditors have direct access to members of 
the Committee for independent discussions.
Remuneration Committee
The Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee is Wessel Hamman. The 
Committee comprises three Directors, 
Wessel Hamman, Robert Sinclair and 
James Peggie. It determines the terms and 
conditions of the employment and annual 
remuneration of the Non-executive Directors, 
the Executive Directors and the Senior 
Management Team of the business. To do 
this it consults with the Executive Directors, 
takes into consideration External Data and 
has access to external professional advice.
The key policy objectives of the Remuneration 
Committee in respect of the Company’s 
Executive Directors and Senior 
Management Team are:
 » to ensure that individuals are fairly 
rewarded for their personal contribution 
to the Group’s overall performance; and
 » to act as the independent committee 
ensuring that due regard is given to the 
interest of the Company’s shareholders 
and to the financial health of the Group.
Nomination Committee
The Chairman of the Nomination Committee 
is James Peggie. The Committee comprises 
four Directors, James Peggie, Wessel Hamman, 
Robert Sinclair and Andrew Coombs. It is 
responsible for evaluating the workings 
and performance of the existing Board 
and nominating new Directors to become 
part of the Board as appropriate.
Auditors and disclosure of information 
to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date 
of approval of the financial statements 
confirm that, so far as they are each aware:
 » there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Group’s auditors are 
unaware; and
 » each Director has taken all the steps 
that he ought to have taken as a Director 
to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that 
the Group’s auditors are aware of 
that information.
KPMG Channel Islands Limited have 
indicated their willingness to continue 
in office as auditors and a resolution 
proposing their reappointment will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

>  Independent auditors’ report to the members of Sirius Real Estate Limited
We have audited the consolidated financial statements (the “financial statements”) of Sirius Real Estate Limited (the “Company”, 
and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) for the year ended 31 March 2015 which comprise the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, 
the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 262 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 
2008. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’ s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on pages 18 through 19, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (“APB’s”) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
 » give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2015 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
 » are in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU; and 
 » comply with the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 » the Company has not kept proper accounting records; or 
 » the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records; or 
 » we have not received all the information and explanations, which to the best of our knowledge and belief are necessary 
for the purpose of our audit.

Financial statements
1. General information
Sirius Real Estate Limited (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in Guernsey whose shares are publicly traded 
on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (primary listing) and the Alternative Exchange (“AltX”) of the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange (secondary listing).
The consolidated financial statements of Sirius Real Estate Limited comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred 
to as the “Group”). The Group financial statements have been prepared for the year ended 31 March 2015.
The principal activity of the Group is the investment in and development of commercial property to provide conventional 
and flexible workspace in Germany, primarily focused on the SME sector.
2. Significant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for investment properties, investment 
properties held for sale and derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (€000) except where otherwise indicated.
(b) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”) 
and the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008. The consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view and are in compliance 
with the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008.
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 21 May 2015.
(c) Going concern
Having reviewed the Group’s current trading and forecasts, together with sensitivities and mitigating factors and the available 
facilities, the Board has reasonable expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
(d) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Sirius Real Estate Limited and its subsidiaries as at 
31 March 2015. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company, 
using consistent accounting policies.
All intragroup balances and transactions and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue 
to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented separately 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, 
separately from parent shareholders’ equity.
(e) Single statement of comprehensive income 
The Group has chosen to present a single statement of comprehensive income (combining the income statement and a statement 
of comprehensive income). 
(f) Acquisitions
Property acquisitions that are not accounted for as business combinations under IFRS 3 are dealt with as acquisitions of property assets.
(g) Foreign currency translation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional and presentational currency of all members 
of the Group.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange 
ruling at the statement of financial position date. All differences are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(h) Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue 
can be reliably measured. In particular:
Rental income
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the benefit derived from the leased asset is diminished.
Fixed or determinable rental increases, which can take the form of actual amounts or agreed percentages, are recognised on 
a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. If the increases are related to a price index to cover inflationary cost increases 
then the policy is not to spread the amount but to recognise them when the increase takes place.
The value of rent free periods and all similar lease incentives are spread on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised as it accrues (using the effective interest method that is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument).
Service charges
The service charge income receivable is not treated as revenue; rather, it is set off against the costs to which such income relates.
(i) Leases
Group as lessor
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified 
as operating leases. 
(j) Income tax
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the reporting date at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
The Company has obtained exempt company status in Guernsey under the terms of the Income Tax (Exempt Bodies) Ordinance, 
1989. The Directors intend to conduct the Company’s affairs so that they remain eligible for exemption. 
Certain subsidiaries may be subject to foreign taxes in respect of foreign sources of income.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, with the following exceptions:
 » where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
 » in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future; and 
 » deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is foreseeable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
to the year when the related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
(k) Sales tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:
 » where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case 
the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and 
 » receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the statement of financial position. Sirius Real Estate Limited

(l) Investment properties
Investment properties are properties owned by the Group which are held either for long-term rental income or for capital 
appreciation or both.
Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs. The carrying amount includes the cost 
of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met and 
excludes the costs of day-to-day servicing of an investment property. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties 
are stated at fair value, which reflects market conditions at the reporting date. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in the statement of comprehensive 
income in the period in which they arise.
The fair value of the Group’s investment properties at 31 March 2015 has been arrived at on the basis of a valuation carried out 
at that date by Cushman & Wakefield LLP (2014: Cushman & Wakefield LLP), an independent valuer.
The valuations are in accordance with standards complying with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ (“RIC’s”) approval 
and the conceptual framework that has been settled by the International Valuation Standards Committee (“IVSC”).
(m) Disposals of investment property
Investment property disposals are recognised in the financial statements on the date of completion. Profit or losses arising 
on disposal of investment properties are calculated by reference to the carrying value of the asset at the beginning of the year 
adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure.
(n) Investment property under construction
Property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investment property is accounted for as an investment property 
under construction until construction or development is complete, when it is then reclassified as investment property.
Investment property under construction will be carried at fair value at the earlier of when the fair value first becomes reliably 
measurable and the date of completion of the property. Any gain or loss will be recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income, consistent with the policy adopted for all other investment properties carried at fair value. 
(o) Plant and equipment
Recognition and measurement
Items of plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation
Where parts of an item of plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of plant 
and equipment.
Depreciation is charged in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of each part of an item of the fixed assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Plant and equipment four to ten years
Fixtures and fittings four years
Computer software five years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.
(p) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of the purchase consideration over the Group’s interest 
in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill 
is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may 
be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated.
(q) Investment properties held for sale
Non-current assets that are expected to be recovered primarily through disposal rather than through continuing use are classified 
as held for sale. For this to be the case, the asset must be available for immediate disposal in its present condition subject only 
to terms that are usual and customary for disposals of such assets and its disposal must be highly probable.
Immediately before classification as held for sale the assets are measured in line with the Group’s accounting policies. 
Thereafter the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Sirius Real Estate Limited

(r) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less an allowance for impairment (see note 2(z) (i)).
(s) Treasury shares
Own equity instruments which are reacquired (“Treasury Shares”) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s equity instruments.
(t) Share-based payments
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number 
of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
(u) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments 
with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of change in value.
(v) Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the liabilities are derecognised, 
as well as through the amortisation process.
(w) Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
rate method.
(x) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(y) Dividends
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the consolidated financial statements 
in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
(z) Impairment excluding investment properties
(i) Financial assets
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial 
asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated 
future cash flows of that asset. Objective evidence of impairment includes observable data that comes to the attention of the 
Group about one or more of the following loss events:
 » significant financial difficulty of the debtor;
 » a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; and
 » it becomes probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed 
collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Any cumulative loss in respect of an available-for-sale 
financial asset recognised previously in equity is transferred to the statement of comprehensive income.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. 
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.  Sirius Real Estate Limited

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(z) Impairment excluding investment properties continued
(ii) Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than investment property and deferred tax assets, are reviewed 
at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are 
largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”).
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Impairment losses recognised in respect 
of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then 
to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
(aa) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps to hedge its risks associated with interest 
rate fluctuations. The interest rate swaps and caps are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value on the reporting date. Derivatives are carried as assets when the 
fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting to its interest rate swaps and caps. Any change in the fair value of such derivatives 
is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income as a finance expense or as finance income as appropriate.
(ab) Compound financial instruments
Compound financial instruments issued by the Group comprise convertible notes denominated in euros that can be converted 
to share capital at the option of the holder, when the number of shares to be issued is fixed.
The liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does 
not have an equity conversion option. The equity component is recognised initially at the difference between the fair value of 
the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability component. Any directly attributable transaction 
costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial instrument is measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. The equity component of a compound financial instrument is not remeasured subsequent 
to initial recognition.
Interest related to the financial liability is recognised in profit or loss. On conversion, the financial liability is reclassified to equity 
and no gain or loss is recognised.
(ac) Standards effective in the year
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except that the following new standards 
have been adopted in the current year:
 » IAS 1 (amended) ‘Financial Statement Presentation’ changes the grouping of items presented in the Group’s Statement 
of Comprehensive Income so that items which may be reclassified to the income statement in the future are presented 
separately from items that will never be reclassified. The amendment affects presentation only and has no impact on the Group’s 
financial position or performance.
 » Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’ – clarifies the offsetting criteria, specifically when 
an entity currently has a legal right of set-off and when gross settlement is equivalent to net settlement. An entity “currently 
has a legally enforceable right of set off” if the right is not contingent on a future event and is not enforceable in both the 
normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the entity and all of the counterparties. 
Gross settlement is equivalent to net settlement if and only if the gross settlement mechanism has features that eliminate 
and result in insignificant credit and liquidity risk and process receivables and payables in a single settlement process or cycle. 
The adoption of this has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in the Group financial statements.
 » Annual Improvements 2009 – 2011, which includes changes to IAS 1 ‘Financial Statement Presentation’, IAS 32 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Presentation, IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ and IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’. The adoption 
of these has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in the Group financial statements.

(ad) Standards and interpretations in issue and not yet effective
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ – In November 2009 and October 2010, the IASB issued IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which represents 
part of a project to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the 
classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: 
those measured as at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification 
depends on the entity’ s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. 
For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option 
is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’ s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income 
rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The IASB currently has an active project to make limited 
amendments to the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9 and to add new requirements to address the impairment of 
financial assets and hedge accounting. A final standard in relation to hedge accounting is now in issue. IFRS 9 will not be effective before 
1 January 2018, with the final effective date being determined by the IASB when other parts of the IFRS are finalised, but may be applied 
earlier subject to EU endorsement. The Group has yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact and will also consider the impact of the remaining 
phases of IFRS 9 when completed by the IASB.
3. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors have made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Operating lease commitments – Group as lessor
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio. The Group has determined that it 
retains all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and therefore accounts for them as operating leases.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are discussed below.
Valuation of investment properties
The fair value of the Group’ s investment properties of €550.0 million (2014: €448.7 million) was determined by Cushman & Wakefield LLP 
(2014: Cushman & Wakefield LLP), an independent valuer. After adjusting investment properties reclassified as held for sale and for 
lease incentive accounting and Directors’ write-downs on non-core assets, the value of investment properties is shown as €545.6 million 
(2014: €443.7 million). The valuation is based upon assumptions including future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs and 
the appropriate discount rate. The properties are valued on the basis of a ten year discounted cash flow model supported by comparable 
evidence. The discounted cash flow calculation is a valuation of rental income considering non-recoverable costs and applying a discount 
rate for the current income risk over a ten year period. After ten years a determining residual value (exit scenario) is calculated. A cap 
rate is applied to the more uncertain future income, discounted to a present value.
As a result of the level of judgement used in arriving at the market valuations, the amounts which may ultimately be realised 
in respect of any given property may differ from the valuations shown on the statement of financial position.
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group’s interest rate swaps and caps are shown in these financial statements (note 22) at fair value based on valuations prepared 
by relevant banks. Such valuations are based on market prices, estimated future cash flows and forward rate as appropriate.
Deferred tax
Deferred taxation is measured at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Such rates are subject to governmental changes that 
are outside the control of the entity.
Additionally, management has to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets and certain assets are not recognised due to uncertainties 
over the timing and nature of future events that will lead to their realisation. Accordingly these unrecognised assets may have an 
impact on future corporate tax changes in certain circumstances. Sirius Real Estate Limited

3. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions continued
Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test on an annual basis whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The assessment and quantification 
of any such impairment charges is determined by key management judgements in terms of:
 » detailed short-term budgeting on which the recoverable amounts calculated are based;
 » determining the medium and long-term growth rates that are used in extrapolating these budgets over the goodwill’s indefinite 
useful economic life; and
 » the discount rate applied to these extrapolated forecasts to calculate the present value of the cash flows. 
4. Operating segments
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s operating segments. The operating segments are based on the Group’s 
management and internal reporting structure. Segment results and assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well 
as those that can be allocated to a segment on a reasonable basis.
Management considers that there is only one geographical segment, which is Germany, and one reporting segment, 
which is investment in commercial property.

8. Equity-settled share-based payments
The Group has a LTIP scheme for the benefit of the Executive Directors and the Senior Management Team as described in the 
Remuneration Report. As a result, 666,668 shares were granted under the scheme in August 2014 and an expense of €261,000 
was recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income to 31 March 2015. In addition, an expense of €3,276,000 
was recorded in anticipation of the granting of 6,200,000 shares under the scheme to the participants, contingent upon achieving 
the performance conditions and the completion of the audit of the Company’s 31 March 2015 Statutory Accounts.
During the year, a further 870,279 shares were issued to the Company’s management through its Share Matching Scheme and 
shares taken in lieu of bonus. For the issued shares that were not expensed in prior years, an expense of €109,000 was recognised

in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the revaluation losses on investment properties 
and interest rate swaps as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group as realisation is not assured.
On 1 May 2014, the Company relocated its tax residence from Guernsey to the United Kingdom. Although the Company continues 
to be a limited company registered in Guernsey, the migration in tax residence to the UK enables the Company to take advantage 
of recent reforms of the UK tax regime and allows future Board appointments to be made irrespective of their residence. Migration 
also allows the Company to hold Board and shareholder meetings in the UK.

Reclassified as investment properties held for sale — (2,633)
Balance as at year end 545,626 441,087
*  This relates to three (2014: two) non-core assets that management hopes to sell in the year but which currently do not meet the criteria for assets held 
for sale. These are non-core assets with high vacancy and the write-down adjusts the value to the expected sales price required to achieve a quick sale.
The fair value of the Group’s investment properties at 31 March 2015 has been arrived at on the basis of a valuation carried 
out by Cushman & Wakefield LLP (2014: Cushman & Wakefield LLP), an independent valuer.
The value of each of the properties has been assessed in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards on the basis of market 
value. Market value was primarily derived using a ten year discounted cash flow model supported by comparable evidence. 
The discounted cash flow calculation is a valuation of rental income considering non-recoverable costs and applying a discount 
rate for the current income risk over a ten year period. After ten years a determining residual value (exit scenario) is calculated. 
A cap rate is applied to the more uncertain future income, discounted to a present value.
The weighted average lease duration across all the properties held by the Group at 31 March 2015 was 2.4 years.

All investment properties are categorised as Level 3 fair values as they use significant unobservable inputs. There have not been any 
transfers between levels during the year. Investment properties have been classed according to their real estate sector. Information

As a result of the level of judgement used in arriving at the market valuations, the amounts which may ultimately be realised 
in respect of any given property may differ from the valuations shown in the statement of financial position.
For example, an increase in market rental values of 5% would lead to an increase in the fair value of the investment properties 
of €28,830,000 and a decrease in market rental values of 5% would lead to a decrease in the fair value of the investment properties 
of €28,750,000. Similarly, an increase in the discount rates of 0.25% would lead to a decrease in the fair value of the investment 
properties of €10,770,000 and a decrease in the discount rates of 0.25% would lead to an increase in the fair value of the 
investment properties of €10,990,000. 
The highest and best use of properties do not differ from their current use.

On 30 January 2012 a transaction was completed to internalise the Asset Management Agreement and as a result of the consideration 
given exceeding the net assets acquired, goodwill of €3,738,000 was recognised. Current business plans indicate that the 
balance is unimpaired.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and whenever there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable 
amount of a cash-generating unit is based on its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the projected cash flows of the 
cash-generating unit. The key assumptions regarding the value in use calculations were budgeted growth in profit margins and the 
discount rate applied. Budgeted profit margins were estimated based on actual performance over the past two financial years and 
expected market changes. The discount rate used is a pre-tax rate and reflects the risks specific to the real estate industry. The Group 
prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent financial budget approved by management, which covers a one year period. Cash 
flows beyond this period are extrapolated to a period of five years using a growth rate of 2%, which is consistent with the long-term 
average growth rate for the real estate sector. The discount rate applied was 4.4%.

21. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise bank loans, derivative financial instruments and trade payables. The main purpose 
of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various financial assets such as trade 
receivables and cash, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk and interest rate risk. 
Credit risk
Credit risk arises when a failure by counterparties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash inflows 
from financial assets on hand at the reporting date. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks 
with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The risk management policies employed by the Group to 
manage these risks are discussed below. In the event of a default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall 
and incur additional costs, including expenses incurred to try and recover the defaulted amounts and legal expenses in maintaining, 
insuring and marketing the property until it is re-let. During the year, the Group monitored the tenants in order to anticipate and 
minimise the impact of defaults by occupational tenants, as well as to ensure that the Group has a diversified tenant base. 
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting 
date was:

€000
Balance at 31 March (3,760) (4,032)
Impairment loss released 17 272
Balance at 31 March (3,743) (3,760)
The allowance account for trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group believes that no recovery of the 
amount owing is possible; at that point the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against the trade receivables directly.
Most trade receivables are generally due one month in advance. The exception is service charge balancing billing, which is due 
ten days after it has been invoiced. Included in the Group’s trade receivables are debtors with carrying amounts of €3,591,000 
(2014: €4,545,000) that are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been 
a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that arises when the maturity of assets and liabilities does not match. An unmatched position potentially 
enhances profitability but can also increase the risk of losses. The Group has procedures with the objective of minimising such losses, 
such as maintaining sufficient cash and other highly liquid current assets and having available an adequate amount of committed 
credit facilities. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts and continually monitors its ongoing commitments compared to available cash. 
Cash and cash equivalents are placed with financial institutions on a short-term basis which allows immediate access. This reflects the 
Group’s desire to maintain a high level of liquidity in order to meet any unexpected liabilities that may arise due to the current financial 
position. Similarly, accounts receivable are due either in advance (e.g., rents, recharges) or within ten days (e.g., service charge 
reconciliations), further bolstering the Group’s liquidity level.

Currency risk
There is no significant foreign currency risk as most of the assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in euros. Small amounts 
of UK sterling are held to ensure payments made in UK sterling can be achieved at an effective rate.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group’s long-term floating rate debt obligations. The Group’s 
policy is to mitigate interest rate risk by ensuring that a minimum of 80% of its total borrowing is at fixed or capped interest rates 
by taking out fixed rate loans or derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure, or interest rate caps.
A change in interest will only have an impact on the floating loans capped due to the fact that the other loans have a general fixed 
interest or they are effectively fixed by a swap. An increase in 100 basis points in interest rate would result in a decreased post tax profit 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of €0.3 million (excluding the movement on derivative financial instruments) 
and a decrease in 100 basis points in interest yield would result in an increased post tax profit in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income of €0.3 million (excluding the movement on derivative financial instruments).
Market risk
The Group’s activities are within the real estate market, exposing it to very specific industry risks.
The yields available from investments in real estate depend primarily on the amount of revenue earned and capital appreciation 
generated by the relevant properties as well as expenses incurred. If properties do not generate sufficient revenues to meet 
operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditure, the Group’s revenue will be adversely affected.
Revenues from properties may be adversely affected by the general economic climate, local conditions such as oversupply of properties 
or a reduction of demand for properties in the market in which the Group operates, the attractiveness of the properties to the tenants, 
the quality of the management, competition from other available properties and increased operating costs.
In addition, the Group’s revenue would be adversely affected if a significant number of tenants were unable to pay rent or its 
properties could not be rented on favourable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with each equity investment in real 
estate (such as external financing costs, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) are generally not reduced when circumstances cause 
a reduction in revenue from properties. By diversifying in product, risk categories and tenants, the Group expects to lower the risk 
profile of the portfolio.
Capital management
The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by 
managing the capital structure.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, issue shares or undertake transactions 
such as those that occurred with the internalisation of the Asset Management Agreement.
The Company holds 4,981,784 of its own shares which continue to be held as Treasury Shares. During the year 1,536,947 shares were 
issued from treasury and no shares were bought back. 
The Group monitors capital using a gross debt to property assets ratio, which was 46.8% as at 31 March 2015 (2014: 50.9%).
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements other than those related to the covenants of the bank 
loan facilities.

used to determine fair value:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

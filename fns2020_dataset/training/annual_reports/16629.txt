78155 PRE ACC  14/5/08  18:47  Page 1 I am pleased to present Vero
Software’s financial results for the 
year ended 31 December 2007. 
The Company has produced strong
growth in both revenues and profits
while significantly improving its
software development and subsidiary
distribution capabilities. 
Results
Group turnover increased by 15% 
to £12.7m (2006: £11.0m), a result 
of organic growth and the effect of
acquisitions made in both the current
and previous year. The growth was
achieved despite significant weakness
in the US Dollar and the Japanese Yen
exchange rates against Sterling which
constrained our reported earnings. 
In constant currency terms sales
growth would have been over 18%.
EBITDA (earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation)
increased by 40% to £1.9m (2006:
£1.3m), operating profit rose 30% 
to £1.3m (2006: £1.0m) and profit
before tax rose 15% to £1.1m 
(2006: £0.9m). Earnings per share
increased by 19% to 1.79p 
(2006: 1.51p).
The acquisition of the distributor
Camtek North America in June 
further cemented the relationship with
the Camtek organisation and gave
additional sales and technical 
support weight to our growing North
American operations. The acquisition
immediately made a positive
contribution to both the sales and
profitability of Vero Software.
In addition to the positive results 
from North America, Europe was
instrumental in providing growth with
Germany, France and Italy all providing
good revenue increases over 2006.
European mould and die sector
manufacturers continue to drive
efficiency in order to compete with
their Asian counterparts. This has 
led to a realisation of the need 
for investment in specific new
technologies and in which Vero
Software is a recognised leader.
2007 was also a significant year 
for the growth in managerial and
technically expert staff fuelling and
supporting our expansion in China,
Japan, France and North America. 
In addition the new marketing
department started their ambitious 
role by re-branding the Company
identity to a more inclusive and modern
style that has become associated 
with Vero Software. These changes,
implemented across all products,
subsidiaries and dealerships have
been widely applauded by end users,
dealers and investors alike.

Chairman’s statement
78155 PRE ACC  14/5/08  18:47  Page 2 Dividend Policy 
As cash generation within the
Company rises the Board has 
recently decided to initiate a capital 
re-structuring that will allow the
payment of future dividends. Going
forward we intend to maintain a
progressive dividend policy reflecting
the balance between the investment
needs of the business and the growth
in underlying cash and earnings 
per share. 
Summary and Outlook
2007 represented the start of a
number of product introductions
arising from four acquisitions made
within the last 20 months. Trading for
the first quarter of 2008 will exceed
that of 2007 and the first half of 2008
will also see some very exciting
product announcements backed by
phase two of our specific marketing
initiatives. These developments
together with our continuing interest 
in expanding the distribution channels
through acquisition means Vero
Software will have another exciting
and busy year in the execution of its
growth strategy.

VISI is one of the industries leading design
and manufacturing solutions for the mould
and die industries, providing the toolmaker
with unsurpassed levels of productivity.
PEPS is a supplier of specialist CAM
technologies. Its powerful machining
techniques enable the user to minimise
programming time, streamline production
and save money.
78155 PRE ACC  14/5/08  18:47  Page 3 The Directors set out in this section
their analysis of business. We do so
voluntarily and do not seek to comply
in full with the Accounting Standard
Board’s Statement “Operating and
Financial Review” issued in 
January 2003.
Business Review
Vero Software made further and
substantial progress in 2007 following
the introduction of new products, the
consolidation of earlier acquisitions
and an increased marketing emphasis.
All these effects combined to provide
a record increase in revenue and a
15% rise in pre tax profits.
There was a 20% increase in revenue
from the competitive German market
where Vero Software products have
attained an impressive reputation for
technical excellence and where the
productivity of the software solutions 
is much sought after. Revenues from
operations in both Japan and North
America increased by over 10% in
local terms although these positive
revenue effects were partly offset in
pound terms by the weaker Yen and
US Dollar throughout 2007. Italy and
France also showed revenue gains as
mould and die manufacturers sought
to regain cost of production benefits
through new automation advances.
Customer care and technical support
services are showing good returns as
the number of renewed maintenance
agreements continues to rise along
with the basic software license
revenues. Consulting and training
revenues grew by a third as we
expanded the subsidiary Company
capabilities in providing quality technical
expertise for customer projects. 
The greater development capacity
provided by the 2006 Camtek
acquisition has led to a further
increase in our gross margin. 
Acquisitions
The acquisitions of Plastics &
Computer in Italy and Camtek Ltd. 
in the UK both completed in 2006
provided significant product and
integration opportunities that were
capitalised on during 2007. The
plastics flow analysis product is now
integrated within the VISI mould and
die offering and the Camtek PEPS
products have been introduced to all
of the major Vero Software markets.
Both companies are now successfully
integrated in the Vero Software
structure and the combination of 
the two UK offices into one will be
completed by the summer.

In June 2007 we also acquired the
North American distributor for the
CAMTEK PEPS product to provide
further qualified sales and support
personnel as well as open cross selling
opportunities in some of the newer
mould and die areas in the south of
the USA. 
New Operations 
In January this year the Company
established its new Vero Insight division
to address the data mining needs of
the technical and manufacturing
arenas. These software application
and consulting services bring together
many of the Company’s traditional data
design, mathematical, and 3D graphics
skills required to uncover technical
solutions among large data files. 
The division will be working with and
wherever empirical data results hold
the key to improving performance or
prolonging the lives of components in
such diverse fields as motor racing or
mining. The division’s impact on 2008
results will be small in comparison to
the existing business but is set to
provide a fast growing element for 
the future. 
Operating Expenses 
Selling expenses grew at 5% as a
result of further investment in the Asian
and North American subsidiaries. The
increase in administrative expenses of
21% to £2.4m reflected a full year of
costs relating to the previous year’s
acquisitions. 
Product Development and Other
Operating Income
The 2006 acquisitions provided 
an increase in qualified software
development personnel to accelerate
some product introductions and
accentuate the focus on providing
specific product sets for the niche
application areas within the mould 
and die sector. 
Product development expenditure 
of £1,026,000 has been capitalised
this year (2006: £603,000) as required
by International Financial Reporting
Standards. This reflects investment in
development which will be included 
in future releases of our products. 
New releases of Vero Software
products in all ranges will be
introduced from next month. 
Machining STRATEGIST is a powerful
3D CAM product that generates optimum
CNC toolpaths from the complex shapes
generated by all major 3D modelling systems.
SMIRT is the industry leading viewing
software designed explicitly for the
Die Build stamping industry to
enhance productivity in a Shop
Floor environment.
78155 PRE ACC  14/5/08  18:47  Page 5 Taxation and Earnings per Share
The Company made earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA) of £1.88m,
an increase of 40% on the previous
year (2006: £1.34m). It also recorded
a pre-tax profit of £1,088,000 
(2006: £942,000). The Company
incurred a tax charge of £420,000
(2006: £380,000) and recorded a 
post tax profit of £668,000 
(2006: £562,000). Basic earnings 
per share were 1.79p (2006: 1.51p) 
an increase of 19%.
Cash Flow and Net Funds
Cash generated from operations 
was £1.7m compared to an inflow 
of £1.4m in 2006. Cash balances 
at the year end were £0.81m 
(2006: £0.97m), with £0.83m of 
short-term borrowings (2006: £0.63m),
resulting in a net short term borrowing
figure of £0.02m (2006: net funds
£0.34m). Net debt increased to £2.7m
from £2.3m. £2.6m of this relates to
term loans from UK and Italian Banks
repayable over 5 years. The Company
has total short term borrowing facilities
of £1.4m in Italy and the UK to cover
its working capital requirements.
Interest payments during the year
were £211,000 (2006: £81,000) and
were covered 6 times (2006: 13 times)
by profits.

Directors and advisers
78155 PRE ACC  14/5/08  18:47  Page 8 The directors present their annual report and audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Change of name
On 31 August 2007 the Company changed its name from VI Group Plc to Vero Software Plc.
Principal activities
The principal activities of the Group during the year were the development, marketing and distribution of computer aided
design and computer aided manufacturing (“CAD/CAM”) software.
Business review
In accordance with section S234ZZB of the Companies Act 1985, a review of the development and performance of the
business of the Group including the financial performance during the year is set out in the Chairman’s Statement and 
Chief Executive’s Review section of this Annual Report on pages  to 6 which is incorporated into this report 
by reference. The Directors consider that the following measures are key performance indicators:
Financial 2007 2006
Revenue growth 15% 8%
Adjusted EBITDA growth 15% 19%
Adjusted EBITDA is a non GAAP measure which excludes capitalised development. 
Non financial 2007 2006
Number of licences on maintenance contract 6,830 6,621
The number of licences on maintenance is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and recurring revenues.
2007 2006
Staff turnover 7% 7%
Recruitment and retention of staff is one of the key risks facing the business, therefore staff turnover ratios are an important
indicator of how we are managing that risk. 
Risk factors
Vero’s business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition, results of our operations or share price. The factors discussed in this section are not an exhaustive list
but are considered some of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the business. Our aim is to manage and control
identified risk through established processes but it cannot be eliminated completely.

Directors’ report
2
78155 PRE ACC  14/5/08  18:47  Page 9 Risk Area
International trade risks
The Group generates a significant portion of its revenue
outside the United Kingdom and is therefore subject 
to additional risks associated with the extent of its
international operations.
Vero receives a substantial proportion of its revenues in
Euros, US dollars and Japanese Yen therefore adverse
fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly affect its
revenue and reported profits.
Intellectual property
The Group’s software products are the result of a
considerable investment in research and development.
Inability to protect them could reduce the value of the
Group’s products and services.
The Group has developed and utilises software in
collaboration with various software developers. In particular
the termination of the Group’s licensing agreements for
technologies from third parties could result in significant
costs, delays in product development and affect the
Group’s profitability. 
Competition 
The Group faces competition from numerous companies
for all of its products. Product innovations or technical
advances by competitors could adversely affect 
the Group.
Recruitment and retention
There is limited availability of employees and distributors
around the world, who have the necessary technical skills
to develop, sell and support our products. The ability to
attract, retain and motivate people with the appropriate
skills is an important factor in the Group’s ability to expand.
Acquisition integration
Vero Group is an active acquirer: acquisitions may involve
risks that might have a material impact on the Group. 
Any failure in the Group’s due diligence of the operating
and financial condition of these acquired businesses, or 
of their integration into the Group’s operations, could have
an adverse impact on the Group’s businesses or the
Group as a whole.
Management Action/Mitigation
The geographic spread of our markets helps to minimise
risk as conditions in one market are not always reflected
elsewhere in the world. 
Exchange rate, credit and interest rate risks are discussed
in note 27 to the accounts on page 36 to 38.
The Group protects its software using a combination of
encrypted hardware and software devices. 
The Group protects its proprietary rights to its software
with license agreements and with the registration of
trademarks. Patent applications for our VISI-flow product
have been filed in the US. 
The Group has entered into agreements that provide for
the Group’s right to market and distribute the products
containing third party component technologies. 
The Group has a policy of continuous research and
development and commits a significant amount of
expenditure to this. The products of competitors are 
also monitored.
Vero aims to foster productive and mutually beneficial
working relationships with distributors and provide a
positive working environment and competitive pay levels 
in order to recruit and retain the employees that it needs.
These risks are mitigated by due diligence, forecasting 
and planning and, where practicable, by representations
and warranties and indemnities from the vendors.

The following analyses illustrate the effect that specific changes could have had on our results in the 2007 financial year.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation. Actual results in the future
may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in
interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should
not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.

Creditor payment policy and practice
The Group’s policy is to fix payment terms when agreeing the terms of each transaction. It is the Group’s general policy 
to pay suppliers according to the agreed terms and conditions provided the supplier has agreed with those terms. 
On average, creditors were settled within 30 days of their due date. Trade creditor days of the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2007 were 28 days, calculated in accordance with the requirements set down in the Companies Act 1985.
This represents the ratio, expressed in days between the amounts invoiced to the Group by its suppliers in the year and 
the amounts due, at the year end to trade creditors within one year.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on 12 June 2008 at the Company’s Head Office, The Mill, Brimscombe Port,
Stroud, Gloucestershire, GL5 2QG. The notice of the Annual General Meeting is on pages 47 to 49 of this Annual Report.
Corporate governance
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance and intend that the Company will comply with 
the main provisions of the Combined Code of the Financial Reporting Council on Corporate Governance insofar as they 
are appropriate given the Company’s size and stage of development and will endeavour to follow the recommendations 
on corporate governance contained in the Quoted Companies Alliance Guidelines on Corporate Governance for AIM 
listed companies.
The Board comprises 4 executive and 2 non-executive directors, who meet on a regular basis throughout the year.
The Board maintains a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval and is responsible for formulating, reviewing 
and approving the Company’s strategy, budgets, major items of capital expenditure, acquisitions and appointment of 
senior personnel.

Directors’ report
continued
78155 PRE ACC  14/5/08  18:47  Page 12 An Audit Committee has been established which comprises the two non-executive directors. This committee meets at 
least twice a year and is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly reported on and
monitored, and for meeting the auditors and reviewing reports from the auditors relating to the accounts and internal 
control systems.
A Remuneration Committee has been established which comprises the two non-executive directors. Its main function is 
to review the performance of the executive directors, to set the scale and structure of their remuneration and the basis 
of their service agreements with due regard to the interests of the shareholders.
The Board has adopted the Model Code for directors’ dealings in shares as applicable to AIM companies and will take all
reasonable steps to ensure compliance by the directors and by relevant employees.
Share option schemes
The Company operates share option schemes as summarised below, which are administered by the Remuneration
Committee. Options granted under all of the available option schemes will not in aggregate exceed 10% of the Holding
Company’s issued share capital. The directors believe that the success of the Company depends to a high degree on 
the future performance of the management team. The directors also recognise the importance of ensuring that all key
employees are incentivised and identify closely with the profitability of the company.
EMI scheme
Options are exercisable after 3 years and will lapse if not exercised within 7 years.
Approved scheme
Options are exercisable after 3 years and will lapse if not exercised within 10 years. Under this scheme, which has been
approved by the Inland Revenue, the maximum aggregate market value of options, which may be issued to a participant,
may not exceed £30,000.
Unapproved scheme
Options are exercisable after 3 years and will lapse if not exercised within 7 years.
Shadow scheme
This scheme provides a similar incentive to the above schemes by way of a cash equivalent. The main purpose of the
scheme is to enable the Company to provide equity related incentives to employees whose participation in the Approved
Scheme or Unapproved Scheme, may, at the relevant time, not be practicable.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are required by company law to prepare financial statements for each financial period that give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial period and of the profit and 
loss for the Group for that period.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently and reasonable and
prudent judgements and estimates have been made in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2007. The directors also confirm that applicable accounting standards have been followed and that the
financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are responsible for systems of internal control, safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

78155 PRE ACC  14/5/08  18:47  Page 13 We have audited the Group financial statements of Vero Software Plc for the year ended 31 December 2007 which are 
set out on pages 15 to 40. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out
therein. We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of Vero Software Plc for the year ended
on 31 December 2007. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies 
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out 
in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’
Report includes that specific information presented in the Chief Executive’s Review that is cross referred from the Business
Review section of the Directors’ Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. We read
other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the Group financial statements.
This other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, and the Business Review. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in 
the Group financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group financial statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
● the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
● the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and 
● the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Group financial statements.

Reconciliation of net cash flow to movement in net debt
78155 PRE ACC  14/5/08  18:47  Page 18 General information
Vero Software plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of 
the registered office is given on page 8. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in 
the business review on pages 4 to 6.
The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand, as that is the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’).
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 1985 and therefore comply
with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. No income statement is presented for the Company as provided by s230 of
the Companies Act 1985.
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial
instruments. The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows:
The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year. Adoption of
these revised standards and interpretations did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the
Group. They did however, in some instances, give rise to additional disclosures.
• IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures;
• IAS 1 Amendment: Capital disclosures – Presentation of Financial Statements;
• IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2;
• IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives;
• IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment;
• IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions. 
New standards and interpretations not applied
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations which are not effective and have not
been early adopted for these financial statements:
Effective for financial year beginning

IFRS Notes to the financial statements
78155 NOTES  14/5/08  18:54  Page 19 1. Accounting policies – continued
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 incorporate the financial information of
the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company has
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control.
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The cost of the business
combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values of assets given less liabilities incurred or assumed.
Consideration includes any deferred consideration. Deferred consideration is not discounted.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenditure are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting estimates and judgments
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. These judgments involve
assumptions or estimates in respect of future events, which can vary from what is anticipated as discussed below:
Impairment of non financial assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. Other non financial assets
are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash flows from the
asset or cash generating unit and choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those
cash flows. Further details are given in note 10.
Capitalised software development 
Management have reviewed the Group’s research and development activities and have made estimates and
judgments on the amount of development it is appropriate to capitalise and the expected life over which to amortise
the development projects capitalised.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents the value of sales of software and related services to third parties, exclusive of value added 
tax or equivalent. Software licences are recognised on delivery of the software licence. Maintenance renewals are
recognised rateably over the period of the maintenance contract. 
Cost of sales
Cost of sales represents the cost of licence fees in respect of third party software licences, software media costs 
and related hardware. 
Employee benefits 
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for employees based in the United Kingdom. The scheme
is funded by the payment of contributions to an independently administered fund. The pension contributions are
charged to the income statement when incurred.
Accruals are made for holiday pay, based on a calculation of the number of days holiday earned during the year, 
but not yet taken.
Share based payments
Charges have been made in the income statement to spread the fair value of share options issued since November
2002 over the vesting period of those options.
Government grants
Grants are recognised in the income statement as other income and matched against the project’s related
expenditure, provided that the Group has met the conditions of the grant and there is reasonable assurance that 
it will be received.

78155 NOTES  14/5/08  18:54  Page 20 1. Accounting policies – continued
Intangible fixed assets – research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge 
and understanding is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. Development costs incurred
after the point at which the commercial and technical feasibility of the product has been proven, and the decision 
to complete the development has been taken and the resources made available, are capitalised. The expenditure
capitalised includes the cost of direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Capitalised development
expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Development expenditure has 
an estimated useful life of 6 years and is amortised on a straight-line basis.
Intangible assets – other
Software acquired from third parties, licences and trade marks, are included as intangible fixed assets at cost less
amortisation and are amortised over 3 to 10 years. 
In accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised
and included in intangible assets. IFRS 3 also requires the identification of other intangible assets acquired. Although
the techniques used to value other intangible assets are in line with internationally used models, they do require the
use of estimates, which may differ from actual outcomes.
The estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets are as follows:
Intellectual property 6 years
In process research and development 6 years
The carrying value is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be
impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the
extent of the impairment loss. 
Impairment of goodwill
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use
of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use estimation includes estimates
about the future financial performance of the cash generating units, including management’s estimates of long term
operating margins and long-term growth rates. The carrying amount of goodwill and the key assumptions used in 
the calculation of value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill is allocated is disclosed in note 10.
Property, plant and equipment
Assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of assets less
their estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Buildings 2% to 3%
Motor Vehicles 25%
Plant and equipment 10% to 25%
Leasehold improvements over the remaining life of the lease
Inventories
Inventories of CD’s, manuals and packaging are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making
due allowance for obsolete and slow moving stock.
The cost of inventories comprises the purchase price, carriage and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition
of goods, less any trade discounts deductible.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term (with an original maturity of less than three
months) deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the
purpose of the cash flow statement.
Annual Report and Accounts 2007

78155 NOTES  14/5/08  18:54  Page 21 1. Accounting policies – continued
Taxation
Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is
recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, 
in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method providing for temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The
amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets
or liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when
they reverse, based on laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Financial instruments
Treasury activities are managed under policies and procedures approved and monitored by the Board. These are designed
to reduce the financial risk faced by the Group, which relate primarily to credit risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk
and interest rate risk. The Group does not undertake any trading or speculative activity in financial instruments.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currency are included in the accounts of individual companies at the rate of exchange ruling 
at the time of the transaction. Assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at
the balance sheet date and any differences on translation are dealt with in the income statement.
Results are translated into Sterling at the weighted average rates for the year, which is effected by translating each
overseas subsidiary’s monthly result at exchange rates applicable to each of the respective months. Assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the foreign
exchange rate ruling at that date. Differences on exchange resulting from the translation of overseas assets and
liabilities are recognised directly in equity. Such exchange differences are recognised as income or expense in the period
in which the operation is disposed of. Cumulative differences have been set to zero at the date of transition to IFRS.
The closing rates of exchange that have been applied at the balance sheet date and the average rates of exchange
during the period are shown below:-

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the
parent company by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent
company by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, plus the weighted average number of
ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units (CGU’s). The Group conducts
annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of the CGU’s to which
the goodwill has been allocated.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management
and extrapolates future cash flows based on an estimated growth rate of 5%. This rate does not exceed the average
long term growth rate for the relevant markets. The post tax discount rate used of 4.6% is based on 10 year Treasury
bond yields
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Group tested its balance of goodwill for impairment in accordance with IAS36
“Impairment of assets”. No impairment charge was required as a result of this annual impairment test.

Trade receivables that are less than three months past due are not considered impaired. As of 31 December 2007,
trade receivables of £1,020,000 (2006: £750,000) were past due but not impaired. These relate to a number of
dealers and independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk since the risk is spread over a large number of unrelated
counterparties.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.

Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet
are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and
their assessment of the current economic environment. Credit risks of new customers must be assessed locally
before entering into contracts. The overall Group debtor exposure is monitored by Group finance and local entities
must report the current exposure on a monthly basis.
The risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high
credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers 
and counterparties. 
Foreign currency risk
Group Companies have their local currency as their functional currency. The Group policy has the objective of
reducing exposure to revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities. Under the policy, material outstanding foreign
currency balances arising from transactions in currencies other than a Company’s functional currency, are hedged by
either currency deposits, borrowings in currency or forward contracts. As a result of the hedging policy, the exposure
to foreign currencies is significantly reduced. The remaining exposure at the balance sheet date, as shown in the table
below, arises principally from the fact that the extent that the balances were hedged was adjusted soon after the year
end close, in response to a high level of trading at the end of December. Monetary assets and liabilities arising on
transactions between the UK and subsidiary undertakings in Europe and the United States are also hedged. At the
year end forward contracts outstanding amounted to £1,478,000 (2006: £1,766,000), which are revalued at the year
end and resulting gains or losses arising were offset against the gains or losses arising on the corresponding
monetary assets and liabilities.

Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity management implies maintaining sufficient cash locally and the availability of committed credit
facilities. Each Group Company is mainly financed by equity, self-generated cash flows and inter company loans. 
Capital management risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 
in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital
structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long term debt
obligations which carry floating interest rates. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other
variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax through the impact on cash balances and floating rate
borrowings. There is no impact on the Group’s equity.

Fair value
There is no significant difference between the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet and the fair values of the
Group’s financial instruments. For current trade and other receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one
year, the nominal amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
28. Contingent liabilities
In the event that Vero Software Plc does not pay the deferred consideration relating to the acquisition of Camtek Ltd.
when due, the acquisition agreement provides for an additional payment of £284,250 if the deferred consideration is

78155 NOTES  14/5/08  18:54  Page 40 We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Vero Software Plc for the year ended 31 December 2007
which are set out on pages 42 to 46. These parent Company financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Vero Software Plc for the year ended 31 December 2007. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the parent Company financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view and 
whether the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the
financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the
Business Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent
Company financial statements. The other information comprises the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, and 
the Business Review. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the parent Company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in 
the parent Company financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made
by the directors in the preparation of the parent Company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent Company financial statements
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
● the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2007; 
● the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985;
and 
● the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent Company financial statements.

Company balance sheet
78155 NOTES  14/5/08  18:54  Page 42 A. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of the revaluation
of forward currency contracts, on the going concern basis and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in
the United Kingdom (UK GAAP).
Investments
Investments are included at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay
more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on 
current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation
computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax 
is not provided on un-remitted earnings of subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit those earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. Deferred tax is not recognised where it is not material.
Share based payments
The fair value of employee share plans is calculated using a Black Scholes model. In accordance with FRS 20 
“Share based payment” the resulting cost is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting periods of 
the plan. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual levels of options vesting.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currency are included in the accounts at the rate of exchange ruling at the time of the
transaction. Assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance 
sheet date and any differences on translation are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Cash Flow Statement
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS1 “Cash flow statements” which provides that where 
a company is a member of a group and a consolidated cash flow statement is published, the Company does not
have to prepare a cash flow statement.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 “Related Party Disclosures” not to
disclose transactions between Group companies. 
B. Profit for the financial year
As permitted by s230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss
account for the year. The Company reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2007 of £168,000
(2006: £261,000).

Notice of Annual General Meeting
78155 NOTES  14/5/08  18:54  Page 48 Explanation of Resolutions proposed at the Annual General Meeting
Re-election of directors
Resolution 2 
In accordance with Article 72 of the Company’s Articles of Association Richard Youhill retires by rotation, and being eligible,
offers himself for re-election at the AGM.  
Resolution 3
In accordance with Article 72 of the Company’s Articles of Association Donald Babbs retires by rotation, and being eligible,
offers himself for re-election at the AGM.  
Share capital resolutions
Resolution 5 - renewal of and extension of authority to allot shares
Resolution 5 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to give the directors a general authority, in accordance with
Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985, to allot 12,400,000 ordinary shares (being ordinary shares of a nominal value of
£62,000) in the Company equivalent to 33.3% of the current issued share capital. This is in compliance with the Association
of British Insurers’ guidelines. The Company has made use of such authorities in the past for the purpose of acquisitions
and this would provide the flexibility needed for similar acquisition opportunities in the future. This authority replaces the
authority given to the directors on 13 June 2007. 
Resolution 6 - renewal and extension of authority to disapply statutory pre-emption rights
Resolution 6 will be proposed as a special resolution to authorise the directors to allot equity securities for cash (otherwise
than pro rata to existing shareholders) in connection with an offer by way of rights which does not strictly comply with
Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 or otherwise up to a maximum aggregate nominal value of £10,000 (representing
5.4% per cent of the ordinary share capital of the Company presently in issue). Under the Association of British Insurers’
guidelines, such authority would not normally exceed 5% of the Company's issued share capital. As in resolution 5, the
additional authority provides flexibility to act on opportunities for acquisitions or investments, which may arise.
Articles of Association
Resolution 7
Under the Companies Act 2006, from 1 October 2008 a director must avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct
or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict with the company’s interests. The requirement is very broad and
could apply, for example, if a director becomes a director of another company or a trustee of another organisation. The Act
allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate, where a company’s
Articles of Association contain a provision to this effect. Resolution 7 gives the directors authority to approve such
situations. Only directors who have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the relevant decision.
At the present time the board are not aware of any circumstances which may give rise to a conflict or potential conflict
of interest. 
Reduction of share premium account
Resolution 8
This Resolution relates to the reduction of share premium account by £4,000,000, further details of which are given in the
accompanying Chairman’s Letter.

CHAIRmAN’S STATEmENT
Synchronica continues to make great 
strategic and commercial progress as we 
focus our efforts on becoming the leading 
provider of push mobile email solutions 
for mobile operators in emerging markets. 
Key to this progress is the enhancement 
of our distribution network. 
During 2009 we successfully secured 
global reseller agreements with 
Brights t ar ,	nok i a	 siemen s 	netw ork s,	
and a large Asian-based network 
equipment vendor. This has resulted 
in us being able to substantially enlarge 
our	c u s t omer	f ootprint,	and	w elc ome	
new customers from our target markets 
of 	the	Mid dl e	e a s t 	and	Afric a,	e a s t ern	
e ur ope,	As i a	and	Latin	Americ a.	Our	
distribution partnerships provide 
Synchronica with global reach and 
local presence in all the high growth 
m ark ets 	and	w e	r em ain	c onfident 	th at 	
our focus on distribution will continue 
to bear fruit. 
Financial results
We increased revenue slightly on last 
year at £3.83m (2008: £3.71m). The 
consensus broker expectation had been 
for higher revenues in 2009 and in the 
latter part of 2009 and into 2010 we 
believed that this had been achieved.

counter-signatures and purchase orders 
relating to the delivery of mobile Gateway 
in 2009 would not be received in time 
for us to recognise the revenue in 2009. 
We gave the appropriate guidance to 
the	m ark et,	and	h av e	in	the	me antime	
successfully restarted discussions with 
the customer aiming to conclude this 
contract soon after the acquisition 
is completed.

started positively building the sales 
pipeline to a higher level than ever

provided there is an accelerated rate of 
conversion to revenue in the remainder of 
the 	 y e ar . 	 In 	 pr ev iou s 	 y e ar s, 	 s y nc hr onic a’s	
revenue has been heavily weighted 
towards the second half. The slower 
conversion of the sales pipeline has 
led to a lower than expected level of

Contrary to the common belief that

world is hungry for access to the online 
applications we take for granted – 
em ai l,	in s t ant 	me s s agin g	and	soc i al

penetr ation	in	emer gin g	m ark ets,	
the mobile device has the opportunity 
to become the primary device for 
accessing these next-generation 
messaging applications.

Synchronica signed a record 13 new

throughout 2009 – predominantly 
in	the	emer gin g	m ark ets 	of 	Afric a,

While in 2009 Synchronica received 
revenue from these customers for initial 
lic en se	r equir ements,	w e	e xpect 	t o	
receive further revenue as their user base 
grows and they place expansion orders. 
F or	e x amp l e,	fiv e	c ontr acts 	h av e	been

Assuming a successful launch and 
r e a son ab l e	t ak eup-r at e s,	w e	h av e	
every reason to believe that we will 
see substantial expansion orders 
from these operators within the next 
12-18 months.
The impact expansion orders have 
on revenue contribution has already 
been	demon s tr at ed.	In	Apri l 	2009,

orders with a combined value of

mobile operators in Russia and the CIS. 
It is reasonable to expect subsequent 
expansion orders from our customers 
as they commercialise their service 
and the user base exceeds the initial 
license orders. Synchronica will also 
receive recurring revenues from 
customers in the form of hosting 
f ee s 	(wher e	ho s tin g	i s 	pr o v ided),	
annual support and maintenance

RepoRt of the DiRectoRs
foR the yeAR enDeD 31 DecembeR 2009
the Directors present their report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Principal activities
During the course of the year the principal activity of the Group remained the development and provision of mobile device 
management and synchronisation solutions.
Review of the business
We continued to focus the business on two software products, synchronica mobile Gateway and synchronica mobile backup; 
both targeted on the mass market particularly in developing countries. We further developed our direct sales and our sales 
channels; please see the chairman’s and chief executive’s statements. 
Results and dividends
the loss on ordinary activities after taxation for the year was £3.077m (2008: £6.100m).
no dividend is proposed for the year ended 31 December 2009 (2008: £nil).
Research and development
the Group has a continuing commitment to a high level of research and development spending (2009: £1.500m, 2008: £1.421m). 
the Group’s accounting policy on research and development is detailed in the notes to the accounts, during 2008, all costs 
incurred on research and development were charged to the income statement. close to the end of 2008, the Group reached 
a position where the conditions, as set out in the Group’s accounting policies, had been met which compelled the Group 
to capitalise development expenditure as required by international financial reporting standards in relation to its two products 
synchronica mobile Gateway and synchronica mobile backup. With effect from 1 January 2009 the Group began capitalising 
development expenditure related directly to these two products. the assets created are amortised over a period of four years 
from the time the features of the software comes into use by customers. Development costs are ongoing and reflect the Group’s 
commitment to being at the forefront of technological advances necessary to ensure future growth. Research and development 
in the year concentrated on further improvements in the technical features and capabilities of the key products in the business. 
Subsequent events 
on 7 April 2010, the c ompany issued 8,510,204 ordinary shares to settle the deferred consideration outstanding as a 
result of the acquisition of concluded in september 2008. 
on 7 April 2010, the c ompany issued 88,000,000 ordinary shares in connection with an equity swap placing to provide 
working capital over a two year period.
on 21 April 2010, the c ompany issued 54,054,054 ordinary shares and €700,000 in cash for the initial consideration 
for the acquisition of assets and the instant messaging and presence service (imps) business of c olibria As of norway. 
in addition the company issued 111,600,000 new ordinary shares with institutional and private investors at 2.5p. 
the funds were raised to fund the acquisition and to develop, market and support the imps business. 
Directors and Directors’ interests

At the close of business on 28 May 2010 the Company had been notified of the following material interests (excluding Directors’

Williams de broe        31,549,354 3.76
Group policy to the payment of creditors
it is the policy of the Group that, where possible, payments are made within the terms established with suppliers, provided 
that the supplier is also complying with all relevant terms and conditions. the weighted average number of days’ purchases 
outstanding during 2009 was 98 days (2008: 50 days).
Key Performance Indicators (“KPI’s”)
the board uses the following Kpi’s to monitor the performance of the business:
          2009 2008 
          £’000 £’000
Revenue         3,827 3,708
l oss for the year after tax         3,077 6,100
cash         2,633 3,494
the board sets a budget each year and monitors Kpi’s against this.
Principal risks and uncertainty
Competition
there is a competitive market for the Group’s products; on occasion this places pressure on sales price and sales margin. 
the Group monitors the products offered by competitors, functionality and price and if necessary adjusts price accordingly. 
Employees
the Group’s performance depends largely on key staff. the resignation of key individuals and the inability to recruit people 
with the right skills could adversely impact the Group’s results. to mitigate these issues the Group provides a share option 
scheme and remuneration packages designed to retain key individuals. 
Technological change
the pace of technological change is rapid and the Group seeks to be part of this. the Group is a member of key industry 
standard setting bodies, is seen as a thought leader, regularly monitors the activities of its competitors and continuously 
invests in product development. it is therefore considered unlikely that markets will develop without the Group responding 
in such a way as to make the Group’s products less attractive than those of its competitors.
Financial risk management 
Price and credit control risk
t he Group has set prices for its products, which only senior management can adjust. t he majority of the Group’s customers are 
national mobile phone operators and offer it low credit risk. there is also a risk that governments impose exchange restrictions.
Liquidity and cash flow risk
The Group monitors its cash position on a daily basis and maintains a detailed rolling weekly cash flow forecast for three months 
ahead. The Group’s annual budgets include a cash flow forecast. All of these documents are regularly reviewed by the Directors. 
the Group does not have any borrowings and the Group’s assets are principally funded by equity and cash in bank.
Foreign currency risk
The main financial risk arising from the Group’s operations is foreign currency risk as the Group receives a significant 
proportion of its revenues in us Dollars and euros. there were no forward contracts outstanding at year end.
Treasury management 
the Group invests its cash balances, which are mainly held in sterling (see note 25) for appropriate periods with institutions 
with high credit ratings. The release of funds from deposit has been timed to reflect the Group’s ongoing cash needs. 
the Group monitors interest rates, switching cash balances to bank accounts that provide competitive rates of return. 18 Synchronica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
RepoRt of the DiRectoRs continueD
foR the yeAR enDeD 31 DecembeR 2009
Financial risk management (continued)
Environmental risk
the Group’s policy is to ensure that it fully understands and manages the actual and potential environmental impact 
of its activities. our operations are conducted in such a way that we comply with the legal requirements relating to 
the environment in all areas of our business.
Disclosure of information to auditors
At the date of making this report each of the Group’s Directors, as set out on page 14, confirm the following:
››  so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant information needed by the Group’s auditors in connection with 
preparing their report of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
››  each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant information needed by the Group’s auditors in connection with preparing their report and to establish that 
the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint bDo llp as the c ompany’s auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming General meeting.
Annual General Meeting
notice of a General meeting to be held on 28 July 2010 is set out on page 59 of the Annual Report.
Resolutions 1 and 2 are ordinary resolutions dealing with the adoption of the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Resolutions 3 and 4 are ordinary resolutions dealing with the re-election of Directors. Directors appointed to the board 
since the date of the last Annual General meeting are required to be re-elected at the following Annual General meeting. 
thereafter Directors are required to be re-elected by rotation at lease once every three years. 
Resolution 5 is an ordinary resolution and deals with the appointment of the auditors of the company.
Resolution 6 is an ordinary resolution dealing with the Directors’ authority to issue shares. 
Resolutions 7 is a special resolution.
this special business proposed for consideration at the Annual General m eeting relates to the ability of the Directors to 
issue new shares. under the c ompanies Act 2006, the Directors of a company may only allot unissued shares if authorised 
to do so. The Act also prevents allotments for cash, other than to existing shareholders unless the Directors are specifically 
authorised. this gives the shareholders what are known as “pre-emption rights”. the Articles of Association envisage the 
Directors having general authority to allot unissued shares and disapply the pre-emption rights in respect of amounts to be 
fixed by shareholder resolutions. Passing these resolutions will extend the Directors’ flexibility to act in the best interests 
of the shareholders, when opportunities arise to issue new shares.
the Directors will be able to allot new shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,679,238.
The arrangements are intended to give the Directors a measure of operational flexibility, while at the same time ensuring 
that the interests of the existing shareholders are protected. f or example, in the event of a share issue, the proportionate 
interests of existing shareholders could not, without their agreement, be reduced by more than 17% by the new issue of shares 
for cash to new shareholders. the board has no current plans to allot shares except in connection with the m anagement 
incentive plan and the outstanding warrants.
the authority sought by resolutions 6 and 7 will expire on 28 July 2015, but could be varied or withdrawn by agreement 
of shareholders at an intervening general meeting.
Approval
the Directors’ Report was approved by the board and signed on its behalf by:

Policy statement
the board’s aim is to achieve a high standard of c orporate Governance. As an Aim traded group, full compliance with the 
combined code is not a formal obligation. notwithstanding this exemption, the Group has sought to adopt the provisions 
of the combined code that are appropriate to its size and organisation and establish frameworks for the achievement of 
this objective.
The Board of Directors
the board comprises two executive and two non-executive Directors. the board meets, at least monthly, to consider the 
current state of the business and the strategic issues. board papers including detailed management accounts are circulated 
in advance of meetings and all board and c ommittee meetings, and their attendees, are recorded. the board considers 
strategic matters, business development policy, expenditure on major capital items, annual operating budgets, management 
structure and internal control procedures.
The roles of the (Non-executive) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separated. David Mason and Michael Jackson 
are considered by the board to be independent non-executive Directors. neither take part in the executive management 
of the Group and their holdings of the parent company’s shares are insufficient, in the opinion of the Board, to influence 
the exercise of their independent judgement. non-executive Directors have access to all information and, if required, external 
advice at the expense of the Group. 
Appointments to the Board
The Board has the responsibility of selecting suitable candidates to hold office as Director. Both Executive and Non-executive 
Directors are required to retire by rotation in accordance with the Articles of Association of the company and re-appointment 
is subject to confirmation by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Given its size, the Board does not consider it 
necessary to establish a nominations c ommittee.
Remuneration Committee
All of the non-executive Directors serve on the Remuneration c ommittee, which is chaired by michael Jackson. the Remuneration 
Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration, contract terms and other benefits of the Executive Directors 
and all other employees where the proposed annual salary is in excess of £50,000.
Audit Committee
All of the non-executive Directors serve on the Audit c ommittee, which is chaired by michael Jackson. the Audit c ommittee 
meets at least twice a year and in addition, the auditors may request a meeting at any time. the Audit c ommittee is responsible 
for reviewing the interim and final accounts prior to submission to the Board. The Committee agrees the scope and approach 
to the annual audit and interim review in advance with the auditors. the c ommittee keeps under review the appointment 
and remuneration of the external auditors, their cost effectiveness, their independence and objectivity. the chief financial 
Officer attends meetings of the Audit Committee by invitation.
Internal control and risk management
the board is responsible for maintaining an appropriate system of internal control to provide reasonable assurance of 
the quality and reliability of financial information used to direct the business, safeguard assets and recognise liabilities 
in accordance with company law and generally accepted accounting practices and for reviewing its effectiveness. Authority 
levels for purchase and capital commitments are defined. The Group has developed detailed budgets and monthly management 
reporting of actual results against budgets and analyses variances in performance. Regular re-forecasting and projection 
of results are carried out during the year as required.
Investor relations
management has put in place procedures to enable a regular dialogue with institutional investors and analysts particularly 
in relation to interim and full year results. All shareholders will receive the Annual Report and the interim financial statements. 
the board welcomes as many investors as possible to the Annual General m eeting and invites discussion on issues facing 
the Group. 
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. the rationale for the 
going concern basis is set out in note 2 to the financial statements. o VeRVieW coRpoRA te Go VeRnAnce finAnciAl stAtements business ReVieW

stAtement of DiRectoRs’ Responsibilities
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and the Group, 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the parent company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
the Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. The Directors are also required to prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance with 
international financial Reporting standards as adopted by the european union (ifRss) and the rules of the l ondon stock 
exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative investment market. the Directors have chosen to prepare 
financial statements for the parent company in accordance with IFRSs.
Group financial statements
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses set out in the international Accounting standards board’s “framework for the preparation and 
presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with 
all applicable ifRss. A fair presentation also requires the Directors to:
››  consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies; 
››  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and 
››    provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance. 
Parent company financial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
››  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
››    prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will 
continue in business; 
››  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
››  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements. 
f inancial statements are published on the Group’s website in accordance with legislation in the united Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Group’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. the Directors’ responsibility also extends to the 
ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.  24 Synchronica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and international standards on Auditing (uK and ireland). those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing practices board’s (Apb’s) ethical standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
this includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements
in our opinion: 
››    the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2009 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
››    the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
››    the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Report of the Directors for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
››  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
››    the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
››    certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
››  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. o VeRVieW coRpoRA te Go VeRnAnce finAnciAl stAtements business ReVieW

Emphasis of matter – going concern
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure 
made in note 2 of the financial statements concerning the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is 
reliant on signing new deals with customers which are expected but not guaranteed in order to continue as a going concern. 
These conditions, along with other matters discussed in note 2 to the financial statements, indicate the existence of a material 
uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial 
statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern.

1 General information
Synchronica plc is incorporated in England under the Companies Act 2006. The address of its registered office 
is mount pleasant house, l onsdale Gardens, Royal tunbridge Wells, Kent tn1 1ny , united Kingdom.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in pound Sterling, which represented the reporting currency of the 
Group and parent company, the functional currency of the Group entities is the united states Dollar. f oreign operations are 
consolidated in accordance with the policies set out in note 2 below.
2 Significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Group and parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International 
financial Reporting standards (ifRs), international financial Reporting interpretations c ommittee (ifRic) interpretations 
and with those parts of the companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under ifRs. All accounting standards 
and interpretations issued by the international Accounting standards board and the international financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee effective at the time of preparing these financial statements have been applied.
A summary of the significant Group and Company accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements 
is set out below. these policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The preparation of financial statements which comply with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions, and for 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. critical judgements and 
key estimates and assumptions are disclosed in note 3.
As of 1 January 2009, the company and Group changed its functional currency from sterling to us Dollar. the change 
reflects the majority of the revenues are from competitive markets priced and settled in US Dollars. The translation procedures 
applicable to the new functional currency were applied prospectively from the date of change. the presentational currency 
has remained as Sterling for the benefit of investors.
Going concern
These Group financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which is supported by forecasts and 
projections covering the period to 31 December 2011.
the Group made a loss of £3.077m for the year to 31 December 2009 (2008: £6.100m) and had cash of £2.633m at that 
time. in April 2010 the Group raised an additional £4.8m (£2.8m in cash plus £2m on a 24 month swap) before expenses 
from existing and new shareholders. from this placing £0.611m was used as part consideration for the acquisition of the 
colibria imps business (see note 36). 
The forecasts and projections, which include monthly cash flows, suggest that provided the Group trades in line with 
expectations it has sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due. There is however a risk that the Group may not 
meet its revenue expectations and/or that while it may meet these revenue expectations it might meet them more slowly 
than anticipated; either or both of these could test the Group’s cash flow. The forecasts are reliant on signing new deals 
with new customers which is expected but not guaranteed, negotiations are ongoing.
in addition, the Group operates in a highly specialised and fast moving environment in which in order to generate revenue 
it is necessary that the products are and remain up to date. this leaves the Group with little opportunity to reduce costs 
if it is to remain competitive.
Given the above, the Directors acknowledge that there is a material uncertainty related to these events, that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, that it may be unable to realise 
its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
the Group has faced the uncertainties noted above throughout its life. to date, when required, management has been successful 
in raising additional funding from existing and new investors. based on forecasts and projections and the additional funding 
raised since the balance sheet date, management expects the company to continue as a going concern. o VeRVieW coRpoRA te Go VeRnAnce finAnciAl stAtements business ReVieW

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Standards adopted
ifRs 8 “operating segments” (effective for period beginning on or after 1 January 2009) replaces iAs 14 “segmental 
Reporting”. the effects of adopting this standard are included in note 9. 
ifRs 3 “business combinations” (revised) has been adopted. the effects of adopting this standard are included in note 32. 
the Group has adopted the revised iAs 1 “presentation of financial statements (2007)”, which became effective as of 
1 January 2009. As a result, the Group presents in the consolidated statement of changes in equity all owner changes in 
equity, whereas all non-owner changes in equity are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
As permitted under the revised iAs 1, the Group has elected to present a single statement of comprehensive income. 
comparative information has been re-presented so that it also is in conformity with the revised standard.
the Group has applied “improving Disclosures about financial instruments (Amendments to ifRs 7)” effective for the year 
ending 31 December 2009. this amendment requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements and liquidity 
risk which have been provided in note 21. the amendment does not change the recognition or measurements of transactions 
and balances in the financial statements.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards not yet effective
certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory 
for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 or later periods and which the Group has decided 
not to adopt early. these are:
››  amendment to iAs 39 “financial instrument: eligible hedged items” and “financial instruments Recognition and 
Measurement” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009). This amendment clarifies principals 
relating to one sided hedge transactions and inflation on financial hedged items. Management is currently assessing 
the impact of this amendment on the financial statements. 
››  amendment to ifRic 9 “Reassessment of embedded Derivatives” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
30 June 2009). This amendment clarifies the treatment of embedded derivatives to be consistent with changes in IAS 39 
and IFRS 7. Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the financial statements.
››  ifRic 17 Distribution of non-cash Assets to owners (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009). 
This interpretation clarifies the treatment of non-cash distributions to owners such as non-cash dividends. No such 
transactions are planned by management and the standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Group’s 
financial statements.
››  ifRic 18 “transfer of Assets from customers” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009). 
this standard relates to assets transferred to the entity that it must use to connect to the customers network. 
Management is currently assessing the impact of the interpretation on the financial accounts. 
››  ifRs 2 “Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2010). Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the financial accounts.
››  ifRs 1 Additional exemptions for first time Adopters (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010). 
These are specific exemptions on first time adoption that do not apply to the entity and therefore will have no impact 
on the results or disclosure of the Group.
››    IAS 32 “Classification of Rights Issues” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010). 
Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the financial accounts.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the Company and each 
of its subsidiaries for the financial year ended 31 December 2009.
subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. control is deemed to exist when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly 
to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results, assets, 
liabilities and cash flows of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control 
commences until the date that control ceases.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used 
into line with those used by the Group.
intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 34 Synchronica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currencies 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, the Group’s presentation currency. Items included in the 
financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using US Dollars as the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’).
transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (the “functional currency”) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. f oreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at rates ruling at the statement of financial p osition date. exchange differences 
arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
on consolidation, the statement of financial position of the overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the statement of financial p osition date. the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of opening net assets, 
together with the year-end adjustment to closing rates of statement of c omprehensive income translated at average rates, 
are taken directly to reserves. t he statement of comprehensive income of the overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated 
at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the effect of the rates prevailing on the 
transaction dates, in which case the income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions). All other 
translation differences are taken to the statement of c omprehensive income. 
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for 
licences granted and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, any refunds due and VAt.
t he Group derives revenue from one trade in software licences and providing customer support and other services in relation 
to those licences. customer support includes telephone support and maintenance updates. other services include the sale 
of professional services to install and maintain software and to train licensees in the maintenance and use of the software.
Revenue allocable to software licences is recognised when all of the following conditions are met:
››    the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership;
››  the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership 
nor effective control over the goods sold;
››  the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
››    it is probable that the economic benefit associated with the transaction will flow; and
››  the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue allocable to customer support and maintenance is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the contract, 
usually one year. Revenue not recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income under this policy is classified as deferred 
income in the statement of financial p osition.
Revenue allocable to other services is recognised when the service has been rendered to the customer and the value can 
be measured reliably with reference to the stage of completion of the project.
Share-based payments
the Group operates an employee share option scheme. the fair value of options or shares granted under the scheme is 
recognised in the statement of c omprehensive income as an expense over the period in which any performance conditions 
are fulfilled ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award, based on management’s 
best estimate of the number of awards that will ultimately vest. A corresponding amount is credited to equity. no expense 
is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for those where the vesting depends on a market condition. 
Whether or not the market condition is satisfied, these are treated as vesting as long as all other performance conditions 
are satisfied.
the fair value of the awards are measured at the date at which they are granted using a black- scholes-merton option-pricing model. 
Goods and services received in exchange for warrants are recognised when the goods are obtained or the services are 
received. the goods and services received in exchange for warrants are recognised as assets or expenses as appropriate 
with a corresponding increase in equity. o VeRVieW coRpoRA te Go VeRnAnce finAnciAl stAtements business ReVieW

2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Leases
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group (an “operating lease”), 
the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated statement of c omprehensive income on a straight 
line basis over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction of the rental expense 
over the lease term on a straight line basis.
Investments
investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment where necessary to reduce book value to recoverable 
amount. Cost is purchase price including acquisition expenses, but excluding any payment for accrued interest or fixed 
dividend entitlement.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value 
of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is capitalised and provision 
is made for any impairment.
Goodwill and intellectual property rights are allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill or intellectual property rights relate is tested 
annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Intangible assets – intellectual property rights
intellectual property rights acquired as part of a business acquisition are capitalised separately from goodwill if their value 
can be measured reliably on initial recognition and they are controlled through custody or legal rights. these rights are initially 
recorded at fair value which is based on replacement cost and are amortised over four years which is their estimated useful 
economic life. provision is made for any impairment.
intellectual property rights purchased separately from a business are capitalised at cost and are amortised over four years 
which is their estimated useful economic life. provision is made for any impairment.
Intangible assets – computer software and customer relationships
computer software and customer relationships are amortised on a straight line basis, to reduce their carrying value to their 
residual value, over their estimated useful lives. the following useful lives were applied during the year:
computer software — up to 2 years 
customer relationships — up to 2½ years 
Deferred development expenditure — up to 4 years
methods of amortisation, residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if necessary at each statement of financial 
position date.
Intangible assets – collaboration rights
costs attributed to rights acquired in a tripartite collaboration for the design, production, email and instant message enabling, 
sale and distribution of devices are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the first 500,000 units sold.
Impairment 
in an impairment test, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or asset is estimated to determine the extent of 
any impairment loss. the recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use in the 
Group. An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.
In determining a cash-generating unit’s value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to 
the cash-generating unit or asset that has not already been included in the estimate of future cash flows.
Reversals of impairment losses other than for goodwill are recognised immediately in the statement of c omprehensive income. 36 Synchronica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

foR the yeAR enDeD 31 DecembeR 2009
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Research and development
An intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) will be recognised if, 
and only if, it can be demonstrated that all of the following conditions are met:
››    it is probable that the asset will create future economic benefits;
››  the development costs can be measured reliably;
››  technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset can be demonstrated;
››  there is the intention to complete the asset and use or sell it;
››  there is the ability to use or sell the asset; and
››    adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use the asset are available.
subsequent to initial recognition, internally generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.
Property, plant and equipment 
property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if applicable. 
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is charged on an asset’s residual value over its useful economic life as follows:
Office equipment  —  up to 2 years 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment  —  up to 4 years
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial p osition date.
Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition 
of a financial liability. The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments. The Group considers its capital 
to comprise its ordinary share capital, share premium and accumulated retained earnings. there have been no changes 
in what the Group considers to be capital since the previous period. 
the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of preparation of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand 
and short-term deposits with an original maturity period of three months or less. 
Trade and other receivables
trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation 
and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. the amount of the 
provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted 
at the original effective interest rate. the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account 
and the amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of c omprehensive income within administrative expenses. When 
a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written-off against the allowance account for trade receivables. subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written-off are credited against administrative costs in the statement of c omprehensive income.
Taxation
the charge for current income tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are not taxed or disallowed. 
it is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial p osition date.
Deferred income tax is accounted for using the liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference is due to goodwill arising on a business combination 
or from an asset or liability, the initial recognition of which does not affect either taxable or accounting income. o VeRVieW coRpoRA te Go VeRnAnce finAnciAl stAtements business ReVieW
Synchronica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 37
2 Significant accounting policies (continued)
Taxation (continued)
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where 
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and law enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial p osition date. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of c omprehensive income, except when it relates to items credited 
or charged directly to shareholders’ equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in shareholders’ equity.
Provisions
provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation in respect of a past event, where it is more likely than 
not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount can be reliably estimated.
Financial instruments
The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial 
liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position when the Group 
becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The particular recognition and measurement methods adopted for the Group’s financial instruments are disclosed below:
Fair value measurement hierarchy
IFRS 7 requires certain disclosures which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at 
fair value using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurement 
(see note 3). the fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
(a) quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (l evel 1);
(b)  inputs other than quoted prices included within l evel 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) (l evel 2); and
(c) inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (l evel 3).
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are also subsequently 
carried at fair value. Gains and losses are charged to financial income or costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
see note 21.
in the normal course of its business, the Group is exposed to currency risk. f orward foreign exchange contracts are 
derivative instruments and are used by the Group to manage its currency risks. 
Fair value determination
Whenever available, the fair value of a financial instrument is derived from quoted prices in an active market. For assets 
held, fair value is the bid price and for liabilities held it is the asking price. if there is no active market, fair value is established 
by using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques include the use of information from recent arm’s length market transactions 
between knowledgeable, willing parties, if available, reference to the current fair value of similar instruments and discounted 
cash flow analysis. The valuation technique used incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in setting 
a price and is consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all its 
liabilities. equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable 
issue costs.
Dividends
final dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the c ompany’s shareholders. 
interim dividends are recognised when they are paid. 38 Synchronica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

In the process of applying the Group accounting policies, the following judgements have had the most significant effect 
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Revenue recognition
In accordance with IAS 18, revenue, even when invoiced, is not recognised to the extent that significant obligations are 
retained by the Group, such as when customer support services remain to be performed. Revenue is recognised where 
the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the customer and there is certainty that the 
economic benefits from the transaction will flow to the Group. For perpetual licence fees and other services recognition 
occurs when the customer has accepted the software or service. f or annual licence fees and annual support fees revenue 
is recognised over the period of the related obligation. 
Income taxes
the determination of the Group’s tax liabilities requires the interpretation of tax law. the Group obtains appropriate professional 
advice from its tax advisors in relation to all significant tax matters. The Directors believe that the judgements made in determining 
the Group’s tax liabilities are reasonable and appropriate, however, actual experience may differ and materially affect 
future tax charges. Claims for research and development tax credits are recognised when the cash flows are certain. 
Key accounting estimates and assumptions
Key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are as follows.
Business combination
Accounting estimates are applied in determining the initial fair value of goodwill, intellectual property rights and 
customer relationships. 
Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
the Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
All other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when indicators of impairment exist. 
impairment is determined with reference to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is estimated 
using adjusted future cash flows. Significant assumptions are made in estimating future cash flows about future events 
including future market conditions and future growth rates. changes in these assumptions could affect the outcome of 
impairment reviews.
the recoverable amount of the above cash-generating unit has been determined from value in use calculations based on 
cash flow projections from the formally approved 2009 budgets and projections covering the years to 31 December 2014. 
Fair value of derivative instruments
the assumptions made to calculate the fair value of derivatives are set out in note 21. in calculating the fair value at the 
statement of financial p osition date, the company share price and liboR rates are assumed to remain at the rate ruling 
at the statement of financial p osition values until the end of the agreements. A change in share price in either direction 
of 1.0p from the year end price of 3.375p will lead to a change in value of £153,600. A change in liboR interest rate of 1% 
causes a change in value of £13,700. The discount rate used is based on the Group’s beta adjusted discount rate to reflect 
management’s assessment of specific risks related to the Company. The use of following discount rates would provide the 
following fair values:
Discount rate f air value £’000 
9.5%  557 
11.0%  551 
12.5%  545
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when management is satisfied that an outflow of economic benefits is probable and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the obligation.
in estimating the onerous lease provisions, the Group considers the likelihood of being able to sub-let properties and the 
probability of assignees going into liquidation and property reverting to the Group. o VeRVieW coRpoRA te Go VeRnAnce finAnciAl stAtements business ReVieW

4 Financial risk management
Treasury management
Group treasury policies are reviewed and approved by the board. the objectives of Group treasury policies are to ensure 
that adequate financial resources are available for development of the business while at the same time managing financial 
risks. Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce financial risk exposures arising from the Group’s business 
activities and not for speculative purposes.
The Group’s treasury activities are managed by the Group finance function under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer. 
The Chief Financial Officer reports to the Board on the implementation of Group treasury policy.
The Group’s business activities expose it to a variety of financial risks that include:
››  liquidity risk;
››  credit risk;
›› interest rate risk; and
›› currency risk.
the policies for managing these risks are described below:
Liquidity risk
The Group finances its operations through a combination of shareholders’ funding and cash generated from revenues. 
The Group’s treasury policy aims to ensure that there are sufficient funds available to meet the projected cash flow 
requirements in the business plan. Management monitors the Group’s liquidity on the basis of expected cash flow. 
Cash reports are produced and reviewed by senior management. Monthly cash flow statements are reviewed by 
management and annual cash flow budgets are produced and reviewed by the Board of Directors.
the Group’s principal source of funding is from its shareholders, the Group has no borrowings. 
Credit risk
the amounts of trade receivables presented in the statement of financial p osition are net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
estimated by management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are high credit 
quality financial institutions.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk are interest rate swaps plus cash and cash 
equivalents. The terms of the interest rate swaps are set out in note 21. The interest rate profile of these financial 
instruments is disclosed in note 24. the Group does not have any overdrafts or loans.
Currency risk
the Group is exposed to currency risk through movements in exchange rates on its purchases and sales that are not 
denominated in us Dollars. the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the currency risk associated 
with highly probable forecast transactions. the contracts are denominated primarily in us Dollars and euros. 
Fair value estimation
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and borrowings with a maturity of less than one year 
are assumed to approximate to their book values.

During the year customer relationships were impaired by £35,000 to reflect a customer written-off as a bad debt. In 2008 
£415,000 was impaired against a one off large contract. 
the Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit (cGu) to which goodwill has been allocated. the Group has only one c Gu. the recoverable amount of 
the cGu is determined from value-in-use calculations. the key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the 
discount rate applied, the operating margin and the growth rate of net operating cash flows. The approved cash flow 
projections in the three financial years following the budget year reflect management’s expectation of the medium-term 
operating performance of the cGu and the prospects of the Group in the market.
››    The discount rate applied to the CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value 
of money at the balance sheet date and the risks specific to the CGU. The discount rate applied to the CGU is 20%.
››  the operating margin assumed for the c Gu is primarily based on management’s assessment of operating margin 
and expected revenues.
››    Long-term growth rates of net operating cash flows are assumed equal to the growth rate in mobile consumer email. 
A growth rate of 30% has been applied based on industry expectations to 2014. o VeRVieW coRpoRA te Go VeRnAnce finAnciAl stAtements business ReVieW

the c ompany has previously entered into two derivative agreements. the c ompany issued shares in exchange for the right 
to receive the proceeds of monthly swap settlements. each settlement amount is determined by the company’s share price 
and by interest on the notional balance outstanding balance during that settlement period. until the settlement of each swap 
the company holds the risk and reward of market changes.
on 15 January 2008, the c ompany completed a placing of 30,000,000 ordinary 1p shares at a price of 6.25p. the c ompany 
also entered into its first derivative agreement, consisting of equity and interest rate swaps with a notional principal value 
of £1.875m. At the request of the company the settlement of swaps was delayed in november 2009, resuming in f ebruary 2010. 
18 of 24 swaps remain to be settled at 31 December 2009.
on 11 september 2008, the c ompany completed a placing of 21,666,666 ordinary 1p shares at a price of 3p. the c ompany 
also entered into the second derivative agreement, consisting of equity and interest rate swaps with a notional principal 
value of £0.65m. The final swaps of this agreement settled in September 2009.

t he notional principal of this derivative agreement is divided into 24 equal swaps. t he value of the swap settled in each period 
is determined by reference to the company’s share price, the equity swap, and to liboR (one month Gbp l ondon interbank 
borrowing Rate), the interest rate swap. the amount received in respect of each equity swap is based on the c ompany’s 
share price divided by the base price of 8.3333p multiplied by the principal being settled of £78,125. A change in share 
price of 0.1p from the base price will lead to a change in receipts of £938 per month. the settlement value of the interest 
rate swap to be deducted from the equity swap is arrived at by multiplying the outstanding notional principal amount over 
the period since the last settlement date by liboR minus 2.5% p.a.
Fair value of the swaps is calculated by discounting the forecast cash flows by reference to the current share price and 
liboR on the reference date.

of £23,363,000 (2008: £20,500,000) has not been recognised due to the uncertainty of recoverability of this amount.

31 Share-based payments
Employee share options
share-based payment incentives have been granted to certain employees to acquire ordinary shares of 1p each under the 
synchronica Global share option plan and enterprise m anagement incentive plan (“option plans”). options were granted 
with an exercise price equal to the closing mid-market price as quoted by the l ondon stock exchange on the business day 
before the options were granted.
under the rules of the option plans options become exercisable after a minimum of one year from the date of grant to a 
maximum of five years from the date of grant. As a condition of exercise the Option Holder must make a payment to the 
company of the aggregate exercise price due. income tax, employee national insurance and their overseas equivalents 
may be due on the exercise of the options.
the rules of the option plans provide that options granted will lapse six months after an employee leaves the Group’s 
employment. however the Directors have authority to vary these provisions.
During the year options over a total of 40,799,240 ordinary shares were granted under the option plans.

no dividends are expected on the underlying shares. the options have been valued using a black- scholes-merton model 
for valuation. in previous years the historical data for the company was limited, the expected volatility was determined 
by reference to comparable companies. the model assumes employees will exercise their options when the market price 
is 2.0 times (2008: 2.0) the exercise price and that the employee exit rate is 20% (2008: 20%). the options granted in 
the year are exercisable in three annual equal instalments from the date of the grant without any market based conditions. 
the interests of the Directors in the share options of the c ompany are as shown in the Remuneration Report.
At 31 December 2009, options over a total of 60,290,443 ordinary shares remained in issue:

32 Prior period acquisition of AxisMobile Limited
As disclosed in last year’s financial statements, on 10 September 2008, the Group completed the acquisition of AxisMobile Limited 
(AML). During the year the fair value of deferred income reflected in the prior year was revised by £0.713m to reflect the 
actual stage of completion of the customer installations. in addition, costs of acquisition have been written-off to the statement 
of Comprehensive Income in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 (revised). Further adjustments include a reclassification 
of capital to be issued of £532,000 as a current liability and an adjustment to deferred tax for these amounts. the Group 
has adopted ifRs 3 (revised) in order to provide consistent accounting for this and future acquisitions. these changes have 
been treated as a prior year adjustment in these financial statements and the numbers restated accordingly. Had these 
amounts been finalised at the 2008 financial statements year end, the reported amounts would have differed to those 
previously reported as follows:
››  deferred income would have been £713,000 higher; 
››  goodwill would have been £608,000 higher; and
››  retained losses would be £105,000 higher.
Details of the restated fair value of the net assets acquired, purchase consideration and goodwill are as follows:

33 Prior year adjustment 
(1) the Group has adopted ifRs 3 early in order to provide a consistent approach to this and future acquisitions.
(2)   The fair value of AxisMobile Limited has been amended to reflect the stage of completion of customer installations (see note 32).
(3)  t he effect of deferred tax on the acquisition of Axismobile l imited was not accounted for in the 2008 accounts. t he Directors 
had not previously felt that the year end balance was material. this was revised on the review of the fair value position.
(4) the merger reserve has been separated from the share premium account to comply with the 2006 c ompanies Act 2006.

Balances owed to subsidiaries are shown in note 22 to the financial statements. The outstanding balances are unsecured 
and bear no interest. they are due for settlement in accordance with the Group’s normal trade terms.
sales by the subsidiaries to the c ompany were as follows:

f unds are transferred within the Group, dependent on the operational needs of individual companies. the Directors do not 
consider it meaningful to set out the gross amounts of transfers between individual companies.
35 Events after the balance sheet date
on 7 April 2010, the c ompany raised £2.0m before expenses of additional share capital. the c ompany placed 80,000,000 
ordinary shares of 1p each at a price of 2.5p per share. synchronica has entered into an equity based swap to retain much 
of the economic value of the shares issued. settlement of the swap over the next 24 months will release the credit support 
posted by the company, in addition the swap settlement will be an amount determined by reference price to the synchronica 
share price. As such a change in share price of 0.25p from the base level of 3.3333p per share will lead to a change in receipts 
from the swap of £6,250 per month. in addition the company issued 8,000,000 ordinary shares in lieu of fees for setting 
up the equity swap. in addition the company issued 8,510,204 ordinary shares in accordance with the provisions of the 
agreement to purchase the shares of Axismobile limited in 2008. 
on 21 April 2010, the c ompany raised £2,790,000 before expenses by placing 111,600,000 ordinary shares. the c ompany 
also entered into an asset purchase agreement with colibria As of norway. the assets purchased from c olibria include their 
instant messaging and presence service (imps) business (see note 36). t he assets include intellectual property rights, software, 
a patent, customer contracts, reseller contracts, consultancy contracts and shares in a filipino subsidiary. in addition c olibria 
granted a worldwide royalty free licence to synchronica in respect of certain software in addition to the software described 
above. in consideration for these assets synchronica made a payment of eur700,000 and issued of 54,054,054 ordinary 
shares initially and will issue up to 72,072,072 ordinary shares in october 2010 if all conditions are met. 58 Synchronica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

to attend, speak and vote at the meeting on a show of hands or on a poll and any adjournment(s) thereof. A member may appoint more than one proxy 
in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attaching to a different share or shares held by him/her. A proxy 
need not be a member of the company. 
2.  A form of proxy is enclosed. please read carefully the instructions on how to complete the form. f or a proxy to be effective, it must be deposited together 
with the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a notarially certified copy of such power of attorney or other authority,

the poll or, in the case of a poll to be taken less than 48 hours after it is demanded, at the time at which the poll was demanded. 
3. the appointment of a proxy does not preclude a member from subsequently attending and voting at the meeting in person if he or she so wishes.
4.  A vote withheld option has been included on the proxy form. the legal effect of choosing the vote withheld option on any resolution is that the member 
concerned will be treated not to have voted on the relevant resolution. t he number of votes in respect of which votes are withheld will however be counted 
and recorded but disregarded in calculating the votes for or against a resolution.
5.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights (a “nominated 
person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone 
else appointed) as a proxy for the meeting. if a nominated person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under 
any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
6.  the rights of shareholders set out above in relation to the appointment of proxies do not apply to nominated p ersons. such rights can only be exercised 
by shareholders of the company.
7.  copies of contracts of service and appointment of the Directors with the company or with any of its subsidiary undertakings are available for inspection 
at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours (Saturdays and public holidays excepted) and will be available for inspection at the 
place of the meeting for 30 minutes prior to and throughout the meeting.

register of members of the company as at 09.30 am on 26 July 2010 or, in the event that the meeting is adjourned, in such register 48 hours before the time 
of the adjourned meeting, shall be entitled to attend or vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at the relevant 
time. changes after the relevant time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
9.  A member of the company which is a corporation may authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) at the AGm. in accordance with the 
provisions of the companies Act 2006 (as amended by the companies (shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009), each such representative may exercise 
(on behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual member of the company, provided that they do 
not do so in relation to the same shares. it is therefore no longer necessary to nominate a designated corporate representative.
10.  pursuant to section 319A of the companies Act 2006, the company must cause to be answered at the AGm any question relating to the business being 
dealt with at the AGm which is put by a member attending the meeting, except in certain circumstances, including if it is undesirable in the interests 
of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered or if to do so would involve the disclosure of confidential information.
11.  in accordance with section 311A of the companies Act 2006, the contents of this notice of meeting, details of the total number of shares in respect 
of which members are entitled to exercise voting rights at the AGm and, if applicable, any members’ statements, members’ resolutions or members’ 
matters of business received by the company after the date of this notice will be available on the company’s website.

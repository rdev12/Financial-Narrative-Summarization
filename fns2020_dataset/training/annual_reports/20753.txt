ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Chairman’s Report
 
I am delighted to present this Annual Report to 
shareholders for the full year 2015, which was a 
highly productive period for Allied Minds . This is my 
first Annual Report as Chairman and I would start by 
extending my thanks to Mark Pritchard, the Group’s 
founder and Executive Chairman until September 
2015, for his vision in developing such a unique 
company . The culture of focusing on the successful 
commercialisation of innovation he fostered is alive 
and well in the senior leadership team .
The Board embraces its responsibility to set the 
Group’s strategic aims, ensure the senior leadership 
is in place to put them into effect, supervise 
the management of the business, and report to 
shareholders on this stewardship . We are focused 
on providing Board leadership, guidance and support to facilitate effective, entrepreneurial and prudent 
management that can deliver long-term and sustainable success for the Group and its shareholders .
The Company’s business model is to form, fund, manage and build start-up companies which undertake 
product development and commercialise innovations emerging from US universities and US federal 
government research laboratories in the life sciences and technology sectors . Our ultimate strategy is to 
build a significant and diversified group of businesses and achieve strong growth, which in turn rewards 
our shareholders . In 2015, the Board ensured that the Group was both bold in executing this strategy and 
prudent in the way it deployed capital and resources .
Board Changes
During 2015, the Board sought to ensure there was an appropriate and diverse mix of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board . In addition to my appointment as Non-Executive Chairman in June 2015, 
Rick Davis, who has served on our Board since 2011, became our Senior Independent Director in August 
2015 . The Board was further strengthened with the appointment of two new Independent Non-Executive 
Directors; Kevin Sharer in June 2015, and Jill Smith, post period end, in January 2016 .
Kevin spent more than 20 years leading Amgen, the world’s largest independent biotechnology firm, 
starting as President and Chief Operating Officer and then served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer . 
Having previously served on the Boards of Directors of Chevron Corp . and Northrop Grumman Corp ., 
Kevin is currently a faculty member at Harvard Business School, where he teaches General Management 
and other classes .
Jill has more than 25 years of experience as an international business leader, including 16 years as Chief 
Executive Officer of private and public companies in the technology and information services markets . 
Most recently, Jill served as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of DigitalGlobe Inc ., a global 
provider of satellite imagery products and services . Currently, Jill serves as an independent director on the 
Boards of Directors of Endo International plc, Hexagon and JM Huber .

Chairman’s Report (continued)
 
Incentive Alignment
The Remuneration Committee carried out a thorough review of all elements of remuneration for Executive 
Directors and senior management and considered feedback received from major shareholders and 
shareholder advisory services in 2015 . Notable revisions to the Remuneration Policy which will be put 
to a binding shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM include: annual cash incentive bonus awards shall be 
determined solely by the level of achievement against the financial, operational, technical and other 
performance targets (MBOs) set by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year; and 
100% of awards under our long term incentive plan (LTIP) shall be subject to performance conditions based 
on the Company’s relative total shareholder return (rTSR) performance as compared to broad indices 
and industry peer companies . The Board believes that the new Policy will serve to reward entrepreneurial 
milestone achievement, increased subsidiary valuation and the creation of shareholder value over time .
Our Model to Build Value
Allied Minds made significant progress in 2015, executing against its strategy to identify early-stage 
technologies and innovations from leading US research facilities, form and invest in companies with 
differentiated intellectual property rights and key scientific, engineering and management talent, and develop 
the resulting subsidiaries into potentially disruptive businesses which address large and growing markets . 
We currently have 23 subsidiary businesses at varying stages of maturity across the life sciences and 
technology sectors, the majority of which met or exceeded their key technical and operational milestones 
in 2015 .
We look to 2016 as a year of crystallising value as we attract further investments into the existing portfolio, 
welcome further partnerships with industry leaders, and continue to achieve other financial, operational and 
technical milestones . I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support and our management 
team and staff for their hard work and commitment .

Highlights
 
Strategic Report
 
Investment Highlights
During 2015, an aggregate of $102 .8 million was invested into new and existing portfolio companies, 
including:
•	 $63 .6 million from two fundraisings led by Allied Minds, with $42 .2 million coming from third-party 
investment, to further accelerate the development of two of the Group’s existing companies, SciFluor 
Life Sciences and Precision Biopsy;
  SciFluor Life Sciences, a drug discovery company developing a portfolio of best-in-class compounds 
through the strategic use of fluorine, raised $30 .0 million at a post money valuation of $130 .7 million, 
up from $37 .1 million . These funds in part are being used to accelerate its two lead compounds, a 
topical treatment for retinal diseases and a treatment for neurological diseases, into the clinic . These 
compounds are expected to result in three Investigational New Drug (IND) applications to the US 
Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 and subsequent commencement of Phase I trials .
  Precision Biopsy, a company developing early intervention technology that detects in real time 
suspicious tissue during prostate biopsy examinations, raised $33 .6 million at a post money valuation 
of $90 .4 million, up from $19 .0 million, to accelerate the commercialisation of its ClariCore™ Biopsy 
System, and develop its Focal Therapy programme . The funds support the continuation of taking 
clinical core samples to optimise the tissue classification system, as well as planned FDA clinical 
trials to support final development and regulatory approvals for the prostate market .
•	 In addition to these two fundraisings, $39 .2 million was invested by the Group into new and other 
existing portfolio companies, including investments in four new businesses: BridgeSat, ABLS I (Yale), 
HawkEye 360 and ABLS II (Harvard) .
•	 Post-period-end, on 29 January 2016, Federated Wireless raised $22 .0 million at a post money valuation 
of $82 .0 million, up from $10 .0 million previously . The raise will enable it to complete its Spectrum 
Access System (SAS) and Environmental Sensor Capability (ESC) certification process, conclude the 
development and accelerate the commercialisation of its cloud-hosted CINQ platform, and conduct field 
trials throughout 2016 and 2017 with technology partners to include Ruckus Wireless, Google, Intel, 
Qualcomm, and Nokia . Allied Minds invested $5 .0 million in this fundraising, and third-party investment 
totaled $17 .0 million .
Operational Highlights
•	 During the year, Allied Minds engaged with over 90 new research institutions, bringing the total US 
universities and federal laboratories in the Allied Minds partner network to 160, from 68 at the end of 
2014 .
•	 The investment team reviewed more than 5,000 new technologies developed by the partner network . 
Following extensive due diligence on over 20 of the most promising, the Group formed and funded four 
new businesses, resulting in a total Group portfolio of 23 subsidiary businesses at December 2015, and 
executed options to license three additional technologies .
010_c112021_5.5.indd   5 21/04/2016   13:25 Page 6 of 165
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Highlights (continued)
 
•	 The Group currently has 21 technologies in early due diligence, two technologies in final due diligence, 
and a number of opportunities in active negotiations .
•	 During 2015 and post-period, several Allied Minds businesses entered into collaborations with industry 
leaders including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Lockheed Martin, 
Google, Cisco, Ruckus Wireless, Qualcomm, Nokia and others, validating the quality of the companies’ 
platforms, people and technologies .
•	 The accelerating pace of developing new and existing companies during 2015 led to significant expansion 
in the total workforce from approximately 234 to 359 employees and consultants . The workforce 
increase was almost entirely concentrated into the operating subsidiaries, where new hires consisted 
of approximately 61% engineering and technical development professionals, 27% leadership and 
management professionals, and 12% sales, marketing and other business development professionals .
Financial Highlights
•	 Net cash and investments* of $194 .8 million, (2014: $261 .5 million)
* includes funds in form of fixed income securities
•	 Revenues of $3 .3 million, (2014: $7 .7 million) primarily reflecting revenue shortfall compared to prior year 
at RF Biocidics (RFB), which following initial regulatory approval requires certification for each individual 
installation and is extending the sales cycle and delaying revenue .
•	 Net loss of $97 .9 million, (2014: $57 .9 million) primarily reflecting an increase in the overall growth 
of the Group’s investment in research and development activities, reflecting the creation of four new 
businesses in 2015 and ramping up full scale of research and development (R&D) activities of companies 
created in late 2013 and into 2014 .
•	 The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value (GSOAV) of $535 .8 million as of 31 December 2015, 
compared to $488 .0 million at 31 December 2014, was an increase of $47 .8 million, or 9 .8% . The 
increase in 2015 is primarily attributed to the increase in value at Precision Biopsy and Federated 
Wireless demonstrated by the consummation of third-party fundraisings into such subsidiaries, offset by 
decreases in value at RF Biocidics and CryoXtract as a result of slower than anticipated sales growth, 
and the closing of SiEnergy .
•	 Share price performance: 421 .9p share price, the 30-day trailing average as at 31 December 2015, an 
increase of 32 .5% over the 318 .3p share price, the 30-day trailing average as at 31 December 2014 .
Key Subsidiary Highlights
•	 Spin Transfer Technologies (STT), a next-generation computer memory company:
  signed a co-development agreement with a major memory company; and
  successfully developed a fully functional technology demonstrator memory integrated circuit (DM1) 
to generate commercially relevant data for evaluation by potential partners and customers .

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
CEO’s Report
 
In 2015, Allied Minds made significant progress across key areas 
of the Group . With support from third-party investors, we were 
able to make substantial investments in our portfolio businesses, 
fueling their ability to achieve key development milestones . 
The considerable number of corporate collaborations further 
demonstrated the commercial progress of our subsidiaries . 
During 2015 and post-period, our businesses established 
important relationships with leading companies such as Intel, 
AMD, Lockheed Martin, Google, Cisco, Ruckus Wireless, 
Qualcomm, Nokia and many others . Our partnership with Bristol-
Myers Squibb (BMS), Allied-Bristol Life Sciences, continued to 
generate new companies focused on developing future drug 
candidates addressing large underserved medical needs . All of 
these achievements are indicative of the commercial potential 
of our subsidiary businesses and Group’s ability to create value 
from potentially disruptive, early stage technologies .
We also benefited from strong additions to the leadership team, including the appointment of new members 
to our Board of Directors, as well as the recruitment of several high-calibre advisors and the successful 
appointment of seasoned executives, scientists and engineers for our subsidiaries . We increased our 
workforce by over 53% during the year, bringing our headcount of employees and consultants to 359 . This 
increase was almost entirely concentrated into the operating subsidiaries, with the new hires being 61% 
engineers and technical developers, 27% leadership and management executives and 12% sales, marketing 
and other business development professionals . We implemented a new annual bonus attainment process, 
which we believe best aligns shareholder value creation with employee performance . More information is 
available in the Remuneration Report of this Annual Report .
Our pipeline of new technologies expanded dramatically as we grew and strengthened our relationships 
with our US research university and US federal laboratory partners . Our network more than doubled to 160 
partners from 68 partners at the end of the prior year . The investment team reviewed a record number 
of over 5,000 new technologies from our network and, following extensive due diligence on more than 
20 of the most promising, formed four new businesses, bringing the total count to 23 subsidiaries at the 
end of the year . We also executed options to license three additional technologies . The Group currently 
has 21 technologies in early due diligence, two in final due diligence and a number of opportunities in 
active negotiations . We have clearly established an industry-leading pipeline of cutting-edge technologies 
from the US research community, which we believe will result in the sustainable generation of disruptive 
businesses for years to come .
Continued Significant Investment
During 2015, Allied Minds strategically deployed $102 .8 million into new and existing businesses, which 
followed the $125 .0 million deployed last year . We made new investments in key subsidiary businesses 
including Federated Wireless, SciFluor Life Sciences, Precision Biopsy and others, to accelerate important 
activities such as commencing clinical trials, launching new products, and entering into strategic 
collaborations with leading industry participants .

Strategic Report
 
The Group continued to attract third-party investments directly into several subsidiaries, providing for the 
acceleration of their growth . These investments included a $33 .6 million financing for Precision Biopsy; a 
$30 .0 million financing for SciFluor Life Sciences; and post-period, a $22 .0 million financing for Federated 
Wireless .
We started four new subsidiary businesses based on ground-breaking government technologies, as well 
as innovative new drugs to treat diseases . These included the formation of two space-based subsidiaries, 
BridgeSat and HawkEye 360; and the licensing of life-science technologies from Harvard and Yale 
Universities, building upon our Allied-Bristol Life Sciences (ABLS) partnership with BMS .
As a result of continued significant investment and the subsidiary milestones achieved, the Group 
Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value increased by 9 .8% to $535 .8 million as of 31 December 2015, from

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Company Overview
 
Allied Minds is an innovative US-focused science and technology development and commercialisation 
company . The Group commenced operations in 2006 to invest in transformative technologies developed 
at the leading US universities . The Company’s business model is to form, fund, manage and build start-
up companies which undertake product development and commercialise innovations emerging from US 
universities and US federal government research laboratories in the life sciences and technology sectors .
Allied Minds’ strategy is to build a diversified group of businesses and achieve significant growth over 
the medium to long term through the maturation of its products through the commercialisation cycle . We 
believe the strength of the Group’s strategy is its ability to access a wide range of innovative scientific 
research and technology by leveraging its relationships with leading research institutions . In 2015, the 
Group engaged with 160 research universities and US federal government laboratories, providing it with an 
extensive pipeline of innovations from which the Group can identify technology for potential development to 
commercially viable products . In addition, Allied Minds’ business model centralises the support functions at 
the parent Company level, thereby enabling its businesses to focus efforts primarily on commercialisation 
activities whilst achieving operational and financial efficiency .
Since inception, the Group has invested significant capital and resources in its subsidiary businesses . 
The Group currently comprises of 23 subsidiary businesses in the life sciences and technology sectors 
based upon a broad range of underlying innovative technologies ranging from molecular compounds to 
memory integrated circuit technology . Allied Minds benefits from a highly skilled workforce, with valuable 
expertise throughout the Group across a range of science and technology disciplines . By leveraging this 
expertise, and through its extensive research and development activity to date, Allied Minds has established 
a significant portfolio of intellectual property to support and protect its research and innovation programme .
Allied Minds is structured as a diversified holding company with a strong central management team active 
in the strategic development of its subsidiary businesses . We believe this is a key distinguishing feature 
of the Company when compared with investment funds . Allied Minds’ core aim is to focus on early-stage 
disruptive technologies that it believes have significant upside potential and to realise that potential through 
supporting commercial development .
The Opportunity
The US is the world’s largest market for research and development (R&D) investment, with more than 
$125 billion in annual spending by the US federal government . The investment by the US federal government 
in research through the nation’s universities, federal laboratories, and non-profit institutions generates 
innovations and inventions with considerable commercial potential . These innovations and inventions result 
in thousands of US patent applications per annum . Though US universities and federal research institutions 
have an established technology transfer process designed to commercialise this intellectual property, they 
face a number of challenges . Marketing early-stage innovations to investors that often seek lower-risk, 
more mature technologies is challenging . Universities also often lack the resources necessary to adequately 
and efficiently identify the most marketable opportunities, coordinate between technology transfer offices 
and researchers to render opportunities marketable, and locate investors and entrepreneurs to license the 
invention and carry concepts forward . As a result, many universities license only a relatively small number 
of patents per year from a base of thousands, of which only a small fraction progress to the next stage of 
development .
Allied Minds was established with the objective of collaborating with universities, and subsequently, US 
federal government labs, to better identify high-potential innovations and inventions at an early stage, and

Strategic Report
 
subsequently licensing those inventions into subsidiaries formed and funded by the Company . By providing 
requisite commercial direction and management talent together with funding the product development 
activities of its businesses, we believe Allied Minds has the opportunity to be able to unlock the significant 
market potential inherent in promising technologies .
Our Strategy
Allied Minds aims to identify, develop and commercialise potentially transformative technologies . The 
Company seeks to maximise growth by creating new businesses based around proprietary and innovative 
intellectual property . Allied Minds is actively engaged in focused scientific research and product development 
within its businesses, and bringing products to significant identifiable markets . The Company’s objective is 
to build its businesses into commercially successful and valuable enterprises .
A key component of the Company’s strategy is to maintain strict capital discipline within an operationally 
efficient model for new companies while the commercial viability of the technology is explored and tested . 
The Company aims to ensure that only when there are sufficient additional proof points that the technology 
is satisfactorily de-risked and could succeed commercially, is additional scale-up capital provided . Should 
those proof points no longer support on-going commercialisation activity, a subsidiary’s business is 
terminated . As part of Allied Minds’ strategy, it is recognised that failure is an inherent but necessary 
component of early-stage investing .
In order to execute this strategy, and more broadly to ensure alignment of stakeholder interests, we believe 
that for early-stage businesses, it is important to retain initial control of projects . Accordingly, the Company 
currently maintains operating control of all of its businesses and we anticipate maintaining such control for 
as long as necessary subject to the demands and needs of each subsidiary and the overall management of 
the Company’s business . We review the development path of each business on an on-going basis and, at 
the appropriate time, it is expected that each business will look to secure strategic, commercial and capital 
partners, as appropriate, with a view to accelerate and maximise value appreciation .
The Company’s strategy is to drive each subsidiary business toward commercialisation . The development 
time of each technology can vary enormously, particularly if regulatory approvals need to be secured before 
the product can reach the market . Inherent in the commercialisation strategy is a belief that realisation 
of assets should not be attempted until significant value inflection milestones have been reached . These 
milestones are typically commercial traction and revenue generation .
The achievement of such milestones is expected to provide the Board with strategic flexibility to explore 
a range of avenues for value realisation, including initial public offerings, trade sales (in whole or in part), 
licensing arrangements and joint ventures .
Our Business Model and Approach
Since inception, Allied Minds has sought to deliver the commercial potential of selected university owned, 
early-stage intellectual property by working with technology transfer offices (TTOs) and establishing a 
structure to form, fund, manage and build start-up companies to develop innovative technologies . Allied 
Minds maintains regular contact with its university partners, which includes campus visits and interaction 
between Allied Minds staff and university technology transfer personnel and researchers . The strategic 
relationships with universities provide Allied Minds with direct access to scientific research which is 
potentially capable of developing into transformative technologies and products .

Company Overview (continued)
 
As an extension of its university model, in September 2012, Allied Minds reached agreements for first-of-
their-kind Public Private Partnerships (PPP) with several US Department of Defense laboratories and federal 
government agencies, and subsequently reached agreements with other federal government agencies such 
as the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy . Under these PPPs, the Company 
typically receives certain access and licensing rights to inventions originating from the US Department 
of Defense laboratories and other federal government agencies . We believe that these PPPs create a 
closer relationship between the Company and the respective institutions, thereby increasing the amount of 
potential deal flow available in new intellectual property for the Company .
Through these collaborative relationships with research universities and federal government laboratories, 
the Company and the corresponding research institutions work together to form, fund, manage and build 
early stage companies to commercialise US innovation .
Form
The Company’s extensive network of relationships with universities and US federal government laboratories 
provides access to the outcome of substantial research and development expenditure . In 2015, Allied 
Minds evaluated more than 5,000 potential projects from across a broad range of university and federal 
laboratories and addressing a broad range of underlying technologies . These proposals frequently 
represent the culmination of years of scientific research within university and federal government laboratory 
environments .
Using a screening and investment selection process and supported by data on technical merit, commercial 
potential and patentability, we believe Allied Minds is able to make timely and effective decisions on which 
projects merit further consideration . We believe that use of this opportunity assessment system and the 
efficiency of this process can substantially reduce transactional costs and enhance timely and effective 
decision making for the Group .
In order for a project to proceed past the first review stage, it must score highly in key technical assessment 
criteria . The starting point for this process is an assessment of the technologies that underpins the project . 
Projects are assessed on the following criteria: value proposition; disruptive technology; initial commercial 
application; addressable market; business model; potential intellectual property protection; competitive 
landscape, and regulatory path, where applicable .
Approximately 5% of those projects reviewed are typically selected for further evaluation . At this stage 
Allied Minds coordinates the involvement of sector experts, academic peers and, in certain cases, external 
advisers to perform a deeper evaluation of the scientific and commercial potential of the project . Following 
this second review stage, approximately 1% of those projects initially reviewed are selected for detailed 
due diligence . The Company’s full due diligence process involves coordination with the inventor(s) and 
institution to gain acceptance of the Allied Minds operating model as well as preparation of a detailed 
product and business development plan and budget structured around key milestones . We intend to form 
approximately five new projects per annum in the near and medium term .
After selecting a project, Allied Minds typically establishes a subsidiary that receives an exclusive license 
for the commercial rights to the underlying intellectual property . The subsidiary is usually majority owned by 
Allied Minds in either a limited liability company or incorporated structure, with the originating university and 
inventor(s) each typically receiving a minority shareholding in that entity .

Strategic Report
 
Fund
Following due diligence procedures, the subsidiary validates the core scientific principles of the intellectual 
property, and evaluates the progress and likelihood of commercial success of a technology prior to making 
any significant additional commitment to fund, develop and commercialise such technology . Following this 
initial seed funding from the Company, Allied Minds provides further incremental funding to support the 
product development activity within its subsidiaries .
Disbursement of funding and future rounds of financing for further development are often based on 
achievement of key milestones, which are designed to measure technological and commercial progress . 
Where a project has failed to deliver sufficient additional proof points, no longer supports on- going 
development and commercialisation activity, and cannot be successfully redirected to an alternative 
commercial path, Allied Minds will look to terminate the investment early .
As its businesses mature further, Allied Minds will also seek funding from third parties for such businesses 
should it be in the Group’s strategic interests to do so . Allied Minds has a track record with certain corporate 
and institutional investors which have co-invested with Allied Minds to finance its subsidiary businesses .
Manage
Allied Minds actively manages and monitors its businesses as they advance research and product 
development towards commercialisation . During the early stages, Allied Minds typically provides technical 
and executive leadership to oversee the progress of its businesses toward preliminary milestones . As those 
businesses evolve, Allied Minds contributes to the board composition of the companies and hires seasoned 
industry executives to advance the businesses towards commercialisation . We believe the Company will 
continue to attract talented executives to its businesses .
Allied Minds expects to directly control each start-up company in its early stages, and retain board seats in 
the later stages of such company’s development . Throughout this process, Allied Minds expects to provide 
strategic and other advice or retain expert advisors for the businesses, where necessary .
Build
Allied Minds applies a structured approach to building the business infrastructure that is critical to the growth 
of its businesses . In addition to providing executive leadership, Allied Minds provides sales and marketing 
research, consulting, competitive analysis, technology analysis, commercial development support, shared 
services such as payroll and IT support, and operational advice . In doing so, Allied Minds’ business model 
maintains central support functions at the parent Company level, thereby enabling its businesses to 
focus on research and product development activity whilst achieving operational and financial efficiency . 
We believe that the support provided to each of the Group’s businesses distinguishes them from many 
comparably-sized and -aged businesses in terms of availability of resources that aid in their planning and 
decision making .
Allied Minds is focused on pursuing projects with the objective of bringing commercially viable products to 
significant identifiable markets . Accordingly, we evaluate on an on-going basis the progress and potential 
of each of the Company’s businesses, and make strategy and funding decisions based on the achievement 
of key milestones . The Company sets out to identify key achievements within each subsidiary that indicate 
growth momentum such as revenue, industry partnerships, and go-to-market agreements, as a means of 
commercially validating the technology and business case .

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Subsidiary Valuation
 
The Group currently has 23 subsidiary businesses, whose activities are principally in the life sciences and 
technology sectors .
All of the Company’s subsidiary companies are currently majority owned and/or controlled and therefore 
fully consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) . As a result, the Consolidated Statements of Financial 
Position incorporated within the Company’s consolidated financial statements do not include current 
valuations of the Company’s subsidiary companies . As a means of promoting transparency, we also 
present, as supplementary information, ownership adjusted valuations of each of the Group’s top ten 
subsidiary businesses by value, as well as an aggregated sum-of-the-parts valuation of all the Group’s 
subsidiary businesses . This supplementary valuation disclosure has been prepared on the basis of the 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities 
Issued as Compensation (AICPA Guidelines) . The AICPA Guidelines do not represent, but are consistent 
with valuation principles adopted under IFRS . The subsidiary company valuations are not presented as 
alternative measures to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company’s consolidated financial 
information prepared in accordance with IFRS as set out in the Annual Report .
There can be no guarantee that the aforementioned valuation of the Group will be considered to be correct 
in light of the future performance of the various Group businesses, or that the Group would be able to realise 
proceeds in the amount of such valuations, or at all, in the event of a sale by it of any of its subsidiaries .
At the close of each annual financial period, the Directors formally approve the value of all subsidiary 
businesses in the Group which is used to derive the “Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value” . The 
Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value was $535 .8 million as at 31 December 2015, as set out in 
the table below, which has been extracted without material adjustment from the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as set out in the Annual Report . We believe there 
has been no significant change in the Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value since 31 December 
2015 .
The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value (GSOAV) of $535 .8 million as of 31 December 2015, 
compared to $488 .0 million at 31 December 2014, was an increase of $47 .8 million, or 9 .8% . The 
increase in 2015 is primarily attributed to the increase in value at Precision Biopsy and Federated Wireless 
demonstrated by the consummation of third-party fundraisings into such subsidiaries, offset by decreases 
in value at RF Biocidics and CryoXtract as a result of slower than anticipated sales growth, and the closing 
of SiEnergy .

Portfolio Review and Developments
 
For the purposes of this section, the Company’s top 10 operating businesses by estimated value, accounting 
for approximately 76% of the Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value as at 31 December 2015, have 
been identified as Material Subsidiaries .
Material Subsidiaries
Spin Transfer Technologies, Inc.
Spin Transfer Technologies, Inc . (STT) engages 
in the development of Orthogonal Spin Transfer 
(OST) Magneto-Resistive Random Access Memory 
(MRAM), an innovative memory integrated circuit 
technology . OST-MRAM aims to combine the 
advantages of high-speed volatile memory (i .e . 
DRAM and SRAM) and non-volatile memory (Flash) in 
a single memory element . OST- MRAM’s potentially 
unique combination of fast write speed, low power, 
and virtually unlimited endurance is expected to 
enable it to address a wide range of applications 
in the standalone and embedded memory markets, 
which collectively had a combined estimated value 
of greater than $60 billion per annum worldwide in 
2014 .
In 2015, the company recorded some notable 
achievements building on 2014 progress when 
the company completed integration of magnetic 
and CMOS wafer technology, raised $70 .0 million 
of new capital, and expanded the technical team 
and intellectual property portfolio . During 2015, 
STT developed a fully functional technology 
demonstrator memory integrated circuit (Diagnostic 
Memory 1), demonstrating desired functionalities 
for evaluation by potential customers and partners . 
STT also completed expansion of the company’s 
clean room, process line, and measurement and 
test capabilities to allow complete end-to-end 
fabrication with much reduced cycle time .
On 10 October 2013, Crocus Technology S .A . filed 
a petition at the US Patent Office (PTO) requesting 
that the PTO grant an inter partes review (IPR) of 
US Patent No . 6,980,469 which relates to magnetic 
devices for memory cells that can serve as non-
volatile memory . This patent is licensed by STT 
from the New York University (NYU) . The IPR is 
a form of proceeding permitted under the Leahy- 
Smith America Invents Act, which permits third 
parties to challenge the validity of issued patents . 
No damages are available in such IPR proceedings .
On 26 March 2015, the US Patent Office (PTO) 
entered a judgment on the inter partes review (IPR) 
of US Patent No . 6,980,469 and cancelled several 
claims under this single NYU patent as being invalid 
over prior art references . This judgment provides 
no legal authority and the Company believes that 
STT’s ability to develop and market its technology 
and products will not be materially impaired by this 
judgment, that the claims remaining under other 
licensed NYU patents, as well as under STT’s 
owned patents, provide substantial defense against 
other competitors who may enter the market .
Engagement with partners is very important to the 
company . In 2015, the company entered into a 
co-development agreement with one of the largest 
global data storage companies . STT also partnered 
with an Asian foundry, whereby the foundry provides 
CMOS wafers to interface with STT’s OST-MRAM 
devices, as well as jointly develop embedded 
MRAM products . Joint customer engagement is 
also envisioned with early discussions in progress .
For 2016, key targeted milestones include the further 
development of the STT technology incorporating 
perpendicular MTJ structures into its devices and 
the establishment of additional partnerships and 
potential early customer relationships .
SciFluor Life Sciences, Inc.
SciFluor Life Sciences, Inc . (SciFluor) aims to develop 
a best-in-class portfolio of compounds through the 
strategic use of fluorine . It engages in drug discovery 
and development and is building a portfolio of 
proprietary fluorinated compounds seeking to serve 
various billion dollar markets . Fluorine modification 
of the underlying chemical structure of a drug has 
been demonstrated to improve potency, selectivity,

rates of absorption, metabolic stability, and half-life . 
These factors all improve the drug and positively 
impact delivery, dosing, side effects and more . 
As such, approximately 25% of drugs currently 
marketed or in the pipeline contain fluorine . 
SciFluor’s principal products are based on two 
patented lead compounds:
•	 SF0166, a patented small molecule integrin 
antagonist wholly owned by SciFluor and 
intended to treat eye conditions including age-
related macular degeneration, diabetic macular 
edema and retinal vein occlusion, representing 
an estimated 50 million patients worldwide . 
SF0166 is a topical drug to be delivered via eye 
drops and is intended to replace drugs requiring 
repeated injection into the eye .
•	 SF0034, a KCNQ2/3 modulator and a 
fluorinated derivative of ezogabine, is also 
patented and is wholly owned by SciFluor . It 
is a potent potassium channel activator and 
in effect it electrically stabilises neurons by 
opening their potassium channels . SF0034 
could eliminate key safety issues associated 
with ezogabine including urinary retention, 
cardiac interactions, pigmentation problems 
which could lead to blindness, and dosing . It 
could potentially serve markets totalling $5 .0 
billion in aggregate including: epilepsy/seizures; 
tinnitus; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or 
Lou Gehrig’s disease); and channelopathies 
(genetic orphan rare diseases) .
In April 2015, SciFluor raised $30 .0 million in a 
Series A preferred stock financing at a pre-money 
valuation of $100 million to progress development of 
its two lead compounds and to expand its portfolio . 
By the end of 2015, the company had advanced the 
pre-clinical development of SF0166 and SF0034 
and completed pre-IND meetings with the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) to agree on the 
data needed to support clinical studies, which are 
now planned to start in mid-2016 . Additionally, the 
company intends to execute pre-clinical tests on its 
existing pipeline compounds in fibrosis, immuno-
oncology, and pain therapy . SciFluor also intends 
to continue to pursue patent protection for its 
compounds in various select global markets and to 
evaluate the potential for partnerships with a variety 
of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies .
Precision Biopsy, Inc.
Precision Biopsy, Inc . (Precision Biopsy) is 
developing ClariCore™, a next generation prostate 
cancer biopsy medical device system, as well a focal 
therapy ablation system to treat prostate cancer 
patients using ClariCore as the targeting system . 
The aim of the ClariCore system is to provide the 
capability to analyse prostate tissue in real-time 
for signs of cancer during the biopsy procedure, 
thereby minimising unnecessary tissue biopsies 
as well as the associated pathology costs . Current 
biopsy procedures require random or ‘‘blind’’ 
sampling, and often multiple and repeated biopsies 
per procedure . The Precision Biopsy system is 
intended to be used within the typical biopsy 
procedure and the company aims to develop a 
system along with a disposable needle biopsy unit, 
creating a capital equipment and recurring revenue 
model . It is estimated that in the US alone, 1 million 
men undergo a needle biopsy procedure each year .
In October 2015, Precision Biopsy raised $33 .6 
million to accelerate the commercialisation of 
its ClariCore™ Biopsy System, and develop its 
Focal Therapy programme . The funds support 
the continuation of taking clinical core samples 
to optimise the tissue classification system, as 
well as planned FDA clinical trials to support final 
development and regulatory approvals for the 
prostate market .
In 2015, Precision Biopsy completed its product 
development and verification and validation 
testing of its ClariCore™ system . The company 
successfully initiated a clinical trial of the system by 
enrolling patients . Precision Biopsy also submitted 
the IDE (investigational device exemption) of the 
ClariCore system to the FDA in the first quarter of 
2016 . The current US regulatory strategy includes 
two separate clinical trials and submissions to

support commercialisation and intended approvals 
based on the indications for use . Precision Biopsy 
intends to complete its first clinical trial in 2016 and 
submit the results to the FDA . A second clinical trial 
initiation is planned for early 2017 and those trial 
results are expected to support commercial release 
and system launch in the US and EU .
In 2016, Precision Biopsy also initiated definition 
and development of its focal therapy program 
where the identified/diagnosed cancer tissue within 
the prostate is expected to be ablated in the same 
procedure using ClariCore to target the suspicious 
tissue . If this program is successful, the company’s 
objective is to replace the majority of invasive radical 
prostatectomy procedures with targeted minimally 
invasive focal therapy .
Federated Wireless, Inc.
Federated Wireless, Inc . (Federated Wireless) 
provides innovative cloud-based wireless 
infrastructure solutions to extend the access 
of carrier networks through sharing of wireless 
spectrum amongst multiple tiers of users . As 
discussed below, significant bands of wireless 
spectrum have traditionally been allocated strictly for 
government use despite actually needing or utilising 
that spectrum a small fraction of time . Federated 
Wireless has developed a dynamic Spectrum 
Access System (SAS) that could revolutionise the 
way in which spectrum is allocated, managed, and 
optimized . The company’s innovative approach 
incorporates a neural network of radio sensors 
allowing interference free access to low-cost, 
high-quality, licensed spectrum while meeting 
the required exclusion periods required by US 
government users . Spectrum sharing capability 
is intended to be a core building block of next 
generation wireless systems, sometimes called 
5G . In effect, the company intends for its spectrum 
sharing capabilities to provide ubiquitous, high-
quality spectrum with the ease of implementation 
and low cost of Wi-Fi .
In April 2015, the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) approved the formal Rule & 
Order governing the dynamic sharing of federal 
spectrum in the 3 .5 GHz band, thereby ensuring 
the necessary regulatory authority for Federated 
Wireless to go to market with its proprietary SAS . 
Federated Wireless has been very active in its 
relationship with the FCC since the company’s 
inception and has been instrumental in determining 
the standards for commercial use of the band . 
Between that relationship and the company’s 
involvement in the industry working group, Wireless 
Innovation Forum (WInnForum), Federated Wireless 
has emerged as a leading voice in developing 
the standards for a shared spectrum model . In 
September 2015, the company announced a 
partnership with the US Government entity, The 
National Advanced Spectrum and Communications 
Test Network (NASCTN) to conduct the first pilot 
test of an Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) 
for the SAS . Federated Wireless also launched its 
first product, CINQ XP, which allows carriers to 
access shared spectrum and unlock the value of 
the 3 .5 GHz band .
Post-period-end in January 2016, Federated 
Wireless raised a $22 .0 million Series A preferred 
stock financing round representing an attractive 
increase in the value of the company . In February, 
the company announced an alliance with five other 
wireless industry leaders to develop, promote, 
and market solutions in the 3 .5 GHz band . The 
other companies in the alliance are: Google, Intel, 
Qualcomm Incorporated, Nokia, and Ruckus 
Wireless . Federated Wireless is working with these 
companies and others in developing plans for pilot 
tests and field trials of the solution that are expected 
to begin in the second half of 2016 . Additionally, 
Federated Wireless continues to work with the FCC 
and other government agencies on certification of 
the company’s SAS and sensors as they prepare 
the 3 .5 GHz band for commercial usage .

solutions using radio frequency (RF) technology . 
RF Biocidics operates in the area of disinfection 
and disinfestation of agricultural products, against 
pathogens, pests and fungi in a variety of food 
commodities . Today, RF Biocidics’ addressable 
market includes the dried fruit, tree nut and seed/
grain markets representing an estimated 500 million 
metric tonnes (MMt), in aggregate, globally per 
annum . The company currently has two lines of RF 
processing equipment:
•	 The SENTINEL line uses high frequency RF to 
process high moisture products, such as prunes 
and raisins .
•	 The APEX line uses low frequency RF to process 
lower moisture products, such as nuts, grains, 
seeds and flours .
Fiscal year 2015 represented a disappointing year 
for the company as sales declined from 2014 . 
There are a number of potential factors behind this 
decline and foremost among them we believe has 
been the introduction of the new Generation IV 
Apex machine and delays in receiving key industry 
regulatory approvals . Reflecting the uncertainties 
around sales growth, as highlighted elsewhere, the 
valuation for the company declined by 42 .5% .
Allied Minds remains optimistic about the long-
term future for the food safety and treatment 
sector . Many of the drivers remain strongly in place 
including: repeated recalls of target commodities; 
high cost and reputation damage from a recall; 
potential prison time for executives involved in 
recalls; consumer desire for organic food products 
including avoidance of toxic chemicals; regulation 
banning or limiting use of chemicals such as methyl 
bromide; and, government demands for improved 
food safety (e .g ., Food Safety Modernization Act in 
the US) .
In 2015, the company’s APEX machine received 
regulatory approval for use in the roasting of 
almonds . This validation was completed by the 
Almond Board of California Technical Expert 
Review Panel whose decision confirmed third-
party tests that showed RF Biocidics’ chemical-free 
process effectively eliminates pathogens including 
Salmonella from almonds, ensuring their safety . 
The company continues to pursue other required 
approvals as certification is required for each 
individual installation and is attempting to streamline 
the process for regulatory approval .
A high level of interest and some early orders point 
to at least modest improvement in 2016 at the 
revenue level . We expect adoption to accelerate 
over time . Key targets for 2016 include extension 
in the number of treated commodities, achievement 
of further regulatory approvals for pasteurisation of 
raw almonds, and expansion of sales revenues and 
financial performance of the company .
Optio Labs, Inc.
Optio Labs, Inc . (Optio) is a cybersecurity company 
focused on creating unique sensor technologies 
to recognise and protect against malware and 
taking the outputs of the sensor’s findings into 
Optio’s cloud-based Insight Platform . The sensor 
technology combines Optio’s original product 
OptioCore™, which is embedded on mobile devices 
and provides user based controls and malware 
blocking, with its newer product, PrivateEye™, 
which provides for insider threat detection securing 
the last two feet of the network . PrivateEye joined 
Optio’s product suite through the company’s April 
2015 acquisition of Oculis Labs . The joint offering 
combined with Optio’s new server technology will 
provide enterprise and government customers 
with a unique cross domain view of the mobile and 
computer network environment . Optio’s platform will 
be able to discover distinctive malicious behaviour 
and alert and thwart these actions quickly .
The team at Optio expanded over the course of the 
fiscal year to approximately 30 people, including 
the addition of industry veterans experienced in 
North American and international sales, product 
management, research and engineering to its 
management team . Other changes in 2015 included 
the launch of the company’s services business to 
assist in the sales and marketing of its products,

Portfolio Review and Developments (continued)
 
and the closure of the Kodomo™ product which no 
longer met Optio’s business model .
Over the course of 2015, the engineering team 
concentrated on bringing OptioCore version 2 .0 to 
market . While OptioCore was originally built as a 
toolkit, the engineering team has produced a much 
more comprehensive updated version that is fully 
integrated with the newest versions of Android, 
which remains by far the single most attacked 
mobile operating system . With those tasks nearly 
complete, the business development team has 
successfully created relationships with additional 
handset vendors, including ruggedised handset 
vendor Sonim .
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) selected Optio Labs’ 
PrivateEye as a key security partner for release of its 
new chipset . In connection with such partnership, 
AMD is assisting Optio to market PrivateEye to the 
computer and laptop manufacturers .
The profile of Optio Labs has grown throughout 
the year as well . The company was awarded two 
prestigious product awards at the leading trade 
show RSA in March 2016, for both OptioCore and 
PrivateEye . Optio’s products were also featured 
in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Network 
World and Security Week, in addition to Optio’s 
management being featured on both television and 
radio . Additionally, Optio Labs has been issued two 
new patents .
In the coming year Optio Labs will focus on further 
product development, global market expansion, 
business development deals with handset 
manufacturers, and achieving direct sales to the 
government and enterprises .

Cephalogics, LLC (Cephalogics) is developing a 
non-invasive bedside neuroimaging system which 
it intends to commercialise . The primary target 
market is stroke victims . The Cephalogics system 
aims to provide continuous data and imaging from 
clinically relevant cerebrovascular regions to allow 
clinicians at the bedside or in emergent conditions 
to quickly identify perfusion deficits and enable early 
interventions to avoid ischemia and associated 
adverse outcomes . Cephalogics estimates that 
bringing its non-invasive neuro monitoring and 
imaging system to the bedside potentially represents 
over a $1 .0 billion market opportunity .
During 2015, the company successfully completed 
its third generation system . This commercial 
prototype went through initial bench top testing and 
achieved all technical performance targets . As a 
result, the company initiated bench top studies on 
blood phantoms, animal studies at Tufts University 
Animal Lab, and lab studies on healthy human 
subjects . Preparations for patient studies at Duke 
University and Tufts University were also initiated . 
The results from these multiple testing environments 
are being used to demonstrate performance, to 
generate publications, and to justify commercial 
system build . Initial results from the blood phantom 
studies and healthy human studies were the basis 
for submitted abstracts to the Optical Society of 
America and the Human Brain Mapping Society . 
Both were accepted for presentation at their 
respective 2016 conferences .
Cephalogics’s focus for 2016 is to continue to 
demonstrate the strong performance of its third 
generation system in multiple environments focusing 
primarily on patient studies, as well continue its 
Algorithm development and testing . The company 
will initiate business development activities aimed 
at fueling commercial system build, testing, and 
submissions for an anticipated 510(k) submission .
ProGDerm, Inc., d/b/a Novare Pharmaceuticals
ProGDerm, Inc ., d/b/a Novare Pharmaceuticals 
(Novare) holds the exclusive license rights 
to a technology that represents a potentially 
revolutionary breakthrough in tissue engineering 
and disease control – based on the observation 
by Dr . Eva Turley (founder) that blocking RHAMM

Strategic Report
 
We believe that Novare is the only biotechnology 
company that is dedicated to treating catastrophic 
disease by using RHAMM-based cellular responses 
to aid the body’s natural regenerative processes . 
Novare is positioned to provide novel therapies 
to multiple, billion dollar markets that range from 
promoting women’s health and post-mastectomy 
breast regeneration, to reducing pain and joint 
damage in crippling arthritis, to aesthetics and to 
preventing life-threatening lung damage in infants 
with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) and adults 
with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) .
Through the licensing of additional RHAMM 
compounds (developed by RHAMM pioneers, 
Dr . Turley and Dr . Luyt) as first-in-class therapeutics 
for inflammatory conditions, the company’s focus 
has been expanded beyond the original target 
market of cosmetics and aesthetics . In 2015, the 
company began to optimise peptide targets for 
the new indications highlighted above . Potential 
drug candidates have now been synthesised and 
characterised in a variety of in-vitro tests, as well as 
limited animal studies . Novare is aiming to identify 
lead compounds in 2016 to perform subsequent 
toxicity and formulation testing with the intention 
of advancing them into the clinic in the future . In 
2016 and beyond, Novare intends to conduct 
further enabling animal studies with its lead drug 
candidates and will continue to expand the patent 
portfolio in support of these advancements .

proprietary automated solutions to the global 
medical research community that preserve the 
integrity of frozen biospecimens that advance 
life science R&D . The company’s commercial 
automated solutions enable repeated and safe 
frozen biospecimen sampling (aliquotting) from 
frozen tissue, biofluids and other unique, high-
value biospecimens – eliminating their potential 
degradation due to thawing, maximising biosample 
integrity, and optimising scientific outcomes . 
CryoXtract’s products support various critical 
applications in genomics, proteomics, human 
gut microbiome research, research pathology, 
analytical chemistry and QA/QC . They are intended 
for use in scientific research and advancement and 
are not intended for Human Diagnostic Purposes; 
as such, they are not regulated as medical devices . 
The company’s commercial solutions are marketed 
and sold, and have been adopted, both in and 
outside the US .
CryoXtract has developed two principal products 
to date, which the company believes are the only 
automated frozen sample aliquotting solutions:
•	 The CXT 750 Automated Frozen Sample 
Aliquotter, a fully-automated instrument directed 
at large-scale automated access to frozen 
biofluids and feces .
•	 The CXT 350 Frozen Sample Aliquotter, a semi-
automated, bench-top solution for the frozen 
aliquotting of a wide range of sample types, 
including tissue, feces, serum, plasma, whole 
blood, urine, cells, bone, and other specifically 
designed to service a lower volume lab or 
biobank .
In 2015, the company focused on sales and 
expanding its installed base of units . For the year 
ending 31 December 2015, CryoXtract recorded 
a 32% increase in revenue from the prior year, 
resulting in a cumulative base of 37 CryoXtract 
instruments sold or installed in 16 countries in 
North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific . Notably, 
orders for the Company’s CXT 35X models have 
grown by more than 2x year-on-year from the 
platform’s introduction at the end of 2013 . Despite 
these advances, sales growth has been slower than 
expected thus pushing out the time to profitability 
and positive cash flow . This has been reflected 
in the decline of the company’s valuation as of 
31 December 2015 .
The company also expanded its geographic reach 
with new distributors in Germany/Switzerland, Korea 
and Singapore . A Japanese distributor was added 
in 2016 . Scientific data supporting the company’s

on devices including cardiac and neuromodulation 
catheters, implants, and wearables, as well as for 
other markets . The company’s technology seeks 
to address key limitations faced by the medical 
device industry including foreign body reactions, 
surgical invasiveness, miniaturisation, signal quality, 
precious metal use, and long-term electrical 
performance in vivo . In 2015, the company’s leading 
commercial product, the Amplicoat™ electrode 
coating, was licensed to Acutus Medical for their 
cardiac EP mapping catheter . The coating materials 
are produced in Biotectix’ ISO 13485-compliant 
facility . In 2015, Biotectix had three US patents 
and one European patent granted . These patents 
serve to further protect and improve on Biotectix’ 
key technologies . In 2016, the company plans to 
continue to enhance its product offerings, and 
importantly, to pursue further customer applications, 
contracts and licenses .
Other Subsidiaries
Allied-Bristol Life Sciences, LLC
Allied-Bristol Life Sciences, LLC (ABLS) is a 
drug discovery and development company 
created in August 2014 through a partnership 
between Allied Minds and Bristol-Myers Squibb 
(BMS) . The company’s mission is to create novel 
drug candidates against serious diseases with 
large market potential . These include fibrosis, 
cardiovascular, immunescience, immuno-oncology, 
oncology, and genetically-defined diseases . The 
focus on these diseases aligns, by design, with the 
strategy of BMS . It is intended that up to 10 scientific 
discoveries and innovative breakthroughs will be 
sourced from US universities, and a new subsidiary 
will be formed around each of these programs .
This partnership provides Allied Minds with a 
seasoned large pharmaceutical partner as well 
a natural early stage (pre-clinical) acquirer of 
developing assets . It provides BMS access 
to Allied Minds’ broad university network and 
experienced licensing practices and provides a 
capital disciplined, structured format through which 
early university breakthrough research can be 
advanced into the formal drug discovery process 
at BMS . This partnership is structured to potentially 
reduce risk for both partners since it is intended to 
drive exits of early stage pre-clinical candidates to 
BMS prior to clinical trials and human testing . Both 
parties intend to agree on development milestones 
for each subsidiary program prior to launching any 
given subsidiary and, upon successful achievement 
of such milestones, it is anticipated that BMS would 
acquire the subsidiary or asset . We believe that this 
model of upfront agreement on exits based on pre-
clinically achieved milestones and pre-determined 
exit terms could be highly beneficial to Allied Minds’ 
shareholders .
The company is very active in sourcing new 
opportunities and reviewed more than 900 
technologies in 2015 . As of this date, three 
subsidiaries have been launched as described 
below . Pre-clinical work on these three programs 
is underway in collaboration with BMS at its R&D 
Site in India, called Biocon-BMS Research Center 
(BBRC) .

named Antibody Recruiting Molecules (ARMs) . 
ARMs use the body’s own immunity to target 
various cancers by attaching to a given cancer and 
then attracting the body’s innate antibodies to the 
ARM to destroy the target; ABLS I is developing 
ARM against prostate cancer . The company has 
synthesised multiple different types of ARMs which 
are currently being evaluated for their safety and 
efficacy in various prostate pre-clinical cancer 
models .
ABLS II, LLC
ABLS II is a company undertaking the preclinical 
discovery and development of molecules against a 
novel target (Prolyl tRNA Synthetase) for treatment 
of fibrotic diseases . Harvard University researchers 
had earlier identified the mechanism of halofuginone 
(a natural product with anti-fibrotic properties) as 
an inhibitor of Prolyl tRNA Synthetase . ABLS II’s 
objective is to discover and develop halofuginone 
analogues with novel IP, better safety and superior 
efficacy . ABLS II has synthesised various molecules 
and is evaluating them for safety and efficacy .
ABLS III, LLC, d/b/a ißeCa Therapeutics
ißeCa Therapeutics is a newly formed subsidiary 
in 2016 with IP licenced from New York University 
(NYU) School of Medicine . NYU researchers have 
identified novel inhibitors of nuclear beta catenin, a 
key player in the Wnt signaling pathway and a major 
driver of various cancers . These molecules are 
targeted specifically against nuclear beta catenin 
(vs cytoplasmic) with potentially better safety and 
efficacy . The company’s objective is to develop 
molecules with improved potency, efficacy and 
better pharmaceutical properties .
Allied Minds Federal Innovations, Inc.
Allied Minds Federal Innovations, Inc . (AMFI) 
was created as a vehicle designed specifically to 
commercialise US federal laboratory inventions, 
via a series of public private partnerships (PPP) 
with a number of US federal research institutions . 
The company represents the first and most 
comprehensive PPP formed between the US 
Department of Defence and a US technology 
commercialisation firm dedicated to bringing 
government inventions to market . The company has 
developed formal relationships with partner labs, 
providing the company with thousands of pieces of 
Intellectual Property per year for commercialisation 
evaluation . Since inception, six companies have 
been created from federally sourced intellectual 
property, including: BridgeSat, Inc .; Federated 
Wireless, Inc .; Foreland Technologies, Inc .; 
Whitewood Encryption Systems, Inc .; HawkEye 
360, Inc .; and Percipient Networks, LLC .
BridgeSat, Inc.
BridgeSat, Inc . (BridgeSat) was formed in February 
2015 to commercialise space-based optical 
communications technologies developed at partner 
Federally Funded Research and Development 
Centre, The Aerospace Corporation under the 
NASA Ames Optical Communications and Sensor 
Demonstration (OCSD) mission . The resulting 
portfolio of technologies that has been licenced, 
or optioned to licence to BridgeSat, encompass 
intellectual property from Aerospace’s small satellite 
efforts and select technologies from Cambridge, 
Massachusetts-based Draper Labs .
BridgeSat is developing an optical connectivity 
system that aims to increase the speed, security 
and efficiency of data transmissions from Low Earth 
Orbit (LEO) satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, 
and remote terrestrial infrastructure at a reduced 
cost and amplified speed (ultimately up to 10 
Gbps) compared with traditional radio frequency 
(RF) solutions . Demand for accurate and frequent 
data collection from LEO satellites is expected to 
accelerate aggressively over the next decade amidst 
declining costs for building and launching satellites . 
Traditional RF communications are constrained 
by limited spectrum, lower bandwidth, and large 
transmitter payloads, and by the bureaucratic 
process of securing the RF spectrum from relevant 
industry regulatory bodies .
In the near term, BridgeSat intends to deploy an 
optical communications downlink payload and an 
associated global network of ground stations to

fully demonstrate its advantages in volume, mass, 
power, and bandwidth .
Foreland Technologies, Inc.
Foreland Technologies, Inc . (Foreland) was created 
as a platform company for the discovery, incubation 
and commercialisation of cyber security related 
intellectual property, leveraging AMFI’s access to 
technical innovation within Allied Minds’ university 
and federal research institution partner network and 
the platform’s competitive advantages in agility and 
speed in incubating new cyber capabilities . The 
company focuses on large scale data management; 
cybersecurity including active defence; cloud 
computing, and secure data storage, among others .
To date, Foreland has created two subsidiaries, 
Percipient Networks, LLC which is commercialising 
intellectual property from The MITRE Corporation, 
and Whitewood Encryption Systems, Inc ., which 
is commercialising intellectual property from 
Los Alamos National Laboratories . Foreland 
Technologies is currently evaluating several core 
technologies in due diligence to become the basis of 
new Foreland subsidiaries; these core technologies 
include those sourced from Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology Lincoln Laboratory, Draper Labs, 
and MITRE .
HawkEye 360, Inc.
HawkEye 360, Inc . (HawkEye 360), formed in 
September 2015, is developing a constellation of 
formation-flying small satellites in Low Earth Orbit 
(LEO) to execute a space-based radio frequency (RF) 
spectrum monitoring and geolocation capability . 
The company’s proprietary processing and analytics 
engine generates reports on signals that can be 
used to track and monitor global transportation 
networks, detect distress alerts, support US and 
allied nations’ government missions, and assist with 
emergencies . HawkEye 360 aims to provide highly 
accurate maritime domain awareness for federal 
and commercial customers, establish a national 
and international spectrum inventory for commercial 
carriers and wireless regulators, and develop insight 
into how signals are being used globally .
Initially, HawkEye 360 intends to develop terrestrial 
and airborne demonstrations of its capabilities, with 
a space-based “pathfinder cluster” demonstration 
scheduled for 2017 . Beyond the demonstrations, 
the company’s first satellite constellation is planned 
to include eighteen spacecraft with global coverage 
for RF monitoring and data analytics .
LuxCath, LLC
LuxCath, LLC (LuxCath) is developing a catheter-
based real-time visualisation technology for use 
during cardiac ablation procedures to optimise 
today’s arrhythmia ablation procedures . LuxCath 
is primarily focused on atrial fibrillation ablation 
as this is by far the largest and most challenging 
arrhythmia market, although its technology is 
applicable to all cardiac ablation procedures . 
LuxCath seeks to significantly improve the speed of 
ablation procedures and to optimise outcomes . Its 
technology is capable of identifying tissue that has not 
been properly ablated and which can subsequently 
cause arrhythmia recurrences . The technology has 
been proven to identify and distinguish viable from 
ablated cardiac tissue in preclinical tests and has 
also been tested in human ablation cases with 100% 
success and no complications in December 2015 
by Drs . Vivek Reddy and Petr Neuzil in Prague . It 
has been used to monitor the progression of lesion 
formation as well as to determine the presence and 
quality of catheter-tissue contact in both preclinical 
and clinical testing . The company has two issued 
patents and an expanding portfolio of global patent 
applications . 
These accomplishments have been performed 
both with standalone LuxCath devices as well as 
through the integration of LuxCath technology into 
an existing FDA approved ablation catheter . Various 
results from preclinical and clinical tests were 
published and presented at the Atrial Fribrillation 
Symposium in Orlando in January 2016 .
Percipient Networks, LLC

Strategic Report
 
The company uses automated threat interdiction 
capabilities, advanced remediation techniques, and 
shared intelligence platforms as the foundational 
building blocks upon which the company is 
developing its solution for business network 
defence . The core technology underlying Percipient 
was sourced from The MITRE Corporation .
The company’s flagship product Strongarm™ 
was developed recognising that despite significant 
effort to stop malware from getting onto a firm’s 
network, there appears to be an increasing amount 
of malware getting through these defenses . Often, 
it goes unrecognised for extended periods of 
time threatening loss and/or damage to sensitive 
customer information and valuable intellectual 
property . Strongarm’s approach is based on 
monitoring outbound communications and 
“blackholing” traffic to known bad sites . Strongarm 
is cloud based and can be implemented without 
the need for enterprise-sized IT staff or security 
budgets .
Although formal launch of the product occurred in 
April 2016, Percipient completed its first commercial 
contracts in 2015 and thousands of end users 
are currently protected by Strongarm . In 2016, 
Percipient will continue to expand the capabilities 
of Strongarm and has begun the process of 
curating its own Threat Intelligence to help combat 
specific malware associated with Ransomware and 
other advanced attacks . The company will also 
aggressively pursue new sales .
Seamless Devices, Inc.
Seamless Devices, Inc . (Seamless) is a mixed 
signal IP (intellectual property) company based in 
San Jose, California, developing analog front end 
(AFE) solutions used in high performance wireless 
connectivity applications . Utilising a novel approach 
to analog signal processing and embodied in its 
Switched-Mode Operational Amplifier (SMOA), the 
Seamless technology aims to simplify production of 
high-performance devices even as transistors are 
scaled down to deep sub-micron scales .
In October 2015, the company successfully provided 
its design (“taped out”) to TSMC, one of the largest 
semiconductor foundries in the world, for two high 
performance analog to digital converters utilising 
our core SMOA technology at 28nm . The design 
was a 14-bit continuous time delta-sigma ADC with 
40 and 80 MHz of bandwidth powered completely 
using a single core voltage supply of 0 .9V . The chip 
returned from the TSMC in early 2016 and initial 
characterisation tests showed the ADC has very 
high jitter tolerance (>4 picoseconds) and dynamic 
range (>70dB) using only half the power of other 
chips . These are potentially very advantageous 
characteristics and the company is now in contact 
with potential customers in the US, Europe, and 
Asia as part of its initial marketing efforts .
Key milestones for 2016 include pursuing 
partnerships as well as approaching potential 
customers about integrating our designs into their 
systems, and expansion of our AFE components 
portfolio to appeal to a wider segment of the market .
SoundCure, Inc. and Tinnitus Treatment 
Solutions, Inc.
SoundCure, Inc . (SoundCure) is a consumer medical 
device company with a core technology based 
on neuroscience used to treat tinnitus through 
its acoustic therapy, branded as S-Tones™ . 
S-Tones are temporally patterned sounds which 
are customised specifically for each patient’s 
unique tinnitus, generating neural activity which can 
suppress tinnitus .
SoundCure’s first product is an FDA 510(k) cleared 
and CE Marked medical device in a handheld 
configuration called Serenade™ incorporating 
customised tracks of sound therapy including 
S-Tones . An estimated 50 million Americans 
experience tinnitus to some degree . Nearly a third of 
this number seek medical advice and approximately 
two million Americans experience tinnitus as a life-
altering, disabling condition .
In January 2015, SoundCure submitted its 510(k) 
application to the FDA for remote programing of the

Portfolio Review and Developments (continued)
 
SoundCure Serenade and in April 2015 SoundCure 
received FDA clearance for this telemedicine device 
programing via the internet in the patient’s home . 
To the company’s knowledge, this is the first 
FDA clearance for a tinnitus therapy device to be 
programed via telemedicine . This would represent a 
unique tinnitus care tool for telemedicine providers 
such as Tinnitus Treatment Solutions (TTS), and 
potentially the US Veterans Administration (VA) – 
tinnitus is the #1 service related disability and many 
servicemen look to the VA for therapies during 
and upon return from duty . Additional milestones 
achieved include the issuance of new patents in 
Canada and Europe for S-Tones .
Sales growth has been nominal to date . After 
launch, it became clear that a much bigger market 
opportunity potentially exists in addressing the “gap 
in care” between the millions of suffering patients 
and the relatively small number of tinnitus providers . 
Thus, the focus for 2015 and going forward in 
2016 is on market development primarily through 
SoundCure’s telemedicine sister company, TTS, to 
address this gap in care .
TTS is focused on becoming the number one 
(online) tinnitus therapy source and the number 
one nationwide provider of tinnitus treatment . 
TTS is a cutting-edge telemedicine tinnitus health 
care provider that offers and sells a full range of 
tinnitus hearing aids from all the “Big 6” hearing 
aid manufacturers, the Serenade device, and 
tinnitus accessories . To date, supply agreements 
have been completed with Oticon, Starkey, Widex, 
Resound, Phonak and Siemens (note that 80% of 
tinnitus sufferers also have concomitant hearing 
loss) . TTS has tinnitus expert audiologists providing 
care conveniently through its telemedicine channel 
via a full range of tinnitus therapies and devices .
Of critical importance to TTS in 2016 and beyond 
is the development of go-to-market partnerships 
including referral of patients to TTS . In 2015, TTS 
partnered with Your Hearing Network, a subsidiary 
of hearing aid company William Demant Group 
(Oticon), and in 2016 TTS announced a partnership 
with HearUSA and AARP . TTS is the exclusive 
tinnitus care partner for the AARP Hearing Care 
Program . With these partnerships, TTS has created 
what it believes is the USA’s largest tinnitus care 
affiliated network with over 4000+ providers . In the 
first quarter of 2016, TTS also launched its services 
in Canada .
Whitewood Encryption Systems, Inc.
Whitewood Encryption Systems (Whitewood) seeks 
to address one of the most fundamental challenges 
associated with all modern cryptosystems – random 
number generation — utilising advanced quantum 
cryptography technologies originating from Los 
Alamos National Lab (LANL) . Whitewood enables 
its customers to take control of the generation of 
random numbers across their entire application 
infrastructure . Without true randomness as is the 
case with most random number generators today, 
applications that rely on cryptography suffer from 
degraded security . This is critical as the use of 
random numbers in computer systems has become 
so prolific and fundamental .
 Whitewood addresses two important challenges 
– generating true random numbers at scale, and 
making those random numbers accessible to large 
populations of applications and devices across the 
data, the cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT) . 
The company launched its first product in August 
2015 . The Entropy Engine ™ is a hardware random 
number generator that employs technology originally 
invented at Los Alamos National Laboratory to 
exploit the fundamental properties of quantum 
mechanics to generate a truly random signal that is 
digitised to create true random numbers .
Whitewood extended its product portfolio in March 
2016 with the launch of the netRandom solution . 
This product enables random numbers to be 
generated as a shared resource and delivered over 
a network (cloud) to applications and devices on-
demand . Also in 2016, the company announced 
two partnerships: the first with WolfSSL to provide 
access to high-quality true random numbers for 
large-scale security applications across embedded,

machine-to-machine (M2M), and Internet of Things 
(IoT) systems; and, the second with CryptSoft to 
deliver high-performance quantum based security 
to enterprise key management security systems . 
Whitewood will spend the balance of 2016 
enhancing its product portfolio and pursuing further 
go-to-market opportunities .
Discontinued Subsidiaries
Consistent with the Allied Minds’ model, where a 
project has failed to deliver sufficient additional 
proof points for ultimate commercialisation and 
financial return, and no longer supports on-going 
development and commercialisation activity, and 
cannot be successfully redirected to an alternative 
commercial path, Allied Minds will look to cease 
operations and terminate the project .
SiEnergy Systems, LLC
In 2016, Allied Minds ceased operations at its 
subsidiary SiEnergy Systems, LLC (SiEnergy) . The 
company was formed to develop thin film Solid 
Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) technology . The technology 
aimed to use silicon-based microfabrication and 
nanometer scale electrolytes to create SOFCs 
that would operate at a commercially desirable 
temperature and be scalable to meet various power 
requirements . Allied Minds determined that the 
technology would not meet key milestones which 
were designed to measure technological and 
commercial progress within a reasonable timeframe 
and within a reasonable budget, and that the 
market for clean energy alternatives continued to 
be potentially adversely impacted by the low cost of 
traditional energy sources .

Financial Review
 
The financial results of the year reflect the Group’s sustainable model of deploying patient capital into 
our continuously growing portfolio of Group controlled businesses at the right pace . During 2015, 
$102 .8 million was invested into new and existing portfolio companies . This included $63 .6 million from two 
fundraisings led by Allied Minds, with $42 .2 million coming from third-party investment, to further accelerate 
the development of two of the Group’s existing companies, SciFluor Life Sciences and Precision Biopsy . 
In addition to these two fundraisings, $39 .2 million was invested by the Group into new and other existing 
portfolio companies, including investments in four new businesses: BridgeSat, ABLS I (Yale), HawkEye 360 
and ABLS II (Harvard) .

  Non-controlling interests (20,191) (12,228)
Revenue decreased by $4 .4 million, to $3 .3 million in 2015 (2014: $7 .7 million) . This decrease is mainly 
attributable to the lower product revenue at RF Biocidics, offset by increased sales at CryoXtract systems 
when compared to last year . The revenue in the early stage companies’ segment increased to $1 .1 million 
in 2015 (2014: $0 .4 million) . Cost of revenue decreased by $1 .5 million, proportionately to the decrease in 
revenue from prior year .
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $8 .9 million, to $46 .9 million, for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: $38 .0 million), largely due to the overall growth of the Group . Of 
this increase, $4 .3 million relates to an increase in personnel expenses reflecting the increase in headcount 
and salaries offset by the decrease in non-cash share-based compensation expense by $1 .6 million . The 
increase is also attributed to higher professional and legal advisory services in 2015 since the listing of Allied 
Minds on the London Stock Exchange in mid-year of 2014, reflected mainly in a $1 .9 million increase in 
professional services to $7 .5 million (2014: $5 .6 million) .
Research and development (R&D) expenses increased by $27 .0 million to $49 .2 million for the year ended 
31 December 2015 (2014: $22 .2 million) . The increase is attributed to the overall growth of the Group’s 
research and development activities, reflecting the creation of four new businesses in 2015 and ramping 
up full scale of R&D activities of companies created in late 2013 and into 2014 .
As a result of the above discussed factors, total comprehensive loss increased by $40 .0 million to $97 .9 
million for the year ended 31 December 2015 (2014: $57 .9 million) . Total comprehensive loss for the year

The Group’s net cash outflow from operating activities of $81 .9 million in 2015 (2014: $45 .4 million) was 
primarily due to the net operating losses for the year of $96 .7 million, offset by the net effect from movement 
in working capital of $2 .7 million, adjustment for non-cash items such as depreciation, amortisation, and 
share-based expenses of $11 .4 million and interest received net of paid and other finance charges of 
$0 .7 million .
The Group had a net cash outflow from investing activities of $75 .0 million in 2015 (2014: $40 .7 million) 
mainly reflecting the purchases of fixed income investment securities of $51 .8 million, purchases or property 
and equipment net of disposals of $21 .5 million, and purchases of intangible assets net of disposals of 
$1 .7 million .

Financial Review (continued)
 
Strategic Report
 
The Group’s net cash inflow from financing activities of $38 .4 million in 2015 (2014: $205 .6 million) primarily 
reflects the proceeds from issuance of preferred shares in subsidiaries of $36 .2 million from the rounds in 
SciFluor Life Sciences and Precision Biopsy .
The Group’s strategy is to maintain healthy, highly liquid cash balances that are readily available to 
support the activities of its subsidiaries by providing working capital, maintaining the level of research and 
development activities required to achieve the set milestone goals, and acquiring capital equipment where 
necessary to support research and development activities . To further minimise its exposure to risks the 
Group does not maintain any material borrowings or cash balances in foreign currency .

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Risk Management
 
The execution of the Group’s strategy is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties . A key focus for 
the Board is to formally identify the principle risks facing the Group and develop a robust and effective 
framework to ensure that the risks are both well understood and appropriate for the Company’s risk 
appetite to achieve the stated corporate goals . This process needs to address both risks arising from the 
internal operations of the Group and those arising from the business environment in which it operates . It is 
possible that one or more of these identified risks could impact the Group in a similar timeframe which may 
compound their effects .
As an early-stage investor in start-ups, the Group inherently operates in a high risk environment . The 
overall aim of the risk management policy is to achieve an effective balancing of risk and reward, although 
ultimately no strategy can provide an absolute assurance against loss .
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and/or liquidity . The major risks and 
uncertainties identified by the Board are set out below along with the consequences and mitigation strategy 
of each risk .
1 .   The science and technology being developed or commercialised by the Group’s businesses may fail 
and/or the Group’s business may not be able to develop their intellectual property into commercially 
viable products or technologies . There is also a risk that some of the subsidiary businesses may fail or 
not succeed as anticipated, resulting in an impairment of the Group’s value .
 Impact:  The failure of any of the Group’s subsidiary businesses would impact the Group’s value . A 
failure of one of the major subsidiary businesses could also impact on the perception of the 
Group as a builder of high value businesses and possibly make additional fund raising at the 
Group or subsidiary level more difficult .
   Mitigation: 
•	 Before making any investment, extensive due diligence is carried out by the Group which 
covers all the major business risks including market size, strategy, adoption and intellectual 
property .
•	 The initial seed round investment is typically quite small with incremental investment only 
being made on successful completion of milestones .
•	 A capital disciplined approach is pursued such that proof of concept has to be achieved 
before substantial capital is committed .
•	 Members of the Group’s management team who carry out the initial due diligence initially 
run the subsidiary in its incubation phase and subsequently move to becoming independent 
directors staying with the project to help ensure consistency of management . The Group’s 
point of contact will stay in regular communication with the senior management of the 
subsidiary business .
•	 During incubation phase, we closely monitor milestone developments and should a project 
fail to achieve sufficient progress, we terminate the investments .
•	 The Company carries out face-to-face quarterly reviews with the management of each of 
the subsidiary businesses .

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Risk Management (continued)
 
Strategic Report
 
•	 The shared services model provides significant administrative support to the subsidiary 
businesses whilst the budgetary and financial controls ensure good governance .
•	 Within the Group there is a wealth of management expertise which can be called upon to 
support each of the subsidiary businesses where necessary .
•	 The Group actively uses third party advisors and consultants, specific to the particular 
domain in which a subsidiary business operates, to assist on market strategy and direction .
2 .   The Group expects to continue to incur substantial expenditure in further research and development 
activities of its businesses . There is no guarantee that the Group will become profitable and, even if it 
does, it may be unable to sustain profitability .
 Impact:  The strategic aim of the business is to generate profits for its shareholders through the 
investment into IP-based start-ups, delivering value through capital gain . As such, profits will 
be generated on exits . The timing and size of these potential inflows is uncertain and should 
exits not be forthcoming, or in the event that they are achieved but at values significantly less 
than the amount of capital invested, then it would be difficult to sustain the current levels of 
investment in the subsidiary businesses and continue to make new investments . This will lead 
to reduced activity across the Group . In turn this could make raising additional capital at the 
Group level difficult and it could ultimately lead to the failure of the Group as a whole .
   Mitigation: 
•	 The Group retains significant cash balances in order to support its internal cash flow 
requirements .
•	 The Group has close relationships with a wide group of investors, including its shareholder 
base to ensure it can continue to access the capital markets .
•	 Senior management continually seek to create additional strategic relationships for the 
Group .
3 .   If any of the Group’s relationships with US universities and federal government institutions were to break 
down or be terminated or expire, then the Group would lose any rights that it has to act as a private 
sector partner in the commercialisation of intellectual property being generated by such universities, 
other research intensive institutions or US federal research institutions .
 Impact:  Termination of certain of the Group’s existing relationships would impact the quantity and 
potential quality of the Company’s deal flow . This may in turn prevent the Company from 
completing promising new deals and reduce its opportunity to create new subsidiaries . This 
could potentially have an adverse effect on the Group’s long term prospects and performance .
   Mitigation: 
•	 The Group currently receives in excess of 5,000 items of intellectual property per year 
from its 160 partner institutions . The risk of losing deal flow through the termination of 
relationships is greatly lessened by the wide portfolio and geographic spread of our 
partners .
•	 The Group continues to strengthen its partner network .
010_c112021_5.5.indd   41 21/04/2016   13:25 Page 42 of 165
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Risk Management (continued)
 
•	 The Group has hired a dedicated resource to manage and expand the partner network .
4 .   A majority of the Group’s intellectual property relates to technologies originated in the course of research 
conducted in, and initially funded by, US universities or other federally-funded research institutions . 
Although the Group has been granted exclusive licenses to use this intellectual property, there are 
certain limitations inherent in these licenses, for example as required by the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 .
 Impact:  There are certain circumstances where the US government has rights to utilise the underlying 
intellectual property without any economic benefit flowing back to the Group . In the event this 
were to happen, this could impact the financial return to the Group on its investment in the 
applicable subsidiary businesses .
   Mitigation: 
•	 To the Board’s knowledge, while these so called “march in” rights exist, the US government 
has never had cause to use them .
•	 The Group seeks to develop dual use capabilities for the technology it licenses and 
generally tends to avoid use cases directly applicable to government use .
•	 This risk is also mitigated through employing experienced technology transfer experts 
supported by our legal team to assess risks that may arise out of this eventuality .
5 .   The Group currently has in place cooperative research and development agreements with certain US 
Department of Defence laboratories and federal funded government institutions . Certain regulatory 
measures apply to these agreements which restrict the export of information and material that may be 
used for military or intelligence applications by a non-US person .
 Impact:  If the Group were to breach restrictions on the use of certain licensed technologies, particularly 
those derived from federally funded research facilities, this could materially impact upon 
the Group’s ability to license additional intellectual property from these establishments . In 
certain circumstances it may also lead to the termination of existing licenses . In the event 
that this were to happen, this could materially affect a number of the Group’s businesses and 
potentially harm the reputation and standing of the Group and cause the termination of certain 
important relationships with federally funded research institutions .
   Mitigation: 
•	 Prior to the commercialisation process, the Group’s management seeks to obtain all 
the necessary clearances from applicable regulatory bodies to ensure that the export of 
products based upon the licensed IP is strictly in accordance with government guidelines .
•	 The Group employs a number of individuals with experience in working with various 
government agencies .
•	 Senior management is fully cognisant with the regulations and sensitivities in relation to this 
issue and in particular with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) which regulate 
the use of technologies for export, and has numerous mitigating actions available should 
issues arise .

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Risk Management (continued)
 
Strategic Report
 
6 .   The Group operates in complex and specialised business domains and requires highly qualified and 
experienced management to implement its strategy successfully . All of the operations of the Group and 
its subsidiary businesses are located in the United States, which is a highly competitive employment 
market . There is a risk that the Group may lose key personnel, or fail to attract or retain new personnel . 
Furthermore, given the relatively small size of the senior management at the corporate level, the Group 
is reliant on a small number of key individuals .
 Impact:  The loss of key personnel would have an adverse impact on the ability of the Group to continue 
to grow and may negatively affect the Group’s competitive advantage .
   Mitigation: 
•	 The Board annually seeks external expertise to assess the competitiveness of the 
compensation packages of its senior management .
•	 Senior management continually monitor and assess compensation levels to ensure the 
Group remains competitive in the employment market .
•	 While staff turnover has historically been low and the Group continues to attract highly 
qualified individuals, management encourages development and inclusion through 
coaching and mentoring programmes .
7 .   A large proportion of the overall value of the Group’s businesses may be concentrated in a small 
proportion of the Group’s businesses . If one or more of the intellectual property rights relevant to a 
valuable business were terminated, this would have a material adverse impact on the overall value of the 
Group’s businesses .
 Impact:  The termination of critical IP licenses would materially impact the value of the subsidiary 
business and have a consequent effect on the value of the overall Group .
   Mitigation: 
•	 In each subsidiary, the management is specifically directed to pursue a policy of generating 
and patenting additional intellectual property to both provide additional protection and 
create direct IP ownership for the subsidiary business .
•	 Where possible, the Group seeks to negotiate intellectual property ownership rights in any 
research and development agreement it enters into with a network partner, such that the 
Group becomes a part owner of the underlying IP .
•	 The Group has a diversified portfolio of subsidiary businesses . The value of any one of its 
subsidiaries relative to the aggregate value of the Group is closely monitored to ensure that 
the concentration risk of any on subsidiary is not disproportionate .
8 .   Clinical studies and other tests to assess the commercial viability of a product are typically expensive, 
complex and time-consuming, and have uncertain outcomes . If the Company fails to complete or 
experiences delays in completing tests for any of its product candidates, it may not be able to obtain 
regulatory approval or commercialise its product candidates on a timely basis, or at all .
 Impact:  Significant delays in any of the clinical studies to support the appropriate regulatory approvals 
could significantly impact the amount of capital required for the subsidiary business to 
010_c112021_5.5.indd   43 21/04/2016   13:25 Page 44 of 165
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Risk Management (continued)
 
become fully sustainable on a cash flow basis . A critical failure in any stage of a clinical testing 
programme would probably necessitate a termination of the project and a loss of the Group’s 
investment .
   Mitigation: 
•	 The Group has dedicated internal resources to establish and monitor each of the clinical 
programmes in order to try and maximise successful outcomes .
•	 During the evaluation and due diligence phase prior to the initial investment, focus is placed 
on an analysis of the risks of the clinical phase of development .
•	 Prior to the launch of any clinical testing it will be normal for a dedicated management team 
(and in certain cases an advisory team to include key opinion leaders (KOLs)) to be hired, 
and experience with the management of clinical programmes would be a prerequisite 
qualification .
•	 In the event of the outsourcing of these trials, care and attention is given to assure the 
quality of the Contract Research Organisation (CRO) vendors used to perform the work .
9 .   The Group expects to remain viable through December 2017 given its current cash and financial 
position . However, if the Group is unable to raise capital, generate sufficient revenue, appropriately 
manage expenses, or exit any of its existing Group businesses prior to the end of such period, then 
the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and future viability could be 
adversely affected .
 Impact:  Lack of capital could restrict the Group’s ability to further develop and commercialise its 
existing businesses and prevent the Group from investing in attractive new opportunities . In 
turn, this could ultimately lead to failure of individual subsidiaries and loss of investment as well 
as failure of the Group as a whole .
   Mitigation: 
•	 The Group maintains close relationships with its shareholder base and a wide group of 
investors to ensure it continuous access to the capital markets .
•	 The Group has historically had a strong financial position, including prior to its initial public 
offering, and holds significant control over the Company’s investments and how subsidiary 
company working capital requirements are met .
•	 The Company has majority control over all of the subsidiary companies, and is able to 
maintain close control of their expenses and cash outflows .
•	 The Company has built a valuable portfolio of subsidiary companies since its inception .

Directors’ Report (continued)
 
information on the Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies, including those in relation 
to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, is provided in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, 
along with further information on the Group’s use of financial instruments.
Significant Agreements
The Group has not entered into any significant agreements which may be impacted by a change of control 
following a takeover bid.
Share Capital
Details of the structure of the Company’s share capital and the rights attaching to the Company’s shares 
are set out in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Other than the minimum share ownership 
policy adopted by the Board in April 2016 with respect to Executive Directors and PDMRs, there are no 
specific restrictions on the holding of securities or on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the 
general provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association (Articles) and prevailing legislation. None of the 
ordinary shares carry any special rights with regard to control of the Company and there are no restrictions 
on voting rights.
At the last Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 28 May 2015 (the “2015 AGM”), authority was 
given to the Directors pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 to allot unissued 
relevant securities in the Company up to a maximum amount equivalent to approximately one-third of the 
issued ordinary share capital on 24 April 2015 at any time up to the earlier of the conclusion of the next 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company and 1 August 2016. In addition, at the 2015 AGM, the 
Directors were also given authority effective for the same period as the aforementioned authority to allot 
relevant securities in the Company up to a maximum of approximately two-thirds of the total ordinary share 
capital in issue on 24 April 2015 in connection with an offer by way of a fully preemptive rights issue. The 
Directors propose to renew both of these authorities at the Company’s next AGM to be held on 26 May 
2016. The authorities being sought are in accordance with guidance issued by the Investment Association.
A further special resolution passed at the 2015 AGM granted authority to the Directors to allot equity 
securities in the Company for cash, without regard to the pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act 
2006, both: (i) up to a maximum of approximately two-thirds of the total ordinary share capital in issue on 
24 April 2015 in connection with a fully preemptive rights issue; and (ii) up to a maximum of approximately 
5% of the aggregate nominal value of the shares in issue on 24 April 2015, each authority exercisable at 
any time up to the earlier of the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company and 1 August 2016. These 
authorities were not used during the year. The Directors will seek to renew these authorities for a similar 
period at the next AGM to be held on 26 May 2016.
Under the Companies Act 2006, the Company has the power to purchase its own shares in accordance 
with Part 18, Chapter 5 of the Companies Act 2006. At the 2015 AGM, a special resolution was passed 
which granted the Directors authority to make market purchases of the Company’s shares pursuant to 
these provisions of the Companies Act 2006 up to a maximum of approximately 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital on 24 April 2015 provided that the authority granted set a minimum and maximum 
price at which purchases can be made and is exercisable at any time up to the earlier of the conclusion 
of the next AGM and 1 August 2016. This authority has not been used during the year and therefore the 
outstanding authority is 21,449,058. The Directors will seek to renew the authority within similar parameters 
and for a similar period at the next AGM to be held on 26 May 2016.

Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles may be amended by a special resolution of the shareholders.
Substantial Shareholders
As at 31 December 2015, the Company had been advised of the following notifiable interests in the 
Company’s voting rights under DTR 5. Other than as shown, so far as the Company (and its directors) are 
aware, no other person holds or is beneficially interested in a disclosable interest in the Company.
Shareholder
Number of 
Shares Percentage
Invesco Asset Management Limited 63,502,442 29.45%
Woodford Investment Management 60,340,757 27.98%
Mark Pritchard 20,350,000 9.44%
SandAire 9,930,236 4.61%
P3 Private Equity Fund 7,721,846 3.58%
Between the year end and 25 April 2016, the Company was advised pursuant to DTR 5 that (1) Woodford 
Investment Management had increased its holdings to 62,663,957 shares, or 29.06%, and (2) Mark 
Pritchard had decreased his holdings to 18,425,000, or 8.54%.
Relationship Agreement
In accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.4 (14), the Company has set out below a statement describing the 
relationship agreement entered into by the Company with its principal shareholder.
On 19 June 2014, the Company entered into a Relationship Agreement with Invesco Asset Management 
Limited (Invesco), which came into force at the Company’s initial public offering (IPO) on the Main Market of 
the London Stock Exchange. The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement was to ensure that the 
Company was capable at all times of carrying on its business independently of Invesco.
If any person acquired control of the Company or the Company ceased to be admitted to the Official 
List, the Relationship Agreement could be terminated by Invesco. If Invesco (together with its associates) 
ceased to hold 30% or more of the voting rights over the Company’s shares, the Relationship Agreement 
would terminate save for certain specified provisions.
On 9 October 2015, Invesco reported pursuant to DTR 5 that it had decreased its holdings to 63,502,442 
shares, or 29.45%. On the basis that Invesco no longer exercises or controls, on its own or together with 
any person with which they are acting in concert, 30% or more of the voting rights over the Company’s 
shares, Invesco is no longer a “controlling shareholder” under the Listing Rules, and the Relationship 
Agreement terminated on such date in accordance with its terms and conditions.
The Relationship Agreement provided that Invesco would undertake to use all reasonable endeavors to 
procure that its associates and any person with whom it was acting in concert shall:
•	 conduct all agreements, arrangements, transactions and relationships with any member of the Group 
on an arm’s length basis and on a normal commercial basis and in accordance with the related party 
transaction requirements of Chapter 11 of the Listing Rules;

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Directors’ Report (continued)
 
•	 not take any action that would have the effect of preventing the Company from complying with its 
obligations under the Listing Rules or preclude or inhibit any member of the Group from carrying on its 
business independently of Invesco, its associates and any person with whom it was acting in concert;
•	 not propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder resolution which was intended to, or appeared to 
be intended to, circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules; and
•	 not exercise any of its voting rights attaching to the shares held by it to procure any amendment to the 
Articles of Association of the Company which would be inconsistent with, undermine or breach any of 
the provisions of the Relationship Agreement.
The Board believes that the terms of the Relationship Agreement enabled the Company to carry on its 
business independently, prior to its termination, from Invesco and its associates, and ensured that all 
transactions and relationships between the Company and Invesco were at arm’s length and on a normal 
commercial basis.
The Company has and, in so far as it is aware, the Invesco and its associates have, complied with the 
independence provisions set out in the Relationship Agreement from the date of the agreement, during 
the relevant period under review, until its termination on 9 October 2015. The ordinary shares owned by 
Invesco rank pari passu with the other ordinary shares in all respects.
Political Donations
The Group did not make any political donations in 2014 or 2015.
Corporate and Social Responsibility
Details on the Group’s policies, activities and aims with regard to its corporate and social responsibilities 
are included in the Sustainability section on pages 68 to 69. and are incorporated into this Director’s Report 
by reference.
Directors’ Indemnity and Liability Insurance
During the year, the Company has maintained liability insurance in respect of its directors who held office 
during the period. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Articles provide that every 
director is entitled to be indemnified out of the funds of the Company against any liabilities incurred in the 
execution or discharge of his or her powers or duties.
Issuance of Equity by Major Subsidiary Undertaking
None of the Companies major subsidiary undertakings (as defined in the Listing Rules) issued equity in 
2015.

Directors’ Report (continued)
 
Viability Statement
While the financial statements and accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis, section C.2.2 
of the 2014 revision of the UK Corporate Governance Code requires the Directors to make a statement in 
the Annual Report with regard to the viability of the Group, including explaining how they have assessed 
the prospects of the Group, the period of time for which they have made the assessment, and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate. Accordingly, the Directors conducted this assessment over the two 
years to December 2017, taking into account the Group’s current position, investment strategy, and the 
principal risks detailed in the Strategic Report. The Directors believe that a two-year assessment is most 
appropriate as it aligns with the Group’s normal and well-established budgeting process. In making their 
assessment, the Directors considered a wide range of information, including present and future economic 
conditions, future projections of profitability, cash flows and capital requirements and availability of sources 
of funding.
The Group’s annual budgeting process builds into a robust two-year plan, which is the period the Directors 
consider as an appropriate period to be covered by the viability statement. This plan forms the basis for 
strategic decisions across the Group. The consolidated plan is reviewed and approved annually by the 
Directors at the beginning of the year. The plan is then deployed down to the subsidiary businesses and 
used to set performance metrics and objectives (MBOs). Progress against the original plan is reviewed 
quarterly by the Directors, and adjustments to the plan can be made if needed to address new risks or take 
advantage of new opportunities.
In summary, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over the two year period to December 
2017. They were comforted by the Group’s strong financial position, its long-term investment objectives, 
the stability of the business model, the Group’s control over its investments and how working capital 
requirements are met. Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the two year period 
to December 2017.
Disclosure of Information to Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this Annual Report confirms that:
•	 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware; and
•	 the Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself 
or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of 
the Companies Act 2006.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held on 26 May 2016. The Notice of AGM circulated with this 
Report and Accounts contains a full explanation of the business to be conducted at that meeting. This 
includes a resolution to re-appoint KPMG LLP as the Company’s Auditors.

Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent Company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the European Union (EU) and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Group and the parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the parent Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, 
Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies 
with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Financial Report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group and the parent 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
•	 the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Corporate Governance Report
 
Management and
Governance
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Directors are committed to a high standard of corporate governance and compliance with the best 
practice of the UK Corporate Governance Code (Code) which was issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in 2010 and revised in September 2014. The Code is available at the Financial Reporting Council website 
at www.frc.org.uk. During the twelve months ended 31 December 2015, the Directors consider that the 
Company has been in compliance with the provisions set out in the Code with the following exceptions:
•	 Contrary to provision A.3.1 of the Code, Mark Pritchard, an Executive Director who served as our 
Chairman since our IPO, was not deemed to be independent. At the time of Admission, the Board 
deemed it appropriate that our company founder lead the Company through the IPO in the role of 
Chairman. Peter Dolan, our former Senior Independent Director, succeeded Mark Pritchard as Non-
Executive Chairman effective as of the conclusion of the AGM held in May 2015.
•	 Contrary to provision D.1.3 of the Code, certain Non-Executive Directors hold restricted ordinary shares 
that vest over time. These shares were granted to the Non-Executive Directors prior to the IPO and do 
not have performance conditions. The Board does not believe that ownership of these shares impacts 
the independence of the Non-Executive Directors.
•	 Contrary to provision D.1.3 of the Code, certain Non-Executive Directors hold restricted stock units 
(RSUs) that vest over time. These RSUs were granted to the Non-Executive Directors in 2015 and do 
not have performance conditions. The Board does not believe that ownership of these RSUs impacts 
the independence of the Non-Executive Directors.
•	 Contrary to provision E.2.4 of the Code, the complexities faced by the Company in collating information 
for its first Annual Report meant that it was considered to be in the best interests of shareholders 
not to rush publication. Accordingly, shareholders received less than the 20 working days’ notice 
recommended by the Code in respect of the Company’s AGM in 2015. However, the Company has 
complied with and exceeded the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 to provide shareholders with 
21 clear days’ notice of the AGM and intends to meet the recommendation of the Code in future years.
Further explanation as to how the provisions set out in the Code have been applied by the Company is 
provided in the following statement, the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Audit Committee Report 
and the Strategic Report. The Company’s auditor, KPMG LLP, is required to review whether the above 
statements reflect the Company’s compliance with the provisions of the Code specified for its review by 
the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to report if it does not reflect such compliance; no such 
report has been made.
The Board
Role and Responsibilities of the Board
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the overall management of the Group as a whole, providing 
entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of controls for assessing and managing risk; defining, 
challenging and interrogating the Group’s strategic aims and direction; maintaining the policy and decision-
making framework in which such strategic aims are implemented; ensuring that the necessary financial 
and human resources are in place to meet strategic aims; monitoring performance against key financial 
and non-financial indicators; succession planning; overseeing the system of risk management; setting 
values and standards in governance matters and monitoring policies and performance on corporate social 
responsibility. The Directors are also responsible for ensuring that obligations to shareholders and other

Corporate Governance Report (continued)
 
stakeholders are understood and met and a satisfactory dialogue with shareholders is maintained. All 
Directors are equally accountable to the Company’s shareholders for the proper stewardship of its affairs 
and the long-term success of the Group.
The responsibility of the Directors is collective, taking into account their respective roles as Executive 
Directors and Non-Executive Directors. The Executive Directors are directly responsible for running the 
business operations and the Non-Executive Directors are responsible for constructively challenging 
proposals on strategy, scrutinising the performance of management, determining levels of remuneration 
and for succession planning for the Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors must also satisfy 
themselves on the integrity of financial information and that financial controls and systems of risk 
management are robust.
The Board reviews strategic issues on a regular basis and exercises control over the performance of the 
Group by agreeing on budgetary targets and monitoring performance against those targets. The Board 
has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal controls and risk management, as described on 
pages 65 to 66. Any decisions made by the Board on policies and strategy to be adopted by the Group 
or changes to current policies and strategy are made following presentations by the Executive Directors 
and a detailed process of review and challenge by the Board. Once made, the Executive Directors are fully 
empowered to implement those decisions.
Except for a formal schedule of matters which are reserved for decision and approval by the Board, the 
Board has delegated the day-to-day management of the Group to the Chief Executive Officer who is 
supported by the Executive Directors and other members of the senior management team. The schedule 
of matters reserved for Board decision and approval are those significant to the Group as a whole due to 
their strategic, financial or reputational implications.
This schedule is reviewed and updated regularly and currently includes those matters set forth below:
•	 Approval and monitoring of the Group’s strategic aims and objectives, and approval of the annual 
operating budget.
•	 Strategic acquisitions by the Group.
•	 Major disposals of the Group’s assets or subsidiaries.
•	 Changes to the Group’s capital structure, the issue of any securities and material borrowing of the 
Group.
•	 Approval of the annual report and half-year results statement, accounting policies and practices or any 
matter having a material impact on future financial performance of the Group.
•	 Ensuring a sound system of internal control and risk management.
•	 Approval of all circulars, prospectuses and other documents issued to shareholders governed by 
the FCA’s Listing Rules, Disclosure Rules or Transparency Rules or the City Code on Takeovers and 
Mergers.
•	 Approving Board appointments and removals, and approving policies relating to directors’ remuneration.
•	 The division of responsibility between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
•	 Approval of terms of reference and membership of Board committees.

•	 Considering and, where appropriate, approving directors’ conflicts of interest.
•	 Approval, subject to shareholder approval, of the appointment and remuneration of the auditors.
•	 Major changes in employee share schemes.
•	 Insurance and litigation.
The schedule of matters reserved to the Board is available on request from the Company Secretary or 
within the Investors section of the Group’s website at www.alliedminds.com.
The Board delegates specific responsibilities to certain committees that assist the Board in carrying out its 
functions and ensure independent oversight of internal control and risk management. The three principal 
Board committees (Audit, Remuneration and Nomination) play an essential role in supporting the Board in 
fulfilling its responsibilities and ensuring that the highest standards of corporate governance are maintained 
throughout the Group. Each committee has its own terms of reference which set out the specific matters 
for which delegated authority has been given by the Board. The initial terms of reference for each of 
the committees, which are fully compliant with the provisions of the Code and which reflect both best 
practice and the recommendations arising from the external evaluation process undergone by the Board 
and its committees in connection with the Company’s IPO, were adopted by the Board during 2014. These 
were reviewed in January 2015 and August 2015, and will be reviewed annually on an ongoing basis and 
updated where necessary. All of these are available on request from the Company Secretary or within the 
Investors section of the Group’s website at www.alliedminds.com.
Board Size and Composition
As at 31 December 2015, there were five Directors on the Board: the Non-Executive Chairman, one 
Executive Director and three Non-Executive Directors. During the year, Kevin Sharer joined the Board as 
a Non-Executive Director in June 2015, and Mark Pritchard resigned from the Board in September 2015. 
Subsequent to year end, Jill Smith joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director in January 2016. The 
biographies of all of the Directors are provided on pages 46 and 47.
The Company’s policy relating to the terms of appointment and the remuneration of both Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors is detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 70 to 97.
The size and composition of the Board is regularly reviewed by the Board, and in particular the Nomination 
Committee, to ensure there is an appropriate and diverse mix of skills and experience on the Board.
The Company’s Articles of Association allow appointment of Directors by ordinary resolution and require 
all Directors to submit themselves for re-election by the shareholders at the Company’s AGM following 
their first appointment and thereafter at each AGM in respect of which they have held office for the two 
preceding AGMs and did not retire at either of them. In addition, each director who has held office with the 
Company for a continuous period of nine years or more must retire and offer themselves up for re-election 
at every AGM.
However, because the Company is a FTSE 350 company, in accordance with the Code, all Directors will 
submit themselves for annual election or re-election by shareholders at the AGM of the Company to be 
held on 26 May 2016 (2016 AGM). New directors may be appointed by the Board, but their appointment is 
subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment. The Board recommends 
to shareholders the reappointment of all Directors retiring at the meeting and offering themselves for re-

Corporate Governance Report (continued)
 
election on the basis that independent performance reviews demonstrated that they contribute effectively 
and continue to display the appropriate level of commitment in their respective roles.
Diversity
The Board is committed to a culture that attracts and retains talented people to deliver outstanding 
performance and further enhance the success of the Company. In that culture, diversity across a range of 
criteria is valued, primarily in relation to skills, knowledge and experience and also in other criteria such as 
gender and ethnicity. The Company will give careful consideration to issues of overall Board balance and 
diversity in making new appointments to the Board and, in identifying suitable candidates, the Nomination 
Committee will seek candidates from a range of backgrounds, with the final decision being based on 
merit against objective criteria. In addition, the terms of reference of the Nomination Committee include a 
requirement for the Committee to consider diversity, including gender, in evaluating the composition of the 
Board and in identifying suitable candidates for Board appointments. A breakdown of employee gender 
showing the percentage of persons who were Directors of the Company and senior managers during the 
period covered by this Annual Report can be found on page 69.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors provide a wide range of skills and experience to the Group. They bring their 
own senior level of experience in each of their respective fields, robust opinions and an independent 
judgement on issues of strategy, performance, risk and people. They are well-placed to constructively 
challenge and scrutinise the performance of management at Board and Committee meetings. The Code 
sets out the circumstances that should be relevant to the Board in determining whether each Non-Executive 
Director is independent. The Board considers non-executive director independence on an annual basis as 
part of each non-executive director’s performance evaluation. Having undertaken this review and with due 
regard to provision B.1.1 of the Code, the Board has concluded this year that all of the Non-Executive 
Directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free of any relationship or 
circumstance which could materially influence or interfere with, or affect, or appear to affect, the exercise 
of their independent judgement.
Non-Executive Directors are required to obtain the approval of the Chairman before taking on any further 
appointments and the Chairman and Executive Director require the approval of the Board before adding to 
their commitments. In all cases, the Directors must ensure that their external appointments do not involve 
excessive time commitment or cause a conflict of interest.
The Roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
Peter Dolan is the current Chairman. Mark Pritchard was the Executive Chairman until he stepped down 
and Peter Dolan was appointed Non-Executive Chairman in May 2015. The division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer is clearly established, set out in writing and agreed 
by the Board. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership and conduct of the Board, the conduct of the 
Group’s affairs and strategy and for ensuring effective communication with shareholders. The Chairman 
facilitates the full and effective contribution of Non-Executive Directors at Board and Committee meetings, 
ensures that they are kept well informed and ensures a constructive relationship between the Executive 
Directors and Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman also ensures that the Board committees carry out 
their duties, including reporting back to the Board either orally or in writing following their meetings at the 
next Board meeting.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
 
Management and
Governance
The role of the Chief Executive Officer, Chris Silva, is to lead the delivery of the strategy and the executive 
management of the Group and its operating businesses. He is responsible, amongst other things, for 
the development and implementation of strategy and processes which enable the Group to meet the 
requirements of shareholders, for delivering the operating plans and budgets for the Group’s businesses, 
monitoring business performance against key performance indicators (KPIs) and reporting on these to the 
Board and for providing the appropriate environment to recruit, engage, retain and develop the high quality 
personnel needed to deliver the Group’s strategy.
Senior Independent Director
Rick Davis is the current Senior Independent Director. Peter Dolan was the Senior Independent Director 
until he was appointed Chairman in May 2015, and Rick Davis was appointed Senior Independent Director 
in August 2015. A key responsibility of the Senior Independent Director is to be available to shareholders 
in the event that they may feel it inappropriate to relay views through the Chairman or Chief Executive 
Officer. In addition, the Senior Independent Director serves as an intermediary between the rest of the 
Board and the Chairman where necessary and takes the lead when the Non-Executive Directors assess 
the Chairman’s performance and when the appointment of a new Chairman is considered. Further, the 
Senior Independent Director will lead the Board in its deliberations on any matters on which the Chairman 
is conflicted.
Board Support
The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for ensuring Board procedures are followed, applicable 
rules and regulations are complied with and that the Board is advised on governance matters and relevant 
regulatory matters. All Directors have access to the impartial advice and services of the Company Secretary. 
There is also an agreed procedure for directors to take independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and a contractual Deed of Indemnity, 
directors have been granted an indemnity issued by the Company to the extent permitted by law in respect 
of liabilities incurred to third parties as a result of their office. The indemnity would not provide any coverage 
where a director is proved to have acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct. The Company has also 
arranged appropriate insurance coverage in respect of legal action against its directors and officers.
Board Meetings and Decisions
The Board meets regularly during the year, as well as when required by business need. The Board had six 
scheduled Board meetings in 2015. During their term of service, each of the Directors were present at all 
meetings during the year. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors also met without the presence of the 
Executive Directors four times during the year.
The schedule of Board and Committee meetings each year is, so far as is possible, determined before the 
commencement of that year and all Directors or, if appropriate, all Committee members are expected to 
attend each meeting. Supplementary meetings of the Board and/or the Committees are held as and when 
necessary. Each member of the Board receives detailed Board packs, including an agenda based upon the 
schedule of matters reserved for its approval, appropriate reports and briefing papers in advance of each 
scheduled meeting. If a director is unable to attend a meeting due to exceptional circumstances, he or she 
will still receive the supporting papers and is expected to discuss any matters he or she wishes to raise with 
the Chairman in advance of the meeting. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
Company Secretary work together to ensure that the Directors receive relevant information to enable them

to discharge their duties and that such information is accurate, timely and clear. This information includes 
quarterly management accounts containing analysis of performance against budget and other forecasts. 
Additional information is provided as appropriate or if requested. At each meeting, the Board receives 
information, reports and presentations from the Chief Executive Officer and, by invitation, other members 
of senior management as required. This ensures that all Directors are aware of, and are in a position to 
monitor effectively, the overall performance of the Group, its development and implementation of strategy 
and its management of risk.
Any matter requiring a decision by the Board is supported by a paper analysing the relevant aspects of the 
proposal including costs, benefits, potential risks involved and proposed executive management action and 
recommendations.
The majority of Board meetings are held at the Group’s offices in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, which gives 
members of the Company’s senior management team, as well as the senior managers of the subsidiaries, 
the opportunity to formally present to the Board on business development and new investment opportunities. 
This assists the Board in gaining a deeper understanding of the breadth, stage of development and diversity 
of the Group’s subsidiaries. During 2015, the Board held one of its scheduled meetings at one of the 
Company’s subsidiary offices in Silicon Valley, California, USA, which is also the location of several of the 
Company’s subsidiaries, in order to encourage further interaction with the senior management teams of 
those subsidiaries. Meetings between the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors, both with and without 
the presence of the Chief Executive Officer, are also held as the need arises.
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
Each director has a statutory duty under the Companies Act 2006 (CA 2006) to avoid a situation in which he 
or she has or can have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts or may potentially conflict with the interests 
of the Company. This duty is in addition to the continuing duty that a director owes to the Company to 
disclose to the Board any transaction or arrangement under consideration by the Company in which he 
or she is interested. The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to authorise conflicts or 
potential conflicts of interest. The Board has established procedures for managing and, where appropriate, 
authorising any such conflicts or potential conflicts of interest. It is a recurring agenda item at all Board 
meetings and this gives the directors the opportunity to raise at the beginning of every Board meeting, any 
actual of potential conflict of interests that they may have on the matters to be discussed, or to update the 
Board on any change to a previous conflict of interest already declared. In deciding whether to authorise 
any conflict, the directors must have regard to their general duties under the CA 2006 and their overriding 
obligation to act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the Company’s 
success. In addition, the directors are able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation to 
a conflict or potential conflict of interest if they think this is appropriate. The authorisation of any conflict 
matter, and the terms of any authorisation, may be reviewed by the Board at any time. The Board believes 
that the procedures established to deal with conflicts of interest are operating effectively.
Induction, Awareness and Development
A comprehensive induction process is in place for new directors. The programme is tailored to the needs 
of each individual director and agreed with him or her so that he or she can gain a better understanding 
of the Group and its businesses. This will generally include an overview of the Group and its businesses, 
structure, functions and strategic aims; site visits to the Group’s head office in Boston, Massachusetts, 
020_c112021_5.5.indd   62 21/04/2016   13:26 Page 63 of 165

Management and
Governance
USA; and, upon request, site visits to a number of the Group’s subsidiary companies, which will include 
meeting with such companies’ management and a presentation from them on their businesses. In addition, 
the Company facilitates sessions as appropriate with the Group’s advisers, in particular its joint corporate 
brokers, Credit Suisse International and Numis Securities Limited, as well as with appropriate governance 
specialists, to ensure that any new directors are fully aware of and understand their responsibilities and 
obligations as a director of a FTSE 350 company and of the governance framework within which they must 
operate.
In order to ensure that the Directors continue to further their understanding of the issues facing the Group, 
the Board is also exposed to the early-stage opportunities in which the Group has invested through 
presentations at Board meetings by relevant members of the Group’s staff. In addition, other members of 
senior management present to the Board to enhance the Board’s awareness of how the Group operates 
on a day-to-day basis and how such functions operate so as to assist in the execution of the Group’s 
core strategy of systematically developing an innovation company that forms, funds, manages and builds 
start-ups based on early-stage technology originating from US universities and federally funded research 
institutions.
As a further aspect of their ongoing development, each Director also receives feedback on his or her 
performance following the Board’s performance evaluation in each year and, through the Company 
Secretary, access is facilitated to relevant training and development opportunities including those relevant 
to the Non-Executive Directors’ membership on the Board’s committees.
Board Effectiveness and Performance Evaluation
A performance evaluation of the Board and its Committees is carried out annually to ensure that they 
continue to be effective and that each of the Directors demonstrates commitment to his or her respective 
role and has sufficient time to meet his or her commitment to the Company. The Board will seek the 
assistance of an independent third party provider at least once every three years in its evaluation in 
compliance with the Code, and otherwise carry out an internally facilitated Board evaluation led by the 
Chairman, assisted by the Company Secretary, and covering the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, its 
individual Directors and its Committees. This review will include each of the Board and Committee members 
completing a detailed and tailored survey and one-to-one discussions between the Chairman and each of 
the individual Directors. A summary of the results of the review, together with the Chairman and Company 
Secretary’s observations and recommendations, will be prepared and shared with members of the Board. 
In addition to the above, the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, will appraise 
the Chairman’s performance, following which the Senior Independent Director will provide feedback to the 
Chairman. The performance of each of the Directors on the Board will be reviewed by the Chairman and 
the operational performance of the other Executive Directors will be reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer 
as part of the annual appraisal process. In addition to the aforementioned annual reviews, the performance 
of Executive Directors will be reviewed by the Board on an ongoing basis, as deemed necessary, in the 
absence of the Executive Director under review.
During the 2015 financial year, the Board assessed its own effectiveness through an internal Board evaluation 
process. This process was based on: a review of documentation including Board and committee terms of 
reference, the completion of a survey to Directors comprising quantitative and qualitative questions; and 
discussions with all Board members and a number of stakeholders who regularly interact with the Board, 
to include the Company Secretary.

Corporate Governance Report (continued)
 
The results were analysed by the Chairman and the Company Secretary, and a detailed discussion was 
facilitated with the Board to outline the observations and recommendations. Overall it was concluded that 
the Board continues to work effectively. There have been a number of changes to the Board composition, 
resulting in a well-balanced Board with a range of skills and experience. In an effort to continue to improve, 
a number of areas the Board should continue to focus on where identified to include: (i) continued 
presentations to the Board by subsidiary CEOs to increase awareness of strategic operations, (ii) regular 
Executive Director and senior management access to the Board, and (iii) review of detailed written monthly 
Board updates prepared by senior management on corporate and subsidiary operations.
Committees of the Board
The composition of the three committees of the Board and the attendance of the members throughout 
the year is set out in the table on page 48. The terms of reference of each committee are available 
on request from the Company Secretary or within the Investors section of the Group’s website at  
www.alliedminds.com.
Remuneration and Audit Committees
Separate reports on the role, composition, responsibilities and operation of the Remuneration Committee 
and the Audit Committee are set out on pages 95 to 97, and pages 98 to 101, respectively.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee leads the process for Board appointments, re-election and succession of 
directors and the Chairman. Its key objective is to ensure that the Board comprises individuals with the 
necessary skills, knowledge and experience to ensure that it is effective in discharging its duties. It is 
responsible for making recommendations to the Board and its Committees concerning the composition 
and skills of the Board including any changes considered necessary in the identification and nomination 
of new directors, the reappointment of existing directors and the appointment of members to the Board’s 
committees. It also assesses the roles of the existing directors in office to ensure there continues to be 
a balanced Board in terms of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity. In addition, the Nomination 
Committee reviews the senior leadership needs of the Group to enable it to compete effectively in the 
marketplace. The Nomination Committee also advises the Board on succession planning for Executive 
Director appointments, although the Board itself is responsible for succession generally.
The Committee is chaired by Rick Davis and its other members as at 31 December 2015 were Jeff Rohr 
and Kevin Sharer, being a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors as prescribed by the Code. 
The Nomination Committee meets as and when required or requested by the Board and met two times 
during 2015 to review the structure, size and composition of the Board, following which it discussed the 
conclusions with the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. Messrs. Davis, Rohr and Sharer were 
present at all meetings during the year.
Before selecting new appointees to the Board, the Nomination Committee shall consider the balance, 
skill, knowledge, independence, diversity (including gender) and experience on the Board to ensure that a 
suitable balance is maintained. The Committee shall adopt a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new directors to the Board. Consideration shall always be given as to whether 
identified candidates have sufficient time available to devote to the role. When searching for appropriate 
candidates, the Committee shall give consideration to using an external search company, but may also

Management and
Governance
consider candidates who are proposed by existing Board members or employees of the Group. When 
the Committee has found a suitable candidate, the Chairman of the Committee will make a proposal 
to the whole Board. The appointment of a candidate is the responsibility of the whole Board following 
recommendation from the Committee. The Committee did not use the services of an external search 
company in 2015.
As part of its annual duties in 2015, the Committee and the full Board completed a very active year which 
resulted in (1) the appointment of Peter Dolan as Non-Executive Chairman in May 2015, (2) the appointment 
of Kevin Sharer as a Non-Executive Director in June 2015, (3) the appointment of Rick Davis as Senior 
Independent Director in August 2015, and (4) the appointment of Jill Smith as a Non-Executive Director in 
January 2016. In the year ahead, the Nomination Committee will continue to assess the Board’s size and 
composition and how it may be enhanced.
Internal control
The Board fully recognises the importance of the guidance contained in Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting (Financial Reporting Council). The Group’s 
internal controls, which are Groupwide, were in place during the whole of 2015, were reviewed by the 
Board and Audit Committee and were considered to be effective throughout the year ended 31 December 
2015.
The Board and Audit Committee are responsible for establishing and monitoring internal control systems 
and for reviewing the effectiveness of these systems. The Board views the effective operation of a rigorous 
system of internal control as critical to the success of the Group; however, it recognises that such systems 
are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure and can provide only reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The key elements of the Group’s internal control system, 
all of which have been in place during the financial year and up to the date these financial statements were 
approved, are as follows:
Control environment and procedures
The Group has a clear organisational structure with defined responsibilities and accountabilities. It adopts 
the highest values surrounding quality, integrity and ethics, and these values are documented and 
communicated clearly throughout the whole organisation.
Detailed written policies and procedures have been established covering key operating and compliance 
risk areas. These are reviewed and updated at least once a year. The effectiveness of the systems of 
internal control is reviewed at least annually by the Board. The Board considers that the controls have been 
effective for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Identification and evaluation of risks
The Board actively identifies and evaluates the risks inherent in the business, and ensures that appropriate 
controls and procedures are in place to manage these risks. The Board obtains an update regarding the 
subsidiary businesses on a monthly basis, and reviews the performance of the Group and its subsidiaries on 
a quarterly basis, although performance of specific investments may be reviewed more frequently if deemed 
appropriate. The Board also obtains a risk management report from members of senior management on 
a regular basis. The key risks and uncertainties faced by the Group, as well as the relevant mitigations, are 
set out on pages 40 to 45.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
 
Information and financial reporting systems
The Group evaluates and manages significant risks associated with the process for preparing consolidated 
accounts by having in place systems and controls that ensure adequate accounting records are maintained 
and transactions are recorded accurately and fairly to permit the preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS. The Board approves the annual operating budgets and each quarter receives 
details of actual performance measured against the budget.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The operations of the Group and the implementation of its objectives and strategy are subject to a number 
of key risks and uncertainties. Risks are formally reviewed by the Board and Audit Committee at least 
annually and appropriate procedures are put in place to monitor and, to the extent possible, mitigate 
these risks. Where more than one of the risks to occur together, the overall impact on the Group may be 
compounded. A summary of the key risks affecting the Group and the steps taken to manage these is set 
out on pages 40 to 45.
Relations with stakeholders
The Company is committed to a continuous dialogue with shareholders as it believes that this is essential to 
ensure a greater understanding of and confidence amongst its shareholders in the medium and longer term 
strategy of the Group. It is the responsibility of the Board as a whole to ensure that a satisfactory dialogue 
does take place.
The Board’s primary shareholder contact is through the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Senior 
Independent Director and other Directors, as appropriate, make themselves available for contact with major 
shareholders and other stakeholders in order to understand their issues and concerns.
The Company uses the AGM as an opportunity to communicate with its shareholders. Notice of the AGM, 
which will be held at 1 p.m. BST on 26 May 2016 at the offices of DLA Piper LLP, 1 London Wall, London 
EC2Y 5EA, United Kingdom, is enclosed with this report. In accordance with the Code, the Notice of AGM 
is sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. Details of the resolutions and the 
explanatory notes thereto are included with the Notice. To ensure compliance with the Code, the Board 
proposes separate resolutions for each issue and proxy forms allow shareholders who are unable to attend 
the AGM to vote for or against or to withhold their vote on each resolution. The results of all proxy voting 
shall be published on the Group’s website after the meeting and at the meeting itself to those shareholders 
who attend. Shareholders who attend the AGM will have the opportunity to ask questions and the Chairman 
and the Executive Directors are expected to be available to take questions.
The Group’s website at www.alliedminds.com is the primary source of information on the Group. The 
website includes an overview of the activities of the Group, details of its subsidiary companies and its key 
university and federal government partnerships, and details of all recent Group and subsidiary business 
announcements.
Political expenditure
It is the Board’s policy not to incur political expenditure or otherwise make cash contributions to political 
parties and it has no intention of changing that policy.

Sustainability
 
Policy Statement
Allied Minds aims to conduct its business in a socially responsible manner, to contribute to the communities 
in which it operates and to respect the needs of its employees and all of its stakeholders.
The Group is committed to growing the business while ensuring a safe environment for employees as well 
as minimising the overall impact on the environment.
Allied Minds endeavours to conduct its business in accordance with established best practice, to be a 
responsible employer and to adopt values and standards designed to help guide staff in their conduct and 
business relationships.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Given the overall size of the Group, we consider the direct environmental impact of the Group as 
relatively low. However, we firmly recognise our responsibility to ensure that our business operates in an 
environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. The Group complies with all current regulations on 
emissions including greenhouse gas emissions, where such regulation exists in our markets.
Though the Group’s day-to-day operational activities have a relatively limited impact on the environment, 
we do recognise that the more significant impact occurs indirectly through the nature and operations of the 
companies that we choose to support with human and financial capital.
The Group therefore considers it important to establish and nurture businesses that comply with existing 
applicable environmental, ethical and social legislation. It is also important that these businesses can 
demonstrate that an appropriate strategy is in place to meet future applicable legislative and regulatory 
requirements and that these businesses can operate to specific industry standards, striving for best practice.
We are establishing detailed processes and controls to enable regular and routine reporting of greenhouse 
gas emissions on a consistent basis. It has therefore not been practicable to provide data concerning the 
annual quantity of emissions from activities for which the Group is responsible (including the combustion of 
fuel and the operation of any facility); nor has it been practicable to disclose the annual quantity of emissions 
resulting from the purchase of electricity, heat, steam, or cooling by the Group for our own use. We fully 
anticipate complying in full, in future years, with the required reporting requirements.
Our Business Ethics and Social Responsibility
The Group seeks to conduct all of its operating and business activities in an honest, ethical and socially 
responsible manner. We are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our business 
dealings and relationships wherever we operate, and for its directors and staff to have due regard to 
the interest of all of its stakeholders including investors, university and government partners, employees, 
suppliers and the businesses in which the Group invests.
We take a zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and implement and enforce effective systems 
to counter bribery. The Group is bound by the laws of the UK, including the Bribery Act 2010, and has 
implemented policies and procedures to address such laws, as well as the laws in each jurisdiction where 
the Group operates, including, the US.
The Group’s management and employees are fundamental to our success and as a result we are 
committed to encouraging the ongoing development of our staff with the aim of maximising the Group’s 
overall performance. Emphasis is placed on staff development through work-based learning, with senior

members of staff acting as coaches and mentors. Allied Minds has continued to employ regular all-staff 
update meetings as the main source of employee communication.
Employee Diversity and Employment Policies
The Group seeks to operate as a responsible employer and has adopted standards which promote 
corporate values designed to help and guide employees in their conduct and business relationships. The 
Group seeks to comply with all laws, regulations and rules applicable to its business and to conduct the 
business in line with applicable established best practice. The Group’s policy is one of equal opportunity in 
the selection, training, career development and promotion of employees, regardless of age, gender, sexual 
orientation, ethnic origin, religion and whether disabled or otherwise. The Group had 359 employees and 
consultants as at 31 December 2015. A breakdown of employees by gender can be seen in the illustrations 
below. Allied Minds supports the rights of all people as set out in the UN Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and ensures that all transactions the Group enters into uphold these principles.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
 
Statement by Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to present, on behalf of the Board, the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 
2015. Our Remuneration Policy, which was approved by shareholders at our 2015 AGM, was applied 
in 2015. During the latter half of 2015, the Remuneration Committee carried out a thorough review of all 
elements of remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management which considered feedback 
received from major shareholders and shareholder advisory services in connection with the implementation 
and adoption of the initial Remuneration Policy in 2015. As a result of this process, the new Remuneration 
Policy for the Executive and Non-Executive Directors on pages 74 to 86, will be put to a binding shareholder 
vote at the AGM on 26 May 2016. Subject to shareholder approval, the new Remuneration Policy will take 
formal effect from that date. If the new Remuneration Policy is not approved by shareholders, the current 
policy will remain in effect.
The Work of the Remuneration Committee
The year ended 31 December 2015 was the first full year of operation for the Remuneration Committee. The 
Committee met on four occasions during the year. Messrs. Sharer, Davis, Dolan and Rohr, as applicable, 
were present at all meetings during the year. I was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 
04 June 2015, and I met several times throughout the financial year with members of senior management in 
order to review all elements of remuneration and their operation. The Committee also received professional 
advice from the Hay Group where appropriate.
A key objective of this review was to ensure an appropriate Remuneration Policy was in place for a UK listed 
company, whilst also ensuring that it was designed to continue to attract and retain US-based management 
and employees of the highest caliber. The programme is weighted toward rewarding entrepreneurial 
achievement and the creation of shareholder value over time. During the year, the key activities carried out 
by the Committee were:
•	 Carried out a thorough review of all elements of remuneration for Executive Directors and senior 
management;
•	 Reviewed feedback received from major shareholders and shareholder advisory services in connection 
with the implementation and adoption of the initial Remuneration Policy in 2015;
•	 In connection with the annual review of the Remuneration Policy, revised and proposed the adoption of 
the new Remuneration Policy;
•	 In the new Remuneration Policy, provided for (i) a revised process for the determination of annual cash 
incentive bonus awards which will utilise specific performance targets and weighting set in advance 
from year to year, and (ii) revised performance metrics for future long term incentive plan (LTIP) awards 
to be solely based upon relative total shareholder return (rTSR);
•	 Reviewed the LTIP to ensure that it continues to advance the Committee’s policy to provide a 
competitive, performance-linked, long-term incentive mechanism to align the interests of management 
and shareholders;
•	 Determined the cash incentive bonus awards for the Executive Officers for the last financial year;
•	 Determined base salaries of the Executive Directors, for the period starting 01 January 2016;
•	 Issued LTIP awards at 04 June 2015;

Management and
Governance
•	 Reviewed progress against 2014 and 2015 LTIP award performance targets for the last financial year;
•	 Established 2014 and 2015 LTIP award performance targets for the current financial year; and
•	 Reviewed the remuneration reporting regulations in connection with the review and revision of the 
Group’s Remuneration Policy and preparation of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Objectives of the Remuneration Policy
In setting the new Remuneration Policy, the Committee focused on simple and transparent market 
competitive remuneration and incentive schemes. The proposed Remuneration Policy is designed to:
•	 attract, retain and motivate high caliber US-based senior management, and to focus them on the 
delivery of the Company’s long-term strategic and business objectives;
•	 promote a strong, fair and sustainable performance culture;
•	 incentivise growth and the achievement of milestones;
•	 align the interests of Executive Directors and members of the senior management team with those of 
shareholders through equity ownership; and
•	 be simple to understand and implement, and designed taking into account best practice guidelines for 
UK listed companies.
The key components of remuneration are set out in detail within the new Remuneration Policy, which will 
be subject to a binding vote at our 2016 AGM.
Performance and Reward for 2015
As outlined earlier in this Annual Report, the Group’s performance has been strong, with progress across 
many of the Group’s portfolio businesses contributing to a significant increase in the Group Subsidiary 
Ownership Adjusted Value (GSOAV) of $535.8 million as of 31 December 2015, compared to $488.0 million 
at 31 December 2014, which was an increase of $47.8 million, or 9.8%. In addition, the Group share price 
performance was as follows: 421.9p share price, the 30-day trailing average as at 31 December 2015, an 
increase of 32.5% over the 318.3p share price, the 30-day trailing average as at 31 December 2014.
As detailed in this Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Committee determined to provide cash incentive 
bonus awards and LTIP awards to the Executive Directors that reflected the level of performance and 
achievement in 2015.
Shareholder Feedback
The Committee recognises that building a close relationship with shareholders can complement the work 
of the Committee in developing the Remuneration Policy. In connection with our first AGM, we received 
feedback from major shareholders and shareholder advisory services with respect to our remuneration 
programme. One of our overarching aims has been to develop a Remuneration Policy which closely aligns 
the interests of our senior executives and our shareholders, and with this in mind, we are asking our 
shareholders to vote for the new Remuneration Policy at the 2016 AGM.

What is in this report?
The Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the Remuneration Policy for the Company on pages 74 to 
86, describes the implementation of that Remuneration Policy, and discloses the amounts paid relating to 
the year ended 31 December 2015. It has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended. The Remuneration Policy 
has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014, the 
Listing Rules and shareholders’ executive remuneration guidelines.
The Remuneration Policy for the Executive and Non-Executive Directors on pages 74 to 86, will be put to a 
binding shareholder vote at the AGM on 26 May 2016. Subject to shareholder approval, the Remuneration 
Policy will take formal effect from that date. If the new Remuneration Policy is not approved by shareholders, 
the current policy will remain in effect.
The Statement by Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on pages 70 to 72, and the Annual 
Remuneration Report on pages 87 to 97, will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM.
As explained in the basis of consolidation accounting policy, the Group’s financial statements reflect the 
continuation of the pre-existing Group headed by Allied Minds, Inc. (now Allied Minds, LLC). In keeping with 
that accounting, the Company has chosen to include the remuneration of these directors when they were 
directors of Allied Minds, Inc. (now Allied Minds, LLC) or any of its subsidiaries.
Remuneration Policy Overview
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for determining remuneration for the Executive Directors, 
and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management. The Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on the Company’s website.
The Committee designed this Remuneration Policy with close regard to market practice in other UK listed 
companies so as to ensure that the arrangements are appropriately competitive and structured in line with 
best practice. However, the Remuneration Policy also retains some of the key elements which helped to 
drive the Group’s success prior to IPO, and other customary service arrangements and incentive elements 
for US-based management and employees.
Allied Minds’ success depends in part on the talent of its management and employees. Allied Minds has 
a highly skilled workforce, with significant expertise throughout the Group across a range of science and 
technology disciplines, as well as a highly experienced management team. Allied Minds seeks to ensure that 
its management team and its employees and consultants working within the Group’s individual businesses 
are fairly and appropriately rewarded and incentivised. Allied Minds seeks to achieve this through a 
combination of competitive levels of remuneration that is appropriate to the scale of responsibility and 
performance of the employee or consultant, and incentives tied directly to increasing shareholder value.

Management and
Governance
The Group operates in the highly competitive US market, and attraction and retention of individual talent is 
important to success of the Group’s businesses. Allied Minds deploys a careful and considered approach 
to remuneration with the objective of attracting, motivating and retaining individuals of the necessary caliber. 
It is important to note that each national market for talent is different, making cross-border comparisons 
very difficult. In addition to general standard of living costs, there are large differences with respect to taxes, 
pensions, provision of cars, and medical plans and costs, among many others.
The Company believes that it is important that remuneration is weighted toward rewarding entrepreneurial 
achievement and the creation of shareholder value over time as its employees work toward the 
commercialisation of scientific and technological innovations. Accordingly, Allied Minds has established 
share incentive plans with the aim of incentivising and rewarding employees and Directors to achieve long 
term shareholder value. The Directors believe the share incentive arrangements at the level of the subsidiary 
businesses, as well as the overall Group, are an important factor in the promotion of shareholder value 
creation.
The aim of the Remuneration Policy is to attract, retain and motivate high caliber senior management and 
employees, and to focus them on the delivery of the Company’s long-term strategic and business objectives, 
to promote a strong and sustainable performance culture, incentivise growth and the achievement of 
milestones, and to align the interests of Executive Directors and senior management team with those 
of shareholders through equity ownership. In promoting these objectives the Remuneration Policy aims 
to be simple in design, transparent and understandable both to participants and Shareholders, and has 
been structured so as to adhere to the principles of good corporate governance and appropriate risk 
management.

Remuneration Policy (pages 74 to 86)
The Remuneration Policy for the Executive and Non-Executive Directors will be put to a binding shareholder 
vote at the AGM on 26 May 2016. If approved by shareholders, the Remuneration Policy will take formal 
effect from that date. The Remuneration Committee will consider the Remuneration Policy annually to 
ensure that it continues to align with the Company’s strategic objectives; however, it is intended that 
the Remuneration Policy will apply for three years from the 2016 AGM. If, during that timeframe, any 
amendments need to be made to the Remuneration Policy, it will be presented to the shareholders to be 
voted on.
How the views of shareholders and employees are taken into account
The Committee does not formally consult directly with employees on executive pay but does receive periodic 
updates in relation to salary and bonus reviews across the Company. As set out in the Remuneration Policy 
table below, in setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the Committee takes note of the overall 
approach to reward for employees in the Company and salary increases will ordinarily be considered in 
light of those of the wider workforce. Thus, the Committee is satisfied that the decisions made in relation to 
Executive Directors’ pay are made with an appropriate understanding of the wider workforce.
Any feedback received from time to time from shareholders will be considered as part of the Committee’s 
annual review of the Remuneration Policy. The Committee will seek to engage with shareholders and their 
representative bodies when it is proposed that any material changes are to be made to the Remuneration 
Policy. The voting outcomes from the 2015 AGM are available on page 97.

The Future Remuneration Policy Table for Executive Directors
The total remuneration package is structured so that variable elements (annual bonus and long-term 
incentives) make up a significant proportion of the package, with the emphasis on variable pay focused on 
long-term incentives. The tables below summarise the key aspects of the Company’s Remuneration Policy 
for Executive Directors.
Element of 
Remuneration
How it supports the 
Company’s Short and

Metrics
Salary The Company is required 
to provide an appropriate 
level of salary in order 
to be competitive and 
to maintain its ability to 
recruit and retain Executive 
Directors. Salaries are set 
to achieve this objective.
The Committee wishes 
to ensure that fixed costs 
are minimised and that 
total actual payments to 
executives will be driven to 
a more significant extent 
through the operation of 
the performance related 
elements of the package.
As described in this 
Remuneration Policy, the 
performance elements of 
total reward are directly 
linked to the achievement 
of the Company’s strategic 
objectives.
An Executive 
Director’s basic 
salary is considered 
by the Committee 
on appointment and 
normally reviewed once 
per year or when there 
is a significant change 
to role or responsibility.
When making a 
determination as 
to the appropriate 
remuneration, the 
Committee, where it is 
relevant, benchmarks 
the remuneration 
against the Company’s 
peer groups.
For the purpose 
of benchmarking 
salaries and other 
remuneration, the 
principal peer grouping 
used by the Company 
consists of companies 
within similar industry 
sectors which are 
either US or UK 
listed with a range of 
capitalisations.
The results of 
benchmarking will, 
however only be one 
of a number of factors 
taken into account 
by the Remuneration 
Committee and which 
will include:
•	 	 scale,	scope	and	
responsibility of the 
role;
•	 	 skills	and	experience	
of the individual;
•	 	 retention	risk;
•	 	 base	salary	of	other	
employees; and
•	 	 economic	
environment.
There is no prescribed maximum annual 
salary. The Committee is satisfied that 
the salaries conform to its strategy, whilst 
remaining competitive against similar roles 
within the relevant peer groups.
The current salaries for the Executive 
Directors are:
2016 
$’000

Chris Silva $515 $500 01 Jan
There are no performance

there are a number of 
performance-based factors 
both at the individual and 
Company level that influence 
the level of salaries provided to 
Executive Directors for annual 
performance appraisals.

Benefits The Committee’s intention 
is to provide a benefits 
package in line with US 
employment market 
practice.
The Company is required 
to provide this benefits 
package in order to 
be competitive and to 
maintain its ability to recruit 
and retain Executive 
Directors.
The Executive Directors 
may be entitled to the 
following benefits:
•	 	 life	insurance;
•	 	 disability	insurance;
•	 	 medical	 benefits	 and	
dental care;
•	 	 a	car	allowance;
•	 	 an	annual	payment	
to cover personal 
legal and tax advice.
Executive Directors 
may also participate in 
any all-employee share 
plans that may be 
operated by the Group 
from time to time on 
the same terms as 
other employees.
Additional benefits, 
which may include 
relocation expenses, 
housing allowance or 
other benefits-in-kind, 
may be provided in 
certain circumstances if 
considered appropriate 
and reasonable by the 
Committee, including 
as may be required on 
recruitment.
This is the cost of providing those benefits 
detailed herewith which in 2015 was as 
follows:
Benefits 
Cost  
$’000
Chris Silva $42
The cost of benefits provided changes in 
accordance with market conditions and 
will, therefore, determine the maximum 
amount that would be paid in the form 
of benefits. There is therefore no overall 
maximum opportunity under this this 
component of the Remuneration Policy.
There are no performance 
conditions attached to the 
payment of benefits.

Cash 
Incentive 
Bonus 
Awards
The cash incentive bonus 
award, taken together with 
base salary, is required in 
order to be competitive 
and to maintain the ability 
to recruit and retain 
Executive Directors. Cash 
incentive bonus awards 
are set to achieve this 
objective.
As described in this 
Remuneration Policy, the 
performance elements 
of cash incentive bonus 
awards and total reward 
are directly linked to 
the achievement of the 
Company’s strategic 
objectives.
The Committee and 
senior management 
review the Group’s 
management by 
objectives (MBOs) 
annually prior to 
the start of each 
financial year to 
ensure the detailed 
performance measures 
and weightings are 
appropriate and 
continue to support the 
business strategy.
Annual MBOs, 
including financial, 
operational, technical 
and other performance 
targets and their 
weightings for the 
upcoming year are set 
at or around the start of 
each financial year.
An Executive Director’s 
cash incentive bonus 
award is considered by 
the Committee upon 
completion of each 
financial year. The 
decision to provide any 
cash incentive bonus 
award and the amount 
and terms of any such 
award, are determined 
solely by the level of 
achievement against 
the MBOs set by the 
Committee at the start 
of the financial year.
There are no caps on the amount of 
bonus which may be paid. However, 
each year the Committee determines the 
maximum opportunity for each Executive 
Director. The maximum opportunity for 
each Executive Director in 2016 is set at 
150% of base salary.
When making a determination as to 
the appropriate maximum bonus, 
the Committee, where it is relevant, 
benchmarks the remuneration against the 
Company’s peer groups.
For the purpose of benchmarking cash 
incentive bonus awards and other 
remuneration, the principal peer grouping 
used by the Company consists of 
companies within similar industry sectors 
which are either US or UK listed with a 
range of capitalisations.
The cash incentive bonus awards in 2015 
were as follows:
Cash Incentive 
Bonus Award 
$’000
Chris Silva $525
As noted in “Operation”, the 
decision to provide any cash 
incentive bonus award and the 
amount and terms of any such 
award, are determined solely 
by the level of achievement 
against the MBOs set by the 
Committee at the start of the 
financial year.
The Committee may consider 
any and all performance criteria 
in setting the annual MBOs to 
be used in the determination 
to provide an award, and may 
generally consider:
•	 	 the	general	performance	
of the Group, including 
financial, operational, 
technical and other 
performance targets; and
•	 	 the	individual	performance	of	
the Executive Director.
Weighting will be primarily 
towards Group, and not 
individual, MBO performance 
for Executive Directors.
Performance will typically be 
measured over one year.

Pension It is the Committee’s 
intention to provide 
pension benefits in line with 
US employment market 
practice.
The Company is not 
required to provide pension 
benefits in order to be 
competitive and to ensure 
its ability to recruit and 
retain Executive Directors.
No element of the 
Executive Directors’ 
remuneration is 
pensionable. The 
Group does not 
operate any pension 
scheme or other 
scheme providing 
retirement or similar 
benefits. The Group 
does not contribute 
to any personal 
pension schemes for 
employees.
However, the Company 
offers a retirement plan 
in accordance with 
subsection 401(k) of 
the Internal Revenue 
Code (401(k) Plan) 
in which Executive 
Directors may make 
voluntary pre-tax 
contributions toward 
their own retirement. 
The Company does not 
make any payments or 
contributions to such 
401(k) Plan.

Allied Minds 
Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(LTIP)
The LTIP provides a 
competitive, performance-
linked long-term incentive 
mechanism that will:
•	 	 attract,	retain	and	
motivate individuals with 
the required personal 
attributes, skills and 
experience;
•	 	 provide	a	real	incentive	
to achieve the 
Company’s long-term 
strategic objectives; and
•	 	 align	the	interests	of	
management and 
shareholders.
The LTIP is reviewed 
annually at or around 
the start of each 
financial year to 
ensure the detailed 
performance measures 
and weightings are 
appropriate and 
continue to support the 
business strategy.
Financial and/or non-
financial performance 
targets are set at or 
around the start of 
each financial year.
Awards under the LTIP 
to Executive Directors 
will normally take the 
form of restricted share 
units (RSUs) (a form 
of conditional share 
award) in respect of 
shares in Allied Minds 
(although instruments 
with similar economic 
effect may be used if 
considered appropri-
ate.)
Calculations of the 
achievement of the 
vesting targets are 
reviewed and approved 
by the Committee.
Awards are subject to 
cancellation or claw-
back provisions under 
which in the event of 
a material correction 
of any accounts of 
the Company used to 
assess satisfaction of 
any performance con-
ditions, or in the event 
of a participant’s gross 
misconduct, awards 
may be reduced, 
adjusted or cancelled 
as determined by the 
Committee. Clawback 
applies for the two 
year period following 
vesting.
Under the terms of the LTIP, the maximum 
value of Ordinary Shares over which 
awards under the LTIP may be granted 
to a participant in any financial year of 
the Company may not generally exceed 
300% of base salary for that financial 
year, unless circumstances arise which 
the Committee believe justify granting an 
award outside this limit. The Committee 
would only envisage overriding the 300% 
limit in exceptional circumstances such 
as where there was a need to do so to 
attract a new executive.
Notwithstanding the maximum value 
permitted under the terms of the LTIP, 
each year the Committee determines the 
maximum opportunity for each Executive 
Director. The maximum opportunity for 
each Executive Director in 2016 is set at 
225% of base salary.
During 2015, the LTIP awards made 
to the Chief Executive Officer had a 
maximum value of 233% of base salary.
When making a determination as to 
the appropriate maximum LTIP award, 
the Committee where it is relevant, 
benchmarks the remuneration against the 
Company’s peer groups.
For the purpose of benchmarking 
LTIP awards and other remuneration, 
the principal peer grouping used by 
the Company consists of companies 
within similar industry sectors which are 
either US or UK listed with a range of 
capitalisations.
Specific performance targets 
may vary from year to year in 
accordance with priorities support 
the business strategy.
In respect of the LTIP awards 
made in 2014 and 2015, vesting 
is dependent upon performance 
metrics measured as follows:
•	 	 60% of each award will be 
subject to performance conditions 
based on the Company’s 
total shareholder return (TSR) 
performance in respect of a  
three-year period; and
•	 	 40%	of	each	award	will	
be subject to performance 
conditions based on a basket 
of shareholder value metrics, 
including, but not limited to:
(i) the increase in quality of 
pipeline intellectual property 
reviewed; (ii) the increase 
in quality of the partnership 
pipeline; and (iii) subsidiary 
level performance (assessed 
by reference to such matters 
as external funding raised, 
corporate collaborations, 
product co-development and 
proof of principal commercial 
pilots and revenues). 
Performance will be assessed 
on these measures on a 
scorecard basis over a three 
year period.
At the end of the three year 
period, performance against 
the relevant measures will be 
calculated to determine the 
number of Ordinary Shares 
capable of vesting. For the 
2014 awards, 50% of the award 
will then vest at that time. The 
remaining 50% will vest in two 
equal tranches in years 4 and 5 
subject to the relevant participant 
still being employed within the 
Group at the relevant vesting date. 
For the 2015 awards, 100% of the 
award will vest at the end of the 
three year period.
The level of vesting for threshold 
performance for the 2015 awards 
is 33.33% of the maximum. 
The level of vesting for target 
performance is 66.67% of the 
maximum.
Starting in 2016, the Committee 
expects to make annual 
awards under the LTIP with 
100% of each award subject to 
performance conditions based 
on the Company’s relative 
total shareholder return (rTSR) 
performance in respect of a three-
year period. The Group TSR will be 
measured relative to the FTSE 250, 
the S&P 500, and a peer group of 
four publicly-traded companies.
The level of vesting for threshold 
performance is 16.67% of the 
maximum. The level of vesting for 
target performance is 66.67% of 
the maximum.

Allied Minds 
Phantom Plan
The Committee intention 
is to reward participants 
for a successful subsidiary 
company liquidity event. 
The Committee recognises 
that successful subsidiary 
company liquidity events 
are a key strategic 
objective of the Group 
and its shareholders, 
and believes that the 
Phantom Plan is designed 
to align the interests of 
the Executive Directors 
and management of Allied 
Minds with such objective.
The Phantom Plan is 
a performance-based, 
cash settled bonus 
plan for Allied Minds’ 
Executive Directors 
and management. The 
Plan is triggered by a 
successful subsidiary 
liquidity event, including 
(i) a subsidiary IPO, 
(ii) the sale of all or 
substantially all of a 
subsidiary company’s 
assets, (iii) the sale of at 
least two-thirds of the 
outstanding shares of a 
subsidiary company’s 
voting equity, (iv) the 
merger or consolidation 
of a subsidiary 
company with or into 
another entity, or (v) a 
subsidiary company’s 
liquidation. Upon a 
liquidity event, Allied 
Minds will deduct the 
amount it invested 
in such subsidiary 
company and deduct 
the accrued interest 
in respect of such 
investment, and will 
then allocate 10% 
of the remaining 
net proceeds to the 
Phantom Plan account 
for allocation among 
the participants.
Participation in the 
Phantom Plan is 
evidenced by “units.”
Vesting of units is 
determined at the time 
of grant of the units. 
Current intention is 
for a proportion of the 
units to vest at grant 
and the remainder on 
an annual basis over a 
two year period.
The maximum aggregate number of units 
that may be awarded under the Phantom 
Plan is 200,000 units.
Upon a liquidity event Allied Minds will 
distribute 80% of the Phantom Plan 
account to the participants based on 
their pro rata share of all vested units 
on the date of the applicable liquidation 
event, and the remaining 20% of the 
Phantom Plan account will be distributed 
to participants at the discretion of the 
Committee.
Notwithstanding the 20% discretionary 
allocation, it is the current intention of 
the Committee to allocate 100% of the 
Phantom Plan account to the participants 
based on their pro rata share of all vested 
units.
No amounts accrue under the 
Phantom Plan, and no amounts 
are distributed to participants, 
until and unless a successful 
subsidiary company liquidity 
event occurs, and the cash 
generated in such liquidity 
event exceeds the amount 
Allied Minds invested in such 
subsidiary company, plus 
accrued interest and expenses 
in respect of such investment. 
No other performance metrics 
apply.

Non-Executive 
Directors’ Fees
The Company’s 
intention is to set fees 
at a level necessary 
to attract and retain 
experienced and skilled 
Non-Executive Directors 
with the necessary 
experience and 
expertise to advise and 
assist in establishing 
and monitoring the 
strategic objectives of 
the Company. Fees 
also reflect the time 
commitment and 
responsibilities of the 
roles.
An additional fee is paid 
for Chairmanship of a 
Board Committee and 
to the Chairman of the 
Board.
Non-Executive 
Directors have specific 
terms of engagement 
provided in formal 
letters of appointment. 
Their remuneration 
is determined by 
the Board, taking 
into account 
recommendations 
from the Remuneration 
Committee, within the 
limits set by the Articles 
of Association and 
based on equivalent 
roles in FTSE 250 
companies and the 
peer groups used for 
Executive Directors. The 
fees for Non-Executive 
Directors are reviewed 
annually and fixed for 
the fiscal year. The 
Non-Executive Directors 
are appointed for a 
three year term, subject 
to annual re-election by 
the shareholders, at the 
Company’s AGM.
Non-Executive Directors 
do not receive any cash 
incentive bonus and 
do not participate in 
any Company pension 
scheme.
The Non-Executive 
Directors are eligible 
for RSU awards under 
the LTIP. Awards to 
the Non-Executive 
Directors will be subject 
to time-based vesting 
provisions, and will 
not be subject to 
performance metrics. 
Each Non-Executive 
Director is also entitled 
to reimbursement of 
reasonable and properly 
documented expenses 
incurred in performing 
the duties of their office.
The current fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors 
are as detailed below. In each case the fees paid take 
account of responsibilities in acting as Chairman of the 
Board, Chairman of a Board Committee or as Senior 
Independent Director.

The fees proposed to be paid to the Chairman shall 
only be payable where the Chairman is a Non-Executive 
Director. Given the US-based nature of the Group’s 
business, and the need to attract and retain independent 
directors with significant US business and leadership 
experience, the proposed fees above include an equity 
component, based upon a recommendation from 
the Hay Group. The Committee is satisfied that the 
level of fees conform to its strategy, whilst remaining 
competitive against similar roles within the relevant peer 
groups. Careful consideration has been given as to 
whether including an equity component would affect the 
independence of the Non-Executive Directors, and the 
conclusion was reached that it would not, given the level 
of the awards and the fact that they are not performance-
related.
There are no 
performance 
conditions 
attached to the 
payment of fees or 
the vesting under 
the awards granted 
under the LTIP.

The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office, 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Remuneration Policy set out in the tables on the previous 
pages, where the terms of the payment were agreed either: (i) before the policy came into effect, or (ii) at a 
time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these 
purposes “payments” include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to 
an award over shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the award is granted. Details of 
any such payments will be set out in the Annual Remuneration Report as they arise.
Differences between the Remuneration Policy and that applied to employees generally
The components of remuneration set out on the previous pages for Executive Directors are also applied 
to the Group’s senior management team and differ only in values and award maxima. The basic benefits 
package is typically available to all US employees at the Group level following completion of a probationary 
period. Overall, there is more emphasis on variable pay for the Executive Directors and senior management, 
but all US employees at the Group level are eligible for discretionary cash incentive bonus awards. In 
addition, the Company is committed to fostering alignment with shareholders through widespread share 
ownership, and thus all US employees at the Group level are eligible to participate in the LTIP. The Group 
has also implemented equity incentive plans within its subsidiaries in order to incentivise employees within 
the subsidiary businesses. Generally, the employees of the subsidiary businesses do not participate in any 
of the Group level incentive plans. The Chief Executive Officer of each of our most significant subsidiaries 
may participate in the future in the LTIP, but the levels of such awards under the LTIP are not expected to 
be a significant percentage of their total compensation.
Schemes or arrangements under which allocations or awards are no longer being made
In addition to the Executive Directors’ remuneration arrangements set forth in the Remuneration Policy, 
the Group previously maintained the Allied Minds Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan (US Stock Plan). 
The Company does not intend to make any further grants under the US Stock Plan. The interests of 
the Executive Directors in outstanding options under the US Stock Plan are shown in the statement of 
directors’ shareholding and share interest on page 90 of this Annual Report.
The exercise price of the options is equivalent to the fair market value of Common Stock of Allied Minds, 
Inc. (now Allied Minds, LLC) as at the date of grant of the options and all outstanding options have already 
vested and become exercisable.

made based on a percentage of the participant’s salary in face value terms and therefore the above amounts relating to the LTIP 
component reflect this. Changes in the value of those shares over the vesting period are therefore ignored.
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration
The Committee will apply the Remuneration Policy for any new Executive Director recruited to the Board in 
respect of all elements of forward-looking remuneration. The maximum level of variable remuneration under 
the cash incentive bonus awards and LTIP that may be awarded will be within the usual maximums set out 
in the Remuneration Policy, subject to the exceptions permitted under the LTIP. The Committee retains 
flexibility to provide benefits in kind, pensions and other allowances, such as relocation, education and tax 
equalisation, required in order to recruit the intended candidate.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buy out remuneration arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will seek to structure buyout awards 
on a comparable basis to awards forfeited, taking into account relevant factors including any performance 
conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted (e.g. cash or shares) and the 
020_c112021_5.5.indd   83 21/04/2016   13:26 Page 84 of 165
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
 
timeframe of awards. It is intended that the value awarded would be no higher than the expected value of 
the forfeited awards. The Committee would seek as far as possible to make such buyout awards under the 
Company’s existing share plans but, if necessary, may rely on the Listing Rules exemption which allows for 
the grant of awards to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the recruitment of a Director.
Similarly, the Remuneration Policy for a new Chairman or new Non-executive Directors would be to apply 
the same remuneration elements as applicable to existing Non-Executive Directors under the Remuneration 
Policy.
In addition to the above principles, the following additional considerations may be applied as appropriate 
depending on the circumstances:
•	 In the case of internal promotion, any existing performance-related elements arising from an individual’s 
previous role will continue to be honored under the Remuneration Policy, even if they may not otherwise 
be consistent with the Remuneration Policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled.
•	 In the case of promotion to executive director following an acquisition or other business combination, 
the Committee may permit equity-based incentive arrangements to continue in force if they can be 
“rolled-up” into awards over Allied Minds’ shares provided the performance and vesting conditions are 
considered appropriate.
•	 In the case of the recruitment of an executive at a time of the year when it would be inappropriate or 
not possible to provide an LTIP award for that year (for instance due to price sensitive information or 
if there is insufficient time to assess performance), the quantum in respect of the months employed 
during the year may be transferred to and amalgamated with the subsequent year’s award if considered 
reasonable to do so by the Committee.
The Committee will include details of the implementation of the Remuneration Policy in respect of any such 
recruitment to the Board in its future Annual Remuneration Reports.
Service Contracts and Letters of Appointment
The Executive Director (Chris Silva) has a service contract that commenced in May 2014. At May 2016, 
and at each anniversary thereafter, the service contract shall be deemed to be automatically extended for 
successive periods of one year unless either party provides at least ninety (90) days’ written notice prior to 
the applicable renewal date of its intention not to extend the term of the service contract.
The Executive Director’s contract does not provide for extended notice periods or compensation in the 
event of a change of control. However, as noted below, the rules of the LTIP provide that, in the event of 
a change of control, awards would vest to the extent determined by the Committee where the Committee 
considers that the performance conditions are satisfied at the date of such event.
If the Executive Director’s employment is terminated by Allied Minds for “Cause”, he shall only be entitled to 
amounts that are accrued or owing but not yet paid and reimbursement of any properly incurred business 
expenses but excluding any bonus payments or other compensation provided pursuant to Allied Minds’ 
incentive compensation plan (such amounts, the “Standard Benefit”).

Management and
Governance
If the Executive Director terminates the service contract for “Good Reason” or Allied Minds terminates the 
service contract without Cause or following delivery by Allied Minds of a Non-Renewal Notice, the Executive 
Director shall be entitled to:
•	 payment of twenty four (24) months’ base salary in accordance with regular payroll;
•	 an annual incentive award equal to the product of: (A) the Executive Director’s average bonus for the 
prior three (3) years (the “Average Bonus”); and (B) a fraction based on the number of days in which the 
Executive Director was employed during that year;
•	 pro-rated payments equal to the Executive Director’s average bonus during any transition period whilst 
the Executive continues to receive base salary; and
•	 payment of the Standard Benefit.
The Executive Director will also be entitled to: (i) continued participation under medical insurance plans for a 
period of six (6) months for him and each of his eligible dependents; and (ii) continuation of life and disability 
insurance coverage for six (6) months.
In the event of death or disability, similar payments will be made as those payable as a termination for Good 
Reason save that the payment of base salary shall only continue for 90 days after the death of the Executive 
Director and/or until the commencement of long term disability payments in the case of termination due to 
disability.
The Executive Director may terminate his service contract without Good Reason at any time during the 
term of the employment, provided he gives at least ninety (90) days’ advance written notice. If the Executive 
Director terminates his employment with Allied Minds without Good Reason (and not because of his death or 
due to disability) or if such Executive Director delivers to Allied Minds a Non-Renewal Notice, the Executive 
Director shall be entitled solely to payment of the Standard Benefit.
Each of Rick Davis, Peter Dolan and Jeff Rohr have Non-Executive Director letters of appointment that 
commenced May 2014. Kevin Sharer and Jill Smith have Non-Executive Director letters of appointment 
that commenced June 2015 and January 2016, respectively. Each of the letters of appointment are for 
an initial fixed term of three years, which are reviewed and may be extended, and are terminable on one 
months’ notice by either party. The letters of appointment for the Non-Executive Directors do not provide 
for any compensation on termination.
The service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office. In accordance with the Code, all Directors submit themselves for election at the first AGM since their 
appointment to the Board, and for annual re-election by shareholders at each AGM.
Remuneration Policy on Payment for Loss of Office
The Directors believe the payments owed upon loss of office detailed below are customary and appropriate 
to attract and retain US-based senior management of the highest caliber.
The Committee reserves the right to make payments where they are made in good faith in discharge of 
an existing obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement or 
compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Director’s office or employment 
where they are in the best interests of Allied Minds and its shareholders and reflecting the directors’ 
contractual and legal rights.

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
 
Impact of Loss of Office on Awards under LTIP
Participants who cease to be employees, directors or service providers to the Group will normally forfeit 
any unvested awards.
However, if a participant leaves as a result of death, disability, dismissal other than for cause or any other 
reason determined by the Committee, awards will vest on the normal vesting date on a pro-rata basis 
taking into account performance and the period of time since the grant of the award and the date on which 
the participant ceased to provide services. The Committee may in its discretion determine that there are 
exceptional circumstances justifying vesting to a greater or lesser extent.
Impact of Change of Control on Awards under LTIP
If there is a change of control of the Company, the number of Ordinary Shares over which awards will vest 
will be calculated on the basis of the extent to which the performance criteria applicable to those awards 
have been satisfied as at the date of the change of control. The resulting number of shares will then be 
reduced on a pro rata basis to reflect the reduced period between the date the award was made and the 
date of the change of control, unless the Committee decides otherwise. In exceptional circumstances, the 
Committee may recommend full vesting. This discretion to accelerate vesting upon a change of control is 
included in the LTIP to meet the expectations of a US-based workforce.
Statement of Consideration of Employment Conditions Elsewhere in the Company
In considering changes to the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Committee is mindful of pay 
and conditions in the wider Group. Whilst the Group operates a range of bonus plans appropriate to its 
various businesses, the main drivers of these subsidiary plans, in common with the cash incentive bonus 
awards to Executive Directors, are the achievement of company milestones, and other company and 
individual objectives. The Committee has not expressly sought the views of employees and no remuneration 
comparison measurements were used when drawing up the Remuneration Policy. Through the Board, 
however, the Committee is regularly updated as to employees’ views on remuneration generally.
In the event that an employee is promoted to the Board, that individual would be allowed to retain any pre-
existing incentive entitlement that had not vested at that time.

awards vested under the LTIP during 2015 or 2014. In addition, no equity-based awards are expected to vest under the LTIP 
during 2016; however, the performance period for LTIP awards made during 2014 ends on 31 December 2016, and such awards 
may vest in April 2017.

Individual Elements of Remuneration
Base Salary and Cash Incentive Bonus Awards during 2015
The Remuneration Committee engaged the Hay Group to conduct a compensation benchmarking study 
for the Company’s senior management in conjunction with the Company’s 2015 year-end compensation 
process, including an analysis of the traditional elements of executive pay (base salary, annual cash 
incentive bonus, long-term equity incentives and total direct compensation). The Hay Group utilised a 
variety of information sources to evaluate the market for executive compensation, including an analysis of 
eight publicly-traded companies. For the purpose of benchmarking salaries and other remuneration the 
principal peer grouping used by the Company consisted of listed companies within similar industry sectors 
with a range of capitalisation.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
 
Based upon the results of the benchmarking study, the Remuneration Committee concluded each of the 
Executive Directors’ total direct compensation was still at or below the 50th percentile of the peer group. 
Given the strong Company performance in 2015, and the achievement of Company and individual goals, 
the Remuneration Committee recommended to the Board a modest 5% increase in the level of cash 
incentive bonus award, and a 25% increase in base salary, to move the Executive Director total direct 
compensation towards the 50th percentile of the peer group. The Remuneration Committee designed 
the increases to reflect its 2015 policy of moving the Executive Director compensation, in connection with 
superior performance, towards the 50th percentile of the peer group. The Remuneration Committee also 
designed the increases to emphasise the variable component of compensation, by allocating more of 
the increase to the cash incentive bonus award and not base salary. Notwithstanding the increases, the 
Executive Director total direct compensation remained below the median for the peer group during 2015. 
The increase in base salary is set forth in the Remuneration Policy tables above. The increase in cash 
incentive bonus award is reflected in the table above.

At 04 June 2015, the LTIP award above was granted to the Chief Executive Officer. The total value of 
the award has been calculated using the closing share price of 599p on such date. The level of award 
was determined by the Committee after giving due consideration to the 2014 Hay Group compensation 
benchmarking study which concluded that the target amount of the award ($775,000), or approximately 
150% of base salary, would position the CEO below the median for the peer group for total compensation 
during 2015. Vesting of the LTIP award is dependent upon performance metrics measured over the three 
years to 31 December 2017, details of which are set out in the Remuneration Policy table on page 79 of 
the Report. The level of vesting for threshold performance is 33.33% of the maximum. The level of vesting 
for target performance is 66.67% of the maximum.
At 04 June 2015, the LTIP awards above were granted to the Non-Executive Directors. The total value 
of the award has been calculated using the closing share price of 599p on such date. The level of award 
was determined by the Committee after giving due consideration to the 2014 Hay Group compensation 
benchmarking study which recommended such awards in light of the US-based nature of the Group’s 
business, and the need to attract and retain independent directors with significant US business and

leadership experience. Vesting of the LTIP award is based upon time of service, with each award vesting 
in three equal installments over a three year period. There are no performance conditions attached to the 
vesting under the awards granted under the LTIP.
Long Term Incentive Plan Vesting during 2015 (audited information)
The Company did not make any awards under the LTIP prior to 2014. Accordingly, no equity-based awards 
vested under the LTIP during 2015 or 2014. In addition, no equity-based awards are expected to vest 
under the LTIP during 2016; however, the performance period for LTIP awards made during 2014 ends on 
31 December 2016, and such awards may vest in April 2017.
US Stock Plan Awards made during 2015 (audited information)
The Company did not make any grants under the US Stock Plan in 2015, and does not intend to make 
any further grants. The interests of the Executive Directors in outstanding options under the US Stock Plan 
are shown in the statement of directors’ shareholding and share interest on page 90 of this Annual Report.
Payments to Past Directors (audited information)
No payments to past Directors were made during the last financial year.
Loss of Office Payments (audited information)
No payments for loss of office were made to past Directors during the last financial year.
Total Pension Entitlements (audited information)
No payments for pension entitlements were made to Directors during the last financial year. The Company 
offers a retirement plan in accordance with subsection 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (401(k) Plan) 
in which Executive Directors may make voluntary pre-tax contributions toward their own retirement. The 
Company does not make any payments or contributions to such 401(k) Plan.

Statement of Directors’ Shareholding and Share Interests (audited)
Share ownership plays a key role in the alignment of our executives with the interests of shareholders. 
In April 2016, the Remuneration Committee adopted a share ownership policy for Executive Directors 
and persons discharging managerial responsibility (PDMRs). The policy requires Executive Directors 
and PDMRs to acquire and maintain a minimum ownership level of ordinary shares in the capital of the 
Company, thereby helping to align their interests with those of shareholders. The Committee has set the 
current requirements at share value of 400% of base salary for Executive Officers, and share value of 300% 
of base salary for PDMRs. The Committee has not set a timeframe during which Executive Officers and 
PDMRs are required to accumulate their share ownership level. Whilst the policy was not in effect during the 
period, the Executive Director met this requirement, and all but one PDMR (the Chief Executive Officer) met 
this requirement, who had only been appointed in August 2015. The table below sets out the number of 
shares held by Directors as at 31 December 2015, and the Company is not aware of any changes through 
25 April 2016.

2015. For 2016, the Remuneration Committee has adopted a maximum cash incentive bonus award of 150% of base salary for 
Executive Officers.
(2)   No equity-based awards vested under the LTIP during 2015, 2014 or 2013. In addition, no equity-based awards are expected 
to vest under the LTIP during 2016; however, the performance period for LTIP awards made during 2014 ends on 31 December 
2016, and such awards may vest in April 2017.

peer groups. As noted above, based upon the results of the peer benchmarking study, the strong Company 
performance in 2015, and the achievement of Company and individual goals, the Board recommended a 
modest 3% increase in base salary. In addition, the 3% increase is consistent with the target cost-of-living 
increase that was implemented across the Group to US employees.
The benefits package during 2016 will continue to be in line with US employment market practice and the 
Remuneration Policy.
Cash Incentive Bonus Awards
The Remuneration Committee expects to implement the following changes to the cash incentive bonus 
awards, which are permitted under the current Remuneration Policy and shall permitted under the revised 
Remuneration Policy in this Annual Report. During 2015, there was no cap on the amount of bonus to 
be paid to Executive Directors. Under the revised Remuneration Policy, each year the Committee will 
determine the maximum opportunity for each Executive Director. The maximum opportunity for each 
Executive Director in 2016 is set at 150% of base salary, which is considered to be up to median level 
compared with the Company’s peer groups.
The Executive Director’s cash incentive bonus awards shall be considered by the Committee upon 
completion of the financial year. The decision to provide any cash incentive bonus award and the amount 
and terms of any such award, are determined solely by the level of achievement against the MBOs set by

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
 
the Committee at the start of the financial year. The annual MBOs, including financial, operational, technical 
and other performance targets and their weightings for the upcoming year were set at the start of 2016.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Remuneration Committee expects to implement the following changes to the LTIP awards, which 
are permitted under the current Remuneration Policy and shall permitted under the revised Remuneration 
Policy in this Annual Report. During 2015, there was no cap on the amount of LTIP award to be made to 
Executive Directors, other than the cap of 300% of base salary per financial year as specified in the LTIP. 
Under the revised Remuneration Policy, each year the Committee will determine the maximum opportunity 
for each Executive Director. The maximum opportunity for each Executive Director in 2016 is set at 225% 
of base salary, which is considered to be up to median level compared with the Company’s peer groups.
Starting in 2016, the Committee expects to make annual awards under the LTIP with 100% of each 
award subject to performance conditions based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return (rTSR) 
performance in respect of a three-year period. The Group TSR will be measured relative to the FTSE 
250, the S&P 500, and a peer group of four publicly-traded companies. The level of vesting for threshold 
performance is 16.67% of the maximum. The level of vesting for target performance is 66.67% of the 
maximum.
In respect of the 2014 and 2015 awards, the Committee expects vesting to continue to be dependent upon 
performance metrics as follows:
•	 60% of each award will be subject to performance conditions based on the Company’s total shareholder 
return performance in respect of a three-year period; and
•	 40% of each award will be subject to performance conditions based on a basket of shareholder value 
metrics, including but not limited to: (i) the increase in quality of pipeline intellectual property reviewed; 
(ii) the increase in quality of the partnership pipeline; and (iii) subsidiary level performance (assessed by 
reference to such matters as external funding raised, corporate collaborations, product co-development 
and proof of principal commercial pilots and revenues). Performance will be assessed on these measures 
on a scorecard basis over a three year period.
In respect of the 2014 and 2015 awards, at the end of the three year period, performance against the 
relevant measures will be calculated to determine the number of Ordinary Shares capable of vesting. The 
level of vesting for threshold performance will be 33.33% of the maximum. The level of vesting for target 
performance will be 66.67% of the maximum.

Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
Effective from 01 January 2016, the base salaries of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors will be:
 2016
Cash Component
Non-Executive Director Annual Fee $75,000
Audit Committee Chair Annual Fee $25,000
Remuneration Committee Chair Annual Fee $10,000
Nomination Committee Chair Annual Fee $10,000
Chairman of the Board Annual Fee $75,000
Equity Component
Non-Executive Director LTIP Award Value $50,000
Chairman of the Board LTIP Award Value $75,000
The Chairman, Non-Executive Director and Committee Chair annual fees set forth in the table above remain 
unchanged from 2015. The additional fee for serving as Chairman shall only be payable where the Chairman 
is a Non-Executive Director. Given the US-based nature of the Group’s business, and the need to attract 
and retain independent directors with significant US business and leadership experience, the proposed 
fees above include an equity component, which will have a time-based vesting schedule. Chris Silva, as an 
Executive Director, will not be entitled to any Board fees.
Outside Appointments for Executive Directors
Any proposed external directorships are considered and approved by the Board to ensure they do not 
cause a conflict of interest but, subject to this, Executive Directors may accept outside non-executive 
appointments.
Limits on the number of shares used to satisfy share awards (dilution limits)
All of the Group’s incentive schemes that contain an element that may be satisfied in Allied Minds plc shares 
incorporate provisions that in any ten-year period (ending on the relevant date of grant), the maximum 
number of the shares that may be issued or issuable under all such schemes shall not exceed 10% of 
the issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time (excluding shares issued pursuant to 
awards granted prior to IPO under the US Stock Plan).
The Committee regularly monitors the position and prior to the making of any share-based award, considers 
the effect of potential vesting of outstanding awards to ensure that the Company remains within these 
limits. Any awards which are required to be satisfied by market purchased shares are excluded from such 
calculations. No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended 31 December 2015.
Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The full terms of reference of the Committee, which are reviewed annually, are available on the Group’s 
website at www.alliedminds.com. In summary, the Remuneration Committee has specific responsibility 
for advising the Board on the remuneration and other benefits of executive directors, an overall policy in 
respect of remuneration of other employees of the Group and establishing the Group’s policy with respect 
to employee incentivisation schemes.

Activities during the year
The Committee’s activities for the year ended 31 December 2015 included the responsibilities set forth 
above, as well as the items set forth below:
Financial reporting
•	 Reviewed and approved the appropriate audit plan, before the start of the annual audit cycle;
•	 Reviewed and provided comments and recommendations in respect of the financial statements in the 
half-yearly report for the period ended 30 June 2015, and the financial statements in the Annual Report 
and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015;
•	 Reviewed the Company’s approach and methodology for determining the fair value of investments, 
including review of the fair value reports on the individual investments. Considered and recommended 
the involvement of external valuation specialist firm to assist management and the Board in deriving the 
fair value of the subsidiary undertakings;
•	 Considered significant matters, risk areas, and areas of judgement in relation to the Group’s financial 
statements taking into account the areas highlighted by the external auditors in their presentations to 
the Committee, and challenged where necessary.
The Committee is satisfied with the integrity of the financial statements of the Company in all material 
aspects, including the application of significant accounting policies, the methods used to account for 
significant transactions, use of judgements and estimates made by management, including those made in 
deriving the fair value of the subsidiary undertakings, and the quality and completeness of the disclosures 
in the financial statements of the Company.
Internal controls and risk management systems
•	 Reviewed the principal elements of the Company’s risk management framework as set out on pages 40 
to 45 of this Annual Report. The Committee gives consideration and provides guidance on enhancing 
the internal controls and risk management framework, as needed;
•	 Reviewed the established procedures, which provide a reasonable basis for the Board to make proper 
judgements on an ongoing basis as to the financial position and prospects (FPP) procedures of the 
Company following the adopted risk approach;
•	 Reviewed the whistleblower policy that was established and approved by the Board in 2014, which has 
been communicated to employees. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the policy has been designed 
to encourage staff to report suspected wrongdoing as soon as possible, provide staff with guidance 
on how to raise those concerns, and ensure staff that they should be able to raise genuine concerns 
without fear of reprisals, even if they turn out to be mistaken.
Significant areas reported to the Board
Valuation of Group subsidiaries
At the close of each annual financial period, the Directors formally approve the value of all subsidiary 
businesses in the Group, which is used to derive the Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value (GSOAV). 
This Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value is a sum-of-the-parts (‘‘SOTP’’) valuation of all the 
subsidiaries that make up the Group.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Audit Committee Report (continued)
 
The Audit Committee discusses with management and the auditors the appropriateness of the adopted 
methodology and approach in deriving the GSOAV. Further details of the Group valuation methodology are 
outlined in note 11 on pages 138 to 141. Although the fair values of the Group’s investments in subsidiaries 
are not included in the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, additional disclosures are 
provided in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This is a significant performance metric for 
the Group.
Financial instruments – subsidiary preferred shares
Certain of the Group’s subsidiaries have outstanding preferred shares which have been classified as 
subsidiary preferred shares in current liabilities as the subsidiaries have a contractual obligation to deliver 
cash or other assets to the holders under certain future liquidity events, and/or a requirement to deliver 
an uncertain number of common shares upon conversion. Significant judgement is used in determining 
the classification of these financial instruments in terms of liability or equity and significant estimates are 
made when determining the appropriate valuation methodology and deriving the estimated fair value of the 
subsidiary preferred shares. As such, they present a significant risk for the financial statements.
Capitalisation of development cost
Given the nature of our business, the Group incurs significant research and development costs. Due to 
the early stage of development of most of our subsidiaries, there is a limited history of achieving both 
technical feasibility and commercial viability that can be used as a base for assessing and determining 
whether the development costs have met the criteria for capitalisation. As such, key judgements are made 
in determining whether the capitalisation criteria are met, there is a risk of development cost not being 
appropriately capitalised, which in turn, is a significant risk for the financial statements.
External audit
•	 Reviewed and approved the scope of the external audit procedures over the half-yearly report for the 
period ended 30 June 2015, and the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 
2015;
•	 Discussed with management and agreed upon the terms of the engagement of the external auditors 
and the auditors’ remuneration for audit and non-audit services. In assessing independence, the Audit 
Committee received the auditor’s presentation and confirmation that in its professional judgment, KPMG 
is independent within the meaning of regulatory and professional requirements and the objectivity of the 
partner and audit staff is not impaired. The Committee was satisfied that throughout the year that the 
objectivity and independence of KPMG was not in any way impaired by the non-audit services they 
provided to the Group during the year, by the amounts of non-audit fees, or by any other factors;
•	 Assessed the independence, objectivity and qualifications of KPMG as the external auditor and 
evaluated the quality and effectiveness of the audit procedures. In doing so, the Committee reviewed 
the audit plan and monitored performance against the plan, reviewed the periodic reports of KPMG to 
the Committee that highlighted key areas of focus during the audit and the applied audit approach, and 
obtained feedback from the finance department in respect to quality and status of KPMG work in the 
course of the audit. The Committee concluded that the audit process during the year was effective;
•	 Reviewed and discussed the principal areas of financial reporting risk, as highlighted above, and 
reported to the Board.

Audit Committee Report (continued)
 
Management and
Governance
KPMG has been the external auditor of the Group since the first audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in 2008. The total fees to KPMG for the year ended 31 December 2015 were $0.5 million, of 
which $49 thousand were for non-audit services primarily related to tax compliance services (see note 5 of 
the consolidated financial statements). The Audit Committee has considered the recent European Union 
audit reforms in terms of tendering and auditor’s tenure. Given that the Group listed on the London Stock 
Exchange during 2014 and became a public interest entity (PIE), the next anticipated requirement to tender 
audit will be for the 2024 calendar year.
Internal audit
Given the size and composition of the Group, taking into account relevant significant matters, risk areas, 
areas of judgement in relation to the Group’s financial statements, and the centralised internal controls 
system in respect to the Group’s financial reporting process, the Board did not consider it necessary to 
have an internal audit function during the year. The Board will keep this decision under annual review.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Allied Minds plc for the year ended 31 December 2015 set out 
on pages 107 to 164. In our opinion:
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
•	 the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
•	 the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had 
the greatest effect on our audit were as follows (in decreasing order of significance):
Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value ($535.8 million) Risk vs 2014 
Refer to pages 99 to 100 (Audit Committee Report) and pages 138 to 141 (financial disclosures)
The risk — The Group owns 28 subsidiaries in which it has ownership stakes of between 48% and 100%. 
The results and financial position of the subsidiaries are consolidated in the group accounts. Although the 
Group’s holdings in subsidiaries are not included in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position at fair value, 
the financial statements do include additional disclosure in relation to the Group Subsidiary Ownership 
Adjusted Value of the subsidiaries, as, in the directors’ view, the fair value of the subsidiaries is very 
pertinent to the shareholders and other users of the financial statements. The valuation methodologies are 
based primarily on net present value or risk-adjusted net present value from discounted cash flows. A small 
minority of the valuations are based on recent third party investment or asset-based methodologies (see 
note 11 for more details). In the current year not all of the subsidiaries have been subject to a new valuation 
as at 31 December 2015 as management believes that the value of these subsidiaries has not changed 
significantly when compared to 31 December 2014. The Group’s subsidiaries are, for the most part, still 
at the development stage and the majority do not yet generate revenues. Due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting the trading of such companies the Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value 
disclosures in the group accounts, this has been determined to be a significant risk.
Our response — In this area our audit procedures included,
•	 Assessing the appropriateness of the valuation model used for each subsidiary and obtaining an 
understanding of how the forecasts are compiled.
•	 We obtained and analysed the valuations prepared by an external expert on behalf of the Company. We 
used our own valuation specialist to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used 
in the valuations.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Financial Statements
Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Allied Minds plc only (continued)
•	 We critically assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying the forecasts, including 
assumptions over projected revenue and operating costs and the discount rates applied, assessing 
also for consistency with the assumptions used in the prior year. In doing this we used our knowledge of 
each subsidiary and its industry with reference to both internal management information and externally 
derived data and benchmarks, including market size data, royalty rates and competitor analyses based 
on information publically available.
•	 Where values are based on recent transactions from third party investments we assessed the accuracy 
of the data used.
•	 Where no new valuations have been prepared in the current year or there was no third party funding 
round in the year we assessed the trading performance of the related subsidiaries compared to 
forecasts. We challenged the Group’s explanation of variances and considered the progression of the 
entity towards achieving milestones set.
•	 We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures were consistent with the valuations performed and 
whether the Group’s disclosures adequately highlight the uncertainty inherent in the valuations.
Financial instruments – preferred shares classification and valuation ($94.1 million) Risk vs 
2014 (New risk)
Refer to page 100 (Audit Committee Report), pages 114 to 116 (accounting policy) and pages 146 to 147 
and 149 to 150 (financial disclosures)
The risk – The Group finances its operations and subsidiaries partly through financial instruments such 
as preferred shares. There is a significant level of judgement in relation to assessing the terms of the 
instruments to identify whether the instruments meets the criteria to be classified as debt or equity (and the 
resulting NCI impact); Further, the Group has elected to fair value the financial instruments through profit 
and loss. There is a significant level of judgement around the assumptions used. Due to these factors this 
has been determined to be a significant risk.
Our response – in this area our audit procedures included,
•	 We critically assessed the conclusions reached by the Group in relation to the debt versus equity 
classification of the issued financial instruments by considering the key terms and features of the 
contracts through applying and interpreting the relevant sections of the accounting standards and also 
assessing the impact of the classification on the NCI disclosure;
•	 We obtained and analysed the valuations prepared by an external expert on behalf of the Company and 
we critically assessed the appropriateness of the valuation models used in determining the fair value of 
the financial instruments;
•	 We used our own valuation specialist to assist us in critically assessing the key inputs which require 
significant estimation and judgement in their selection and can have a significant impact on the derived 
fair value, specifically the time to the conversion event which is relevant where there are conversion 
options, the probability weighting, the discount rate and the volatility assumptions. These key inputs 
were assessed for reasonableness by reference to external data or internal information such as available 
market information;

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the members of Allied Minds plc only (continued)
•	 We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures were consistent with the conclusions reached in 
relation to both the classification of the financial instruments and in relation to the key assumptions 
related to the valuations and whether the Group’s disclosures adequately highlight the uncertainty 
inherent in the valuations.
Capitalisation of development costs ($0.2 million) Risk vs 2014 
Refer to page 100 (Audit Committee Report), pages 116 to 117 (accounting policy) and pages 134 to 135 
(financial disclosures)
The risk – The Group incurs significant research and development costs. Due to the early stage of development 
of most of the Group’s subsidiaries, management has limited history on which to base its assessment of 
both technical feasibility and commercial viability in order to ascertain whether the development costs 
have met the criteria for capitalisation. There is therefore a risk that development costs which have met the 
requirements of the relevant accounting standards have not been capitalised, and this is therefore one of 
the key judgemental areas of our audit.
Our response — In this area our audit procedures included,
•	 Critically assessing on a product by product basis the group’s assessment of whether technical and 
commercial feasibility had been achieved. The assessment of technical viability included considering 
whether successful product testing had been performed and whether regulatory approval had been 
achieved. In relation to commercial viability we challenged the assumptions made as to whether the 
current market proposition, sales recorded or orders received in relation to specific products were 
indicative of commercial feasibility, using our knowledge of each subsidiary and of the industry in which 
it operates.
•	 We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures and related judgements in relation to 
the capitalisation of development costs.
In our audit report for the year ended 31 December 2014 we included Share Based Payments accounting 
and disclosures as one of the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit. We 
continue to perform procedure over this risk, however, given that there were no new plans introduced in the 
year and also that the basis and mechanics of the calculation were reviewed and concluded on in the prior 
year with no issues noted, we have not assessed this as one of the risk that had the greatest effect on our 
audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at $1m. This has been determined 
with reference to a benchmark of total expenses (being cost of revenue, selling and general administrative 
expenses and research and development expenses) (of which it represents 1.0%), which we consider to be 
one of the principal considerations for the members of the company in assessing the financial performance 
of the Group, since the Group’s activities are currently principally in relation to expenditure on developing 
forms of intellectual property which can be exploited commercially to generate income and growth in the 
future.
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified 
through our audit with a value in excess of $50,000, in addition to other audit misstatements below that 
threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Allied Minds plc only (continued)
The Group consists of two reporting components, one containing all the US subsidiary companies and the 
second containing the UK parent Company. We subjected both to audits for group reporting purposes. All 
of the US subsidiaries are centrally administered and therefore the audit of the component containing these 
is performed by the US component auditors as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information. 
The parent Company component audit was performed by the Group audit team. Both component audits 
were performed to a component materiality of $0.9 million approved by the Group audit team. These audits 
covered 100% of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax, and total Group assets.
The UK Group audit team issued detailed audit instructions to the component auditor. These instructions 
covered the significant audit areas that should be covered by the audit (which included the relevant risks 
of material misstatement detailed above) and set out the information required to be reported back to the 
group audit team.
The Group audit team maintained close communication with the component audit team throughout the 
engagement including but not limited to discussions and meetings in relation to risks identified, the audit 
approach to be adopted, the results of procedures performed and significant findings and visited the site 
at which the components are located.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and
•	 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
•	 information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 65 to 66 with respect to 
internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about 
share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to:
•	 the directors’ Viability Statement on page 54, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, 
based on that, the directors’ assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing in operation over 
the two years to 31 December 2017; or
•	 the disclosures in Note 1 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6.  We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during 
our audit, we have identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency 
with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise 
misleading.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the members of Allied Minds plc only (continued)
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
•	 we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and 
the directors’ statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a 
whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or
•	 the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit 
committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
•	 a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•	 the directors’ statements, set out on page 67 and 54, in relation to going concern and longer-term 
viability; and
•	 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 57 relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 55, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members as a body and is subject to important explanations and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities,

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(1) Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation
Allied Minds plc (“Allied Minds” or the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the 
UK. The Annual Report and Accounts of Allied Minds and its subsidiaries (together referred to as 
the “Group”) are presented for the year ended 31 December 2015. The group financial statements 
consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries and the Group’s interest in associates. The 
Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with the 
International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards, and Interpretations 
(collectively “IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) as adopted by 
the European Union (“adopted IFRSs”). The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise 
stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
Prior Year Restatement
At the end of the previous year one of the Group’s subsidiaries issued subsidiary preferred shares to 
existing shareholders of the Group. These subsidiary preferred shares were accounted for as equity 
(Non-controlling interests (“NCI”) and Accumulated deficit) in the previous year. During the current 
period management have further analysed the subsidiary preferred shares and believe that, due to 
nature of their conversion features, they should have been accounted for as subsidiary preferred shares 
in current liabilities. As a result, as at 31 December 2014 management have increased current liabilities 
in the prior period by $50.0 million, reduced NCI by $36.9 million and increased accumulated deficit 
$13.1 million in the consolidated statement of financial position. This adjustment had no material effect 
on the Group’s consolidated comprehensive loss for the prior period. As a result of this restatement the 
following items in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position have changed in the prior 
year: non-controlling interests have decreased by $36.9 million, accumulated deficit has increased 
by $13.1 million, equity attributable to owners of the Company has decreased by $13.1 million, total 
equity has decreased by $50.0 million; “Subsidiary preferred shares” has been recognised as a new 
current liability category, at a value of $50.0 million, and total current liabilities and total liabilities have 
increased by $50.0 million.
There has been no impact on the 31 December 2014 balance sheet of the Company.
Basis of Measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
Use of Judgments and Estimates
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to estimates are 
recognised prospectively.
Significant estimates are made when determining the appropriate valuation methodology and deriving 
the estimated fair value of subsidiary undertakings and subsidiary preferred shares. These judgments 
include making certain estimates of the future earnings potential of the subsidiary businesses, 
appropriate discount rate and earnings multiple to be applied, marketability and other industry and 
company specific risk factors. Significant judgement is used in determining the classification of financial 
040_c112021_5.5.indd   111 21/04/2016   13:28 Page 112 of 165
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
instruments in terms of liability or equity. Significant judgments are involved in determining the point of 
capitalisation of development costs. Other significant estimates made by the Group also include those 
used in calculating share-based payment expense and related valuations, in particular when using 
Black Scholes or Monte Carlo models to determine the value of the equity based awards, the judgments 
used in considering any impairment required in relation to intangible assets, and the judgments made 
in determining control over subsidiaries. Information about these critical judgments and estimates is 
included in the following notes.
Changes in Accounting Policies
No other new standards, interpretations and amendments effective for the first time from 1 January 
2015 have had a material effect on the Group’s financial statements.
Going Concern
The Directors have prepared trading and cash flow forecasts for the Group covering the period to 
31 December 2017. Despite the fact that the Group is currently loss making and is likely to continue 
to be so, at least in the short term, after making enquiries and considering the impact of risks and 
opportunities on expected cashflows, and given the fact that the Group has $195 million of available 
funds in the form of cash and fixed income securities as at 31 December 2015, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate cash to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Basis of Consolidation
Allied Minds plc was formed on 15 April 2014 and on 19 June 2014 acquired Allied Minds Inc. (now 
Allied Minds, LLC) by share exchange. Each issued and outstanding common stock of Allied Minds 
Inc. held by stockholders of Allied Minds, Inc. (now Allied Minds, LLC) was converted into the right to 
receive twenty-two ordinary shares of Allied Minds plc. This has been accounted for as a common 
control transaction under IFRS 3.B1 (see note 16), therefore the consolidated financial statements for 
each of the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 comprises the financial statements of Allied 
Minds plc and the consolidated financial statements of Allied Minds, Inc. (now Allied Minds, LLC) and 
its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries
The financial information of the subsidiaries is prepared for the same reporting period as the parent 
Company, using consistent accounting policies. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The 
Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests 
in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling 
interests to have a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted 
for as equity transactions. Where the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are 
derecognised along with any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss 
040_c112021_5.5.indd   112 21/04/2016   13:28 Page 113 of 165
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value 
when control is lost.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the 
financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 
between 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially 
recognised at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any 
accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of 
the total comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investees, from the date 
that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s 
share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is 
reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an investee.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra- 
group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted 
investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there 
is no evidence of impairment.
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests (‘‘NCI’’) are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets at the acquisition date. Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in 
a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are 
accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is 
recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on 
a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or 
received and the amount by which non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity 
and attributed to the owners of the parent.
Functional and Presentation Currency
This consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of 
most of the entities in the Group.
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group 
entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency 
at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the 
040_c112021_5.5.indd   113 21/04/2016   13:28 Page 114 of 165

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at 
fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the 
fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on 
consolidation, are translated to the Group’s presentational currency U.S. dollar at foreign exchange 
rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated 
at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the 
dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are 
reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve or non- 
controlling interest, as the case may be. When a foreign operation is disposed of, such that control, 
joint control or significant influence (as the case may be) is lost, the entire accumulated amount in the 
Translation reserve, net of amounts previously attributed to non-controlling interests, is reclassified to 
profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest 
in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while still retaining control, the relevant proportion of 
the accumulated amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only 
part of its investment in a subsidiary or an associate that includes a foreign operation while still retaining 
significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to 
profit or loss.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months 
or less.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based 
on the specific identification or weighted-average method. The cost of inventories includes expenditure 
incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in 
bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work 
in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating 
capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated 
costs of completion and selling expenses.
Financial Instruments
Financial Assets
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. 
All other financial assets are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in 
a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are 
transferred.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and 
intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, 
trade and other receivables, security and other deposits, other investments. Such financial assets are 
recognised at fair value.
Other investments comprise fixed income debt securities, including government agency and corporate 
bonds, are stated at amortised cost less impairment. It is the Group policy to hold these investments 
till maximum maturity of three years.
Financial Liabilities
The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they 
are originated. All other financial liabilities are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled 
or expire.
The Group classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the following categories: trade and other 
payables and loans. Such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Warrants are accounted for as equity instruments and recorded at fair value.
The Group’s financial liabilities include subsidiary preferred shares some of which incorporate 
embedded derivatives. In accordance with IAS 39.11 the Group has elected not to bifurcate the 
embedded derivative but fair value the entire instrument at each reporting date. The gain or loss on 
remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Financial instruments issued by the Group
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only 
to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
•	 they include no contractual obligations upon the group to deliver cash or other financial assets 
or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are 
potentially unfavourable to the Group; and
•	 where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either 
a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own 
equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s exchanging a fixed 
amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the financial instrument is classified as a financial liability. 
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts 
presented in the financial information for share capital and merger reserve account exclude amounts 
in relation to those shares.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
Where a financial instrument that contains both equity and financial liability components exists these 
components are separated and accounted for individually under the above policy.
Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. The Group considers its capital to comprise share capital, 
share premium, merger reserve, translation reserve, and accumulated deficit. Other reserve historically 
presented separately is now included in accumulated deficit.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the 
asset. Assets under construction represent machinery and equipment to be used in operations, R&D 
activities, or to be leased to customers once completed.
When parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items (major components) of property and equipment. Depreciation is calculated using the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets:
Computers and electronics 3 years 
Furniture and fixtures 5 years 
Machinery and equipment 5 – 20 years 
Under construction Not depreciated until transferred into use 
Leasehold improvements Shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and adjusted if 
appropriate.
Intangible Assets
Licenses and Purchased In Process Research & Development
Licenses represent licenses provided by universities and scientists in exchange for an equity ownership 
in the entities. Purchased in process research & development (‘‘IPR&D’’) represents time and expertise 
already invested by the scientist and provided in exchange for an equity interest in the entity. Licenses 
and purchased IPR&D are valued based on the amount of cash contributed by Allied Minds, at inception 
of the subsidiary, and the proportionate amount of equity ascribed to Allied Minds. The licenses and 
IPR&D are capitalised only when they meet the criteria for capitalisation, namely separately identifiable 
and measurable and it is probable that economic benefit will flow to the entity.
Capitalised Development Costs
Research and development costs include charges from universities based on sponsored research 
agreements (SRAs) that the subsidiaries of Allied Minds enter into with universities. Under these 
agreements, the universities perform research on the technology that is being licensed to the 
subsidiaries. Research and development costs also include charges from independent research and 
development contractors, contract research organisations (CROs), and other research institutions.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Development expenditure 
is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and 
commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, the Group intends to and has sufficient 
resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset, and if the Group can measure reliably 
040_c112021_5.5.indd   116 21/04/2016   13:28 Page 117 of 165
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. The point at which technical 
feasibility is determined to have been reached is when regulatory approval has been received, where 
applicable. Management determines that commercial viability has been reached when a clear market 
and pricing point have been identified, which may coincide with achieving recurring sales. Development 
activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or 
processes. The expenditure considered for capitalisation includes the cost of materials, direct 
labour and an appropriate proportion of overhead costs. Otherwise, the development expenditure is 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, development expenditure is 
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Software
Software intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at 
cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, 
from the date that they are available for use. Intangible assets which are not yet available for use (and 
therefore not amortised) are tested for impairment at least annually.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and 
goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other intangible assets 
are amortised from the date they are available for use. Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual 
values are reviewed at least annually and adjusted if appropriate.
The estimated useful lives of the Group’s intangible assets are as follows:
Licences Over the remaining life of the underlying patents
Purchased IPR&D  Over the remaining life of the underlying patents, once 
commercial viability has been achieved
Development cost Over the remaining life of the underlying technology
Software 2 years
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the 
income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognised in equity.
Current Income Tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using 
tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in 
respect of previous years.
Deferred Income Tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences 
040_c112021_5.5.indd   117 21/04/2016   13:28 Page 118 of 165
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be 
used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences 
when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable 
entity, or on different tax entities where the Group intends to settle current tax liabilities and assets on 
a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
Deferred taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised 
directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Impairment
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
Non-financial assets consist of property and equipment and intangible assets, including licences, 
purchased IPR&D, capitalised development cost, with finite lives and such intangible assets which are 
not yet available for use.
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property and equipment and finite-lived intangibles at 
each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication 
exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Intangible assets which are not yet available 
for use are tested annually for impairment.
For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates 
cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or 
cash-generating units (‘‘CGUs’’).
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs 
to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset or CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds 
its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are allocated to reduce the carrying amounts of assets in a 
CGU on a pro rata basis.
Impairment of Financial Assets
Financial assets not classified as at fair value through profit or loss are assessed at each reporting date 
to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes:
•	 default or delinquency by a debtor;
•	 restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;
•	 indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy;
040_c112021_5.5.indd   118 21/04/2016   13:28 Page 119 of 165
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
•	 adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers;
•	 the disappearance of an active market for a security; or
•	 observable data indicating that there is measurable decrease in expected cash flows from a group 
of financial assets.
Financial Assets Measured at Amortised Cost
The Group considers evidence of impairment for these assets at both an individual asset and a 
collective level. All individually significant assets are individually assessed for impairment. Those found 
not to be impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet 
individually identified. Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment. 
Collective assessment is carried out by grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics.
In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical information on the timing of recoveries 
and the amount of loss incurred, and makes an adjustment if current economic and credit conditions 
are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or lesser than suggested by historical trends.
An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses 
are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Group considers that 
there are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the 
amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss 
is reversed through profit or loss.
Share-based Payments
Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration 
for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, 
regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group.
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as 
an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is measured using 
an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were 
granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for 
which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the 
amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related 
service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards 
with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to 
reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
Employee Benefits
Short-term Employee Benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as 
the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by 
the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
Defined Contribution Plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit 
expense in the periods during which related services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions 
are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is 
available.
Phantom Plan
The Phantom Plan is a cash settled bonus plan. Expense is accrued when it is determined that it is 
probable that a payment will be made and when the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
Revenue Recognition
Sale of Goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to 
the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of 
goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
The transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership usually occurs when products are shipped 
and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss.
Rendering of Services
The Group recognises revenue from rendering of services at the time services are provided to the 
customer and the Group has no additional performance obligation to the customer.
Government Grants
Grants received are recognised as revenue when the related work is performed and the qualifying 
research and development costs are incurred.
Finance Income and Finance Costs
Finance income mainly comprises interest income on funds invested and foreign exchange gains. 
Finance costs mainly comprise loan interest expense and foreign exchange losses. Interest income 
and interest payable are recognised as they accrue in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.
Fair Value Measurements
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, 
for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
040_c112021_5.5.indd   120 21/04/2016   13:28 Page 121 of 165
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far 
as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs 
used in the valuation techniques as follows:
•	 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•	 Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
•	 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different 
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same 
level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting 
period during which the change has occurred.
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deposits, accounts payable, 
accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Group’s Consolidated Statements of Financial 
Position approximates their fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments.
Operating Leases
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease 
expense, over the term of the lease.
Operating Segments
Allied Minds determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is 
provided to the executive management team, the body which is considered to be Allied Minds’ Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (‘‘CODM’’).
An operating segment is a component of Allied Minds that engages in business activities from which 
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions 
with any of the Allied Minds’ other components. The operating segment’s operating results are reviewed 
regularly by the CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment, to assess 
its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
(2) New Standards and Interpretations not yet Adopted
A number of new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards are effective for 
annual periods beginning after 1 January 2016, and have not therefore been applied in preparing 
this consolidated financial information. Management has yet to complete an analysis of these new 
standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards on the results of its operations, 
financial position, and disclosures. The Group intends to adopt these standards on their respective 
effective dates.

(4) Operating Segments
Basis for Segmentation
For management purposes, the Group’s principal operations are currently organised in two reportable 
segments:
(I)  Early stage companies – subsidiary businesses that are in the early stage of their lifecycle 
characterised by incubation, research and development activities; and
(II)  Commercial stage companies – subsidiary businesses that have substantially completed their 
research and development activities and that have developed one or more products that are 
actively marketed.
Due to their size and nature Spin Transfer Technologies, Inc. (or ‘‘STT’’, an early stage company) and 
RF Biocidics, Inc. (or ‘‘RFB’’, a commercial stage company) are not aggregated and presented as two 
additional separate reportable segments. The Group’s principal operations are therefore presented as 
four reportable segments being early stage company – STT, early stage companies – other, commercial 
stage company – RFB, and commercial stage companies – other.
The Group’s CODM reviews internal management reports on these segments at least quarterly in order 
to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Other operations include the management function of the head office at the parent level of Allied Minds.

further in notes 11 and 17.
Geographic Information
Whilst the Group includes RF Biocidics (UK) Limited, which is a UK company, the revenues and net 
operating losses of that subsidiary are not considered material to the Group, and therefore the Group 
revenues and net operating losses for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 are considered 
to be entirely derived from its operations within the United States and accordingly no additional 
geographical discloses are provided.

(6) Share-Based Payments
UK Long Term Incentive Plan
On 19 June 2014, Allied Minds plc established the UK Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). Under the 
LTIP, awards over Ordinary Shares may be made to employees, officers and Directors, and other 
individuals providing services to the Company and its subsidiaries. Awards may be granted in the 
form of share options, share appreciation rights, restricted or unrestricted share awards, performance 
share awards, restricted share units, phantom-share awards and other share-based awards. Awards 
have been made under the LTIP during 2015 and 2014 in respect of a total of 450,251 and 4,618,842 
Ordinary Shares, respectively. It is intended that awards will normally vest only after a minimum period 
of three years from the date of grant. Vesting will normally be subject to the achievement of performance 
conditions and continued services of the participant. In respect of the initial awards, which have been 
made conditionally on Admission, vesting is dependent upon performance metrics as follows:
•	 60% of each award will be subject to performance conditions based on the Company’s total 
shareholder return (“TSR”) performance in respect of the period from Admission until 31 December 
2016; and
•	 40% of each award will be subject to performance conditions based on a basket of shareholder 
value metrics (“SVM”), including but not limited to: (i) the increase in quality of pipeline intellectual 
property reviewed; (ii) the increase in quality of the partnership pipeline; and (iii) subsidiary level 
performance (assessed by reference to such matters as external funding raised, corporate 
collaborations, product co-development and proof of principal commercial pilots and revenues) 
Performance will be assessed on these measures on a scorecard basis over a three year period.
In respect of the initial awards, at the end of the three year period, performance against the relevant 
measures will be calculated to determine the number of Ordinary Shares which have satisfied the 
vesting criteria and 50% of the award will then vest at that time. The remaining 50% will vest in two 
equal tranches in years 4 and 5 subject to the relevant participant still being employed within (or being 
a director of a company within) the Group at the relevant vesting date (or being an earlier good leaver 
as described further in the LTIP).
A summary of stock option activity under the UK LTIP for the year ended 31 December 2015 and 2014, 
respectively, is shown below:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
The share grants that vest upon the occurrence of a market condition (i.e. the TSR performance) and 
service condition were adjusted to current market price at the date of the grant to reflect the effect of 
the market condition on the non-vested shares’ value. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation 
analysis utilising a Geometric Brownian Motion process with 50,000 simulations to value those shares. 
The model takes into account share price volatilities, risk-free rate and other covariance of comparable 
UK public companies and other market data to predict distribution of relative share performance. This 
is applied to the reward criteria to arrive at expected value of the TSR awards.
The share grants that vests only upon the occurrence of a performance condition (i.e. the SVM grants) 
and service condition were valued at the fair value of the shares on the date of the grants.
Accounting charge does not necessarily represent the intended value of share-based payments made 
to recipients, which are determined by the Remuneration Committee according to established criteria. 
The share-based payment charge for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2015 related to the UK LTIP 
was $3.1 million (2014: $1.3 million).
U.S. Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan
The U.S. Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan (the “U.S. Stock Plan”) was originally adopted by Allied 
Minds, Inc. (now Allied Minds, LLC) in 2008. The U.S. Stock Plan provides for the grant of share option 
awards, restricted share awards, and other awards to acquire common stock of Allied Minds, Inc. 
(now Allied Minds, LLC). All stock options granted to employees under this plan are equity settled, for a 
ten-year term Pursuant to the reorganisation discussed above, Allied Minds plc adopted and assumed 
the rights and obligations of Allied Minds, Inc. (now Allied Minds, LLC) under this plan except that the 
obligation to issue Common Stock is replaced with an obligation to issue ordinary shares to satisfy 
awards granted under the U.S. Stock Plan.
Measurement of Fair Values
No new stock option grants were awarded in 2015 under the Allied Minds 2008 Plan. The fair value 
of the stock option grants awarded in 2014 under the Allied Minds 2008 Plan was estimated as of the 
date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model that uses the following weighted 
average assumptions, respectively:
2015 2014
Expected option life (in years) — 5.51
Expected stock price volatility — 37.40%
Risk-free interest rate — 1.85%
Expected dividend yield — —
Grant date option fair value — $ 0.93
Share price at grant date — $ 2.49
Exercise price — $ 2.49
Grant date option fair value, share price at grant date, and exercise price disclosed above take into 
account the reorganisation described in note 16. Expected volatility has been based on an evaluation 
of the historical volatility of the share price of publicly traded companies comparable to Allied Minds, 
particularly over the historical period commensurate with the expected term. The expected term of the 
instruments has been based on historical experience and general option holder behavior.

The options outstanding as of 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 had an exercise price in the 
range of $0.68 to $2.60.
As of 19 June 2014, the maximum number of options reserved under the plan were issued and 
outstanding and as a result of the reorganisation discussed in note 16, all issued and outstanding 
options vested on 19 June 2014 and some options were exercised, resulting in the accelerated share- 
based payment charge of additional $2.4 million for the period. The Company does not intend to make 
any further grants under the U.S. Stock Plan.
Restricted share awards are outstanding over 118,800 ordinary shares, which were granted under the 
U.S. Stock Plan to the non-executive Directors. These ordinary shares vest in three equal tranches on 
each of the first three anniversaries of Admission provided that the non-executive Director in question 
is still providing services to the Group on the relevant vesting date.

company to the plan account. Upon a liquidity event, plan participants holding units will receive their 
proportionate share of the plan account. The allocated shares at all times remain the sole and exclusive 
property of Allied Minds and holders of units have no rights or interests in Allied Minds. No amount has 
been paid out to employees under the Phantom Stock Plan through 31 December 2015.
Allied Minds has not accrued any expense relating to the Phantom Plan as of 31 December 2015 or

Amortisation expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive loss. Amortisation expense, recorded using the straight-line method, was 
approximately $747,000 and $580,000 for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Impairment of intangible assets of $1,000 and $1,063,000 for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 
2014, respectively, is mainly attributed to the abandonment of the rights to certain intellectual property 
per the licensing agreement with a partner university and to the closing of subsidiary companies, which

In October 2014, Spin Transfer Technologies (“STT”) completed a Series A financing round as a result 
of which the Allied Minds’ ownership percentage in STT decreased from 56.13% to 48.40%, see 
note 18 for further detail. Whilst Allied Minds owns less than 50.00% of the voting share capital after 
the transaction and as of 31 December 2014, the company remains the largest single shareholder 
at 48.40% of the voting share capital, and retains control over the majority of the voting rights on the 
board of directors of STT. Under the terms of the STT organisational documents, the board of directors 
effectively controls the policies and management of STT, and in all instances, the board acts by majority 
vote. In addition, all material shareholder voting provisions of the STT organisational documents require 
a simple majority for approval, giving the Company substantial influence over the outcome of all action 
which require a shareholder vote. As a result, following the transaction, Allied Minds continues to 
exercise effective control over STT and as such will continue to be fully consolidated within the group’s 
financial statements.
The following tables summarise the financial information related to the Group’s subsidiaries with 
material non-controlling interests, aggregated for interests in similar entities, and before intra-group 
eliminations.

As disclosed above in note 4, at the end of 2015, the Group’s CODM has determined that Biotectix 
reached commercial stage and as such its financial information has been presented in the respective 
reportable segment as of and for the year ended 31 December 2015 and 2014.
Portfolio Valuation
At the close of each annual financial period, the Directors formally approve the value of all subsidiary 
businesses in the Group, which is used to derive the ‘‘Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value’’. 
The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value (‘‘GSOAV’’) was $535.8 million as at 31 December 
2015 (2014: $488.0m), as set out in the table below. This Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value 
is a sum-of-the-parts (‘‘SOTP’’) valuation of all the subsidiaries that make up the Group. The increase 
in the Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value during the year principally reflects the increase in 
value at Federated Wireless and Precision Biopsy supported by their valuations at recent fund raising 
transactions, offset by reductions at CryoXtract and RF Biocidics.
The methodology for Group’s subsidiary company valuations, extracts of which are set out below, is 
based on the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Valuation of Privately-Held-Company 
Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (‘‘AICPA Guidelines’’). The AICPA Guidelines do not

represent, but are consistent with valuation principles adopted under, International Financial Reporting 
Standards.
As of 31 December 2015, the Group’s estimated Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value was 
distributed across the Group’s operating segments as follows:
2015 2014
Company $m % of GSOAV $m % of GSOAV
Biotectix, LLC 12.2 2.3% 11.7 2.4%
CryoXtract, LLC 12.6 2.4% 17.8 3.6%

Ownership adjusted value represents Allied Minds’ interest in the equity value of each subsidiary:
= (Business Enterprise Value – Long Term Debt + Cash) x Allied Minds percentage ownership plus the 
value of debt provided by Allied Minds plc to each subsidiary business. Allied Minds commits post- 
seed funding to its subsidiaries in the form of loans.
The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value includes cash balances held by Allied Minds 
subsidiaries at 31 December 2015 amounting to $79.7 million, on an ownership-adjusted basis (2014: 
$86.1m), including those subsidiaries valued based on recent financing rounds. The Group Subsidiary 
Ownership Adjusted Value above excludes cash balances held at the parent level. As at 31 December 
2015, the Group total consolidated cash and other investments balances was $194.8 million including 
cash, cash equivalents and investments (2014: $261.5m), the balance being cash and investments of 
$115.0 million (2014: $175.4m) held at the parent level and available for investment in the Group.
The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value has been calculated on the basis of Allied Minds’ 
percentage ownership as at 31 December 2015. Where subsidiaries have raised financing from external 
parties since 31 December 2015, the ownership adjusted value in the table above has been updated 
to reflect the current percentage ownership and the valuation implied by that external investment on a 
post new money basis. Federated Wireless completed a funding round of $22 million in January 2016, 
see note 26 for further detail.
Valuation Methodology
Each subsidiary company is regularly evaluated based on a range of inputs, including: company 
performance and progress towards development milestones; market and competitor analyses based 
on information from databases and public material; and interviews with scientists and physicians.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
The Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value represents the sum-of-the-parts (‘‘SOTP’’) of, 
principally, net present value (‘‘NPV’’) or risk-adjusted net present value (‘‘rNPV’’) from discounted 
cash flow (‘‘DCF’’) valuations; valuations based on recent third party investment at the subsidiary level. 
A DCF valuation is used for the majority of Allied Minds subsidiaries. The DCF valuations are updated 
when the underlying assumptions for the valuations warrant a change. Otherwise, the DCF valuations 
are kept constant. When available, financing transactions are used as the basis for the subsidiary 
valuation. In limited instances other techniques such as based on asset values are utilised.
Set out below are the two principal methodologies applied to value each Group company to derive the 
Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value as at 31 December 2015:
Discounted cash flow Funding transaction
Biotectix, LLC Percipient Networks, LLC Allied-Bristol Life Sciences, LLC
BridgeSat, Inc. ProGDerm, Inc. dba Novare

Cephalogics, LLC RF Biocidics, Inc. HawkEye 360, Inc.
CryoXtract Instruments, LLC Seamless Devices, Inc. Optio Labs, Inc.

LuxCath, LLC Whitewood Encryption Systems, Inc. SciFluor Life Sciences, Inc.
Spin Transfer Technologies, Inc.
As per cent of GSOAV: 26.5% (2014: 44.9%) 70.7% (2014: 51.9%)
In addition to the two principal valuation methodologies, the Directors have valued using alternative 
valuation methodologies Allied Minds Federal Innovations, Inc. (“AMFI”), representing 2.8% of the 
group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value (2014: 3.2%). AMFI was valued using an asset-based 
methodology that reflects the intellectual property to which it has access as at 31 December 2015 and 
2014.
Net Present Valuation (‘‘NPV’’) method
NPV is a standard technique used in valuation and can be defined as the difference between the 
present value of the future cash flows from an investment and the amount of investment. Present value 
of the estimated cash flows is computed by discounting them at the required rate of return which 
includes an adjustment for risk.
The following are important factors when determining fair value based on NPV:
•	 Estimated income generally consists of sales, co-development revenues, one-time payments and 
royalty payments on sales depending on the company, its business model and industry. These are 
estimated based on a variety of factors including, inter alia: total addressable market; competitive 
factors; barriers to competition; pricing; typical standards for contract value; royalty rates; and 
likelihood of development of a product that is commercially viable.
•	 Costs and capital expenditures are estimated for each phase of development based on the 
companies’ information or according to industry standards. Costs are typically forecasted for 
cost of goods, SG&A (selling, general and administrative), research and development as well as a 
variety of other expenses. These are typically developed ‘‘from the ground up’’ for earlier years and 
for later years depicted as a factor or percentage of sales.

Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(continued)
•	 The terminal or exit value represents the aggregate value of an entity at the end of the discrete 
forecast period. Terminal value may be estimated using the terminal multiple method, which 
inherently assumes that the business will be valued at the end of the projection period based on 
reference valuations. Under this methodology, the terminal value is typically calculated by applying 
one of two commonly accepted methodologies:
 —  Multiple base terminal value: Use of an appropriate multiple to the relevant financial metric 
forecasted for the last projected year taking into consideration the ongoing growth potential of 
the business in the terminal year. Exit values included in the analysis are typically projected as a 
multiple of EBIT, EBITDA or Sales based on the final year results for the forecast period. Where 
available, a set of guideline public companies that are similar to the company to be used for 
comparative purposes and the multiple is derived from this set;
 —  Gordon growth model based terminal value: Use of a formula that calculates the present value 
of cash flow in the terminal year growing into infinity at an ascribed terminal growth rate. The 
terminal growth rate is derived by estimating the long-term annual growth potential of the 
business at the terminal year.
•	 rNPV is a technique typically used when valuing pharmaceutical or biological companies and has 
been used in estimating the value of ProGDerm. When using rNPV, it is the same process as 
developing an NPV analysis though costs and revenues are probability adjusted downward based 
on the phase of development.
•	 Selection of discount rates is based on part utilising American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants (AICPA) practice standards varying by stage of development of the subsidiary as 
well as other risk factors and typically range from 20-45%. When utilising rNPV, discount rates are 
typically lower reflecting the probability adjustment of the cash flows already made.
•	 Significant events occurring after the date of valuation according to the previous paragraph have 
been taken into account in the valuation to the extent that such events would have affected the 
value on the closing date.
•	 Where available NPV results are compared against peer companies and to valuations for similar 
companies.
Due to the early stage nature of the Group’s subsidiary companies, projections are particularly sensitive 
to certain key assumptions namely:
•	 Discount rate and in particular risk premium;
•	 The ability to predict the cost and timing of achieving technical and commercial viability;
•	 Projected revenue and operating costs in the post-product development phase of each company; 
and
•	 The size and share of addressable market for intellectual property, products and services developed.
Whilst the Board considers the methodologies and assumptions adopted in valuation are supportable, 
reasonable and robust, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may 
differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investment 
existed and the differences could be significant.

(16) Equity
On 19 June 2014 Allied Minds plc acquired the entire issued share capital of Allied Minds, Inc. (now 
Allied Minds, LLC) at a rate of twenty-two £0.01 Ordinary Shares in Allied Minds plc for every $0.01 of 
common stock in Allied Minds, Inc. This has been accounted as a common control transaction and the 
comparative historical financials have been presented as if the transaction had already taken place. It 
has therefore been deemed that the share capital was issued in line with movements in share capital as 
shown prior to the transaction taking place. In addition the merger reserve records amounts previously 
recorded as share premium net of differences arising between share capital on the restructured basis 
and the former basis.
On 25 June 2014 the Company’s entire issued ordinary share capital of 209,499,425 ordinary shares 
of one pence each were admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing 
Authority and to trading on the LSE’s Main Market for listed securities. The IPO was for 61,695,208 
shares at 190 pence per ordinary share, of which 44,254,411 were new ordinary shares issued by the 
Company and 17,440,797 were sold by selling shareholders.
This resulted in approximately $131.8 million of net proceeds from the IPO (net of issue cost of $11.0 
million) reflected in the share premium balance as of 30 June 2014. The IPO also included an over-

allotment option equivalent to 15% of the total number of new ordinary shares, or 6,638,161. The over- 
allotment period expired on 19 July 2014 and the stabilisation manager exercised in part their over- 
allotment option. As a result, the Company issued 3,791,154 Shares at the offer price of 190 pence per

(17) Acquisition of Non-Controlling Interest (“NCI”)
For the two years ended 31 December 2015, the Group recognised the following changes in common 
stock ownership in subsidiaries:
2014
•	 Federated Wireless closed an internal round of financing of $5.0 million equity investment from 
Allied Minds. As a result of the transaction, after covering the anti-dilutive protection of certain 
shareholders, Allied Minds’ interest in Federated Wireless increased from 90.0% to 90.9%;
•	 Optio Labs closed a round of financing of $10.0 million in March 2014 with existing and new 
shareholders of the Group, of which Allied Minds subscribed to contribute $7.7 million by January 
2015 should no other investors opt to participate by July 2014. New and existing shareholders of 
the Group exercised that option in the amount of $150 thousand and Allied Minds completed its 
obligation for the balance in January 2015;
•	 Allied-Bristol Life Sciences, LLC (“ABLS”) was formed in July 2014 as a partnership between Allied 
Minds and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMY”) to identify and foster research and pre-clinical 
development of biopharmaceutical innovations. Allied Minds and BMY have jointly funded ABLS 
with $10.0 million of initial capital, of which $8.0 million were contributed by Allied Minds. ABLS 
will form and fund new companies to conduct feasibility studies and where appropriate, full-phase 
discovery programs;

(18) Subsidiary Preferred Shares
Certain of the Group’s subsidiaries have outstanding preferred shares which have been classified as 
a subsidiary preferred shares in current liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 as the subsidiaries have a 
contractual obligation to deliver cash or other assets to the holders under certain future liquidity events, 
and/or a requirement to deliver an uncertain number of common shares upon conversion. The preferred 
shares do not contain mandatory dividend rights. The preferred shares are convertible into common 
stock of the subsidiary at the option of the holder and mandatorily convertible into common stock of 
the subsidiary upon a qualified public offering at or above certain value and gross proceeds specified in 
the agreements or upon the vote of the holders of a majority of the subsidiary preferred shares. Under 
certain scenarios the number of common stock shares receivable on conversion will change. The 
Group has elected not to bifurcate the variable conversion feature as a derivative liability, but account 
for the entire instrument at fair value through the income statement. The preferred shares are entitled 
to a vote with holders of common stock on an as converted basis. The holders of the preferred shares 
are entitled to a liquidation preference amount in the event of a liquidation or a deemed liquidation event 
of the respective subsidiary. The Group recognises the subsidiary preferred shares balance upon the 
receipt of cash financing, and records the change in its fair value for the respective reporting period 
through profit and loss. Preferred shares are not allocated shares of the subsidiary losses.
The following summarises the subsidiary preferred shares balance:

In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of a subsidiary, the 
holders of subsidiary preferred shares then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets 
of the subsidiary available for distribution to shareholders and before any payment shall be made 
to holders of common shares. A merger, acquisition, sale of voting control or other transaction of a 
subsidiary in which the shareholders of the subsidiary do not own a majority of the outstanding shares 
of the surviving company shall be deemed to be a liquidation event. Additionally, a sale, lease, transfer 
or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary shall also be deemed a 
liquidation event.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded is determined by using valuation techniques 
that maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on 
entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the 
instrument is included in Level 2. Where the inputs for determining the fair value of financial instruments 
are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
The Group has determined that the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
receivables and payables, security and other deposits, and customer deposits are a reasonable 
approximation of their fair values and are included in Level 2.
The following presents the quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in 
the fair value measurement of the Group’s subsidiary preferred shares liability designated as Level 3:
Option Pricing Model Inputs
Measurement Date Time to Liquidity Volatility Risk-Free Rate
31-Dec-2014 4.78 years 60.0% 1.59%
31-Dec-2015 3.78 – 4.76 years 60.0% – 70.0% 1.48% – 1.71%
The change in fair value of the subsidiary preferred shares is recorded in Finance (cost)/income, net in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.

(23) Capital and Financial Risk Management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market 
confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Management monitors the level of 
capital deployed and available for deployment in subsidiary projects. The board of directors seeks to 
maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of deployed 
capital and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Group’s executive management and board of directors have overall responsibility for establishment 
and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Group is exposed to certain risks 
through its normal course of operations. The Group’s main objective in using financial instruments is to 
promote the commercialisation of intellectual property through the raising and investing of funds for this 
purpose. The Group’s policies in calculating the nature, amount and timing of funding are determined 
by planned future investment activity. Due to the nature of activities and with the aim to maintain the 
investors’ funds secure and protected, the Group’s policy is to hold any excess funds in highly liquid 
and readily available financial instruments and reduce the exposure to other financial risks.
The Group has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to 
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, other investments in the 
form of fixed income securities, and trade and other receivables.
The Group held following balances:
As of 31 December:
2015 
$’000 
2014

Cash and cash equivalent 105,555 224,075
Other investments 89,193 37,407
Trade and other receivables 7,342 6,305
202,090 267,787
The Group maintains money market funds, certificates of deposits, and fixed income securities with 
financial institutions, which the Group believes are of high credit quality. Risk control assesses the 
credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other 
factors. Individual risk limits are set based on ratings in accordance with limits set by the board. The 
utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past 
due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to credit ratings (if available) or to historical information 
about counterparty default rates.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk. The Group assesses the credit quality of 
customers, taking into account their current financial position. An analysis of the credit quality of trade 
receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is as follows:

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated 
with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s 
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to 
meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring 
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group seeks to manage liquidity risk, ensuring that sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable 
requirements.
The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The 
amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include estimated interest payments and exclude the impact 
of netting agreements. The current portion of the carrying amount of lease obligations is included in 
trade and other payables.

It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, 
or at significantly different amounts.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices – such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates 
and equity prices – will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. 
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within 
acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. The Group maintains the exposure to market risk 
from such financial instruments to insignificant levels. The Group exposure to changes in interest rates 
is determined to be insignificant.
Capital Risk Management
The Group is funded by equity finance and long term borrowings. Total capital is calculated as ‘total 
equity’ as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to 
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the 
capital structure, the Group may issue new shares or borrow new debt. The Group has some external 
debt and no material externally imposed capital requirements. The Group’s share capital is set out in 
note 16.

Amounts recognised in profit or loss
No current income tax expense was recorded for US jurisdictions for the years ended 31 December 
2015 and 2014 due to accumulated losses. 
For the year ended 31 December:
2015

2014

Net loss 97,989 57,706
Income taxes — — 
Net loss before taxes 97,989 57,706
In January 2016, the Company paid to HM Revenue & Customs $67,000 of UK income taxes of Allied 
Minds plc for the 2014 tax year.
Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate
The Group is primarily subject to taxation in the US, therefore the reconciliation of the effective tax 
rate has been prepared using the US statutory tax rate. A reconciliation of the US statutory rate to the 
effective tax rate is as follows:
2015 
% 
2014 
%
Weighted average statutory rate 35.0 35.0
Effect of state tax rate in US 5.3 5.4
Credits 3.7 2.8
Share-based payment remeasurement (2.6) 26.6
Other (2.6) (8.2)
Current year losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised (38.8) (61.6)
— — 
Factors that may affect future tax expense
The Group is primarily subject to taxation in the US and UK. Additionally, the Group is exposed to state 
taxation in various jurisdictions throughout the US. Changes in corporate tax rates can change both 
the current tax expense (benefit) as well as the deferred tax expense (benefit). Reductions in the UK 
corporation tax rate to 19% (effective 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were substantially 
enacted on 26 October 2015. The maximum corporate tax rate in the US for the corresponding periods 
is 35%.

Unrecognised Deferred Tax Assets
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items, because it is not 
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can use the benefits 
therefrom:

(1) expire starting in 2024
(2) expire starting in 2015
(3) generally will expire 20 years subsequent to the time the deduction is taken
 
Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the period when the temporary 
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially 
enacted by the statement of financial position date. The reduction in the main rate of UK corporation 
tax to 20% (from 23%) was substantially enacted on 2 July 2013 and applied from 1 April 2015. 
However, the UK corporation tax rate initially reduced from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014. The change 
in the UK corporate tax rate did not materially impact the calculation of the deferred tax assets as these 
assets are generally exposed to tax in US jurisdiction.
There were no movements in deferred tax recognised in income or equity in 2015 or 2014 as the 
deferred tax asset was not recognised in any of those years.
(26) Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated subsequent events through 25 April 2016, which is the date the 
consolidated financial information is available to be issued.
Federated Wireless, Inc.
In February 2016, Federated Wireless successfully raised $22.0 million in Series A preferred stock 
financing, of which Allied Minds participated with $5.0 million for 2,727,580 shares of the preferred 
stock and the remainder was provided by existing shareholders of the Group.
ABLS III, LLC
In March 2016, ABLS III (dba ißeCa Therapeutics) was formed and licensed proprietary compounds 
from NYU School of Medicine that target the Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt pathway plays a key role 
in the development and progression of a number of cancers affecting large numbers of patients. ißeCa 
Therapeutics will focus on further discovery and development activities needed to identify candidates 
for human clinical testing.

Financial Statements
Notes to the Financial Statements
(1) Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation and Measurement
The financial statements of the parent company have been prepared under the historical cost convention, 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). 
The Company is preparing its financial statements in accordance with Adopted IFRSs for the first time 
and consequently has applied IFRS 1. In preparing its opening IFRS Balance Sheet, the Company 
has identified no differences in its financial statements as compared to those reported previously in 
accordance with its old basis of accounting (UK GAAP). A summary of the more important accounting 
policies which have been applied consistently throughout the year are set out below.
Functional and Presentation Currency
The functional currency of the parent company is British Pounds. The financial statements of the parent 
company are presented in US dollars.
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of the parent 
company at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency 
at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are 
recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are 
retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was 
determined.
On translation of the Company financial statements from functional currency to presentational currency 
the assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates. Profit and loss accounts are 
translated at the average rates of exchange during the year. Gains and losses arising on these translations 
are taken to reserves.
Investments
Investments are stated at historic cost less any provision for impairment in value and are held for long-term 
investment purposes. Provisions are based upon an assessment of events or changes in circumstances 
that indicate that an impairment has occurred such as the performance and/or prospects (including 
the financial prospects) of the investee company being significantly below the expectations on which 
the investment was based, a significant adverse change in the markets in which the investee company 
operates or a deterioration in general market conditions.
Intercompany Loans
All intercompany loans are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost. Where intercompany loans are intended for use on a continuing basis in the Company’s activities 
and there is no intention of their settlement in the foreseeable future, they are presented as current 
assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months 
or less.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015
Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued)
Impairment
If there is an indication that an asset might be impaired, the Company will perform an impairment review. 
An asset is impaired if the recoverable amount, being the higher of net realisable value and value in use, 
is less than its carrying amount. Value in use is measured based on future discounted cash flows (“DCF”) 
attributable to the asset. In such cases, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to recoverable amount 
with a corresponding charge recognised in the profit and loss account.
Financial Instruments
Currently the Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments. Financial assets and financial 
liabilities are recognised and cease to be recognised on the basis of when the related titles pass to or 
from the Company.
Share-based Payments
Share-based payment arrangements in which the Company receives goods or services as consideration 
for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, 
regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Company.
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an 
employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option 
valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which 
the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount 
ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service 
and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with 
non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such 
conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.

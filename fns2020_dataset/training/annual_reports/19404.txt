The last fifteen months represent one of 
the most exciting periods in our Company’s
history. With planning consent granted 
for the Greenwich Peninsula and approved 
in principle for Wembley by the London
Borough of Brent, Quintain is engaged in
delivering the largest urban regeneration
programme in the UK. Having de-geared
and re-financed and with the human capital
necessary to deliver the results, the
business has the opportunity, the finance
and expertise to bring these projects
to fruition. We envisage an exciting,
challenging and profitable time ahead.

Quintain at a Glance
We have an internal target 
of 10% total shareholder
return net of inflation, a target
that we have exceeded every
year since flotation in 1996.
We have also regularly
outperformed the UK
property market, as
measured by the Investment
Property Databank (IPD), 
the industry benchmark.
Over 10 years we are the
best performing UK property
fund monitored by IPD.
Quintain is a rapidly 
growing property company
specialising in areas of
development, investment 
and asset management
where it has competitive edge.
We develop urban
regeneration sites, invest 
for a combination of income
and uplift in net asset value
(NAV), and manage property
assets in sectors where
we believe there are high
barriers to entry, such as
healthcare. Income from 
the investment portfolio 
and from asset management
finances the development
projects, which have potential
for exceptional returns.

2004 04 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Chairman’s Statement
Chairman’s Statement
As a result of this year’s 
strong performance, the board 
is recommending an increase 
of 9%, or 0.75p, giving a total 
dividend for the year of 8.75p.
Nigel Ellis
Chairman
I am pleased to report that Quintain has
yet again had a successful year in which
considerable progress was made. These
achievements have continued since the
year-end, with the full completion of the
commercial contracts relating to the
Greenwich Peninsula and a resolution to
grant consent decision from the London
Borough of Brent for our Wembley
planning application. 
We have achieved this year a total return
of 19% or 16% net of inflation. This is well
ahead of our internal target of 10% total
return net of inflation, a target which we
have exceeded every year since flotation
in 1996.
We have also significantly outperformed
the property market as measured by the
Investment Property Databank (IPD), the
industry benchmark. Our total ungeared
return was 16.3% compared with IPD’ s
March Universe of 12.6%. This places 
us in the top decile.
In the year to 31 March 2004, the net
asset value per share rose by 16%, from
348p to 405p, and by 17% to 399p from
342p on a diluted basis. As in past years,
the main driver of this uplift was the
surplus on property revaluation. The most
significant contributions arose from our
Meridian Delta Project on the Greenwich
Peninsula; our investment in Wembley;
Neathouse Place, London; Emersons
Green, near Bristol; and the shopping
centres. Details of all these projects and 
a full review of our operations follow 
in the Chief Executive’ s Review. 
Profit before tax rose 14.8% from 
£14m to £16m and earnings increased
by 32% to 12p per share. The rise in
earnings was primarily due to a number
of sales in the core investment portfolio, 
a surrender premium of £2.2m at our
property in Gracechurch Street and an
effective tax rate of 0% arising mainly
through unwinding deferred tax provisions
for capital allowances previously made
on properties acquired within Chesterfield. 
However, as predicted, underlying profits
have fallen marginally, with the growth 
in income being more than offset by 
a predicted increase of 50% in
administrative expenses. This rise was
due to a combination of factors, including
the incorporation of a full year of the
Wembley costs and the impact of the
recruitment of a substantial number of
senior staff to deliver the next phase of
growth. This has enabled us to generate
significant value, as demonstrated by 
the speed with which we applied for
planning and obtained a resolution for
5.3m sq ft of development at Wembley. 05 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Chairman’s Statement
The Company’ s earnings will inevitably
vary over time, particularly in light of the
major special projects, where most of 
the early value comes through in the 
form of capital value uplifts. 
Our progress has been reflected in the
ability to refinance the Company on a
corporate basis. Following the year-end,
we have repaid most of our existing
facilities, having taken out a £400m loan
fully underwritten by Barclays, Bank 
of Scotland, HSBC and Lloyds TSB.
Further details on all of these are to be
found in the Financial Director’ s Review.
Share Price
During the year the share price has
continued to perform well. At 427p at
close of business on 18 June 2004, the
shares have outperformed the FTSE All
Share Index by 48% and the FTSE Real
Estate Index by 16% since 1 April 2003. 
Dividend
As a result of this year’ s strong
performance, the board is recommending
an increase of 9%, or 0.75p, giving a total
dividend for the year of 8.75p. It is
intended that the final dividend will 
be paid on 10 September 2004 to
shareholders on the register as at 
13 August 2004. It remains the
Company's intention to maintain 
a progressive dividend and this will
continue subject to cash requirements.
Corporate Governance
We have made progress on Governance
issues during the period under review
and we continue to strive to achieve 
best practice. A detailed review is
contained in the Corporate Governance
section on pages 24 to 27. 
People
As mentioned in the half year results,
Pam Alexander who joined us as a 
non-executive director in July had to
leave in November because of conflicts
of interest which arose on her subsequent
appointment as Chief Executive of the
South East England Development Agency .
Joan MacNaughton joined us as non-
executive director in January of this year.
We believe there is clear benefit to having
a non-executive director with public
sector experience on the board and
Joan’ s experience as a career civil servant
and as the Director General of Energy
within the DTI leaves her ideally placed 
to provide wise counsel. 
During the year, we have also made 
a number of senior appointments,
particularly within the Company’ s Special
Projects and Structured Finance divisions.
Their skills and experience complement
and strengthen the existing teams and
ensure we are well positioned for the 
next stage of growth. 
Once again, I must stress how much 
we benefit from our enthusiastic and 
hard working staff, including my fellow
directors, all of whom have enabled 
us to have another good year. 
Outlook
The Company made considerable
progress in the year to 31 March 2004
across all its areas of operation. This has
continued since the year-end, with the
achievement of full planning consent for
the Greenwich Peninsula, the resolution
to grant consent at Wembley and the
profitable sales of Neathouse Place 
and The Parishes, Scunthorpe.
With the backing and enthusiasm of 
our management teams, our financial
strength and the exciting prospects for
the Company’ s three operating divisions,
the board is confident of future growth
and success.
Nigel Ellis
Chairman
18 June 2004 Chief Executive’s Review
We continue to be highly selective
in our search for properties with
higher yield and potential for
active management and/or
reversionary uplift
Adrian Wyatt
Chief Executive
Wembley status
Quintain is the sole owner of 58 
acres of land surrounding, but not
including, the new National Stadium 
at Wembley, north west London. The
site comprises the Wembley Complex
(Arena, Conference Centre and
Exhibition Halls), Palace of Arts and
Palace of Industry, and York House. 
In October 2003 Quintain submitted
an outline planning application after
six months of consultation for a
mixed-use regeneration proposal
covering Phase 1, some 42 acres 
of that ownership. 
Quintain’ s programme for the biggest
transformation of Wembley since the
1920s will dramatically enhance the
experience of visitors to the new
National Stadium and world famous
Wembley Arena, as well as revitalising
the local community through the
creation of 3,700 new homes, 40% 
of which will be affordable housing. 
The development will feature 160,000
sq ft of new leisure facilities including 
a cinema complex, a 420-room 5-star
hotel, new offices and 82,000 sq ft of
community space.  Wembley Park
Boulevard, the length, width and height
of Regent Street will feature bars,
restaurants and cafes. In addition,
150,000 sq ft of designer outlet and
127,000 sq ft of sports retailing will be
accompanied by 86,000 sq ft of local
convenience shopping. 
The London Borough of Brent
resolved to grant outline planning
consent for Phase 1 in June 2004.
We now await decisions in favour 
of the application from the Government
Office of London. The Mayor of London
approved the plans on 14 July . A
positive decision and the conclusion
of the S106 planning agreement will
lead to full outline planning permission
being issued.
We anticipate being on site before 
the end of 2004. The standing and reputation of the
Company is further enhanced by another
record year of outperformance, in which
we have made excellent progress across
all areas of our operations. 
We remain adamant that, with good
stock-picking, high returns neither
necessitate nor connote high risk. 
We have a well-financed reversionary
portfolio with upside potential from rent
reviews, planning gain, marriage value
and development. Our current low level
of gearing, combined with intended
sales, should give us substantial financial
resources for our Special Projects, the
development of our Q3P business and
reinvestment in the Main Portfolio.
The business opportunities ahead,
exemplified by the Greenwich Peninsula,
Wembley and fund management, are
exciting, challenging and potentially very
profitable. T o realise the potential, we
have invested in recruiting additional 
highly qualified and talented staff. 
Whilst we are ever cognisant that our
success is primarily measured by total
return, underlying profits must be carefully
monitored as we strive to sustain a
progressive and covered dividend.
Special Projects
Highlights of the year are many and
varied. The major events at Wembley
during the year included the acquisition
of York House – an office block adjacent
to our existing holdings yielding 8%, 
and the delisting of the 13 acre Palace 
of Arts and Industry sites which will 
be included in our Phase II planning
application. Subsequent to the year-end,
a resolution to grant 5.3m sq ft of mixed-
use development was obtained from 
the London Borough of Brent on 3 June
– a significant achievement particularly
given the timescale. Advances have been
made with the pre-letting of buildings
allied to the hotel and leisure industries.
We expect to be on site this year, 
with good progress expected by the
Stadium opening in 2006. This augurs
well for the future.
At Greenwich, the safe-guarded wharf
status has been lifted and the whole
transaction went unconditional on 
18 June 2004. We hope to commence
infrastructure works this calendar year,
with the intention of drawing down on
options over the 194 acres from 2005.
The combination of land sales and equity
participation in joint ventures will generate
substantial profits over this 20 year project.
During the year, we also acquired a 
12 acre strategic site on the other side 
of the river in partnership with the London
Development Agency.
In May 2004, we made an outline
planning application at Emersons Green
for another major mixed-use development.
We own 65 acres of the 275 acre site. 
On our site, the development will be
predominantly residential. The Main Portfolio currently
holds about half the property
assets which contribute
approximately three quarters 
of the Group’s rental income
whilst also contributing to the
uplift in NAV
With our major mixed-use consents, 
the vagaries of the residential market are
not a fundamental concern, as we have
control over the timing and financing 
of development. 
In the City of London, the office building
at 36 Gracechurch Street was let while
the tenant of 37-41 Gracechurch Street
surrendered the lease for a premium
equivalent to five years’ rent. The
combined sites will be available for a
consented development in three years’
time comprising 113,000 sq ft of offices.
At Neathouse Place, the litigation over
the fenestration has been satisfactorily
resolved and the rent review positively
concluded. Shortly after the year-end,
terms were agreed for a sale at £67.8m,
representing a profit of £20m since it 
was acquired as part of Chesterfield. 
Greenwich Peninsula status
Meridian Delta Limited, a joint venture
company comprising Quintain Estates
and Development PLC and Lend Lease
Europe Limited, has the option to
develop 194 acres of the Greenwich
Peninsula in south east London
adjacent to the Thames, of which
Quintain owns 18.5 acres. Following
the London Borough of Greenwich’ s
grant of planning permission in
February 2004, construction of the 
first homes is expected to start in 
Spring 2005. 
This landmark £5 billion, 20 year
regeneration scheme is one of the
largest ever seen in the UK, providing
10,000 new homes and creating an
estimated 24,000 new jobs for the
regional economy. The development
also comprises circa 3.6m sq ft of
commercial and 335,000 sq ft of 
retail space. 
Some 38% of the housing will be
affordable, key worker and special
needs homes. Community benefits
include two new schools, a new health
facility, a new multi-faith centre,
improved transport infrastructure 
and high quality open spaces. Another notable event was the 
formation of a joint venture company with
Countryside Properties PLC to develop
an £89m, 9.4 acre mixed-use site at
Abbey Mills, Merton in south west London.
Sales of the apartments are in line with
expectations and the pre-let leisure, retail
and hotel development has been forward
sold to a UK institution.
Main Portfolio
The Main Portfolio currently holds about
half the property assets which contribute
approximately three quarters of the
Group’ s rental income whilst also
contributing to the uplift in NAV . We
continue to recycle our capital, selling
properties where we can see no further
opportunity to add value. In total, we 
sold £80m worth of properties during 
the reporting period, realising profits
of £6m. Since the year-end, we sold
The Parishes, Scunthorpe, at a price
of £43.1m, a profit on cost of £8.2m. 
Turning to acquisitions, we continue 
to be highly selective in the search for
properties with higher yield and the
potential for active management and/or
reversionary uplift. For example, in
November, we acquired a 57,000 sq ft
office building in Bracknell yielding 9%.
We believe that this property will benefit
from an improving South East office
market. In Central Manchester we
acquired Royal Exchange, a 40,000 sq ft
shopping mall. We plan to refurbish the
centre to provide better quality retail units.
In Leamington Spa, we purchased a
38,000 sq ft office building in October for
a yield of more than 9%, with opportunities
to improve the yield still further through
refurbishment and re-gearing of leases. 
Our larger retail assets, originally acquired
through Chesterfield, have continued 
to make major contributions to the
performance of the portfolio. Castlegate,
Stockton, remains one of the North East’ s
most successful shopping centres.
We continue to maximise the reversionary
potential and are working with the local
council on plans to extend the centre 
to assist in the regeneration of the 
town. At Anglia Square, on the edge of 
Norwich city, we are looking at an urban
regeneration project centred around our
existing shopping centre investment. 
We continue to reduce our exposure
overseas and have sold the Hanford 
Mall shopping centre in California. 
The property was sold in excess of
book value, realising a profit of £2.2m. 
Elsewhere within the portfolio, we have
concluded the rent review on Fountain
Street, Manchester, and are in active
negotiations to re-gear the NHS Trust’ s
PFI agreement on our APU unit at
Dartford. Our rolling refurbishment and
rebranding of our multi-let office/retail
property at Smallbrook Queensway,
Birmingham, continues apace. This
property continues to benefit from the
transformation of Central Birmingham.  Quintain Third Party (Q3P) 
We are expanding our Q3P business 
with the intention of building a high
income stream with a low capital base
using structured finance, joint ventures
and fees from fund management. In
order to fulfil our ambition, the Q3P 
team has been strengthened.
Since the year-end, we have agreed 
with Morley to expand the Quercus health
care fund from £245m up to £450m. The
fund is structured to give us investment
income, fees and a performance related
bonus. We have widened the investment
remit to include small hospitals, assisted
living villages and diagnostic treatment
centres in addition to nursing homes,
specialist care homes and learning
disability homes. 
We are also examining structured finance
and fund management opportunities in
the university and leisure sectors.
Outlook
With inflation subdued and interest 
rates still relatively low, debt driven 
buyers remain active and competition is
increasing with the return of institutional
interest. Although it is difficult to find value
in the market, we have made purchases
of £55m during the year and £27m since
the year-end. 
We have a robust balance sheet with a
majority of our borrowings at fixed rates.
Our development and regeneration
activities are supported by the income
stream from the main investment portfolio
and Q3P revenues. Through a flexible
approach to these projects we anticipate
delivering exceptional returns.
We will continue to recycle our capital
actively and the expansion of Q3P will
contribute to a stable and significant
revenue stream in the years ahead. 
Last, but by no means least, our 
20m sq ft development programme 
in Special Projects is exciting and
challenging but we are more than 
up to the tasks that lie ahead.

Abbey Mills, Merton
Abbey Mills is a mixed-use
development facing the River Wandle 
in Merton, south west London, built
around the existing Abbey Mills market.
With joint venture partner, Countryside
Properties PLC, we are building 276
apartments, a hotel, a health and fitness
centre and two restaurants. As at 18
June 2004, building on Phase I had
started, with contracts exchanged 
on 72 apartments with a further 22
reserved. The average price is £185,000
for a one bedroom apartment and
£280,000 for a two bedroom apartment.
The commercial element of the
development, comprising the hotel,
restaurants, and health and fitness
centre has been sold forward. Finance House, Exeter
Five storey mid 1970’ s office building
under refurbishment. 38,374 sq ft
arranged on lower ground, ground 
and three upper floors together with 
12 underground car parking spaces.
The Royal Exchange, Manchester
City centre location of 40,000 sq ft 
of retail space in a shopping arcade. 
20 ground floor shop units together
with shop units arranged on sub
basement, basement, first floor
and mezzanine. Refurbishment
programme planned.
The Parishes, Scunthorpe
Town centre shopping scheme opened
in October 2002. 243,474 sq ft of retail
space in 28 shop units, including four
large shop units over 20,000 sq ft, a
multiplex cinema of 26,695 sq ft and 
six kiosk units. Quintain also has development
properties with leases taken back from
tenants. As at 31 March 2004, voids in
relation to these made up 6.6% of ERV
(2003: 5.7%), the largest increase coming
from the purchase of Royal Exchange,
Manchester, where major refurbishment
is currently planned. The letting of 36
Gracechurch Street offset the surrender
at 37-41 Gracechurch Street. 
The average unexpired lease term is 
15 years. Armageddon, which is when
rent equals interest assuming no tenants
renew and all breaks are exercised, 
is 2020. 
Profit from the sale of trading properties
was £0.3m (2003: £2.5m). This reflects
the lower level of trading disposals with
the opening balance sheet including 
only £1.8m of stock (2003: £7.7m). 
The increased level of stock during 2004
reflects the acquisition and build costs in
relation to Merton Abbey Mills, the mixed-
use development carried out in joint
venture with Countryside Properties PLC. 
Income from leisure operations of £6.6m
includes a full year of operating income 
at Wembley. The £2.8m for the previous
year related to eight months of trading
following the acquisition of Wembley
(London) Ltd in August 2002.

Rebecca Worthington
Finance Director
Returns on Shareholders’ Equity 
Quintain’ s total return, as measured by
dividend plus increase in net asset value,
was 18.9% (2003: 16%). The largest
contributor to this increase was the
surplus arising from revaluation of the
portfolios of 57.6p per share. Profits
added 12.4p per share before deducting
8.75p for the full year dividend. 
Profit and Loss Account 
Reported profit before tax for the year
increased by 14.8% to £16m (2003:
£14m). Turnover was 5% ahead at
£60.5m, with gross profit up 10.5% 
at £40.4m. Rent coming on stream of
£3.5m from purchases more than offset
rent of £3.2m lost from sales. A further
£2.2m of rent was generated in relation
to new leases. Net rents included back
rent of £2.6m less exceptional repair
costs of £3m in relation to Neathouse
Place. Rents passing as at 31 March
2004 were £40.2m, with an estimated
rental value (ERV) of £51.3m. 
Voids have increased in the year and 
now stand at 5.1% of ERV (2003: 2.6%).
Of this movement, the purchase of York
House adds 0.6%, lease expiries add
1.2% and the practical completion of
development at Croydon Valley Trading
Estate adds 0.4%.  13 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Financial Director’s Review

The increase in other income of 
£1.7m to £3.7m was driven by surrender
premiums of £2.3m (2003: £0.5m). The
largest of these was £2.2m in respect 
of 37-41 Gracechurch Street where, in
conjunction with 36 Gracechurch Street,
Quintain obtained a 113,000 sq ft
development consent. 
Administrative expenses increased 
by £5.6m to £16m. Incorporating a full
year of operations at Wembley resulted 
in their share of administrative expenses
going up by £1.9m to £4.3m. Of the
remaining increase, £2.4m related to staff
costs. Over the last two years, staff have
been recruited to increase the Group’ s
skills base and internal resources to give
it the right platform from which to grow
the business. 
Administrative expenses include £0.8m
of fees paid to our auditors, KPMG, for
non-audit work. Of this, £0.4m related 
to tax advice and compliance. In line 
with corporate governance best practice,
tax work has been transferred to Deloitte
& T ouche LLP with effect from the new
financial year. In addition, £0.4m of fees
were paid for due diligence and legal
work for the acquisition of Power
Securities (Manchester) Ltd. Fees paid 
to other accountancy firms amounted 
to £0.3m (2003: £0.3m). 
Operating profit from joint ventures fell by
£0.8m to £3.6m as the result of the sale
of the Company’ s interest in Hanford Mall, 
a shopping centre in California. 
Net interest payable amounted to £18.2m
compared with £17.8m in the prior year.
Notional interest of £1.5m (2003: £0.9m)
was charged in relation to the deferred
payment for the Wembley Complex.
Interest capitalised in the year was £3.2m
(2003: £2.3m), of which £1.6m related
to development sites at the Wembley
Complex and £1.2m to Meridian Delta.
Interest receivable in the year was 
£0.8m (2003: £0.7m). 
Taxation 
Quintain has an effective tax charge 
of 0% for the year (2003: 11.8%). This
results from a combination of factors.
£1.8m net of prior year UK tax losses
were utilised in addition to £1.1m net 
of overseas losses, the latter covering all 
the profit made on the disposal of Hanford
Mall. Capital allowances of £2m net 
were accumulated with crystallization 
of allowances on disposals more than
offsetting the deferred tax provision. 
A full reconciliation of the current tax
charge is shown in note 6 to the accounts.
T ax has a material impact on total
returns. The Group’ s policy has always
been to seek to retain the benefit of capital
allowances on the disposal of properties
and this together with brought forward
tax losses should keep the effective tax
rate below the standard 30%. Because
the timing of sales has a material impact
on taxation, it is difficult to give precise
estimates of future rates at this time. 
Assuming all properties are sold at the
revalued amounts, the Company has 
an estimated potential capital gains 
tax liability of £40.1m (2003: £42.4m).
This equates to 30.9p per share. 
Balance Sheet 
At 31 March 2004, the investment
portfolio was valued at £797.7m (2003:
£722.5m). The movement in value of the
portfolio reflected purchases of £55.3m,
capital expenditure of £14.9m, disposals
of £61.5m, transfers to stock of £3m 
and a revaluation uplift of £69.3m. 
Major revaluation movements include an
uplift of £24.9m on the Wembley Complex.
During the year , with the London Borough
of Brent having adopted the Group’ s
master planning framework, Quintain
submitted a planning application for
5.3m sq ft of mixed-use development
over 42 acres. Delisting was obtained for
the 13 acre Palace of Arts and Industry
sites opening the way for a further
planning application. After the year-end,
aresolution to grant planning was given
by London Borough of Brent. 
The Meridian Delta joint venture for 
the redevelopment of the Greenwich
Peninsula increased in value by £14.4m.
During the year, a resolution to grant
planning for 14.1m sq ft of mixed-use
development was obtained and received
approval from the Mayor of London and
notice from the Secretary of State that
the application would not be called in. 
In addition, the legal agreement setting
out the conduct of development on the
Peninsula and the package of community
benefits was signed with the London
Borough of Greenwich. Following the
year-end, the final legal agreements
between all parties were signed which
represented the last formal hurdle before
starting on site. 
The value of Neathouse Place, 
London, rose by £5.4m to £65m after
settlement of the outstanding litigation
and agreement being reached on the
June 2002 rent review. The property has 
been sold since the year-end for £67.8m.
Other strong performers were the retail
assets, with Castlegate Shopping Centre
in Stockton showing a 13.8% uplift to
£40.8m and Anglia Square, Norwich,
up 13.2% at £19.5m. 
Net Asset Value 
The basic net asset value per share at 
31 March 2004 was 405p, an uplift of
16.4% from the 348p for the prior year.
On a diluted basis, the net asset value
per share rose 16.7% from 342p to 399p.
The triple net asset value per share was up
20.9% at 364p after taking into account
4p for marking to market of debt and 
31p for unprovided capital gains. 
Joint Ventures 
At 31 March 2004, Quintain had net
investment in joint ventures totalling
£31.3m. Having sold its interest in
Hanford Mall in California during the year,
the only remaining joint venture is with
Morley Asset Management, the asset
management arm of Aviva. Quintain 
has a 20% equity interest in Quercus, 
a nursing home fund, and as property
manager is entitled to basic, transaction
and performance fees.  15 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Financial Director’s Review
Finance 
Gearing at 31 March 2004 was 56%
(2003: 63%). Transactions post year-end
bring this down to circa 40%, giving ample
scope for funding existing projects and
new deals. At the year-end, there were
£124.5m of committed facilities undrawn.
Since the year-end, a £400m corporate
loan fully underwritten by Bank of
Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds
has been concluded. The facility is for five
years with possible one year extensions
at the end of the first and second years.
Of the £400m, £125m is a term facility
with the remaining £275m being
revolving. The margin is 0.95% 
with a 0.375% commitment fee. 
The main financial covenants are 
a maximum gearing of 130% of net 
assets excluding joint ventures, with the
possibility of extending it to 150% with
the banks’ permission and an increase 
in margin to 1.35%. Interest cover must
be 1.25 times covered by earnings before
tax and interest, plus surpluses or deficits
over cost on the disposal of properties. 
A maximum of 30% of net worth can 
be invested in separately financed 
joint ventures. 
This agreement marks a step-change 
in the Group’ s funding arrangements
from secured to corporate borrowing and
is a powerful endorsement of Quintain’ s
management by these first-class banks.
The facility will increase liquidity and
operational flexibility and provide a
competitive advantage in bidding for
investment assets. The new structure 
is expandable and will provide a robust
platform for our next stage of growth.
Drawings have initially been used to
repay existing debt, with remaining
capacity available to fund future
expansion, and, in particular, Special
Projects. The facility is currently being
syndicated to a wide group of banks. 
As at 31 March 2004, Quintain was 
76% hedged with swaps (2003: 100%). 
With post year-end sales, it is currently
fully hedged. Company policy is to be
between two thirds and fully hedged as,
given the nature of its income, it seeks 
to match the revenue profile with certainty
in relation to finance costs. The weighted
average rate of interest of the Company’ s
debt at the year-end was 6.1% (2003:
6.2%) and the weighted average maturity
of borrowing was approximately 
five years. 
The fair value deficit on fixed debt 
and interest rate hedging instruments 
as disclosed in accordance with FRS 13
was £8.4m, equivalent to a reduction in
the Company’ s net asset value per share
of 6p, compared with 13p at the previous
year-end. After taking into account tax
relief, these figures would be 4p and 9p
respectively. Interest cover for the year
ended 31 March 2004 was 1.6 times
(2003: 1.6 times). 
Cashflow 
Net cash outflow before management 
of liquid resources and financing was
£17.4m (2003: £40.3m). This was funded
by a net draw down of loans of £14.6m.
Of the £24.8m purchase of shares in
subsidiary companies, £18m related 
to a deferred payment for Wembley
(London) Ltd. 
Pensions 
Quintain operates a defined contribution
scheme and has no liabilities arising
under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits. 
Financial Reporting 
As from 1 April 2005, Quintain’ s
accounts, in line with all listed companies
in the European Union, will be prepared
under International Accounting Standards
(IAS). The Company has adopted
systems to prepare for this and has
identified the following areas where there
will be major variations between existing
accounting under UK GAAP and IAS:
– under UK GAAP , there is no
requirement to provide for deferred 
tax on timing differences relating to 
the revaluation of investment properties
unless there is a binding contract to
sell the property at the balance sheet
date. IAS requires deferred tax to be
provided on all temporary differences,
which includes differences between
the carrying value of investment
properties and their tax bases. The
deferred tax liability will be reduced 
to the extent that there are suitable 
tax losses available. The area where
this will have the most significant
impact is in providing for the capital
gains tax on the difference between
the asset valuation and tax base cost.
This change is expected to reduce 
net assets by the amount set out 
as unprovided in note 17 to the
accounts, however it will have no
material impact on triple net NAV
(being diluted NAV after deducting
capital gains tax and marking to
market of debt); 
– investment properties will continue to
be revalued each year. However, this
movement will be included within the
current year profit and loss account.
This change will have no impact on 
net assets; 
– under UK GAAP , interests in leasehold
properties are valued on a net basis,
that is to say, head leases payments
are deducted in valuing the assets. 
A recent change to IAS allows
leasehold interests to be recognised
as investment properties with any
associated cash outflows recognised
separately in the balance sheet,
resulting in a grossing up of assets 
and liabilities; 
– IAS require derivatives to be fair valued
with the movement in the year taken 
to the profit and loss account unless 
it can be demonstrated that they are
effective hedges; 
–currently the final dividend is 
provided for, although approval is only
given at the AGM after the results are
announced. Post balance sheet items
where there is no commitment, such
as a final dividend, should not be
provided for under IAS.

Introduction
The board is ultimately responsible 
for the Group’ s strategy and policies in
relation to corporate responsibility as part
of its corporate governance, recognising
the potential environmental and social
impact its business operations might
have on the wider economy.
In addition to compliance with current
legislation, the Group has policies and
codes of conduct encouraging high
standards of corporate behaviour in
areas such as equal opportunities and
health and safety. 
Whilst their primary duty is to 
increase shareholder value, the directors
acknowledge that in discharging this
obligation, they also have responsibilities
to other stakeholders. Such interests 
as those of its joint venture partners,
tenants, staff and the local communities
are important to the Group’ s long-term
success.
The Group is committed to the
management of health and safety, the
environment and the development of 
its people. It aims to keep any negative
impact of its business operations to 
a minimum, encouraging a positive
contribution through appropriate 
environmental policies and objectives,
which are considered an integral part of
its business activities. It views the proper
management of corporate responsibility
issues as an opportunity for future growth
through control of risk, so as to provide
its shareholders and other stakeholders
with additional confidence. The Group’ s
two urban regeneration sites, Greenwich
and Wembley, are an illustration of how 
it is working towards the needs of future
tenants, communities, local and central
government. Built on ‘brownfield’ land,
these mixed-use developments will
revitalise communities through the creation
of new jobs, homes for all social groups,
leisure facilities, community and 
office space.
Social and Environmental
The Group recognises the 
importance of long-term maintenance 
of the environment and encourages
continuous environmental awareness,
aiming to minimise the risk of causing
harm through: 
– careful consideration of construction
techniques; 
–the specification and use of sustainable
materials with a view to the elimination
of materials or substances harmful to
the environment;
–safe encapsulation or removal of
asbestos and other contaminative
materials from its sites;
–reduction of waste; and 
– the adoption of safe working practices
in the construction and maintenance
of its buildings.  
Amongst the measures taken during this
period to minimise the risk of harm to the
environment were:
– compliance with relevant environmental
regulations and local environmental
controls;
– evaluation of contamination issues 
and the conduct of remedial work in
new projects;  
– appropriate controls requiring tenants
to comply with environmental best
practice; and
– inspection of its properties from
an environmental perspective.
In addition the Group has taken positive
steps to create sustainable mixed-use
development projects which:

Whilst their primary duty
is to increase shareholder value,
the directors acknowledge that 
in discharging this obligation, 
they also have responsibilities 
to other stakeholders. 17 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Corporate Responsibility
–are safe and people friendly, with
an adequate range of residential,
commercial and retail properties;
– support local shops, education,
health and other community facilities
(including the incorporation of public
spaces) to foster community cohesion;
– include affordable housing, a
proportion of which is suitable
for key workers;
– through economic regeneration create
job opportunities for local people;
– concentrate on brownfield sites and
urban centres, thereby rejuvenating
these areas;
–reduce dependence on car use by
siting developments close to public
transport and local facilities, working
in co-ordination with local transport
authorities; and
–promote energy efficiency through
better transport links, production
and use of building materials. 
During development the policy is to:
– avoid the unnecessary generation of
waste through the recycling of waste
and water; 
–minimise the depletion of natural
resources and to reduce site
contamination to acceptable levels;
– wherever possible, protect wildlife
areas and/or restore the ecological
balance of the environment and
to promote a natural habitat for
enjoyment by the local community;
– use off-site manufacturing and building
techniques, where appropriate, to
minimise disruption to residents during
construction; and
– work closely with the relevant private
bodies and local authorities to ensure
all guidelines and regulations are
properly considered and adhered to.
Prior to the acquisition of every 
property an environmental report is
commissioned  covering the potential
existence of contaminative materials and
recommendations for any necessary
remedial action.
As part of an ongoing commitment 
to reducing office waste, the use of
electronic documentation is encouraged.
The holding of records and transactions
in electronic format is constantly under
review and steps have been taken
towards this. Agreements are in place 
for the recycling of as much of this waste
as possible.
Sustainable development (including
related environmental issues)
The Group aims to deliver sustainable
long-term regeneration, anticipating
lengthy involvement in projects such as
Wembley and the Greenwich Peninsula
for the benefit of local people and their
communities.
Through these two projects the Group,
either solely or with its joint venture
partners, is involved in the provision 
of 13,700 new homes for London. 
Of these, over 5,000 will be affordable
homes for key workers and those unable
to buy or rent in the open market. It is
anticipated that over 30,000 new jobs will
be created in these new neighbourhoods
and the Group’ s activities will bring to
them improved economic growth and
social inclusivity.
There has been extensive consultation
with local resident and community
groups and local government. There
has also been significant liaison with the
Mayor of London’ s Office, the Office of
the Deputy Prime Minister, the London 
Development Agency and the Secretary 
of State for Culture, Media and Sport.
The Group, together with its Greenwich
joint venture partner, Lend Lease
Europe Limited, is making a significant
contribution towards the achievement
of The London Plan: the Mayor’ s vision
for an exemplar world city.
The urban regeneration projects will 
have the following characteristics:
– be appealing places to live, with
landmark attractions, well-designed
accommodation and community
spaces;
– be drivers of economic growth for the
local community, bringing jobs to the
area through provision of new office,
leisure, entertainment and retail space,
as well as by attracting people to the
environment surrounding the landmark
attractions of the Greenwich Millennium
Dome, the new National Stadium and
refurbished Wembley Arena;
– be environmentally efficient through
the use of both environmentally friendly
construction techniques and designs
that aim to minimise ongoing energy
use, within the business constraints 
of each project; and 
– be contributors to local infrastructure
through such means as the
enhancement of transport links and
construction of schools, as recently
demonstrated in Section 106 
planning agreements.
The Housing Corporation, which funds
and regulates housing associations, 
has agreed to support both of these
major developments by making grants
available to partner housing associations
working with the Group. 18 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Corporate Responsibility
Health and safety
The Group is committed to the highest
standards of care in the provision of 
a safe and healthy environment for 
its employees, tenants and visitors. 
It actively promotes a culture of good
practice in health and safety, leading 
to the avoidance of, or reduction in, 
risks to health and safety and ensuring
compliance with the Health and 
Safety at Work Act 1974 and 
associated legislation. 
To this end the activities 
at its London office have been audited 
by its external advisor National Britannia
Limited, which assists staff with specific
health and safety responsibilities in
reviewing exposure to risk. Whilst the
Group’ s Wembley office does not use
external auditors, it employs its own 
team of professionally qualified
personnel. In addition insurers and
underwriters arrange their own audit 
as part of the renewal process and 
the minor recommendations made 
have been implemented.  
The objectives include:
– the elimination, wherever possible, of
risks to health and safety and, where
not possible, their effective control;
– the reduction of accidents and other
incidents to their lowest possible level;
– ensuring that employees are
appropriately trained to carry
out their duties;
– the review of risks and controls on an
ongoing basis to improve standards of
health and safety and compliance with
legislation and best practice;
– the maintenance of a management
system which, inter alia, identifies
responsibilities of key personnel and 
a corporate health and safety
structure; and
– the promotion of staff awareness 
in relation to good practice in
minimising risks.
Within Wembley’ s operating business,
there is a health and safety team of 
15 full-time staff headed by a dedicated,
fully-qualified and experienced health 
and safety officer.  Other qualified
members of the team are on duty 
24 hours a day. The team files a report
with its Managing Director after every
event held on the Complex.  Health and
safety issues are discussed at formal
PLC board meetings and at Wembley’ s
board, senior manager and safety
committee meetings. 
During the year, the board initiated a
rigorous process designed to check
that managing agents have appropriate
procedures in place for the buildings for
which they are responsible, including
health and safety and compliance with
the Disability Discrimination and The
Control of Asbestos at Work legislation.
Managing agents are now required to
report on health and safety matters on
a quarterly basis.  
Following the introduction of recent
legislation, appropriate external advice
has been taken in relation to asbestos
at the Group’ s properties, which is either
removed or enclosed and monitored,
whichever is the safer.  
During a recent audit process at
Wembley, the numerous contractors on
the Complex were assessed to establish
their competency to carry out works in 
a safe manner. This included completion
of a lengthy questionnaire on work
practices specifically targeted at their 19 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Corporate Responsibility
health and safety arrangements.
Wembley required all safety issues
identified to be addressed and remedial
action taken as a condition of the
contractor being permitted continued
access to the site.
During the year the Group’ s Health and
Safety Policy and manual of regulations
was reviewed and these will need to be
reconsidered annually in line with a
philosophy of continuous improvement
in all areas of the business including
safety performance and culture. 
The services of a doctor and full-time
nurse, located at Wembley, are available
for all staff to consult in confidence.
During the year, and up to the date of
publication of this report, the directors
confirm that no incident has occurred in
any of the Group’ s properties (either at
the Wembley Complex or across the
property portfolio) which was so serious
as to necessitate the filing of a RIDDOR
report.
Notwithstanding more than two million
visitors to the Wembley Complex in the
financial year, only six incidents occurred
which were sufficiently serious that the
Group’ s insurers had to be informed, a
similar record to that of previous years.
The Group has an equally low level 
of incidents within its property portfolio,
where there were ten minor insurance
claims in the financial year, nine of which
occurred at the its largest shopping
centre in Stockton-on-T ees where annual
footfall exceeds four million people.
Staff
The Group recognises the contribution 
of its highly motivated staff to its continued
success. Employees are encouraged to
develop their careers through the funding
of appropriate training and qualifications,
and are given relevant study leave.
Wembley has in-house training facilities
for those wishing to improve their skills 
in areas such as Information T echnology.
During the year in excess of 155
professional or in-house training courses
were undertaken. In addition each
employee is regularly appraised with a
view to maximising his or her potential
and contribution.
There are opportunities for staff to 
make formal input into the management
of the business. A flat corporate structure
and “open door” policy promotes
communication and encourages
maximum contribution. Wembley
conducts a twice yearly staff satisfaction
survey and also has an Investor 
in People accreditation.
The Group is an equal opportunities
employer. Strict codes of conduct are set
out in the corporate handbook to ensure
that this policy is pursued throughout. 
During the year the Group employed an
average of 57 permanent staff at its head
office and 113 at Wembley, comprising:
%
Gender: Women 47
Ethnic origin: 10
Age range: 18-30 years 25
31-45 years 38

Report of the Directors
The directors submit their report 
for the year ended 31 March 2004.
Business of the Group
The principal activity of the Group is
property investment and generating
profits from property. Its wholly owned
subsidiary, Wembley (London) Limited,
operates in the leisure sector and
contributed approximately 10% of 
the Group’ s total operating profit for the
year. The development of the Group’ s
business and the Group’ s results and
strategy are set out in the Chairman’ s
Statement, the Chief Executive’ s Review
and the Financial Director’ s Review.
The results of the Group for the year
ended 31 March 2004 may be found 
in the financial statements on pages 
49 to 71.
An interim dividend of 2.75p per share
(2003: 2.75p per share) was paid on 
19 December 2003. The directors 
now recommend the payment of a final
dividend of 6p per share (2003: 5.25p),
making a total of 8.75p per share in
respect of the year ended 31 March
2004 (2003: 8p per share), an increase 
of 9.4% over that of the previous 
year. This payment will be made on 
10 September 2004 to shareholders 
on the register at 13 August 2004.
The Group operates a progressive
dividend policy, as demonstrated by its
annual dividend payments over the past
few years. This policy, together with the
recommended final dividend, will be put
to the Group’ s shareholders at its next

Note: Since 31 March 2004, through the

due to expire shortly thereafter) NSK Shattock
acquired an additional 48,714 ordinary shares.
In June 2004 he also purchased a further
7,000 ordinary shares making his total holding
of shares in the Company 248,937 at 
18 June 2004. In July 2004 JR Hamilton
Stubber purchased 10,000 ordinary shares 
in the Company. 23 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Report of the Directors
Payment Policy
In the absence of dispute, amounts due
to trade and other suppliers are settled
as expeditiously as possible within their
terms of payment. Trade creditors at
the year-end represent approximately
34 days’ purchase (2003: 33 days).
Share Capital 
During the year no shares were
purchased by the Company for
cancellation. The Company issued
490,849 ordinary shares of 25p each
following the exercise of share options
under the Company’ s Approved
Executive Share Option Scheme and
its unapproved schemes. It also issued
1.5m ordinary shares to Scottish
Equitable under a 1993 option
arrangement. At 31 March 2004 the
authorised share capital of the Company
stood at £50,000,000 and its issued
share capital at £32,322,864.
Authority to allot shares
Resolution 16 in the Notice of Annual
General Meeting seeks the authority 
of the members for the Company to 
allot shares up to the nominal value 
of £10,774,288, being one third of the
nominal value of the issued share capital.
Whilst the Company has no present
intention to allot any further shares
other than in respect of directors’ and
employee share plan obligations, the
directors request the flexibility to do so,
should the need arise. This resolution also
seeks the members’ authority to allot
additional shares up to a nominal value 
of £1,478,764 (being the nominal value 
of shares to be issued in respect of
outstanding options, share rights and
convertibles). Similar authorities were
given to the directors at the last Annual
General Meeting.
Authority to exclude 
pre-emption rights
Under Section 95 of the Companies 
Act the members may elect to disregard
the provisions of Section 89, whereby 
the Company must first offer shares 
to its shareholders in proportion to their
existing holdings. Resolution 19 in the
Notice of Annual General Meeting seeks
the authority of the members for the
directors to disregard the pre-emption
rights conferred by Section 89 to a
limited extent. The authority is sought 
in respect of a sum not exceeding the
Section 89 Amount (as defined in the
Company’ s Articles of Association) being
£1,616,143 or 5% of the current issued
share capital. A similar authority was
given to the Company at the last Annual
General Meeting.
Authority to purchase own shares
Resolution 20 as set out in the Notice 
of Annual General Meeting seeks the
authority of the members for the
Company to purchase its own shares.
This authority would be to purchase up to
19,393,719 ordinary shares, representing
approximately 15% of the issued share
capital of the Company as at 31 March
2004, at or between the minimum and
maximum prices specified in the
Resolution. Again, grant of a similar
authority last year expires at this meeting,
and the Company seeks the members’
approval to keep this option open for a
further year. As in the past, full account
would be taken of major factors such 
as the effect on earnings and net asset
value per share, due consideration 
being given to appropriate gearing levels,
alternative investment opportunities and
the overall financial position of the Group.
Any share so purchased would either 
be cancelled or held as treasury shares
within the 10% limit required by best
practice guidelines.
Donations
The Company made charitable
donations of £18,100 in the financial year
(2003: £1,850). The Company made no
political donations in either 2003 or 2004.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
(Dividend Plan)
The directors have decided to offer the
shareholders the opportunity to elect 
to use their cash dividend to buy further
ordinary shares in the Company through
a special low-cost dealing arrangement.
It is intended that the Dividend Plan 
will be run by the Company’ s Registrars,
Computershare Investor Services PLC,
(which is authorised and regulated by
the Financial Services Authority (FSA)
in the conduct of this service), or any
successor that may be appointed
(the Dividend Plan Administrator).
A brochure giving full details of the 
Dividend Plan is being sent to all
shareholders with this Report and these
will also be available from the Dividend
Plan Administrator or on the Company’ s
website at www.quintain-estates.com.
Shareholders will be given the
opportunity to vote on the introduction 
of the Dividend Plan at the AGM.

the Company of a beneficial interest of 3% or more in its ordinary share capital:

Corporate Governance Report
The directors take decisions objectively
and in the best interests of the Group,
being collectively and individually,
responsible for its success.
Introduction
The following report is a summary of
the Company’ s system of Corporate
Governance. During the year to
31 March 2004, the directors reviewed
best practice, referring to the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (the
Code), the Higgs and Smith reports 
and other guidance.
As a result, the directors are
recommending three changes to the
Company’ s Memorandum and Articles 
of Association. Shareholders will be asked
to amend the provision that restricts the
number of directors to ten, and to lift 
the limit of £100,000 per annum for 
non-executive directors’ aggregate
remuneration. Full details of these
changes are included in the Notice 
of Annual General Meeting on pages 
73 and 74. Whilst the Company has a
board of ten, and no present intention 
to increase its size, these limitations
might fetter the board’ s ability to manage
its business effectively particularly as 
best practice guidelines now encourage
a significant independent director
participation. In the board’ s opinion these
changes neither detract from shareholder
value, nor materially reduce shareholder
rights. As part of its overall review of the
business the board will continue to
monitor the Memorandum and Articles 
of Association at least once a year.
Copies of both the existing and proposed 
Memoranda and Articles of Association
are available to shareholders free of
charge from the registered office and
through the corporate website.
The board collectively and individually
subscribes to the principles and
provisions in the Code and associated
guidance and confirms that the
Company is in compliance, save that
a formal system of board evaluation is
still being finalised on which the directors
will report next year.
The Board of Directors
A schedule of matters reserved for 
the board has been approved which is
reviewed at least once a year. It includes
those matters that are most significant 
to the Group, based on the nature and
size of the transaction, both in terms 
of financial impact and risk. These are
available to all shareholders – again
through the website or on request 
from the registered office. 
As part of its collective responsibility for
the management of the Group, the board
must ensure that adequate resources are
in place to achieve its strategic aims, that
its obligations to shareholders and other
stakeholders are met. In the management
of Group assets the board is also
conscious both of environmental issues
and community relations. As part of the
planning process for the Wembley and
Greenwich urban regeneration projects
the Group has also engaged in 
extensive consultation with central 
and local government and with the
communities involved. 
The directors take decisions 
objectively and in the best interests 
of the Group, being collectively and
individually, responsible for its success.
They are accountable to each and every
shareholder and take into consideration
the need to foster the Group’ s business
relationships with other stakeholders in
discharging that obligation.
The board comprises the Chairman plus
four executive and five non-executive
directors, all of the latter being considered
independent. It has a good balance
between executive and non-executive
directors, with the diversity of relevant
skills required to further the interests of
shareholders. Brief biographies of each
board member can be found on 
pages 20 and 21, including all external
corporate appointments. It is the Group’ s
policy that executive directors may not
hold more than one external directorship.
During the period Nick Shattock was a
non-executive director of Hills Group, but
resigned in July 2004. James Hamilton
Stubber is a director of a small family
property trading company, which does
not conflict in any way with his duties 
and responsibilities at Quintain. 25 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Corporate Governance Report
Formal board meetings are held at 
least bi-monthly and during the year 
to 31 March 2004, there were six 
formal meetings. Each meeting was fully
attended except the July meeting, from
which Adrian Wyatt was absent due to
personal reasons. During the period there
were 17 other ad hoc board meetings,
quorate, but not necessarily of the full
board, to facilitate day to day business
operations. In addition, the Chairman
held two formal and a number of informal
meetings solely with the non-executive
directors. The non-executive directors
also met at least twice without the
Chairman present.
The board is offered training and
information in a form and of a quality 
it believes is appropriate to enable it to
discharge its duties. Directors receive
training in specific areas relevant to their
speciality and relevant to the board as 
a whole. New directors are offered an
induction programme including tailor-
made elements where appropriate. 
Joan MacNaughton, who became a 
non-executive director in January 2004,
is following an Institute of Directors’
course on The Role and Responsibilities
of Being a Non-Executive Director. 
In addition Joan has undertaken a
familiarisation programme of the Group’ s
business including a visit to key sites,
meetings with executive directors and
other members of staff.
The directors have access to the
company secretary, who is both
a qualified solicitor and chartered
secretary. The company secretary 
keeps the directors informed of
corporate governance issues and
changes in the law and best practice
guidance, ensuring board procedures 
are complied with, where required, 
and has access to external professional
advice at the Group’ s expense.
The non-executive directors bring
independent views to the board. They
have diverse experience having expertise
in chartered surveying, the civil service,
accountancy, law and economics to add
to the board’ s effectiveness, particularly
in the areas of corporate strategy,
governance and risk. Non-executive
directors take an active part in debate
and not being afraid to challenge
proposals ensures the robustness 
of board decisions. The Hon. Barbara
Thomas is the deputy chairman of 
the Financial Reporting Council and
chairman of the Professional Standards
Advisory Board of the Institute of
Directors. Barbara is a lawyer and expert
in corporate governance and continues 
to be the nominated Senior Independent
Director (SID). Barbara’ s experience 
and qualifications make her the most
appropriate non-executive director for
this role and she is available to meet
shareholders on request and at the AGM. 
Non-executive directors’ contracts are
initially for a period of three years, which
may be extended for a further period
subject to re-election by the members 
in general meeting. Executive directors
have rolling service contracts which
provide for a notice period of six months.
None of the service agreements contain
any liquidated damages or payment in
lieu of damages on change of control
provisions. All directors’ contracts are
available for inspection at the registered
office, at the AGM, and on the
Company’ s website. 
In accordance with the Company’ s
Articles, each director must stand for 
re-election at least every three years. 
The terms of Reference of the Audit and
Remuneration Committees require the
chairman of each committee to offer
himself/herself for re-election annually. 
This year Martin Meech, Rebecca
Worthington, David Pangbourne and
Barbara Thomas are standing for re-
election as directors. David Pangbourne
is also standing for re-election in his
capacity as Chairman of both the Audit
and Remuneration Committees. Joan
MacNaughton is standing for election,
this being the first opportunity for the
members to vote on her appointment 
to the board in January. The board
recommends to shareholders that 
those directors offering themselves 
for election at its forthcoming AGM 
be elected.
Board Committees
The Company’ s policy is that all 
non-executives are members of all
committees. Whilst the directors are
aware that this may not be regarded 
as best practice by some, they believe 
it to be in the interests of the Company
to have maximum diversity of skills 
on all committees. 
David Pangbourne is currently Chairman
of both the Audit and Remuneration
Committee. Although some guidelines
judge this not to be ideal, the directors
consider that David, being now retired
from full-time practice, is able to commit
the significant time required to execute
both roles. In addition, being a Chartered
Accountant of many years’ experience,
his skills make him an ideal Chairman of
the Audit Committee. It is the board’ s
intention that David will retain his
Chairmanship of the Audit Committee
for the foreseeable future, but that the
Chairmanship of the Remuneration
Committee will continue to rotate more
regularly than that of the Audit Committee,
as it has done in the past.
The Audit Committee meets formally 
at least three times each year. It also
meets separately with the auditors and
the Company’ s property valuers. During
the year ended 31 March 2004, the
Committee met on six occasions. Its
Terms of Reference include consideration
of the appointment and terms of
engagement of the external and internal
auditors together with a review of their
independence, objectivity and
effectiveness, the coordination of internal
and external auditors, reviewing auditors’
reports, annual and interim reports, asset
valuations, internal control policy and
procedures and consistency.  26 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Corporate Governance Report
Best practice introduced since the 
year end requires the Audit Committee 
to comprise only non-executive 
directors and accordingly Nigel Ellis 
has resigned from the Audit Committee.
The Remuneration Committee meets 
at least three times each year. During 
the year ended 31 March 2004, the
Committee met five times. Its T erms 
of Reference include consideration of 
all aspects of the executive directors’
performance, employment, remuneration
and incentives. It also sets the remuneration
and incentives policy of the Group as a
whole and approves the remuneration of
senior staff. The remuneration report is
set out on pages 28 to 35.
The Nominations Committee is
responsible for the selection and
approval of candidates for appointment
to the board. The Committee meets
formally at least once a year and
otherwise when required. It is chaired 
by Nigel Ellis and comprises all the
non-executive directors and the Chief
Executive. Whilst some guidance views
Adrian Wyatt’ s membership of this
Committee as not ideal, the directors
believe it to be in the best interests
of the Group. The Committee’ s T erms
of Reference include the regular review
of the structure and composition of
the board, the identification of suitable
candidates to fill vacancies as and when
they arise, making recommendations for
the re-election of directors and forming
succession plans. During the year
ended 31 March 2004, the Nominations
Committee met three times to discuss
the structure and size of the board,
the addition of a further director and 
its recommendations in relation to 
the subsequent appointment of
Pam Alexander and Joan MacNaughton
following the submission of applicants
from external search consultants.
The Donations Committee is responsible
for evaluating charitable requests
submitted to the Company and makes
decisions within the scope of pre-set
criteria which are reviewed periodically .
The Committee meets as necessary , and
met once in the financial year . It has, for
example, recently introduced a policy to
encourage staff participation in the raising
of funds for charity , under which it will
match the efforts of individual employees
who participate in charitable events up to
a maximum of £500 per employee. It also
has authority to consider applications
from charitable bodies connected with
the Company . The Committee is
chaired by Martin Meech and comprises
the non-executive directors and the
Chief Executive. 
A Risk Committee was formed during 
the period whose members are David
Pangbourne, John Plender, Martin
Meech, Adrian Wyatt and Rebecca
Worthington. The Committee’ s inaugural
meeting was held in January 2004 
and it is intended that it will meet at
least twice a year. Matters within its
remit include financial and treasury
issues, valuation, reputation, legal,
corporate governance, management,
economic and operational risks. 
During the year ended 31 March 2004 
the Committees met with full attendance 
on all occasions with the exception of 
the Audit and Remuneration Committee
meetings in March, which Joan
MacNaughton was unable to attend 
due to commitments made prior to her
appointment to the board, and the board
meeting in July, which Adrian Wyatt did
not attend due to personal reasons.
Lease Code
The Company is in support of the
initiatives set out in The Code of Practice
for Commercial Leases in England and
Wales, which was launched on 22 April
2002. The Code contains a range of
recommendations which are deemed 
to represent best practice between
principles and their representatives 
in landlord and tenant matters. 
Shareholder Relations
The Finance Director, with the 
assistance of her fellow executive
directors, is primarily responsible for
investor relations and regularly makes
contact with institutional and other
shareholders in an effort to maintain 
an open and effective dialogue. 
The Chairman, the SID and the other 
non-executive directors are also 
available to meet with larger shareholders
to review strategy, corporate governance,
or to discuss matters of concern.
Shareholders’ views are communicated
to the board as a whole and summaries
of shareholder meetings given to 
all directors. Formal feedback from
shareholders is also given to the 
directors by the Company’ s brokers,
Cazenove & Co Limited.
The Company’ s AGM provides a further
opportunity for investors to question the
directors, both formally and informally.
They also have a chance to meet any
new directors. The number of proxy
votes lodged for each motion is
announced at the meeting and recorded
in the minutes, a copy of which is posted
on the corporate website.
The format and content of the corporate
website at www.quintain-estates.com
was updated during the year under
review and provides information 
relating to the property portfolio, policy
statements, finance and corporate
contacts, press releases and on-screen
Annual Reports which may be
downloaded in the same format as
the hard copy. There is also a section 
on the statutory documents of the
Company, together with a facility to
contact the Company through the 
site by e-mail.
Going concern
The following statement is made 
as required by provision D.1.3 of
the Code: 
After making enquiries, including
reviewing the Group’ s budgets and
available finance, the directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group
has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to
adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the accounts. 27 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Corporate Governance Report
Directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to
prepare accounts for each financial year
which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and the
Group and of the profit and loss for that
period. In preparing those accounts the
directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies
and then apply them consistently;
–make judgements and estimates
that are reasonable and prudent; and
– state whether applicable accounting
standards have been followed, subject
to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the accounts.
The directors are responsible for keeping
proper accounting records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the
Company and the Group to enable them
to ensure that the accounts comply with
the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company
and the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Internal controls
The board is ultimately responsible for 
the Group’ s system of internal control
and for reviewing its effectiveness.
However, such a system is designed to
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives
and can provide only reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. In accordance with
the Code, the board has in place an on-
going system of identification, evaluation
and management of significant risks. The
effectiveness of the Group’ s system of
internal controls was reviewed during the
period, both by the Audit Committee and
by the board. This review included
financial, operational, compliance and risk
management. During the year and up to
the date of this report, the board was not
aware of any material risks or incidents not
previously assessed. It is anticipated that
in future years this will also be part of the
Risk Committee’ s remit.
Risk identification: managers are
responsible for ongoing identification and
evaluation of key risks applicable to their
areas and for taking appropriate action.
Risks may be associated with a variety
of internal or external sources including
control breakdowns, disruption in
information systems, competition, natural
catastrophe and regulatory requirements.
The risks identified and the actions taken
to minimise or eliminate them are
assessed on a regular basis by the
internal auditors who report to the 
Audit Committee. Significant findings
are presented to the board and can result
in refinements to internal procedures. 
Control environment: the Group 
is committed to the highest standards 
of business conduct and seeks to
maintain these standards across all of its
operations. The board considers it has
an appropriate organisational structure
for planning, executing, controlling and
monitoring business operations in order
to achieve the Group’ s objectives. 
Lines of responsibility and delegation 
of authority are documented.
Information and communication:
periodic strategic reviews are carried 
out which include the consideration of
long-term projections and the evaluation
of business alternatives. Annual budgets
and strategic plans are prepared. The
portfolio manager provides management
with regular operational progress reports
for consideration and, where necessary,
early corrective action. Periodic forecasts
support the active monitoring of the
Group’ s performance against plan. Both
results and forecasts are consolidated
and presented to the board on a
regular basis.
The other key elements of the Group’ s
system of internal control are as follows:
–regular meetings of the board and 
the Audit Committee, whose overall
responsibilities are set out in this
Report and the Audit Committee’ s
Terms of Reference;
–a management structure designed 
to enable effective decision-making
with clearly defined responsibilities
and limits of authority. An important
part of this structure is a weekly
meeting of the executive directors 
to review the ongoing business 
and decide on proposed
acquisitions/divestments;
– agreed operational procedures, both
internal and in dealings with external
bodies, which assist in the maintenance
of uniformly high standards; and
– the measurement of financial
performance at least once every 
three months against budgets and
long-term financial plans.
During the year the directors undertook
an internal audit in relation to all operating
businesses, including a review of health
and safety and insurance issues. 
The Group has entered into a number 
of joint ventures, the most material
being the Quercus Property Partnership
(Quercus), which is 20% controlled
by the Company and 80% by the
major partner, Norwich Union Life and
Pensions, whose responsibility it is to
ensure proper financial controls. Quercus
has therefore not been included as part
of the Group for the purposes of the
internal control assessment.
The board is committed to following
corporate governance best practice
wherever possible and has undertaken 
to review its position annually. It has
considered its system of internal control
and its effectiveness for the financial year
and up to the date of this report and, 
in its opinion, the process accords with 
the current guidance.

Remuneration Report
All of our incentives are discretionary,
geared towards success and payable
only on the achievement of stretching
performance measures.
Introduction
The focus of this report is on directors’
and senior colleagues’ remuneration. It
sets out the Group’ s remuneration policy
and also gives details of the salaries,
incentives, shares and pensions received
by all the directors for the year ended 
31 March 2004.
This report has been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 1985 (as amended),
the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 (the Regulations) 
and associated legislation, together with
the Listing Rules. Under the provisions 
of Part III Schedule 7A Companies Act
1985, KPMG Audit Plc has audited the
directors’ emoluments, pensions, share
option and long-term incentive schemes
sections of this Report. 
This is the third year in which 
the Remuneration Report is put 
to shareholders for approval at the 
Annual General Meeting. 
The Remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee’ s
role and membership are set out in the
Corporate Governance Report on pages
24 to 27. The Committee met five times
during the year. 
The Committee is directly responsible 
to shareholders and, as in previous 
years, its chairman will be present 
at the AGM to answer any questions 
from shareholders and offer himself 
for re-election.
The Committee’ s T erms of Reference 
are available on the Company website, 
or on request from the Group’ s registered
office at 58 Davies Street. They are
consistent with the recommendations
of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance.
Remuneration Policy
The Group’ s remuneration policy 
is based on the following principles:
–the aim is to set base salaries 
at median levels but also taking 
into account each individual’ s
responsibilities, experience and
performance;
– bonuses and other incentive-based
rewards are intended to be positioned
towards the upper quartile and are
considered to be stretching but
achievable. Whilst incentive based
remuneration is discretionary it is subject
to the achievement of predetermined
performance criteria and where this 
is achieved it can form a material part
of the total remuneration package; and
– share rights and share options are
preferred as longer-term incentives 
to enable directors and senior staff 
to share in the Group’ s success and 
to more effectively align the interests 
of management with those of the
shareholders.
This policy has been consistently 
applied since flotation in 1996.
Whilst the Committee strives to
harmonise remuneration throughout 
the Group, it recognises that this is not
always appropriate. For example, the
formulae used for the calculation of
bonus payments differ between the
Company and its more recently acquired
wholly owned subsidiary, Wembley
(London) Limited. At the Company’ s
head office, staff bonus payments are
linked to growth in net asset value, which
is considered to be the most appropriate
measure of success for a company in the
property sector. However, as Wembley
operates in the leisure industry, its staff
bonuses are linked to the achievement 
of targets based on profitability which are
believed to be a more relevant measure. 
In determining remuneration policy, the
Committee’ s objective is to ensure the
Group continues to be able to attract
and motivate individuals with the
experience and skills required to operate 29 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Remuneration Report
its businesses competitively and in
the best interests of shareholders
and other stakeholders. 
No executive director plays any part 
in the determination of his/her own
remuneration package and the fees 
of the non-executive directors are set by
the executive directors to reflect the time
commitment and levels of responsibility
expected of them.
In remuneration matters, the Committee
has the authority and funding to obtain
independent advice. During the year, 
it received advice from Deloitte & T ouche
LLP and Nabarro Nathanson regarding
the proposed 2004 Unapproved Share
Plan detailed below. Nabarro Nathanson
has also provided the Company with
advice in respect of corporate matters
and its property activities. Additional
information on remuneration issues was
also obtained by the Committee from the
Investment Property Databank (IPD),
being the only property industry-wide
benchmark, from Income Data Services,
various other salary and benefit surveys
and industry comparisons. The Group
also held informal discussions with
comparator companies in the property
and leisure sectors.
Other Directorships 
As at 31 March 2004, the only 
executive directors holding non-Group
related directorships were James Hamilton
Stubber, who is a director of a family
property trading company for which 
he receives no remuneration and Nicholas
Shattock, who was a non-executive
director of Hills Group for which he
earned (and retained) fees at the rate
of £20,000 per annum. 
Related party transactions
There were no related party transactions
with directors in the year. 
Service Contracts
Neither the executive directors’ 
service contracts nor those of any other
members of staff (none of which has 
a notice period in excess of six months)
contain liquidated damages provisions
for compensation for loss of office on
early termination or change of control.
Any contract terminated at short notice,
resulting in a right to compensation,
would not be subject to mitigation.

Remuneration of Directors 
and Senior Staff

Terms of Reference as employees whose
remuneration package, including base
salary, car allowance (if any) and employer
pension contributions, is £100,000 
p.a. or above) and the terms of their
employment are reviewed at least 
annually in relation to best practice and
benchmarked against relevant comparator
industry data, where available. 
The audited base salary and benefits 
of each director is set out on the 
following page.
In considering remuneration levels, 
the Committee makes reference to the
contribution each individual has made 
to the Group and also to its performance
as a whole, measured in terms of net
asset value per share, both in absolute
terms and relative to the property sector
or, in the case of the Wembley bonus
calculation, by reference to the increase
in profitability, as previously described.
The Group provides the following further
benefits for directors and senior staff:
–private medical insurance;
– income protection insurance; and
– life assurance. 30 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Remuneration Report

(2)  The value of benefits includes the provision of a car allowance, private medical insurance, income protection, life assurance (referred to on page 28) 
and travel and subsistence where applicable
(3)  Discretionary bonuses are based on the results of the previous financial year

made in respect of her expenses.
Discretionary Bonus Scheme 
The Group operates a discretionary
bonus scheme which is designed to be
a performance related incentive scheme
to reward executive directors and all staff
and provide motivation and identification
with the success of the Group. 
In relation to head office, for the
Committee to exercise its discretion 
and recommend the payment of a bonus,
the guidelines currently adopted by it are
that the Group must not only outperform
the average of the IPD index but also the
real rate of return year on year , must be in
excess of 10%, calculated by reference
to the increase in shareholders’ funds 
as adjusted for any capital variations 
and the annual dividend. 
Under this scheme executive directors
are entitled to earn up to 100% and
senior staff up to 50% of base salary
in cash. 
Any entitlement above this level would be
received in shares purchased by T rustees
of the Employee Benefit T rust and held for
three years prior to release to the relevant
employee or director . The Committee
also has the discretion to recommend
the payment of an additional bonus to
a director or other member of staff for
exceptional performance over and
above the already high standard required.
Pensions 
Defined contributions are made into
personal pension plans arranged by the
Group. For executive directors and head
office staff, the employer contribution for
the year to 31 March 2004 is at the rate
of 10% of base salary. For staff employed
by Wembley (London) Limited the scheme
inherited by the Company following its
acquisition in 2002 has been continued
under which employer contributions are
made ranging from 4% to 6% of base
salary depending upon seniority and
length of service. 
All executive directors and staff have
access to the advice of an Independent
Financial Advisor in relation to their
pensions, which is offered at the 
Group’ s expense. 31 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Remuneration Report
Executive Directors’ Performance
Share Plan (Audited)
Adopted at the 2003 Annual General
Meeting, the Committee believes the
Plan will assist in securing the long-term
services of key directors, with the award
of share rights being conditional upon 
the achievement of challenging corporate
performance targets and subject to lock-
in arrangements for participants’ current
and future shareholdings, which in the
case of the awards made in 2003 to
Adrian Wyatt and Nicholas Shattock 
will be at least until 2012. The exercise of
share awards under this Plan is subject to
the director continuing to be employed at
vesting and to the Company achieving an
increase in net asset value plus dividends
paid of at least 10% per annum above
the retail price index and to the Company
outperforming the average IPD return
over the same period. This Plan received
shareholder authority for specific
maximum dilution limits of 2.5% of 
the issued share capital, with no single
director being entitled to an award of
more than 1%.
Details of share rights granted under 
the Plan are set out below. No amount 
is payable on the exercise of these rights
and no rights were exercised during
the year.
Share Options (Audited)
During the period the Company
continued to operate the 1996 Executive
Share Option Scheme, approved by the
Inland Revenue on 17 July 1996. On
28 February 2003, following an internal
reorganisation, its unapproved share option
scheme was replaced by the Quintain
Services Limited 2003 Unapproved
Share Option Plan, which is not Inland
Revenue approved .
The Committee has decided that for 
it to exercise its discretion to grant any
share options under either scheme, the
Group’ s performance over the previous
three years must exceed the average of
the rolling IPD index. Whilst no formal
performance conditions have historically
been applied to the exercise of option
awards, it had been intended that
exercise should be subject to the growth
in share price exceeding 7.5% net of
inflation over the three years following
grant of the option. For those options
that have already vested these conditions
have been met. The directors have
confirmed they will not exercise their
options that vest in future if such
performance conditions were not met.
Option awards are subject to a minimum
three year vesting period and on exercise
directors are encouraged to hold shares
for a further period after vesting, subject
to the need to finance the costs of
acquisition and any tax liability.
During the financial year a total of
805,479 options were granted, 122,894
options lapsed and 490,849 options 
were exercised at option prices of between
£1.13 and £1.632. Details of options
granted to, and exercised by, the
executive directors are shown overleaf. 
Non-executive directors do not
participate in any share option schemes.
In its annual review of executive directors
and senior staff remuneration policy and
packages, the Committee considers the
guidelines on executive remuneration
issued by the Association of British
Insurers (ABI) in December 2003
(including the joint statement issued 
by the ABI and the National Association
of Pension Funds (NAPF) on Best
Practice on Executive Contracts and
Capital Severance). In relation to the
grant of options and awards and the
design of share based incentive
schemes, the Committee is committed 
to applying these guidelines, particularly
regarding the setting of suitably
stretching performance criteria and the
recommended dilution limit for all 
Group schemes (including all-employee
schemes) of 10%.

2004 Unapproved Share Plan
As referred to above, the Committee
considers it important for executive
directors and employees to participate 
in the Group’ s success through having 
an interest in the shares of the Company.
In the past, this has been achieved mainly
through the medium of share options,
under the 1996 Approved Executive
Share Option Scheme (an Inland
Revenue approved scheme) and the
1996 Executive Share Option (No. 2)
Scheme (an unapproved scheme). The
latter was replicated in February 2003
by the Quintain Services Limited 2003
Unapproved Share Option Plan,
reflecting the internal reorganisation
which took place at that time. The
Company also established the Share
Incentive Plan (in 2002), a scheme under
which employees may acquire a limited
equity interest in the Group in a tax-
efficient way through the direct
acquisition of shares.
With recent changes in tax legislation 
and accounting treatment for employee
share incentives, the Committee, having
taken advice from specialist independent
professionals, has decided that share
options (with an exercise price equal to
the market value of the relevant shares
on the date of grant) are no longer 
the best mechanism for providing 
equity incentives, except where there 
are specific tax advantages (as in the
case of Inland Revenue approved
schemes). T o use shares more efficiently,
and to minimise the dilution of members’
shareholdings, it is better to make
conditional awards over fewer shares
(under which the participants pay
nothing, or at most nominal value, 
for the shares received). It was therefore
proposed late in 2003 to establish a 
new share incentive scheme, the 2004
Unapproved Share Plan (the Plan), to
supersede the Quintain Services Limited
2003 Unapproved Share Option Plan
(which itself superseded the 1996
Executive Share Option (No. 2) Scheme,
as described above).
Although it was important to establish 
the Plan expeditiously, it was thought
inappropriate to trouble shareholders at
that stage with a shareholder resolution
to approve the Plan, necessitating 
an Extraordinary General Meeting.
Accordingly, the Plan was adopted 
on 26 January 2004, but in such a 
way that directors of the Company 
are currently unable to participate and
awards may be satisfied only by the use
of existing shares purchased from the
market, enabling the Plan to be adopted
without obtaining prior shareholder
approval. However, it was always the
Company’ s intention to obtain the
approval of its shareholders to an
extension of the Plan at the next available
opportunity. Accordingly, at this year’ s
Annual General Meeting, the board seeks
the approval of the shareholders to the
adoption of the Plan in a form which
would allow the participation of directors
and also for awards to be satisfied from
new issue shares or treasury shares.
A copy of the draft rules of the Plan will
be available for inspection from the date
of dispatch of this circular at the offices 
of Nabarro Nathanson, Lacon House, 
84 Theobald’ s Road, London WC1X
8RW, on the Company’ s website at
www.quintain-estates.com and also for
at least 15 minutes prior to and during
the Annual General Meeting. 
If the Plan is approved, the Committee
may decide to use it to replace certain
awards under the 1996 Executive Share
Option (No. 2) Scheme or the Quintain
Services Limited 2003 Unapproved
Share Option Plan (under neither of
which is it intended to grant further
options). It has been used in this way
already in relation to a limited category 
of participant (which excludes directors
of the Company), who in April 2004
exchanged their options granted in June
2003 under the Quintain Services Limited
2003 Unapproved Share Option Plan for
rights granted under the Plan. 
Rights under the Plan will only be 
granted if the Company has outperformed
the average of the IPD Index in the three
years prior to grant and the vesting 
of rights granted under the Plan will 
be subject to further stretching
performance criteria.
The level of award will be made by
reference to the market value of the
relevant award at the date of grant 
using Black Scholes methodology 
and calculated along similar lines 
to the Quintain Services Limited 2003
Unapproved Share Option Plan which 
it replaces.
Your directors believe these proposals to
be in the best interests of the shareholders
as a whole, and unanimously recommend
that the members vote with them in
favour of the resolution.
The principal terms of the Plan may 
be summarised as follows:
Constitution
The Plan is constituted by rules 
approved by the Committee and
adopted by the directors.
Eligibility
Any employee or director of the Group
who is required to devote substantially
the whole of his or her working time to
their duties for the Group will be eligible
to participate in the Plan. However, the
Committee will, in its absolute discretion,
select who will participate.
Making and constitution of awards
The Committee will grant a right to
acquire shares in the Company through
the Plan. A right will be evidenced by 
a certificate executed as a deed by the
Company and will consist of a conditional
right to acquire a specified number 
of ordinary shares subject to corporate
performance targets and continued
employment and to payment of the
nominal value of the relevant shares.
When a right is exercised (see below), 
the appropriate number of shares (or
treasury shares) in respect of which the
right is exercised are either transferred 
or issued and allotted to the participant.
No consideration is payable for the 
grant of a right. 
No right shall be granted unless the
Company’ s performance over the period
comprising the immediately preceding
three financial years of the Company
shall have exceeded the IPD Index over
that period.
Rights will be personal to the participant
and may not be transferred or assigned. 
Timing
In absence of exceptional
circumstances, rights may only be
granted within 42 days immediately
following: 34 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Remuneration Report
– the adoption of the Plan; or 
–the announcement of the Company’ s
interim or final financial results for 
any period. 
Rights may not be granted more than 
ten years after the date of adoption 
of the Plan.
Vesting of rights and 
performance criteria
Rights granted under the Plan will only be
exercisable if the performance conditions
are satisfied. The Committee will determine
the performance conditions appropriate
to the rights at the date of grant and
these will be specified in each right
certificate.
A right will not be exercisable unless the
specified performance conditions have
been achieved and the participant is still
an employee of the Company at the end
of the relevant performance period.
The initial awards under the Plan will be
subject to a performance measure based
on the Company’ s real growth in net
asset value (NAV) over periods of three,
four and five years from the date of grant,
with such awards only vesting when
performance conditions have been met.
The right will become exercisable at the
end of the relevant vesting period if the
Company’ s NAV growth matches (or
exceeds) the increase in the retail prices
index (RPI) over the corresponding
period by an average of 10% per annum
(compounded annually). T o the extent
that the NAV targets are not met at the
end of the relevant vesting period, the
right will lapse. These are similar criteria
to those used in the Company’ s bonus
scheme and the Executive Directors’
Performance Share Plan.
The Committee will determine the
performance conditions to apply to
subsequent grants of rights made under
the Plan as are appropriate at the date
such rights are granted, but it is intended
that such conditions would be similar in
terms of difficulty of achievement and
length of performance period as the 
initial awards referred to above.
Diversification of rights
At any time following the third 
anniversary of the date of grant of 
a right and following achievement of the
performance conditions, the Committee
may, at its absolute discretion, allow 
a participant to exchange a proportion 
of his right for a diversified right, the value
of which is determined by reference to 
a fund selected by the participant (but
subject to a right of veto by the Committee
if it considers the selected fund to be
inappropriate). The rationale for this 
is to allow participants to spread their
investments, e.g. into their pension fund.
Cessation of employment
If the participant ceases to be a director
or employee of the Group through injury,
disability, ill health, redundancy, or
through the company that employs him
ceasing to be a member or the Group
then, provided that any performance
conditions have been satisfied, he may
exercise his rights within six months
following such cessation. If the
participant retires on or after normal
retirement age he may exercise his 
rights, subject to the satisfaction of any
performance conditions, at any time
before the expiry of two years following
departure. If the participant ceases to 
be a director or employee for any other
reason then he may exercise his rights, 
to the extent they were validly exercisable,
up to three months after the date of
departure. After this time they will lapse
unless the Committee, in exceptional
circumstances, exercises its discretion
during such period of three months to
permit the participant to exercise the
rights, in which event the rights will
become exercisable (if not already) from
the date of such determination and will
remain exercisable until six months after
such cessation. Any rights not exercised
during the above mentioned periods 
shall lapse at the end of the said periods. 
Change of control
If any person or company obtains 
control of the Company as a result of a
general offer for the whole of the issued
share capital of the Company or pursuant 
to a compromise or arrangement
sanctioned by the Court, rights may 
be exercised, broadly speaking, within six
months of the person obtaining control 
of the Company or the Court sanctioning
the compromise or arrangement (subject
to the relevant performance condition
having been satisfied over the period
between the grant of the right and the
change of control). Any rights not 
so exercised will lapse at the end 
of that period.
Plan limits
No right may be granted to an employee
or director to the extent that the market
value of the shares in respect of which
the right relates, when added to the
market value of shares the subject of
rights previously granted to the employee
or director in the same financial year
which have neither lapsed nor been
exercised or released, would exceed the
annual basic salary of the employee or
director on the date the right is proposed
to be granted.
No right may be granted under the 
Plan which would result in the aggregate
number of shares which have been
issued or remain issuable, or which are
treasury shares transferred or transferable,
in each case in respect of rights granted
in the previous ten years under the Plan,
exceeding 5% of the shares in issue 
at the date of grant.
Pensions
Awards made under the Plan will neither
form part of base salary nor be eligible 
for pension contributions.
Variations of capital
The rights of a participant following 
any rights issue or capitalisation issue 
or certain other variations of capital
will be adjusted in such manner as
the Company’ s auditors consider fair 
and reasonable.
Amendments
The Committee may make any
amendments to the rules of the Plan,
provided that amendments to the
advantage of participants may only 
be made with the sanction of the
Company in general meeting (except 
that shareholder approval is not required
for minor amendments to obtain or
maintain favourable tax, exchange control
or regulatory treatment for participants
(or future participants) or any company 
in the Group).
Termination
The Plan will terminate on the tenth
anniversary of the date of its adoption 
or on any such earlier date as the
Committee may at any time prior to that
date determine, but the rights of existing
participants will not be affected thereby.
In the event of such termination, no further
rights will be granted under the Plan. 35 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Remuneration Report
Personal shareholding 
requirements for executive directors
The Committee wishes strongly to
encourage the building up by executive
directors of a meaningful shareholding 
in the Company (in accordance with ABI
guidelines). It is considered that executive
directors should retain shares in the 
Company with a market value equal
By Order of the Board
David Pangbourne 
Chairman of Remuneration Committee
18 June 2004
to no less than their annual base salary
(although this only need be built up over 
a period of five years). The Committee 
will consider satisfaction of this guideline
(or satisfactory progress towards it) as 
a material factor in determining whether
to grant awards under share incentive
schemes to executive directors and 
the extent of such awards.

Audit Committee Report
The board recognises that it is
ultimately responsible for the system 
of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. In carrying out its duties
it delegates detailed responsibility for
internal control to the Audit Committee. 
Introduction
The Audit Committee submits its report
for the year ended 31 March 2004, which
sets out the Group’ s audit policy and the
role of the Committee in monitoring the
financial systems and the management
of external and internal auditors which
are carried out in accordance with
current legislation and best practice.
This year the directors will be seeking
approval of the Group’ s Audit Report
from its shareholders at its Annual
General Meeting.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises all
the non-executive directors, and since
October 2002 has been chaired by
David Pangbourne, who is a former
partner with Deloitte & T ouche LLP and a
qualified Chartered Accountant. During
the year, the Committee met six times
with full attendance on each occasion
with the exception of Joan MacNaughton
being unable to attend the first meeting
following her appointment due to
previous commitments.
The Finance Director, the Chief Financial
Officer and others attend by invitation.
The Committee met with the external
auditors twice during the year without
management being present. It met the
valuers of the Group’ s principal properties
prior to the release of the preliminary 
results, and will, in future also meet 
with them before the publication of 
its interim results. 
In addition the Committee has access to
funding for any further independent legal,
accounting or other advice it believes to
be necessary for the effective execution
of its duties.
The duties of the Audit Committee are
set out in its T erms of Reference, which
were reviewed and approved during the
period and include: 
– monitoring the integrity of the 
financial statements and any financial
announcements and significant
reporting judgments therein; 
– considering and making
recommendations to the board
regarding the appointment or removal
of the internal and external auditors; 
–reviewing internal financial controls; 
–monitoring and reviewing the
effectiveness of the internal audit
function; 
–reviewing the nature and scope of 
the external audit and monitoring the
external auditor’ s independence and
effectiveness; 
– forming policy on the supply of non-
audit services by the external auditors; 
– considering reports of the internal and
external auditors in the light of current
corporate governance practice; and
–reviewing arrangements for staff to
raise financial concerns in confidence.
The T erms of Reference, which will be
reviewed at least annually, may be found
on the Company’ s website or are available
on request from its registered office.
The Committee confirms that there has
been an ongoing process in place for the
identification, evaluation and management
of risk during the period to the date of 
the publication of this report, and the
Committee is not aware of any previously
unidentified risks. Additionally the board
has reviewed the scope, authority and
resources of the Committee during 
the year.
Internal
The board recognises that it is ultimately
responsible for the system of internal
control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
In carrying out its duties it delegates
detailed responsibility for internal control
to the Audit Committee. Management
prepares financial statements and
disclosures in accordance with
applicable rules and regulations which
the Committee reviews for clarity,
completeness, accuracy and context
and, if dissatisfied, reports back to 
the board.  37 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Audit Committee Report
The Group is committed to the highest
standards of business conduct and
seeks to maintain these standards
across all of its operations. The Group
has what it believes to be an appropriate
organisational structure for planning,
executing, controlling and monitoring
business operations in order to achieve
its objectives. 
The Group has procedures designed
to ensure complete and accurate
accounting, and to limit the potential
exposure to loss of assets or fraud.
Control measures undertaken include
physical controls, segregation of duties,
reviews by management, and internal
and external audit. 
In accordance with the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance, the
effectiveness of the Group’ s system of
internal controls was reviewed during the
period, both by the Committee and by
the board. This review included financial,
operational and compliance issues. 
The board considers its policy 
and procedures to be robust whilst
recognising that such a system is
designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives and can provide only
reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.
Monitoring is achieved through
assessment by internal auditors at 
the direction of the Committee and the
presentation to the board of findings
together with recommendations of any
appropriate corrective actions to be
taken. The Group retained one financial
and one non-financial internal auditor
during the year, both of whom regularly
met with the Committee Chairman and
met or reported to the Committee itself
at least twice a year. The scope of their
work was reviewed during the period 
and agreed with the Committee
Chairman and Finance Director.
The Group has in place a whistle blowing
policy under which members of staff with
concerns may raise these in confidence
under procedures contained in the 
staff handbook.
External control
The Group’ s external auditor was first
appointed in April 1992. In July 1996, 
the audit was transferred to a corporate
body, KPMG Audit Plc (the auditor).
The Committee makes
recommendations on the appointment
of and approves the remuneration of the
external auditor, with particular regard 
to the setting of appropriate parameters
of the audit. It also ensures the auditor’ s
overall work plan is consistent with the
terms of engagement and reviews the
audit representation letters prior to
signature by management.
The Committee meets the external
auditors periodically to ensure a direct
line of communication and to review
their independence.
The Committee reviews significant
financial reporting issues and judgements
made in connection with the preparation
of preliminary, interim and other price
sensitive public reports. The Chairman
and the Committee discuss any major
accounting or other audit issues that
arise with the external audit team. 
At the end of the audit cycle the external
auditor’ s report is reviewed by the
Committee, which reports the auditor’ s
findings and makes recommendations 
to the board. The Committee also
reviews the effectiveness of the audit
process itself, including: 
–whether the auditors have met
the management plan; 
– the robustness and perceptiveness
of the auditors in handling key
accounting/audit judgements 
and systems of internal control; 
– obtaining feedback from key
personnel; and 
–the content of the management letter.
During the year the Committee
reviewed its procedures to ensure 
the independence and objectivity of the
auditors. The auditor has its own internal
procedures in place to ensure that none
of the audit team has a personal or
financial interest in the Company which
might impair their judgement or objectivity .
Furthermore, it is the auditor’ s policy that
the lead audit partner be rotated at least
every five years, in line with which the
audit partner in charge of the audit 
team was replaced in April 2003.
The Committee also reviewed the
Group’ s policy regarding provision
of non-audit services by the auditors,
and introduced additional safeguards,
including a requirement that any
commitment to fees of £20,000 or 
more to the auditors for non-audit
services must be given prior permission
from either the Committee or the board.
During the period the main areas of non-
audit work undertaken by the auditors
were principally tax advice and due
diligence work relating to acquisitions,
which did not compromise its objectivity.
The total value of the auditor’ s non-audit
fees for the year was £762,000 and a
breakdown of these can be found in
note 4(b) on page 56. Following a tender
process Deloitte & T ouche LLP was
appointed to provide taxation advice
from 1 April 2004, replacing the auditor.

Reports from the Principal External 
Valuers to the directors of Quintain
Estates and Development PLC
In accordance with your instructions we
have valued the freehold and leasehold
investment properties, as set out in the
attached schedule as at 31 March 2004
for annual account purposes. 
Our valuations have been made in
accordance with the Practice Statements
in the RICS Appraisal and Valuation
Standards (5th Edition), on the basis of
market value, the full definition of which
accompanies the “General Principles”
attached hereto, to which we draw
your attention.
We have inspected the top 30 properties
by value, a third of the remainder and all
properties acquired over the last twelve
months. For each property we have
made relevant local enquiries and obtained
such other information as we considered
necessary to provide you with our
opinions of value. 
No allowance has been made in our
valuations for expenses of realisation or
for any taxation which might arise in the
event of a disposal and our valuations 
are expressed as exclusive of any Value
Added T ax that may become chargeable.
Our valuations assume that there 
is good and marketable title to the
properties and that they are free of 
any undisclosed burdens, outgoings,
restrictions or charges. We have not 
read all documents of title nor leases 
and, for the purpose of our valuations,
have accepted the details of tenure,
tenancies and all other relevant information
with which we have been supplied by
your Company or other professional
advisers. We have not seen or read the
planning consents and have assumed
that the buildings have been erected 
and are being occupied and used in
accordance with all requisite consents
and that there are no outstanding
statutory notices. 
We were not instructed to carry out
structural surveys of the properties, 
nor to test any of the services, but 
have reflected in our valuations, where
necessary, any defects, items of disrepair
or the benefit of any improvements 
which we noticed during the course 
of our inspections, or of which you have
subsequently advised us. Our valuations
assume that the buildings contain no
deleterious materials, and that the sites
are unaffected by adverse soil conditions
or environmental contamination, except
where we have been notified to the
contrary. Should it, however, be
established subsequently that
contamination exists at any property 
or on any neighbouring land or that the
premises have been or are being put to 
a contaminative use, this might reduce
the values now reported.
Unless expressly advised to the 
contrary we assume that appropriate
insurance cover is and will be available 
on commercially acceptable terms
relating to composite panels, terrorism
and flooding. Accordingly, our opinions 
of value make no allowance for the risk
that insurance cover for any property
may not be available, or may only be
available on onerous terms, or for any
adverse market reaction to the presence
of composite panels.
From 10 April 2003 Stamp Duty 
relief at 100% was introduced in
Disadvantaged Areas on all non-residential
property transactions. This measure has
only been given approval until 2006,
following a review of EU State Aid rules,
or earlier, should the Government seek 
to amend Stamp Duty in the interim. 
The classification of Disadvantaged
Areas is based on a deprivation index,
translated to electoral wards. It would
appear that investors are prepared to
increase their bids in circumstances
where there is competition from other
purchasers. The extent to which this
occurs is likely to depend upon the
quality of the property and the strength 
of investor demand. We have reflected
this change in Stamp Duty in our
valuations by making the necessary
adjustments. Those properties which we
understand are in Disadvantaged Areas
are indicated on the attached schedule.
We have not made any allowance for
properties that are jointly owned and have
therefore reflected the full open market
value of these properties in our certificate.
Adjustments should be made elsewhere
in your accounts for any partial interests.
Our valuation of the property at the
Parishes Shopping Centre, Scunthorpe
does not take into account the cost of
incentives that are likely to be required 
by tenants in order to secure lettings. 
Our valuation is therefore gross of these
costs. We understand that an estimate 
of these costs is reflected elsewhere 
in Quintain’ s Estates and Development
PLC  company accounts. 
Having regard to the foregoing, we 
are of the opinion that the aggregate 
of the market values of the freehold and
leasehold properties, as at 31 March
2004, subject to and with the benefit 
of the tenancies then subsisting (where
applicable), was:
£552,295,750
(FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION TWO
HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN
HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS)
Categorised as follows:
Freehold and Feuhold £370,720,000
Long leasehold £159,550,000
Short leasehold £16,875,750
Part Freehold and Part Leasehold
£5,150,000

We confirm that we have inspected the
above properties and made all relevant
enquiries in order to provide you with our
opinion of Market Value as at 31 March
2004 of the various property interests
which Quintain Estates and Development
PLC hold at the Greenwich Peninsula,
London SE10 and at The Wembley
Complex & the Palace of Industry,
London HA9.
We confirm that our valuations have 
been carried out in accordance with the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
Appraisal and Valuation Standards and
that we have carried out the valuation 
as External Valuers, qualified for the
purpose of the valuation in accordance
with the Standards. Our valuations have
been made on the basis of the definition, 
terms of reference, information sources,
assumptions and conditions as noted 
in our formal Valuation Certificate dated
18 May 2004.
Having carefully considered this 
matter, we have reported our opinion 
of Market Value as at 31 March 2004 
of the Freehold and other interests held,
subject to and with the benefit of the
existing leases and otherwise with
vacant possession, at an aggregate 
of £216,400,000 (T wo Hundred 
and Sixteen Million Four Hundred
Thousand Pounds).
Our Valuation Certificate comments 
on the high degree of subjectivity in this
instance for both properties and various
other property specific matters.
This letter is a shortform confirmation 
of our valuation for inclusion in the
Company’ s Report and Accounts. 
No reliance should be placed upon it
without simultaneous reference to our
formal Valuation Certificate, copies of
which have been provided to you and
which are available for inspection at 
your offices by interested parties.

From FPDSavills Commercial Limited 48 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004 Independent Auditors’ Report
Independent auditors’ report to the
members of Quintain Estates and
Development PLC
We have audited the financial 
statements on pages 49 to 71. We 
have also audited the information in 
the directors’ remuneration report that 
is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the
Company’ s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might
state to the Company’ s members those
matters we are required to state to them
in an auditor’ s report and for no other
purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’ s members 
as a body , for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities 
of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for
preparing the Annual Report and 
the directors’ remuneration report. 
As described on page 27, this includes
responsibility for preparing the financial
statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and accounting
standards. Our responsibilities, as
independent auditors, are established 
in the United Kingdom by statute, the
Auditing Practices board, the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority,
and by our profession’ s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the financial statements give 
a true and fair view and whether the
financial statements and the part of 
the directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985. We also report to you if, in 
our opinion, the directors’ report is not
consistent with the financial statements,
if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and transactions
with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement 
on pages 24 to 27 reflect the Company’ s
compliance with the seven provisions
of the Combined Code specified for
our review by the Listing Rules, and we
report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the board’ s statements
on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’ s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read the other information 
contained in the Annual Report, 
including the corporate governance
statement and the unaudited part of 
the directors’ remuneration report, 
and consider whether it is consistent 
with the audited financial statements. 
We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial
statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance
with Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements
and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in
the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Group’ s
circumstances, consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit 
so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements
and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error. In forming 
our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements 
and the part of the directors’ remuneration
report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the financial statements give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company and the Group as at
31 March 2004 and of the profit of the
Group for the year then ended; and 
–the financial statements and the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

of Power Securities (Manchester) Limited, now called Quintain (Manchester) Limited, a company which owns a single property and which did not
make a significant contribution to the Group’ s results for the financial year. A summary of the assets acquired together with the fair value
adjustments and the consideration for the transaction is shown in note 11c.
A restatement of the 2003 comparatives in relation to the Proceeds from share issue and Purchase of own shares has been made to clarify 
the nature of the transactions which occurred in that year. This had no impact on the subtotal for Net cash inflow from financing. 53 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004
For the year ended 31 March 2004
Notes to the accounts
1. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies, which have
been applied consistently throughout the year
and the preceding year, are as follows:
a) Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared under the
historical cost convention as modified by the
revaluation of investment properties and in
accordance with all applicable accounting
standards and the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985, except as explained below.
b) Basis of consolidation
The group accounts consolidate the accounts of
the Company and all its subsidiaries and include
the Group’ s share of the results of its joint ventures
and associates. No profit and loss account is
presented for the Company, as permitted by
section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. The
results of newly acquired entities are included in
the consolidated accounts from the effective date
of acquisition. 
c) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation is capitalised
and amortised through the profit and loss
account over a period of 20 years or less in line
with the directors’ view of its useful economic life. 
Negative goodwill, which arises as a result of the
fair value of all assets (including property assets)
less liabilities acquired exceeding the related
purchase consideration, is credited to other
capital reserves in the balance sheet. This
represents a departure from FRS 10, Goodwill
and Intangible Assets, which requires that
negative goodwill be treated as a fixed asset.
Given that the negative goodwill relates principally
to the investment properties acquired, which are
neither depreciated nor held for re-sale, the
directors consider that to retain it as a negative
asset on the face of the balance sheet indefinitely
would not properly reflect the substance of such 
a transaction nor result in the financial statements
giving a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Group. The treatment is not inconsistent with
the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. 
d) Foreign currencies
All assets, liabilities and results denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling 
at rates of exchange ruling at the year end. The
rates ruling at the current and previous year ends
were as follows:
2004 2003
France £1 = €1.50 €1.45
United States £1 = US $ 1.83 US $ 1.58
Differences arising from the translation of the net
equity investment in overseas subsidiaries are
dealt with through reserves.
e) Turnover 
Turnover is stated net of VAT and comprises
rental income, proceeds from sales of trading
properties, income from leisure operations, and
commission and fees receivable. Rent increases
arising from rent reviews due during the year are
taken into account only to the extent that such
reviews are agreed with tenants at the accounting
date. When rent free periods are granted with
new leases, rental income is allocated evenly over
the period from the commencement of the lease
to the date of the first rent review. Where a tenant
inducement does not enhance the value of the
property, it is amortised over the period to the
earlier of the first rent review, the first tenant 
break option or the end of the lease term.
f) Disposal of properties
Sales of properties are recognised in the
accounts if an unconditional contract is
exchanged by the balance sheet date and 
the sale is completed before the accounts
are approved by the board. Profits or losses
arising from the sale of investment properties are
calculated by reference to book value and treated
as non-operating items. Those arising from the
sale of trading properties are included in the profit
and loss account as part of the operating profit of
the Group with, if applicable, a transfer between
revaluation and revenue reserves.
g) Depreciation
In accordance with SSAP 19, Accounting 
for Investment Properties, no depreciation 
is provided in respect of the Group’ s freehold
investment properties and leasehold investment
properties with over 20 years to run. This
represents a departure from the provisions of the
Companies Act 1985 which requires all properties
to be depreciated. Such properties are held not
for consumption but for investment and the
directors consider that to depreciate them would
not give a true and fair view. Depreciation is only
one of the many factors reflected in the annual
valuation of properties and accordingly the
amount of depreciation which might otherwise
have been charged cannot be separately
identified or quantified. Depreciation is provided
on leasehold investment properties with less
than 20 years to run, over the remaining life
of the lease and on an operational property
included within freehold investment properties,
over a period of 50 years. In relation to other fixed
assets, depreciation is provided on a straight 
line basis over the life of the lease for the short
leasehold property interest and over their
estimated useful life, usually between three 
and eight years, in the case of fixtures, fittings 
and equipment.
h) Valuation of properties
Investment properties are independently valued
annually by external professional valuers on an
open market basis. Investment properties under
development are stated at estimated market
value on completion, supported by independent
valuation, less estimated costs to complete. 
Any surplus or deficit on revaluation is transferred
to the revaluation reserve except that deficits
below original cost which are expected to 
be permanent are charged to the profit and 
loss account.
Finance charges incurred on investment
properties under development are capitalised
within the historical cost until practical completion.
Trading properties are included in current 
assets at the lower of cost and net realisable
value except for properties previously held for
investment which the directors have decided 
to redevelop and sell. These properties are
reclassified as trading properties and cost is
considered to be the latest valuation prior to their
reclassification. This treatment is a departure from
the Companies Act 1985 which would normally
require current assets to be carried at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value. The directors
consider that compliance with this requirement
would fail to give a true and fair view of historical
revaluation surpluses, which remain unrealised 
by the Group until disposal. 
In the current financial year, a property with a
revaluation surplus of £960,000 was transferred
from investment properties to trading properties.
At the balance sheet date, this was the only such
property held within current assets.
i) Other fixed assets
Other fixed assets comprising the Group’ s
leasehold interest in its head office premises
together with fixtures, fittings and equipment 
are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
j) Investments in joint ventures and associates
In accordance with FRS 9, Associates and Joint
Ventures, joint ventures are included under the
gross equity method. As a result, the Group’ s
balance sheet discloses its share of the gross
assets and gross liabilities of the joint ventures.
Associates are shown at the Group’ s share 
of their net assets. In both cases, the Group’ s
share of operating profit, net interest payable 
and taxation are included in the Group’ s profit 
and loss account.
k) Other fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less
any provision for permanent impairment in value.
l) Financial instruments
The Group uses interest rate swaps for hedging
purposes in line with its risk management policies
to alter the risk profile of existing underlying
exposure in respect of floating rate debt. Amounts
payable and receivable in respect of interest rate
swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest
expense over the period of the contracts. 
m) Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised, without
discounting, in respect of all timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for
taxation and accounting purposes which have
arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet
date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19,
Deferred T axation. Deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that they are 
considered recoverable.
n) Pensions
The Group makes pre-defined contributions 
to employees’ personal pension plans. 54 Quintain Estates and Development PLC Annual Report 2004

The Group is subject to interest rate, liquidity and foreign currency risks. The Group does not speculate in treasury products but uses these only to
limit potential interest rate fluctuations. It usually borrows at floating rates of interest based on LIBOR and uses hedging mechanisms to achieve an
interest rate profile where the majority of borrowings are fixed or capped. As at 31 March 2004, 75.8% (2003: 100%) of the Group’ s net debt was
fixed or protected and the weighted average rate of debt was 6.1% (2003: 6.2%). 
The Group’ s policy is to finance its activities with equity and long term debt with a gearing target of 100%. The weighted average tenure of the
Group’ s Sterling debt is 5 years (2003: 6 years).
The Group borrows in the same currency as the assets being financed to minimise foreign currency risk. No currency derivatives are used.
The maturity profile of the Group’ s debt was as follows:

PLANNING TERMINOLOGY
Resolution to Grant The decision of a local authority planning committee to grant planning permission, which is usually conditional upon the
application being referred to, and then endorsed, by a higher authority (for example, in the case of London, the Mayor
and the Government Office for London) and the completion of a Section 106 Agreement (see below) 
Section 106 Agreement A Section 106 agreement (derived from the relevant section of the T own and County Planning Act 1990) is typically
an agreement between a local planning authority and a developer negotiated in the context of granting a planning
permission. It provides a means of ensuring that developers contribute towards the infrastructure and services that
the local authority believes to be necessary to facilitate the proposed development. Contributions may either be in cash
or in kind. A Section 106 Agreement can also be used to deliver affordable housing
Affordable Housing This is housing made available to occupants at less than market price, either to buy or rent. It is generally provided
through housing associations and can be subsidised by public grant, reduced development price to housing
associations (as under S.106 agreement), or both. It comprises two forms:
– Social rented housing – at low rents for households on the lowest incomes; and 
– Intermediate housing – shared ownership or other equity participation arrangements together with higher rented 
accommodation. This form of affordable housing is targetted at households which are generally working, but have 
lower average incomes and in some cases will include key workers

p4 Providing high quality services across all of our operations  
is one of our key objectives for the business. For us, quality 
means meeting the needs of our passengers. This covers all 
aspects of the customer experience from safety, comfort,  
and value for money to frequency and reliability. 
Delive Rin G qu Ali Ty
At Go-Ahead we are committed to 
listening to our passengers, acting on 
their feedback, and continually improving 
our services to meet and exceed their 
rising expectations.
Our unique devolved structure  
enables our local management teams 
to respond to the specific needs of the 
passengers they serve. We believe the 
key to providing good quality services 
is to get the basics right, from the 
simple things like ensuring our trains 
and buses are clean and our employees 
are well presented, to providing up to 
date timetable information. We take 
continuous improvement very seriously. 
We ensure our staff receive the training 
they need to meet the expectations of 
our passengers. Alongside this, we ensure 
that health and safety is the number one 
priority for every employee to ensure 
that both they and our passengers are 
safe. In an industry first we recently 
commissioned Passenger Focus to 
conduct a passenger survey across  
our deregulated bus operations and 
found that 91%
1
 of bus passengers  
were satisfied with Go-Ahead’s services. 
Our rail passengers are also satisfied  
with our services. Customer satisfaction 
rates are currently over 82%

. 
Southeastern saw its highest ever score  
in the latest results.

All of our companies strive to stay at the 
forefront of customer service and new 
initiatives are continually being launched 
across our operations.
One such rail initiative is the award 
winning “Railway for All” programme from 
Southern which goes well beyond the 
statutory requirements of the Disability 
Discrimination Act to ensure all our 
passengers have a service they can use  
and enjoy. The programme includes a 
range of measures, but also tackles the 
simple things that make a difference such 
as priority seating. A “priority seat card” is 
issued which entitles the holder to a seat 
on the train avoiding the embarrassment  
of having to ask a fellow passenger to give 
up the seat or identify why it is needed. 
Our bus operations are also adopting 
initiatives. Go n orth east is stepping 
up to exceed passenger expectations 
through the recent launch of the 
“Commuter Club” service, designed to 
bring people into the heart of n ewcastle 
quickly, directly and in comfort on 
luxury coaches. The service offers 
commuters the opportunity to work 
or relax on their journey into the city, 
providing newspapers and Wi-Fi access 
to passengers. it offers great value for 
money, compared with the alternative 
of the private car and provides a more 
relaxing commuter experience.

A Southern employee said; 
“I love to come  
to work; it’s a nice 
place; people are 
approachable.  
I am proud to work 
for Southern.”
Mr Farrow, who uses Go South Coast’s Wilts & Dorset 
services said; 
“The buses are always clean and 
well presented, and the drivers 
invariably cheerful and helpful;  
a fantastic service. ” Our unique devolved structure enables our local management 
teams to focus on the specific needs of the passengers they 
serve. We realise that while many of the markets in which  
we operate have common features, each have their own 
unique characteristics. 
Delive Rin G FOCu S
Go-Ahead’s core strategy is to deliver 
bus and rail services in predominantly 
urban areas where there is a strong 
underlying demand for public transport. 
This strategy has enabled us to withstand 
the economic challenges the u K has 
faced as these markets are the most 
resilient and continue to grow. 
in a tougher economic environment, 
we have to work harder to grow the 
business and keep our passengers happy. 
Alongside the frequent and reliable 
services that we provide, passengers 
want us to be innovative and make travel 
as hassle-free as possible. That is why 
last year we launched The Key, our new 
smartcard, which makes travelling on our 
services simple and cost effective. The 
aim is for this card to be used across our 
operations saving time when switching 
services or boarding the bus and saving 
money through multi-journey tickets 
available. We believe this will improve the 
travel experience for both bus and rail 
passengers and will provide information 
to help us better understand their needs. 
Many passengers use more than one 
mode of transport to complete their 
journey with vast numbers using both 
bus and rail. in order to make these 
multi-stage journeys as easy and as cost 
effective as possible we encourage our 
businesses to participate in Plu SBu S, a 
scheme which enables multi-modal travel 
across hundreds of services in the u K. 
The scheme offers flexibility as well as 
time and cost savings. 
in a pioneering scheme, the Oxford  
Bus Company has formed a partnership 
with Stagecoach and Oxfordshire County 
Council using new powers under the 
2008 l ocal T ransport Act. The scheme, 
part of the county’s “Transform Oxford” 
initiative is the first of its kind, with 
integrated smartcard ticketing and 
coordinated timetabling, making bus travel 
in the Oxford area much simpler. We 
will be exploring the merit of other such 
schemes across the country where  
there is passenger demand and they  
are economically viable.
We recognise the need to communicate 
to our passengers on products and offers 
that are both timely and relevant. As such 
we have invested heavily in developing a 
single customer view marketing database 
that includes both bus and rail passenger 
details. This ensures that passengers who 
live in areas where we provide both bus 
and rail services such as l ondon, Brighton 
and Southampton receive offers that help 
end-to-end journey planning. in addition, 
by clearly analysing previous transactions 
we are able to identify the most relevant 
products to promote to our passengers 
to drive both loyalty and revenue. Our 
database currently holds information  
for 1.6 million passengers.

The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 4 A Go n orth east user said; 
“My family and I have been 
visiting the North East for 
several years and I wouldn’t 
consider using the car as the 
bus is so efficient. I’d like to 
express my appreciation for the 
frequent and reliable service 
provided and to the drivers 
who are courteous and helpful. 
I was also very impressed by 
the branding on the buses in 
the area, providing an easily 
identifiable service and giving a 
splash of colour to the city”.

www.go-ahead.com 5 We run our business with strong financial discipline to  
deliver value to our shareholders. We are continually  
assessing growth opportunities in line with our strategy  
and maintaining the dividend remains a core priority for  
the Group.
Delive Rin G v A lue
The views of our shareholders are 
important to us. We take the time and 
effort to ensure we understand what  
they expect from our business and 
to meet their expectations on their 
investment. Our aim is to deliver a 
combination of good earnings growth, 
strong cash generation and effective 
balance sheet management. 
Our Board of Directors acknowledges 
the importance of the strong dividend  
to our shareholders and is committed  
to maintaining this despite the continuing 
difficult economic conditions. Due to our 
increasing earnings, dividend cover has 
increased to 1.67x further enhancing the 
security of the dividend payout. 
We remain committed to growing the 
business organically and through bolt-on 
acquisitions. in May 2011 we acquired the 
high quality bus operator, Thames Travel, 
based in Oxfordshire. This is a great 
addition to the Go-Ahead family. We  
are continually assessing opportunities  
for growth in line with our strategy. 
improvements in the rail franchise model 
and the wider rail industry will add value 
to the Group. We are actively working 
with the Government and other key 
parties to deliver change in the industry.  
Go-Ahead submitted its bid for the 
Greater Anglia Rail Franchise in July 2011 
on a stand-alone basis. Should the bid  
be successful, the franchise would be  
a welcome addition to Go-Ahead’s 
division of busy commuter operations. 
The Department for Transport is 
expected to announce the successful 
bidder in the autumn of 2011.

A new employee of Konectbus said;
“I cannot believe 
how professionally 
Konectbus operates. 
We have first-class 
back-up from the 
depot during the 
working day.” Corporate responsibility is at the heart of our 
business. Adopting a responsible approach to  
our operations directly contributes to our success. 
Delivering safe, reliable and cost-effective services 
helps us to grow passenger numbers. 
 S UST AINABLE
Delive Rin G Su STAin ABili Ty
Corporate responsibility is integral to 
the way we run our business. The safety 
of our passengers and employees is an 
absolute priority. We are committed to 
reducing the environmental impacts of 
our operations and believe a sustainable 
transport network is essential to the 
UK’s future. We are a passenger focused 
business and we strive to provide 
reliable and convenient services to the 
millions of passengers who travel with us 
every day. We consider our employees 
to be our most valuable asset. We put 
considerable effort into developing their 
skills and performance, this helps deliver 
high levels of staff retention, low levels 
of absenteeism and improving levels of 
customer service. We believe that good 
businesses have strong links with the 
communities they serve. Our devolved 
structure, where local management teams 
make day-to-day service decisions, ensures 
we have an immediate understanding of 
local communities and can tailor services 
to those individual needs. 
We set challenging targets to ensure 
we are continually improving our 
performance. 
Our commitment to corporate 
responsibility can be seen throughout our 
businesses. Go South Coast has launched 
the “Community Bus Partnership” on the 
isle of Wight, a unique initiative designed 
to provide much needed bus services to 
communities which have been affected 
by public spending cuts. The company 
is maximising spare vehicle capacity by 
training local community volunteers to 
drive them. The company is working 
with local authorities to ensure that new 
routes are designed, based on community 
needs. This initiative is a positive move 
for local communities by improving social 
inclusion. There are also environmental 
benefits to the scheme, as the provision 
of services will reduce the number of 
private cars on the island’s roads. 
During the year l ondon Midland became 
the first UK train operator to install 
energy meters on all of its electric train 
fleet. The benefits include accurate energy 
costs being charged, information that 
will enable energy consumption to be 
reduced and data on the condition of 
train systems to improve reliability.  
in addition, l ondon Midland expects 
that, over time, its electricity costs will 
be reduced by up to 20% and its carbon 
emissions from 98,000 tonnes to 78,000 
due to the installation of the new meters. 
The company is also working to reduce 
energy usage by training drivers in  
energy efficient driving techniques and 
is making smarter use of on-board air 
conditioning, heating and lighting to  
drive down energy usage.

Ch AIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Strength 
acro SS bu S 
and rail 
operation S
I am pleased with the performance of the Group this year. Despite 
facing challenging economic conditions in the last 12 months and 
the adverse weather in the first half of the year, all of our operations 
have seen growth in like-for-like passenger revenue and passenger 
journeys. We have worked hard to continue providing a high quality, 
value for money service to our customers and have made good 
progress in understanding who our customers are and what their 
priorities are. 
In the first half of the year, we disposed of the remainder of our 
aviation services division and began operating our first contracts 
through our yellow school bus joint venture in North America. 
The second half of the year saw the acquisition of the Thames 
Travel bus business. 
We welcomed the findings of the McNulty review in May and are 
working closely with the Government and key organisations within 
the rail industry to shape the future of rail franchising. 
We have refinanced our main bank facilities during the year and 
maintained our investment grade credit ratings. We remain in 
good financial shape and continue to believe in the fundamental 
strengths of public transport having seen an evident modal shift 
from private car usage to public transport over the last 12 months. 
Overall, revenue increased by £129.7m, or 6.0%, to £2,297.0m 
(2010: £2,167.3m), with increases in our deregulated bus division 
and our rail division more than offsetting a slight reduction in  
our regulated bus division. Operating profit
*
 was up 14.0%  
to £115.1m, in line with our expectations (2010: £101.0m).  
Adjusted earnings per share
*
 increased by 6.5% to 135.2p  
(2010: 126.9p). Basic earnings per share, including exceptional 
items and discontinued operations, was 157.1p (2010: 40.1p)  
and profit attributable to members was £67.4m (2010: £17.2m).
Business development and acquisitions
This year has seen us dispose of the remainder of our aviation 
services division. The residual operations disposed in the first half 
of the year are classified as discontinued and are excluded from 
the results discussed throughout this report. 
We have seen continued 
growth in the financial year, 
demonstrating resilience in 
our core business in what  
continues to be a difficult  
economic environment  Strategic Review
www.go-ahead.com 13
Our North American yellow school bus joint venture operations 
have been running successfully for a year, having started with two 
contracts in St Louis, Missouri in August 2010. We have established 
ourselves as a reliable and credible operator in the market.
T owards the end of the financial year we acquired Thames Travel, 
a small bus company based in Oxfordshire. This demonstrates our 
commitment to acquisitive growth through bolt-on acquisitions  
in our deregulated bus business. 
Dividends
We know that our dividend policy is key to the investment 
decision for many shareholders. The Board remains committed 
to maintaining the dividend per share which is supported by the 
Group’s strong balance sheet and cash generation. The Board is 
proposing a final dividend of 55.5p per share (2010: 30.0p) to 
maintain the total dividend for the year at 81.0p (2010: 81.0p). 
The final dividend is payable on 18 November 2011 to registered 
shareholders at the close of business on 4 November 2011.
The Board of Directors and Governance
Following a 40 year career in the transport industry, Keith 
Ludeman retired as Group Chief Executive in July 2011. It  
has been a pleasure to work with Keith and I wish him well  
in his retirement.
I am delighted to welcome David Brown and Keith Down to the 
Board of Go-Ahead. Both David and Keith bring new strengths to 
the Board and are committed to continuing the excellent progress 
we are making in line with our strategy. 
David Brown was appointed to the Board in April 2011 as Deputy 
Group Chief Executive and following a handover period he 
became Group Chief Executive on 3 July 2011, following Keith 
Ludeman’s retirement. Keith Down was appointed to the Board as 
Group Finance Director in March 2011. Both David and Keith will 
stand for election at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)  
in October 2011. 
In May 2010, the Financial Reporting Council issued a new  
edition of the Combined Code, called the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which outlined a number of changes designed 
to reinforce Board quality, focus on risk and improve accountability 
to shareholders. The Board has implemented changes accordingly, 
including all Directors being subject to annual election by 
shareholders at the AGM, which took effect from October 2010.
In addition to this, we acknowledged the Financial Reporting 
Council’s new guidance on Board Effectiveness and changes to the 
code following the Financial Reporting Council’s consultation on 
gender diversity on Boards.
Corporate responsibility
For Go-Ahead, corporate responsibility is about operating our 
trains and buses safely, reducing the impact of our operations 
on the environment and being passenger focused. It also means 
developing our staff and enriching our local communities while 
growing our business profitably for our shareholders. Environmental 
and social issues have continued to play an important role this year. 
These issues are at the heart of our business and we work closely 
with our many stakeholder groups to innovate so we remain at 
the forefront of our sector. Our aim is to provide passengers with 
quality bus and rail services which are sustainable and meet the 
requirements of the communities in which we operate.
Our approach to corporate responsibility covers five main areas: 
safety, environment, passengers, employees and community. The 
safety and security of our passengers, our people and the general 
public is an absolute priority for the Group and we continually 
strive to improve our already high safety performance. We are 
committed to improving the energy efficiency of our bus and 
rail operations as this not only has important environmental 
benefits, but also helps to reduce operating costs. Our Driving 
Energy Further initiatives, aimed at reducing our CO
2
 emissions 
per passenger journey by 20% by 2015, have continued this year. 
Investment, innovation and the commitment of our employees 
means we have made good progress against our target, achieving a 
12% reduction against our 2007/08 baseline – a 3% improvement 
on last year.
employees
The average number of employees in the Group for the financial 
year was 22,201, below last year’s average of 22,570, primarily due 
to the disposal of the remainder of our aviation services division.  
I would like to thank our employees for their continuing dedication 
and hard work through these challenging economic conditions to 
ensure that we remain a strong and successful Group.
Outlook
Our bus and rail operations remain fundamentally strong and 
have benefited from passengers leaving their cars at home and 
choosing better value public transport alternatives. Whilst we are 
encouraged by our performance this year, we remain cautious on 
the medium term wider economic outlook.
Our outlook for the next financial year has not changed since 
our trading update in June 2011. We are assuming that the broad 
underlying operating trends experienced in the financial year will 
continue throughout the financial year to 30 June 2012 and that 
around £13m of the rail contract management benefits achieved 
in 2011 will not recur.
In bus, we anticipate that the performance of the business will 
remain strong despite the reduction in the Bus Service Operators 
Grant (BSOG) in April 2012 which will impact on the last  
quarter of the next financial year. Our fuel requirements are  
fully hedged for the next year at 41p per litre, in line with the  
cost in the financial year just ended. In rail, we will continue to 
drive revenue and control costs to help offset the challenges  
of reduced subsidies/increased premia in our franchises.
Our balance sheet, cash flow and financing are strong and we  
continue to view the maintenance of the dividend as a priority. 
We have started the new financial year well and trading has  
been in line with the Board’s expectations.

e xcellent 
pr ogre SS in 
delivering 
our Strategy
In my first review as Group Chief Executive, I am pleased to 
report strong operational performance across our businesses. 
While the wider economy is still facing real challenges our local 
market focus has ensured we are in a strong position to meet the 
needs of our passengers while leveraging the benefits of scale that 
a large group can bring. The combination of strong government 
commitment to public transport and increasing modal shift from 
cars means the growth prospects for public transport, particularly 
in urban areas, are strong. We are therefore well placed to 
grow organically and, where appropriate, make value-enhancing 
acquisitions. The future still holds challenges, but the prospects for 
the business are good.
Summary of performance
In the year, our operating performance was in line with our 
expectations. The increase in operating profit
*
 to £115.1m was 
driven by increased profits in deregulated bus and rail, offset by the 
anticipated reduction in turnover and margin in our regulated bus 
business. As we completed the disposal of our aviation services 
division during the year, these businesses are classed as discontinued 
and, unless otherwise stated, their results are excluded from this 
review. The disposal of this division has enabled us to focus solely 
on our bus and rail divisions. As part of our constant review of 
We continue to deliver 
growth across our business 
through continued 
improvements in service 
standards, better marketing, 
and a local focus on high 
density urban markets Strategic Review

best practice we now report on our regulated and deregulated 
bus businesses separately and have reclassified some elements of 
insurance liability and leased asset dilapidations as provisions rather 
than accruals. In accordance with IFRS we have presented a restated 
balance sheet for the year to  
3 July 2010 to clearly show these changes.
Cash management remains a focus for the Group and this 
resulted in cashflow from operations being ahead of expectations 
at £137.9m (2010: £160.6m) and net debt reducing to £69.8m 
(2010: £88.3m). Capital investment remains slightly ahead of 
depreciation, due to ongoing franchise commitments in both 
Southern and London Midland but also due to maintaining the 
high quality asset base in our expanding bus division. 
We continue to seek bolt-on acquisitions and, on 24 May 
2011, we acquired Thames Travel, a quality operator based in 
Oxfordshire that strengthens our presence in and around  
Oxford and opens up new local markets for us.
Our refinancing was completed during the year. We replaced 
our revolving credit facility with a new five year £275m revolving 
credit facility, maturing in February 2016. This is in addition to  
our £200m sterling bond which matures in September 2017.  
Our investment grade credit ratings from Moody’s and Standard  
& Poor’s have retained their stable outlook. 
This financial strength and profitability ensures we can maintain our 
full year dividend to shareholders at 81.0p per share (2010: 81.0p). 
Market environment
While the wider economic environment remains challenging, we 
are encouraged by the level of growth across our business. The 
Government continues to strongly support public transport. Last 
year the industry was concerned about the impact of government 
spending cuts and, while these have indeed been difficult, the 
underlying growth in our business has more than compensated 
for the impact. We welcome the publication of the Government-
commissioned McNulty Report on rail franchising and look 
forward to playing a key role in transforming the rail industry in 
the months and years ahead. In the medium term, we fully expect 
to benefit from both a cyclical economic recovery and from the 
underlying strengths of public transport in the UK. 
Our strategy
The Board remains committed to the Group’s strategy to  
continue to focus on providing high quality passenger transport.
The underlying elements of this strategy are to:
• Run our companies in a socially and environmentally  
responsible manner;
• Provide high quality, locally focused passenger transport services;
• Prioritise high density, urban markets; and
• Maintain strong financial discipline to deliver shareholder value.
Each element has a number of performance indicators, both financial 
and non-financial, which are routinely measured for improvement 
trends and comparison between operating companies.

In the near term, our priority is to deliver value from our existing 
portfolio of operations and seek value-enhancing opportunities.
Key risks include a major accident or incident, or an unexpected 
reduction in demand for our services. We operate a strong 
governance structure and control environment to mitigate these 
and other risks as far as possible. Our key risks and uncertainties 
are detailed on pages 28 to 31.
Divisional performance overview
Deregulated bus
Our deregulated bus division performed well during the year, 
with strong growth achieved in our existing businesses and also 
in those acquired by the Group in the previous financial year. 
Operating profit
*
 was significantly ahead of last year at £33.7m 
(2010: £27.2m). This was driven by passenger numbers increasing 
by 4.7% and passenger revenue growth of 7.4% (2.3% and 5.1% 
respectively on a like-for-like basis, adjusting for acquisitions and 
the additional week in the prior year). Cost savings achieved 
through Group purchasing continue to support the businesses. We 
continue to de-risk fuel costs through a hedging programme which 
is now rolling forward into 2014. Capital investment continues at 
above depreciation, ensuring that we retain one of the youngest 
bus fleets in the sector and maintain our strategically important 
freehold depot locations. 
Go-Ahead North America, our joint venture with Cook Illinois, 
commenced trading in August 2010 with its first yellow school bus 
franchise in St Louis, Missouri. We have established ourselves as a 
reliable and credible operator in the market and while the 2011 
tendering round has not secured new work for the joint venture, 
we will use the experience gained in the 2012 tendering round.
Regulated bus
Our regulated bus division traded in line with management 
expectations. Revenue was down by 1.3%, primarily through 
reduced receipts through Quality Incentive Contracts (QICs) 
following the abolition of the QIC2 scheme, with profits of 
£33.4m (2010: £36.5m). Like-for-like mileage operated was slightly 
down on last year at 72.2 million miles and we continued to perform 
well in TfL league tables operating 99.6% of scheduled mileage. 
Following recent contract gains, we expect to see mileage and 
revenue growth next year. Tendering competition and the QIC 
bonus structure have stabilised although the costs of uninsured 
claims are increasing. Overall we expect margins to be relatively 
stable although there will be some impact from the decrease in 
the Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) in April 2012.
Rail
The results of our rail division remained resilient with operating 
profit
*
 of £48.0m, some £10.7m ahead of last year, underpinned by 
approximately £13m of non-recurring contract management benefits.
All of our three rail franchises deliver core commuter services 
to high density urban markets. Passenger revenue growth is 
fundamental to their success as the passenger revenue growth 
offsets the profile of reducing underlying DfT subsidy, or in 
Southern’s case, increasing premia. Like-for-like passenger revenue 
growth for the division was 8.5%, with 8.6% in Southern, 8.4% in 
Southeastern and 8.6% in London Midland. Growth in passenger 
numbers was strong in the year with overall growth for the 
division of 4.2% on a like-for-like basis. In Southern, Southeastern 
and London Midland passenger numbers grew by 2.3%, 5.0% and 
7.2% respectively. 
The Southern franchise continues to meet its core franchise 
commitments and is in line with its bid assumptions. Southeastern’s 
high speed service between St Pancras International and Kent 
is now fully established and is expanding. It has benefited, in 
particular, from excellent contract management. London Midland 
continues to improve its operational performance and has made 
steady progress in addressing key staffing issues.
in summary
We are pleased with the set of strong results we have reported. 
While the wider economy still faces challenges, we are making 
excellent progress in delivering our growth strategy. 
We stand ready to benefit from any recovery in the economy 
and, while we remain cautious in the near term outlook for the 
UK, we are confident in the underlying strengths of and growth 
opportunities for our business.
David Brown, Group Chief executive

GROUP Ch IEF Ex ECUTIv E’S
Q&a David Brown returned to Go-Ahead in April 2011 and 
became Group Chief Executive in July 2011. h e has 
nearly 30 years’ experience in the transport sector.
“Maintaining the 
dividend per share is 
an absolute priority 
for the Board”
mixture of ambition, experience, and know-
how will allow me to serve the Group and 
shareholders well in the years ahead.
Q
Do you plan to radically change the direction 
of the Group?
a We have a successful business model, 
involving autonomous business units, and 
there is no need to radically change what 
works well. I do believe, however, that 
there is considerable potential to grow 
the business both organically and through 
bolt-on acquisitions and to use Go-Ahead’s 
scale to deliver business synergies that will 
improve our cost base. We are becoming 
significantly better at marketing our services 
and we are benefiting from higher costs of 
motoring as motorists move to the better 
value alternative of public transport. In the rail 
industry, a number of franchise opportunities 
will be coming up in the years ahead.
Q
How has Go-Ahead been affected by central 
and local government cuts?
a The whole transport sector was concerned 
about the potential impact of the 
Comprehensive Spending Review. I am 
pleased that our underlying performance 
has more than made up for the impact of 
the reduction in bus subsidies. This time last 
year, the sector was concerned about the 
future of the Bus Service Operators Grant. 
The Government chose to reduce rather 
than scrap this grant and, as the reduction 
is gradual, there is time for the business to 
Q
What do you bring to the role of Group  
Chief Executive? 
a A strong ambition for the future of the 
business, an in-depth knowledge of the 
transport sector, and an understanding 
of, and background within, the Go-Ahead 
Group. I am hugely proud to be leading 
a first class business which has significant 
opportunities for growth and business 
development. h aving spent almost 30 years 
in the transport industry I know the sector, 
and in particular the markets that Go-Ahead 
operates in, incredibly well. Before rejoining 
the Group, I spent five years as Managing 
Director for Surface Transport at Transport 
for London – running one of the world’s 
largest urban bus networks. Alongside that, 
I was responsible for London’s Red Route 
road network, congestion charging, taxi 
and private hire regulations, coach, river, 
and mobility transport as well as transport 
policing and enforcement. I also introduced 
the successful Barclays Cycle h ire Scheme. 
In the past, I was Chief Executive of Go-
Ahead’s London bus business and served 
as an adviser to the main Board before 
joining Transport for London. I hope that this 
adapt. Clearly local authorities are under 
pressure and this has impacted the wider 
industry. h owever, as the vast majority of 
our services are fully commercial rather than 
local authority contracts, we do not have 
any significant exposure. Concessionary fare 
negotiations continue to be tough but we 
are confident that we will be able to retain 
reimbursement at a level the business can 
live with. 
Q Q
How confident are you of your ability to 
operate in the UK rail market which is  
very competitive?
a Rail is a very good market in which to 
operate and I believe we excel at it.  
Go-Ahead delivers 30% of all UK 
rail passenger journeys and we have 
demonstrated an ability to win franchises. 
We have a very strong base from which to 
grow. The McNulty review is a chance for 
the rail industry to be put on a much more 
sustainable business model for the long term. 
We welcome that and the opportunities it 
might bring. 
Q
How secure is the dividend?
a Delivery of the dividend is a key priority for 
the Board. We have an excellent balance 
sheet and our cashflows support the level 
of dividend we are committed to delivering 
whilst ensuring we can invest to grow the 
business further. In line with our long term 
strategy, we will continue to seek acquisitions 
where they add value.

in difficult 
condition S
UK public transport remains  
fundamentally strong. While the wider 
economy still faces challenges we continue 
to see growth across our businesses. 
The Government remains committed 
to ensuring the UK has a strong public 
transport infrastructure
The economic environment
The last 12 months have not delivered meaningful growth in  
the wider economy with GDP up only 0.7% in the 12 months  
to June 2011
1
. It is encouraging that employment rates have 
remained relatively stable during the financial year. We have  
seen strong growth on our own services over the period and  
we believe we are well placed to benefit from wider improvement 
in economic conditions.
The rising cost of motoring
The costs of motoring have risen steeply with drivers paying at 
least 20% more to run their cars than a year before
2
. Not only  
are car owners making fewer journeys in their cars, car ownership 
is also declining. This is contributing to modal shift with drivers 
leaving their cars at home and using the better value alternative  
of public transport. Those switching are finding services that are 
high quality, reliable and frequent. 
The future of rail franchising 
Sir Roy McNulty was commissioned by the Department  
for Transport and the Office of Rail Regulation to conduct  
a value-for-money study of the UK rail industry. In May 2011, 
the report, “Realising the potential of GB rail”, was published. 
Key recommendations included longer franchises and closer 
collaboration around infrastructure. We welcome the report  
as a positive step in shaping the future of rail franchising  
which will benefit the industry and passengers alike.  
A “Rail Delivery Group” with representatives from across  
the industry, including Go-Ahead, has been convened to  
help implement the proposals.

Department for T ransport spending cuts
The findings of the Government’s Comprehensive Spending 
Review, which were released in October 2010, demonstrated the 
Government’s commitment to public transport with the impact 
on the bus and rail industries being less severe than many  
had anticipated.
We identified three potential impacts of government spending 
cuts in our 2010 Annual Report. These areas were impacted  
as follows:
Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG)
Prior situation
• 43ppl fuel duty rebate
• £500m overall annual funding of which Go-Ahead currently 
receives c£50m
The result
• 20% reduction from April 2012
Financial impact
• 2011/12 c£1.6m cost (net of receipt of 8% smartcard subsidy)
• 2012/13 c£9.6m cost
Mitigation
• Offset in deregulated market by 8% smartcard subsidy in 2011/12
• Built into new London contract tenders ongoing
• Yield benefits and efficiency improvements across services  
in the rest of the UK
Bus concessionary fares
Prior situation
• £1.2bn overall annual funding of which Go-Ahead currently 
receives c£60m
• 30% of passenger journeys and 20% of passenger  
revenue in Go-Ahead’s deregulated markets are from  
concessionary passengers
• Average concessionary fare reimbursement rates were 50-60%
The result
• Government committed to protecting statutory entitlement  
for travel to ensure older people can maintain greater freedom 
and independence. 
• In practice, we have seen reimbursement rates fluctuate
Financial impact
• Overall impact is negative but not significant (c£2m)
Mitigation
• Continue to drive growth in fare paying passengers
T endered bus services
Prior situation
• £1.2bn overall annual funding of which c£600m is TfL subsidy
• Go-Ahead has 21% share of London market and less than 10%  
of deregulated operations are tendered services
The result
• No changes to London bus mileage requirements
• Different levels of cuts across local authorities
Financial impact
• Due to the highly commercial bias of our bus operations the 
financial impact will be negative but not significant (c£2m)
Mitigation
• Continue with our strategy of operating largely 
commercial services
• Rationalise services on tendered routes where possible
The Competition Commission
In May 2011, the Competition Commission issued its provisional 
findings and notice of proposed remedies in response to its 
inquiry into the UK local bus market. No fundamental change  
to the regulatory structure of the bus industry is currently  
being proposed.
l ong term growth
Our business continues to grow in what is a difficult financial 
environment. We are progressing well in delivering our growth 
strategy and are well placed to embrace future opportunities. 
Our bus and rail operations remain fundamentally strong and 
have benefited from passengers leaving their cars at home and 
choosing better value public transport alternatives. 
We will continue to monitor the wider performance of the 
economy very closely in the months ahead. The Government has 
shown its commitment to UK public transport and believes that 
transport infrastructure investment is vital for economic growth.  
In addition to this, an efficient public transport system reduces 
traffic congestion, limits air pollution, and helps tackle social 
exclusion. The Government recognises this and acknowledges  
that the private sector is best placed to deliver and grow  
these services.
“The Coalition Government’s vision is  
for a transport system that generates 
growth and spreads prosperity.  
We want one that empowers local 
communities and supports social 
 mobility and is a cleaner, greener  
gateway to a better quality of life.”

T o run our companies in a safe, socially 
and environmentally responsible manner
As a public transport operator, corporate 
responsibility is integral to the way we run 
our business. Ensuring the safety of our 
passengers and employees is an absolute 
priority for the Group. We are also 
committed to reducing the environmental 
impacts of our operations and strongly 
believe that a sustainable public transport 
network is essential to the future of the UK.
 See page 8 for more information
2
T o provide high quality locally focused 
passenger transport services
We believe providing a reliable and 
convenient service encourages passenger 
growth and offers an attractive alternative 
to the private car. Our unique devolved 
structure ensures a strong local focus to 
provide our passengers with high quality  
bus and rail services.
 See page 2 for more information
3
T o focus our operations in high density 
urban markets
We focus our operations in high density 
commuter markets, predominantly in the 
South East of the UK, where there is strong 
demand for public transport. The UK will 
remain our primary focus however we will 
consider investment in overseas operations  
if we believe it will add shareholder value.
 See page 4 for more information

T o run our business with strong financial 
discipline to deliver shareholder value
Our aim is to deliver shareholder value 
through a combination of earnings growth, 
strong cash generation and balance sheet 
management, supplemented by value adding 
acquisitions and disposals.

t o our 
Strategy Our strategy is designed to deliver 
earnings and growth for our investors 
through the responsible delivery of high  
quality services in the dense urban 
markets where we operate
Our core strategy is comprised of four 
priorities to which we are strongly committed. 
At the beginning of each financial year 
we set internal targets in line with these 
priorities. These targets are closely monitored 
throughout the year at every level of the 
organisation. At Go-Ahead, we believe that 
every one of our employees contributes to 
the successful delivery of our strategy. 
The Board remains confident of the Group’s 
strategy and throughout the financial year  
we made steady progress against our  
strategic priorities. 
We are committed to providing high quality,

Delivering on  
Strategic Priority 2 
The following KPIs underpin our strategic 
objective to be a high quality operator
Rail punctuality
The punctuality of our rail operations is measured on the basis of the Department 
for Transport’s Public Performance Measure (PPM) on a moving annual average basis. 
This is the percentage of trains that arrive at their final destination within five minutes 
of their scheduled arrival time having called at all scheduled stations. This time frame 
is an industry standard definition for ‘on-time’ measurement. We also monitor 
customer satisfaction through the National Passenger Survey, conducted by the 
statutory public transport users watchdog Passenger Focus. The PPM industry 
average is 90.9%
6.
Why it’s important: Providing a punctual service is one of the most important  
factors for our passengers. Our PPM performance also forms part of the  
franchise agreement.
Aim: Maintain our high levels of punctuality at or above 90%. 
l ondon bus 
punctuality
The reliability of  
London bus operations 
is primarily measured on 
excess waiting time
7
. This 
is the time passengers 
have to wait for a bus 
above the average 
scheduled waiting time. 
Therefore, the lower 
the excess waiting time 
the better . The industry 
average is 1.01 minutes
8
.
Why it’s important: 
Service punctuality 
is important to our 
passengers. W e earn 
extra revenue through 
Quality Incentive 
Contracts if we exceed 
TfL punctuality targets.
Aim: Maintain our low 
excess waiting time 
performance at below 
one minute.
Deregulated 
bus punctuality
The punctuality of 
our deregulated bus 
operations is measured 
as a percentage of buses 
that arrive at their stop 
between one minute 
before and five minutes 
after their scheduled 
time.Therefore the 
higher the percentage 
the better .  
 
Why it’s important: 
Providing a punctual 
service is one of the 
most important factors 
for our passengers. 
Delivering a high quality 
service helps us to grow 
passenger numbers.
Aim: Maintain our high 
levels of punctuality at or 
above 90%.

Passenger journeys
We focus our operations in predominantly high 
density urban markets where there is strong 
demand for public transport.
Why it’s important: h elps us to demonstrate that 
our strategy of focusing our operations in urban 
areas is effective. Our bus and rail passenger 
journeys have increased despite the challenging 
economic conditions. In bus, whilst regulated 
mileage was broadly similar, deregulated passenger 
numbers increased by 2.3% and in rail, passenger 
numbers increased by 4.2%. Passenger journeys 
also helps us to measure against our commitment 
to provide a high quality service.
Aim: T o increase passenger journeys each year  
by providing a high quality service.

We are continually 
assessing acquisition 
opportunities in line

MANAGING RISK
r obu St ri Sk 
Manage Ment 
The effective management  
of risk supports the delivery of the 
Group’s objectives, protection of  
its reputation and achievement of 
sustainable shareholder value 
Go-Ahead’s devolved management structure provides a robust 
risk management and internal control framework, as detailed in the 
Corporate Governance report on pages 56 to 68.
The diagram below illustrates the key roles and responsibilities for  
each of the respective functions within our risk management 
framework. Ultimate accountability for risk management lies with  
the Board, supported by the work of the Audit Committee to which 
the Board has delegated responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems. With 
clear leadership from the Board and Audit Committee, the Executive 
Directors play an integral role in helping the operating companies 
identify, assess and monitor their respective risks and controls. Through 
monthly meetings with the senior management of each operating 
company, the Executive Directors encourage open communication on 
risk matters within a clearly defined framework and reporting process. 
Ownership of risk identification and mitigation lies with the senior 
management in operating companies where it is an integral part  
of day to day local company operations.
The tables on pages 29 to 31 summarise our assessment of the key 
risks and uncertainties that could impact the Group’s performance. 
These risks are monitored on an ongoing basis through the Group’s 
risk management processes, together with the effectiveness of 
mitigation through the internal control environment. Residual risk is 
assessed by the Board and accepted, if appropriate, as an integral part 
of the risk and reward of the business, or deemed unacceptable and 
therefore either reduced, transferred to third parties or avoided by 
no longer pursuing the relevant activity. The matters described are not 
intended to be an exhaustive list of all possible risks and uncertainties.
• Delegated responsibility from the Board to oversee risk management  
and internal controls
• Reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management processes
• Monitors the role and effectiveness of the internal auditors and the 
independence and expertise of the external auditors

Fuel costs The Group’s bus and rail businesses are 
exposed to fuel cost volatility, primarily diesel 
for buses and electricity for rail traction. 
Increases in fuel prices which are not fully 
mitigated by the Group’s policies, or hedged 
prices in excess of market prices, could 
adversely impact the Group’s financial position
• The Group forward buys prices for electricity for rail traction as appropriate and 
regularly enters into forward swap contracts to buy fuel at fixed prices to cover all 
of the requirements of the current financial year, at least 50% of the requirements 
for the next financial year and at least 25% for the following financial year

Breach of rail  
franchise agreements
Failure to comply with the conditions of the 
rail franchise agreements results in penalties, 
including the potential termination of one 
or more rail franchise agreements. This 
could result in the Group losing the right to 
continue operating the affected operations 
and consequently the related revenues and 
cashflows. The Group may also lose cash 
balances or season ticket bonds set aside 
to cover working capital requirements, and 
performance bonds. Any such loss of revenues

year (2010: £101.0m). Adjusted earnings per share
*
 was up 6.5% 
to 135.2p (2010: 126.9p). Basic earnings per share was 157.1p 
(2010: 40.1p).
Cash conversion was, once again, excellent with cashflow 
generated from operations of £137.9m (2010: £160.6m) 
compared to operating profit before depreciation, amortisation 
and exceptional items (EBITDA) of £164.3m (2010: £150.9m).
Our balance sheet and financing remain strong. Adjusted net debt 
to EBITDA was 1.6x at the year end (2010: 1.9x) and remains 
within our target range of 1.5-2.5x. Our funding is secured in the 
medium term, through a £275m revolving credit facility, expiring in 
February 2016, together with our £200m bond which matures in 
September 2017. At the end of the year we had headroom within 
the loan facility of £191.0m (2010: £177.0m).
Discontinued operations
Following the disposal of the remainder of our aviation services 
division during the first half of the financial year, the income 
statements for both the current period and comparative periods 
have been re-analysed between those operations which remain 
(continuing) and those which were sold (discontinued), with the 
net profit or loss from the latter shown as a one line item at the 
end of the income statement.
Unless otherwise stated, the narrative throughout this report 
refers to continuing operations. 
A full explanation of discontinued items is provided below.

EBITDA was £164.3m (2010: £150.9m), consisting of operating

Pensions
Operating profit
*
 includes the net cost of the Group’s defined 
benefit pension plans for the period of £37.0m (2010: £36.3m) 
consisting of bus costs of £5.2m (2010: £5.4m) and rail costs of 
£31.8m (2010: £30.9m). Company contributions to the schemes 
totalled £44.1m (2010: £43.2m). 
The net deficit after taxation on the non-rail defined benefit 
schemes was £44.3m (2010: £69.8m), consisting of pre tax 
liabilities of £59.9m (2010: £96.9m) less a deferred tax asset of 
£15.6m (2010: £27.1m). The decrease in deficit was primarily 
due to the future benefit indexation changing from RPI to CPI 
in the period. The pre tax deficit consisted of estimated liabilities 
of £529.7m (2010: £516.9m) less assets of £469.8m (2010: 
£420.0m). The percentage of assets held in higher risk, return 
seeking assets was 46% (2010: 57%), lower than last year due to 
a continuing exercise to de-risk the pension scheme in line with 
industry benchmarks. 
Rail pensions
As reported at the half year, the rail pension schemes follow the 
Government’s change from RPI to CPI, although the nature of 
these schemes means we only recognise the share of surplus  
or deficit expected to be realised over the life of each franchise.
The change from RPI to CPI is expected to reduce the income 
statement charge from the start of the next financial year. The 
changes in other assumptions in the period have also been 
favourable, and would reduce the income statement charge in the 
financial year to June 2013 to give a total benefit of around £5m 
per annum in the income statement over the remaining lives of 
the franchises.
At this stage, we have not assumed any corresponding reduction 
in cash contributions until agreed with trustees as part of the 
December 2010 triennial valuation discussions. On this basis, 
we have recorded a liability of £17.0m (2010: £nil), representing 
the discounted value of the liability attributable to the remaining 
franchise period of around £5m per annum. If the future 
cash contributions were to be agreed in line with the income 
statement charge, this liability would no longer be required and 
both the income statement charge and the cash contributions 
would reduce over the remaining lives of the franchises. 
Net finance costs
Net finance costs for the year increased to £17.5m (2010: 
£13.3m), comprising finance costs of £19.0m (2010: £14.9m) 
less finance revenue of £1.5m (2010: £1.6m). The increase in 
net finance costs was primarily due to the full year impact of the 
interest rates on the £200m sterling bond which was issued at a 
coupon rate of 5.375% in March 2010. The average net interest 
rate was 5.5% (2010: 4.8%) for the year and the proportion of 
gross debt held under fixed interest rate agreements at 2 July 
2011 was 113.1% (2010: 105.6%). 
Goodwill and intangible amortisation
The charge for the year of £10.5m (2010: £10.9m) represents 
the non-cash cost of amortising goodwill, intangibles including 
assets associated with pension accounting for the rail franchises 
and computer costs. The decrease against the prior year is due to 
the amortisation on the New Southern Railway Limited franchise 
acquisition goodwill coming to an end in December 2009.
exceptional items
Exceptional income before taxation in the year was £1.5m (2010 
expense: £46.8m). Exceptional costs on continuing operations for 
the period were £2.3m (2010: £11.0m) consisting of accelerated 
depreciation of £3.0m (2010: £2.6m) in respect of articulated 
London buses which are being phased out, the release of onerous 
bus leases of £0.3m (2010 expense: £0.9m) and the release of

n on-controlling interest
The non-controlling interest in the income statement of £12.0m 
(2010: £6.3m) arises from our 65% holding in Govia Limited 
which owns 100% of our current rail operations and therefore 
represents 35% of the profit after taxation of these operations. 
Discontinued operations
In the first half of the financial year the remainder of our aviation 
services division was sold and, as such, there is no profit or loss 
from this division shown in continuing operations or exceptional 
charges in the current or comparative results. 
Discontinued operations in the year resulted in a minimal net 
profit of £0.1m. 
earnings per share
The earnings per share analysis provides four measures: adjusted 
earnings per share (profit after tax, before amortisation and 
exceptional items and excluding discontinued items), continuing 
earnings per share (after amortisation and exceptional items) and 
total earnings per share (including discontinued operations). In 
the year, adjusted earnings per share also excludes the one-off tax 
benefit of £7.8m relating to the agreement of tax efficient leasing 
schemes and the £4.4m, in respect of the impact on deferred tax 
due to the change in statutory rate. 
Adjusted earnings (net profit after tax on continuing operations 
attributable to members before amortisation and exceptional 
items) were £58.0m (2010: £54.5m) resulting in a 6.5% increase  
in adjusted earnings per share from 126.9p to 135.2p.
The weighted average number of shares remained at 42.9 million 
(2010: 42.9 million), as did the closing number of shares in issue, 
net of treasury shares.
rail reorganisation liabilities of £0.4m (2010 expense: £6.7m). 
The discontinued exceptional income of £3.8m (2010 expense: 
£35.8m) consists of net profit on the sale of residual elements of 
the ground handling operations and Meteor Parking operations, 
and adjustments to the provisions in respect of the pre-sale 
reorganisation costs which related to operations sold in the  
prior period.
Taxation 
Net taxation for the year of £9.8m (2010: £14.5m) included 
underlying tax on ordinary activities of £22.8m (2010: £20.0m), 
equivalent to an effective rate of 26.2% (2010: 26.0%) slightly 
below the UK statutory rate for the period of 27.5% (2010: 28.0%) 
due to the £7.8m benefit of previous tax efficient asset finance 
arrangements. The lower charge also reflects £4.4m credit in respect 
of the impact on deferred tax on the change in statutory rate.

investment in the joint venture. At 2 July 2011 $6.2m or £3.9m  
of this facility was utilised.
In the second half of the financial year, on 3 February 2011, we 
refinanced our £280m revolving credit facility, due to expire in 
November 2012, with a £275m revolving credit facility expiring  
in February 2016. This new facility, together with our £200m  
bond expiring in September 2017, secures significant medium 
term finance. At the year end there were no other bank loans  
(2010: £5.6m).
Net debt was £69.8m, a continued improvement on prior years 
(2010: £88.3m; 2009: £91.0m), consisting of the £200m sterling 
bond, amounts drawn down against the £275m (2010: £280m) 
five year revolving credit facility of £84.0m (2010: £103.0m); hire 
purchase and lease agreements of £5.5m (2010: £10.0m); dollar 
loan of £3.9m (2010: £nil); medium term loans of £nil (2010: 
£5.6m) and overdrafts of £5.0m (2010: £5.8m), partly offset  
by cash and short term deposits of £228.6m (2010: £236.1m) 
which included restricted cash in rail of £189.7m (2010: £204.0m).
Adjusted net debt, consisting of net debt plus restricted cash,  
was £259.5m (2010: £292.3m), equivalent to 1.6x EBITDA (2010: 
1.9x), well within our target range of between 1.5x – 2.5x through 
the cycle, and significantly below our primary financing covenant 
of not more than 3.5x.
Net assets totalled £31.4m at the end of the year compared  
to a liability of £(41.3)m at 3 July 2010. The increase of £72.7m 
consists primarily of profit for the period of £79.4m, less dividends 
of £28.6m and post tax movements in other comprehensive 
income of £22.3m and other reductions of £0.4m.
We have retained the investment grade ratings from Moody’s 
(Baa3, stable outlook) and Standard and Poor’s (BBB-, stable 
outlook) achieved last year ahead of the issue of our sterling bond.
Risk management
Key risks and uncertainties are detailed on pages 28 to 31,  
and include political and economic risks such as political and 
regulatory changes and availability of public funding, together 
with other risks such as a major accident or incident. Page 28 
summarises how we manage these risks across the Group.
Keith Down, Group Finance Director 
31 August 2011
Dividends
The Board is proposing a total dividend for the year of 81.0p per 
share (2010: 81.0p). This includes a proposed final payment of 
55.5p (2010: 30.0p) payable on 18 November 2011 to registered 
shareholders at the close of business on 4 November 2011. The 
final dividend paid last year was lower due to a one-off change 
to the proportion of the full year dividend paid as an interim 
dividend in advance of the 1 April 2010 change to taxation.
Dividends paid in the period represent the payment of last year’s 
final dividend of 30.0p per share (2010: 55.5p) and the interim 
dividend in respect of this year of 25.5p per share (2010: 51.0p).
Cashflow
Cash generated from operations before taxation was £137.9m 
(2010: £160.6m). T ax paid of £24.9m (2010: £18.8m) comprised 
payments on account in respect of the current year’s liability.  
Net interest paid of £12.1m (2010: £10.7m) is less than the charge 
for the period of £17.5m (2010: £13.3m) but in line when adjusted 
for accrued amounts in respect of the sterling bond. Capital 
expenditure, net of sale proceeds, marginally exceeded last year  
at £55.0m (2010: £54.7m).
Following a decision to alter the proportion of last year’s total 
dividend payable as a final dividend, dividends paid to parent 
company shareholders amounted to £23.8m (2010: £45.7m) 
consisting of 30.0p per share final dividend for 2010 (2010: final 
dividend for 2009 was 55.5p) and 25.5p interim dividend for 2011 
(2010: 51.0p). Dividends to non-controlling interests were £4.8m 
(2010: £6.6m) following the agreed deferment of the year end 
dividend into 2012. 
During the period, the Company repurchased 58,632 of its own 
shares at £0.8m (2010: 26,447 shares at £0.3m) for potential  
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards that may vest in the  
future (and Directors’ bonus plan 2010). No shares were issued 
(2010: 14,000 shares for proceeds of £0.2m).

our b u S 
perfor Mance
Go-Ahead is one of the UK’s leading bus 
operators. We are the largest operator in 
London, with around 21% market share, and 
operate in Oxford, East Anglia and southern, 
south east and north east England. We also 
operate a yellow school bus joint venture in 
North America
Bus services are an essential form of travel in our cities and rural 
areas. For some people, it is their only means of transport and for 
others it is a positive choice because it is cost effective, reliable 
and convenient. Go-Ahead understands what passengers value 
from our services and that is why delivering quality is at the 
forefront of everything we do. Getting that right is why we  
have continued to see growth.
Our core strategy
We are a passenger focused business providing quality services  
in predominantly urban areas across the UK.
While many of the markets in which we operate have common 
features, each has its own unique characteristics. That is why we 
employ locally based management teams who have a thorough 
understanding of their local markets. All of our companies have 
local identities and branding which we believe our passengers 
value. We take an active role in the communities we serve so  
that our companies are part of their local communities. This 
enables our businesses to respond quickly and appropriately  
to changing local needs.
Our aim is to grow our market share of the UK bus industry 
organically and through value adding bolt-on acquisitions, 
particularly outside London, where we believe there is 
considerable growth potential.
While our focus is the UK transport market, we continue  
to look at opportunities overseas. We are now one year into  
the operation of our yellow school bus joint venture in North 
America and we have established ourselves as a reliable and 
credible operator in the market.
The u K bus market
The use of public transport is growing, and within that market,  
the bus is the most frequently used mode of transport in the  
UK. Around 5.2 billion passenger journeys
1
 are made each year  
on UK bus networks. 
Our key achievements for 2011
• Record operating profit
*
 achieved in  
the financial year
• Passenger numbers and passenger 
revenue growth across all deregulated 
operations
• Acquisition of Thames T ravel during  
the year
• Introduction of The Key across more

BUS BUSINESS REv IEW CONTINUED
The l ondon market (Regulated market)
The majority of public transport journeys in London take place 
on the bus, over two billion a year compared with around one 
billion on the London Underground
1
. The short to medium term 
prospects in this market are positive. In its latest business plan, TfL 
stated that mileage in the London bus network would be protected, 
following the Comprehensive Spending Review in October 2010. 
With buses being such a vital form of transport, combined with 
congestion charging and a limited ability to expand the tube 
network, we expect the London bus market to remain very resilient 
in the long term. 
The rest of the u K (Deregulated market)
Bus services outside London are comprised of commercial routes 
and tendered contracts and are run by private operators. The 
short to medium term prospects in this market are good as an 
increasing number of people switch from private car to bus travel. 
We are introducing smartcard technology across our networks 
to make travel even easier and more convenient. We believe this, 
combined with an increased marketing focus, will further enhance 
prospects over the next 12 months.
Our business model
Go-Ahead operates in the UK bus market through nine business 
units: Go-Ahead London, Go North East, Go South Coast, 
Metrobus, Brighton & h ove, Oxford Bus Company, Plymouth 
Citybus, Konectbus and Thames T ravel. 
The Group has around 21% of the London bus market, through 
Go-Ahead London and Metrobus
4
. Its operations in the rest of the 
UK give around a 6% share of the deregulated UK bus market.
Our l ondon operations
Go-Ahead has been a major player in the London bus market 
since the early 1990s. We currently have a market share of around 
21%, operating over 100 bus routes and carrying approximately 
one million passengers a day. 
Our success in the London bus market is the result of our  
strong and experienced management team who are committed  
to running high quality, frequent bus services in the capital; and  
our network of well located freehold depots, through which we 
are able to achieve cost efficiencies. 
The UK bus market is comprised of two models: the London 
market which is regulated by Transport for London (TfL); and  
the rest of the UK which is deregulated and largely operated  
on a fully commercial basis.
The bus market has remained resilient and has indeed grown 
despite the wider economic conditions the UK faces. 
The costs of motoring continue to rise, while bus fares on our 
services continue to offer excellent value. With the “cost gap” 
between car and bus continuing to grow, an increasing number  
of former car users are switching to the bus.
Across our businesses we have seen some pioneering use of social 
media to keep customers informed of service updates in a real 
time environment, particularly useful during the heavy snow in 
January 2011. Customers used sites such as Facebook to check  
which services were running and to add commentary themselves 
to keep other customers updated. Go North East, in particular, was 
commended for its use of social media during this time with the 
number of Facebook fans jumping from 6,000 to 30,000 in just  
two weeks.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and social media are 
areas that we will continue to develop across the Group.

2011 performance overview
The performance of our bus operations was strong, with 
operating profit
*
 at record levels.
Revenue increased by 2.0%, or £12.9m, to £642.4m (2010: 
£629.5m), consisting of £17.6m or 2.8% from acquisitions and a 
decrease of 1.3% due to this year being one week shorter than 
the comparative period. Like-for-like growth was a net 0.4%, with 
growth across the deregulated businesses of 4.1% being offset by 
an expected and previously reported reduction of 2.4% in our 
London operations.
Operating profit was £67.1m, increasing in the year by £3.4m or

Transport for l ondon
All London bus routes are regulated by TfL which issues tenders 
for route contracts. These contracts are typically five years long 
with a potential two year extension based largely on performance. 
They are awarded to private operators on a cost per mile basis.  
TfL contracts are price index adjusted, designed to offset 
inflationary increases in costs. As a result, operators’ profits  
are typically not impacted by inflationary changes.
Quality incentive Contracts
In addition to earning revenue per mile, we also generate 
revenue through good performance. TfL sets performance targets 
called Quality Incentive Contracts (QICs) to incentivise high 
quality service provision. Operators receive cash bonuses when 
targets are met and are penalised if performance falls short. We 
consistently rank highly in TfL performance league tables.
In 2010, our QIC bonus revenue totalled £12.3m, comprised  
of £8.8m earned against QIC1 targets based on punctuality and 
£3.5m through QIC2 targets based on factors such as bus driver 
attitude and bus cleanliness. 
Quality incentive bonuses earned in the financial year just ended 
totalled £8.0m. This decrease is due to two, previously reported 
factors. In March 2010, TfL withdrew QIC2 as a cost saving 
measure, as such all QIC revenue reported for the financial 
year just ended was derived from QIC1. In addition, the ability to 
earn QIC1 bonuses has declined in the period as more challenging 
performance targets have been introduced.
The rest of the u K
We focus our operations in the rest of the UK on dense, urban 
operations where we offer high quality, frequent and convenient 
services that are excellent value. Our locally focused, passenger 
oriented businesses are able to respond swiftly to the individual 
needs of the communities they serve. Our companies set their 
own fares on a commercial basis but work closely with local 
authorities and other stakeholders to provide services to  
meet local demand.

BUS BUSINESS REv IEW CONTINUED
2009/10 acquisitions
East Thames Buses was acquired from Transport for London  
by our Go-Ahead London operation in October 2009. In  
the same month, our Metrobus subsidiary acquired Arriva’s 
h orsham depot which operates a mix of regulated routes  
and deregulated services. 
Plymouth Citybus, a high quality urban business which operates 
from a centrally based freehold depot was acquired by the  
Group in December 2009.
In March 2010, we acquired the entire share capital of Konectbus 
in Norfolk and Go North East acquired the h exham operations 
of Arriva at the same time we sold our Ashington depot to Arriva. 
Deregulated bus operations
All of our operating companies reported continued underlying 
revenue growth, resulting in a revenue increase of 7.4% of which 
acquisitions represented 4.2%, offset by a 1.9% fall due to the 
shorter period with like-for-like growth totalling 5.1%. Passenger 
journeys increased by 4.7%, of which acquisitions represented 4.3%, 
a 1.9% fall due to the shorter period and like-for-like growth was 
2.3%, with the majority of the increase from fare paying passengers. 
Revenue growth trends remained positive in the second half of 
the year with like-for-like growth of 5.0%, marginally below that 
of the first half where like-for-like growth was 5.2%. Like-for-
like passenger numbers also increased in each of our operating 
companies with a total second half increase of 2.8% compared  
to a first half increase of 1.8%.
Operating profit margins in the deregulated bus division have 
increased from 10% last year to 11.6%.
We believe understanding our customers is a key driver to our 
business, as is providing a safe and reliable service. During the year 
our deregulated services saw punctuality at 90% (2010: 90%) with 
some operating companies achieving higher than 95%, despite the 
adverse weather conditions in the early part of this calendar year.
performance, excluding acquisitions, remained strong. Revenue 
growth was achieved in each of our deregulated businesses. 
Regulated revenue has reduced by £4.6m, of which £3.5m relates 
to QIC2 which was withdrawn in this financial year. We have 
maintained a strong discipline in cost control and this remains 
a priority with initiatives focusing on both procurement and 
scheduling efficiency. 
We continue to use around 115 million litres of fuel each year 
and have hedged all of our expected fuel requirements at 41p per 
litre (ppl) compared with an average price of 47ppl in 2010. The 
total fuel rebate provided through BSOG was 42 ppl, in addition 
to which we received an additional 8%, or 2ppl, in our deregulated 
businesses for the introduction of ITSO Smartcard technology. 
Our local management remain responsible for local wage 
negotiations to ensure that we continue to pay market rates  
and match reward with ongoing productivity improvements. The 
2011 year costs included £5.2m of pension costs (£2010: £5.4m). 
T otal depreciation for the division was £38.1m (2010: £35.5m) 
and net capital expenditure was £35.7m (2010: £39.6m). The 
average age of our deregulated fleet remains one of the youngest 
in the sector.
Acquisitions
This year has seen continued benefits from acquisitions made 
during 2010 in the regulated and deregulated businesses and they 
are included within acquisitions data until the first anniversary of 
each entity becoming part of the Group. Subsequent to this point 
their results are deemed to be like-for-like. 
2010/11 acquisition
On 24 May 2011 we purchased the entire share capital of Thames 
Travel, a high quality operator based in Oxfordshire. With annual 
turnover of around £5.5m Thames Travel will be run as a stand-alone 
operation overseen by management at Oxford Bus Company.

Operating margins have decreased from 10.2% last year to 9.5% 
largely due to reductions in QIC bonuses.
n orth American joint venture
In August 2010 our 50:50 North America joint venture with 
Cook Illinois began two contracts in St Louis, Missouri to run 
approximately 120 buses. Our investment in the joint venture is 
through a combination of debt and equity and totals US$6.2m 
(£3.9m) provided through a US$10m revolving credit facility  
held in the UK. Whilst the result for the year was a break even 
position we believe we have a good foundation for profitability  
on these contracts going forward. While the 2011 tendering round 
has not secured new work for the joint venture, we will use the 
experience we have gained in the 2012 tendering round. 
Outlook
We anticipate that the performance of our bus divisions will 
remain strong into the next financial year. In our deregulated 
business, retaining customers who have switched from private 
cars will be a priority, together with further growth in passenger 
numbers. Our regulated operations have started the year well 
with new contract wins and no losses. We will work to maintain 
our high rankings in TfL league tables.
In May 2011, the Competition Commission issued its provisional 
findings and notice of proposed remedies in response to its 
inquiry into the UK local bus market. No fundamental change  
to the regulatory structure of the bus industry is currently  
being proposed.
In April 2012 the 20% reduction in BSOG will be enacted. This 
will result in a financial impact in the year to 30 June 2012 of 
around £1.6m, as the reduction in the grant will be partly offset 
by a smartcard subsidy of 8%. T o mitigate these reductions going 
forward, contract tender bids in London will be adjusted and 
deregulated operations will introduce efficiency improvements  
and yield benefits to offset the reduced subsidy. 
We anticipate that the strong demand for our services will 
continue and we continue to seek opportunities to develop  
our business organically and acquisitively.
Regulated bus operations
Our regulated bus operations in London performed well. Reduced 
QICs and lower contract margins were largely offset by effective 
cost control. Revenue declined by 1.3% in the year, acquisitions 
represented 1.8%, a 0.8% fall due to the shorter period, which 
leaves a like-for-like reduction of 2.3%. Contracted mileage was 
marginally behind 2010, declining by 0.8% to 72.2 million miles, of 
which an increase of 1.6% came from acquisitions, a 1.8% fall due 
to the shorter period resulting in a like-for-like decrease of 0.6%.
QIC bonuses reduced to £8.0m (2010: £12.3m), of this reduction 
£3.5m was from QIC2 incentives for driver quality and bus 
incentives which were withdrawn by TfL during the previous year. 
Our strong performance means we continue to earn QICs where 
available and continue to perform well in the TfL quality league 
tables, operating in excess of 99.6% of our target mileage before 
traffic congestion losses (2010: 99.5%).
Revenue trends were in line with our expectations with negative 
growth in the second half of 0.3% compared to a first half 
reduction of 4.9%. 
Our ability to tender effectively is supported by our depot 
capacity in London: 85% of our depots are freehold, which provide 
a strong base for contract renewals as this reduces factors such as 
dead mileage (the distance travelled between the beginning/end 
of a route and the depot). During 2011, we retained contracts for 
270 peak vehicle requirements (Pv R), won new work for 137 Pv R 
and lost 47 Pv R. 2011/12 has started positively on both contract 
wins and retentions with no losses to date.
The decommissioning of articulated buses by TfL, that was 
announced in 2010, has been confirmed and all of these vehicles 
will be removed from service by September 2011. Certain 
routes have been retendered and re-awarded to us using double 
deck vehicles. We have continued the process of accelerating 
the depreciation on these vehicles to a nil residual value with an 
exceptional charge for the year of £3.0m (2010: £2.6m). We are 
seeking opportunities to utilise these vehicles elsewhere in  
the Group.

o ur rail 
perfor Mance
Go-Ahead is the UKs busiest rail operator, 
carrying the majority of rail passengers in 
and out of London on its three franchises: 
Southern, Southeastern and London 
Midland. In the UK, around 30% of all train 
journeys are made on our services 
Our core strategy
We are a passenger focused business providing frequent and 
reliable services through intensive urban commuter rail franchises 
in the UK. 
Operationally, our aim is to continue improving services to ensure 
the needs of our passengers are met. We also aim to create 
greater shareholder value through our rail businesses and support 
the role of the Rail Development Group in working to shape the 
future of rail franchising.
The u K rail market
Public transport is becoming a bigger part of people’s daily 
lives in the UK. Millions of people each year rely on the UK’s 
comprehensive rail network to travel for business and leisure. 
Latest industry figures show that in 2010 around 1.3 billion train 
journeys were made on the UK rail network
1
. 
The UK rail industry is regulated by the Department for Transport 
(DfT) and rail services are operated within franchises run by 
individual train operating companies (TOCs). There are currently 
19 franchises, operated by nine transport providers. 
The market is competitive and, with an increasing number of 
operators entering the market margins remain low. Profit margins 
below 5% are not untypical in the current market. 
The rail industry is driven by GDP and employment and, as such, 
the testing economic conditions have presented challenges. TOCs 
have seen volatility of earnings due to the nature of the current 
franchising model requiring franchise bids to be submitted on the 
basis of economic forecasts years into the future. 
Throughout the economic downturn, it has become evident  
that short-distance commuter routes, such as those that we 
operate, have been more resilient than long-distance inter-city 
routes as only a small proportion of revenue is derived from 
discretionary spending. 
Our key achievements for 2011
• Passenger number and passenger 
revenue growth across all three 
franchises
• Southeastern franchise extended until  
at least March 2014
• Franchise bid submitted for the Greater 
Anglia Rail Franchise. The outcome is 
due to be announced in autumn 2011. 
• Award winning marketing campaign in 
London Midland and record passenger 
satisfaction scores in Southeastern 1 Association of Train Operating Companies, July 2011. The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 44
RAIL BUSINESS REv IEW CONTINUED
Department for T ransport 
All UK rail services are regulated by the DfT which issues franchise 
tenders for which private operators bid. Currently, franchises 
typically last for around eight years and are awarded to operators 
on a largely financial basis. Operators submit detailed franchise 
bids which ultimately specify the level of premium the operator 
will pay to the DfT or the level of subsidy it will require from the 
DfT for operating the franchise. Franchises are highly specified by 
the DfT who provide detailed conditions in franchise agreements 
which the successful bidder must adhere to.
The current franchise model does not allow sufficient flexibility to 
respond to changing market conditions and passenger needs. For 
some time we have been working closely with the DfT to move 
towards a more flexible model that will result in a more efficient 
railway that better meets the requirements of passengers and 
shareholders alike.
Revenue risk 
The majority of UK rail franchises have a revenue share  
and support mechanism under the current structure, as  
detailed below:
r evenue share operates from the start of a franchise. If the 
franchise exceeds revenue expectations set out in the bid a 
defined proportion of the excess is paid to the DfT. If actual 
revenue is between 2% and 6% above bid revenue, 50% of the 
excess is paid to the DfT. If actual revenue is more than 6% above 
The future of u K rail 
The findings of Sir Roy McNulty’s value-for-money study of the 
UK rail industry, released in May 2011, demonstrate that changes 
across the industry could result in a more efficient rail transport 
system. Go-Ahead acknowledges that improving value for money, 
through the implementation of the study’s recommendations,  
is necessary for the industry. 
We believe there is great strength in the longer term prospects 
of the rail industry. The recent value-for-money study identified 
inefficiencies and detailed recommendations for change.  
We acknowledge the need for change in the industry and  
are committed to working with the Government and key  
organisations within the rail industry to bring these changes about. 
Our business model
Go-Ahead currently operates in the UK rail market through  
Govia, a 65% owned joint venture with Keolis. We run three 
franchises: Southern, Southeastern and London Midland, which 
typically operate busy commuter services. We currently carry 
around 30% of rail passengers in the UK and generate 20% of 
total industry revenue. 
During the year London Midland has driven off-peak sales through its  
“The Great Escape” campaign; an off-peak travel promotion around 
school half-term holiday periods, enabling passengers to travel anywhere 
on the network for just £10 a day. London Midland undertook vast 
market research to increase understanding of the key drivers behind 
leisure travel and used eye-catching posters, a series of radio adverts,  
and innovative use of web and social media channels to promote the offer.  
“The Great Escape”, which has helped drive passenger growth in London 
Midland, won the Rail Professional Marketing Campaign of the year at the 
2011 Rail Business Awards.

Tracks & Trains 
Under the current structure TOCs are not responsible for 
rail infrastructure or rolling stock. Infrastructure is owned and 
managed by Network Rail and TOCs pay for the right to use it, 
such as track access fees. Rolling stock is typically leased from 
leasing companies for the duration of a franchise. 
Ticketing & Fares
The DfT regulates peak-time weekday fares (i.e commuter based 
fares), determining the annual January movement in fares through 
a standard formula. Until January 2011 this formula was typically 
Retail Price Index (RPI), from the previous July, plus 1% (RPI + 1%). 
h owever, it was announced in October 2010 that with effect from 
January 2012 the standard formula would change to RPI + 3%, the 
formula currently used to determine fare levels in our Southeastern 
franchise. Regulated passenger revenue increases are factored into 
bid assumptions, effectively these increases form part of the subsidy 
reduction or premium increase built into the franchise contract with 
DfT and generally do not benefit the operators directly.
In August 2011, the Government announced that the July 2011 
RPI, which will apply to January 2012 fare increases, was 5.0%. 
Franchise subsidy/premium profiles are adjusted for inflation  
and, as a result, the profits of TOCs do not typically benefit from  
inflationary changes. 
2011 performance overview
The operating profit
*
 from our rail division was in line with  
our expectations and significantly ahead of last year, benefiting 
from a continuous shift away from car usage, innovative  
marketing, rigorous cost control and procurement and  
contract management benefits.
T otal revenue increased by 7.6% or £116.8m, to £1,654.6m 
(2010: £1,537.8m), with all three franchises showing passenger 
revenue growth in excess of 8% on a like-for-like basis. In total, 
passenger revenue increased by £80.4m, or 6.5%, to £1,315.8m 
(2010: £1,235.4m), on a like-for-like basis this was £103.5m or 
8.5%, the difference being the additional week in the prior year. 
Other revenue increased by £2.4m, or 2.3% to £105.4m (2010: 
£103.0m) and DfT subsidy increased by £34.0m or 17.1% to 
£233.4m (2010: £199.4m). The increase in DfT subsidy primarily 
reflects higher receipts in respect of high speed services in 
Southeastern amounting to £53.1m. This was offset by additional 
access charges and running costs for this service and reductions 
in underlying subsidy in Southeastern and London Midland. In 
addition, but included in operating costs, are DfT premia payable 
by Southern of £54.2m (2010: £12.8m).
Operating profit
*
 increased by £10.7m or 28.7%, to £48.0m  
(2010: £37.3m) reflecting increased passenger revenue from off-
peak services, and stringent cost controls in each of the franchises 
and significant contract management benefits. Operating profit 
margin increased by 0.5% to 2.9% (2010: 2.4%). 
T otal depreciation for the rail division was £11.1m (2010: £14.4m). 
Net capital expenditure was £18.4m (2010 £18.2m), the majority 
of which represented franchise commitments in Southern and 
London Midland.
bid revenue, 80% of any excess above 6% is paid to the DfT in 
addition to 50% of the excess between 2% and 6%. One hundred 
percent of revenue generated between bid revenue and 2% is 
retained by the operator.
r evenue support operates from the start of the fifth year of a 
franchise. It is designed to provide significant mitigation for any 
revenue shortfall in the later part of the franchise. The mechanism 
is similar to that for revenue share, but in reverse. If actual revenue 
is between 2% and 6% below bid revenue, 50% of the shortfall is 
received from the DfT. If actual revenue is more than 6% below 
bid revenue, 80% of any shortfall is above 6% is received from the 
DfT in addition to 50% if the shortfall is between 2% and 6%. One 
hundred percent of revenue generated between bid revenue and 
2% is retained by the operator. 
The franchise models of Go-Ahead’s three TOCs include these 
mechanisms. Currently, Southeastern is receiving revenue support 
at 80%. Four of the six UK rail franchises eligible for revenue 
support currently receive it. 
All our operations are committed to 
delivering a high quality of service. 
Southern’s service quality management 
approach, which assesses train and station 
presentation and customer service, has been 
audited over 2,000 times and is continually 
reviewed and improved. During the year, 
Southern’s stakeholder management board 
launched a ‘Stars and Tsars’ service quality 
award to further engage staff. Since its 
introduction, service quality scores have 
increased by an average of 16% across 
Southern’s stations.

Costs in this franchise remain complicated by legacy issues and  
will continue above bid assumptions. h owever, this will continue to 
be an area of focus as we try to restore margins in the franchise.
Outlook
While the outlook for rail remains difficult to predict, we are 
convinced of the strengths of the rail industry and are  
well positioned for future franchise bids.
Current developments in marketing campaigns, online sales 
and customer relationship management have proven invaluable, 
principally in Southern and London Midland and we will be 
pursuing these initiatives to maintain growth momentum. 
Our Southern franchise continues to deliver strong sales growth 
and we anticipate that it will perform broadly in line with the 
financial assumptions in the bid into the next financial years.
In Southeastern, we expect to remain in 80% revenue support 
until the end of the franchise, which is now confirmed as March 
2014 at the earliest. Strong cost control in this franchise is key  
to remaining profitable in the future.
In London Midland, we will maintain our approach of driving 
revenue through online sales and our successful marketing 
campaigns, principally for off-peak fares, as well as focusing on cost 
control measures. London Midland becomes eligible for revenue 
support in November 2011 and may require this at the 50% level. 
Overall, we are assuming a small reduction in operating profit
*
 
margin next year compared to this financial year, largely due to  
the £13m non-recurring contract management benefits achieved 
in the year just ended. 
On 21 July 2011 we submitted our bid for the Greater Anglia Rail 
Franchise and keenly await the outcome of DfT considerations,  
due to be published before November 2011.
The Government review of the future of rail franchising is  
still underway, and the fundamentals of how rail franchising will 
operate should become clearer ahead of the rebidding timetable 
for our incumbent franchises.
arrived on time and the spring National Passenger Survey customer 
satisfaction rating was 82% (2010: 84%). Both were impacted by the 
adverse weather disruption earlier in the year. 
As this franchise was bid for in 2009 in full anticipation of the 
economic downturn we continue to achieve passenger revenue 
slightly above the bid submission. 
Southeastern
h aving successfully completed a continuation review period 
in December 2010 we were awarded an extension to the 
Southeastern franchise that will now see the franchise retained 
within the Group until at least 31 March 2014. 
T otal revenue in Southeastern consisted of passenger revenue 
of £541.7m (2010: £509.3m), other income of £22.3m (2010: 
£20.0m) and net subsidy receipts of £151.8m (2010: £98.4m). 
The like-for-like increase in full year passenger revenue was  
8.4% (2010: 7.5%), consisting of a first half increase of 12.0%  
and a second half increase of 5.5%. Passenger numbers increased 
by 5.0% (2010: 1.4%) compared to last year, with a second half 
increase of 4.7% slightly lower than the first half growth of 5.6%. 
The continued growth of the high speed service is a strong 
contributor to this growth. The difference between passenger 
revenue and passenger numbers partly reflects the RPI + 3%  
fare regime in this franchise, and partly the premium fare  
charged in respect of Southeastern’s high speed services.
Southeastern became entitled to revenue support from  
1 April 2010. Revenue support is provided by the DfT based 
on projections of the relevant revenue amounts for the rail year 
ended each March compared to bid. As Southeastern is operating 
at around 90% of bid revenue the DFT provides 50% support 
between 98% and 94% and 80% support for any shortfall below 
94%. Revenue support in the year was £22.6m (2010: £6.6m).
Southeastern particularly benefited from procurement and 
contract management benefits this year. This and the cost savings 
through staff reductions last year have ensured that the company 
is in good shape for the remainder of the franchise. 
Our operational performance in Southeastern remained strong, 
with a PPM of 89.0% (2010: 89.2%) of our trains arriving on time 
and the spring National Passenger Survey customer satisfaction 
rating improved to 82% (2010: 81%). 
l ondon Midland
T otal revenue in London Midland consisted of passenger revenue 
of £204.2m (2010: £191.2m), other income of £39.9m (2010: 
£36.9m) and net subsidy receipts of £81.2m (2010: £96.7m).
Like-for-like passenger revenue growth was 8.6% (2010: 10.0%) 
with first half growth at 7.1% and second half growth of 9.9%. 
Passenger numbers increased by 7.2% on a like-for-like basis 
(2010: 4.6%) for the full year, consisting of a first half year increase 
of 4.3% followed by 10.1% for the second half. This second half in 
particular benefited from award winning marketing campaigns.
The operational performance of our London Midland franchise 
remains resilient and we achieved a PPM of 89.7% (2010: 90.4%) 
and a customer satisfaction rating of 83% (2010: 86%) for the 
period, despite industrial action in the second half of the year. * Before amortisation and exceptional items. The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 48

CORPORATE GOv ERNANCE
fully 
co MMitted 
to high 
Standard S Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Corporate 
Governance Report for 2011.
Corporate Governance
Throughout the year, the Board has continued to be committed to 
maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and we 
welcome the new UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
which applies to Go-Ahead in full for this financial year. We believe 
that good governance is integral to the way our business is run 
and it is this commitment that has been a positive contributing 
factor to the effectiveness of the Board during the year. 
The Code emphasises the Board’s responsibility for providing  
the leadership necessary to promote the success of the Company 
within the context of an effective framework of accountability, 
oversight and risk mitigation. As Chairman, I am conscious that  
it is my responsibility to provide leadership to the Board in order 
to ensure its effectiveness and to oversee the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy. In this regard, I am mindful of the importance  
of encouraging the productive engagement of all Board members 
so as to enable all Directors to work in unison within a culture  
of openness and debate.
In this statement, I identify how we apply the Code’s principles 
relating to the role and effectiveness of the Board. 
Board composition
The Board aims to have a diversity of skills, experience, length 
of service, knowledge and gender. We welcome the publication 
of the Davies Review on “Women on Boards”. The benefits of 
greater Board diversity, not just gender specific, are clear and this 
is a positive step forward.

BOARD Ch ANGES Corporate Governance
www.go-ahead.com 57
The Board’s aspiration has always been, and will continue to be, 
to maintain a high level of diversity. Our Nomination Committee 
carries out its search for candidates from the widest possible pool 
of talent against a set of objective criteria on the basis of merit, 
with due regard to the benefits of diversity on the Board.
Following Katherine Innes Ker’s appointment in July 2010, our 
Board has 17% female representation. Including our Group 
Company Secretary Carolyn Sephton, who was appointed in  
July 2006, our Board has 28% female representation. The Board 
will aspire to maintain at least this level of diversity of gender  
going forward, however, our foremost priority is to ensure that  
Go-Ahead continues to have the strongest possible leadership, 
and we will appoint only the most appropriate candidates. 
As a Board, we will consider our response to any changes to 
the UK Corporate Governance Code arising from the Financial 
Reporting Council’s recent consultation document “Gender 
Diversity on Boards”.
Board changes
During this year we announced two Board changes. Our  
Group Chief Executive, Keith Ludeman, retired on 2 July 2011. h is 
replacement, David Brown, joined us as Deputy Chief Executive  
on 1 April 2011, allowing a smooth and organised handover of 
duties on 3 July when he became Group Chief Executive. On  
7 March 2011, Keith Down replaced Nick Swift as Group  
Finance Director.
We acknowledge that it is never ideal to have the two most senior 
executives leave at around the same time, but I am pleased that 
our succession planning process was efficient and effective. We 
have made two excellent external appointments that maintain the 
strength of our Board, providing a continuation of the leadership 
necessary to promote the success of the Company for the long 
term value of shareholders.
Our devolved structure 
We believe that our devolved management structure, as illustrated 
below, enables the Group to be managed in a particularly effective 
way. Local management throughout the Group are empowered 
to operate our companies as autonomous business units, whilst 
working together to share experience and expertise around the 
Group. For example, many aspects of the Group’s day-to-day 
operations report through operating company senior management 
directly into the Board through the Group Chief Executive and  
the Group Finance Director (the “Executive Directors”):
• The Executive Directors sit on the board of each operating 
company and meet formally with local senior management  
each month. 
• The Executive Directors hold regular meetings with the 
managing directors of all of the operating companies (the “Chief 
Executive Group”) to facilitate the sharing of experience and 
best practice across operations. 
• The Executive Directors meet on a monthly basis with the 
senior managers who are responsible for the key centralised 
Group functions (the “Executive Team Group”), which includes 
finance, technology, procurement, engineering, properties, 
development, company secretarial, pensions, legal and  
corporate affairs. 
In addition, there are a number of Group forums that are held 
on a regular basis and which consider finance, engineering, health 
& safety and energy matters. These key forums, which report 
directly to the Executive Directors, enable representatives from 
all operating companies to share best and emerging practice, to 
seek synergies and cost savings, to improve quality and to achieve 
economies of scale wherever possible. 
Our devolved management structure enables the Board to be 
well informed about our businesses, employees, passengers and 
stakeholders. This in turn means that we are able to respond to 
the changing dynamics of the businesses in which we operate  
in a timely and knowledgeable manner.

CORPORATE GOv ERNANCE CONTINUED
Corporate responsibility
Corporate responsibility is deeply embedded across all aspects 
of our organisation. T o ensure that corporate responsibility is 
prioritised across the business, internal safety and energy targets 
for each of our operating companies are set at the beginning of 
each financial year. Progress against these targets is linked to both 
operating company senior managers’ and Executive Directors’ 
remuneration. In addition, a health and safety audit of each of  
our businesses is undertaken by an external consultant each year.
The Board is ultimately responsible for corporate responsibility 
across the Group. As such, we do not have corporate 
responsibility or health and safety committees at Board level 
as we believe that all Board members should be involved in 
these fundamental areas that are central to our business. The 
Group’s flat structure provides the Board with good visibility 
of performance at each operating company. Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) are closely monitored and are reviewed every 
month at operating company board meetings, chaired by the 
Executive Directors. 
Compliance with the u K Corporate Governance Code 
Throughout the year ended 2 July 2011, the Company 
complied with the main and supporting principles and 
provisions set out in Section 1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) save in respect of the 
following provision:
• The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Andrew Allner,  
was unable to attend the Company’s 2010 AGM due  
to an injury. This resulted in partial non-compliance with  
code provision E.2.3. 
A copy of the Code published in June 2010 is  
available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website  
(www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm). 
Applying the principles of good governance 
The Board of Directors
At the year ending 2 July 2011, the Board comprised the Chairman, 
three Non-Executive Directors and three Executive Directors. A full 
list of the Directors with details of their biographies and Committee 
membership is given on pages 52 and 53. 
All Directors were members of the Board throughout the  
financial year with the exception of Nick Swift who resigned on  
7 March 2011, Keith Down who was appointed on 7 March 2011 
and David Brown who was appointed on 1 April 2011.
Following Keith Ludeman’s retirement on 2 July 2011, the Board 
now consists of two Executive Directors, David Brown having 
assumed the role of Group Chief Executive on 3 July 2011. 
Board meetings
The Board normally meets at least seven times during the  
year. At least one of the meetings each year is dedicated to 
reviewing the Group’s strategy. Additional meetings are held 
as and when required. The Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors periodically meet without the Executive Directors  
being present. During the year, the Chairman met individually  
with each Director. 
During the year ended 2 July 2011, the Board held nine scheduled 
meetings. The table on page 60 shows Directors’ attendance 
at scheduled meetings they were eligible to attend. The agenda 
for each Board meeting is set by the Chairman, in consultation 
with the Group Chief Executive and Group Company Secretary. 
Detailed briefing papers in relation to the business to be 
conducted at each meeting are circulated to the Board at least 
one week before each meeting. Individual Board members have 
direct access to the Executive Directors and the Group Company 
Secretary should they wish to receive additional information.

Board meetings are structured to allow open discussion and 
debate and the Chairman ensures that adequate time is available 
for discussion of all agenda items, in particular strategic issues. 
Key senior managers and advisers attend relevant parts of Board 
meetings on a regular basis to ensure that the Board is properly 
informed about the current issues facing the business. Minutes  
of all meetings are circulated promptly afterwards. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for 
decision, the main terms of which are shown below. The Board has 
also delegated specific responsibilities to the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees, each of which has terms of 
reference which detail their authority and duties. While the Board 
delegates some of its responsibilities to these Committees, it still 
retains full responsibility for a number of key areas such as health 
& safety, corporate social responsibility and risk management. 
The Board feels that it is fundamental that the Board as a whole 
is involved in decision making in these areas and this “hands-on” 
approach has served the business well over previous years. 
The Board has established robust procedures for ensuring that 
their powers to authorise conflicts are operated in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association. The Board considers 
that the Directors’ powers of authorisation of conflicts have 
operated effectively during the year and the procedures in 
place have been properly followed. The Board is aware of the 
other commitments of its Directors and any changes to these 
commitments are reported to the Board.
Responsibility for the operation of Group companies, 
implementing strategy in accordance with that agreed by the 
Board and achievement of objectives, is delegated to the Executive 
Directors. The Executive Directors meet regularly with the senior 
management and staff in the Group’s operating companies, both 
formally via the monthly board meetings, and less formally on  
a regular basis.
Schedule of matters reserved for the Board
1   Approval of the Group’s strategy, objectives, values and 
overall governance framework.
2   Approval of the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, Turnbull Statement and 
h alf year Repor ts.
3  Approval of any interim dividend and recommendation  
of the final dividend.
4  Approval of the Notice of Annual General Meeting and 
the resolutions to shareholders therein, including the 
recommendation for the appointment, re-appointment  
or removal of the Auditors.
5   Approval of all other circulars, listing particulars, and 
corresponding documentation sent to shareholders.
6   Approval of any changes to the Company’s constitutional 
documentation.
7   Approval of the Group’s financial, taxation and treasury 
management policies, dividend policy, long term financing, 
annual budget and operating plans.
8  Approval of material capital projects, investments, 
acquisitions, franchises and disposals.
9  Approval of any significant change in accounting, tax or 
treasury management policies or practices.
10   Approval of changes in the capital structure of the Company 
or its status as a public limited company listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and, in particular, the issue or 
allotment of shares in the Company otherwise than pursuant 
to Company-approved employee share schemes and share 
buyback programmes.
11  Responsibility for the appointment, re-appointment 
and removal of the Chairman and Directors and the 
recommendation to shareholders of their election  
or re-election under the Articles of Association; the 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary; ensuring 
that suitable procedures are in place for succession planning 
and the fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors.
12   Regular review and approval of the Board Procedures 
Manual, the division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive and this Schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board.
13  Responsibility for establishing Committees of the Board, 
approving their terms of reference, regularly reviewing their 
activities and, where appropriate, ratifying decisions.
14 Approval of all minutes of Board and Committee meetings.
15  Responsibility for oversight of internal control, risk 
management, health & safety matters and corporate  
social responsibility. The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 60
CORPORATE GOv ERNANCE CONTINUED
Board balance and independence
The Board regularly considers whether the Executive and Non-Executive Directors together have the range of skills, knowledge and 
experience to enable them to promote shareholders’ interests and govern the business effectively. Excluding the Chairman, more than 
half of the Board are Non-Executive Directors who bring a wide range of experience and objectivity to the Boardroom. The Executive 
Directors bring additional perspective to the Board’s work through a deep understanding of the Group’s business. The balance of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors as at the date of this Report and their length of tenure are shown in the charts below. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Chairman was considered independent on his appointment and the 
Board considers all of the Non-Executive Directors to be robustly independent in character and judgement. Since Rupert Pennant-Rea 
will have served on the Board for nine years in October 2011, the Board has concluded that Rupert must then be considered as  
not independent. The Nomination Committee has therefore commenced a selection process to appoint a new independent  
Non-Executive Director.
The Board regularly assesses the other commitments of its Non-Executive Directors and is satisfied that there are no conflicts of duties 
and that the Non-Executive Directors have sufficient time to fulfil their responsibilities to shareholders.

CORPORATE GOv ERNANCE CONTINUED
It is important that the Board ensures planned and progressive 
refreshing of the Board and the balance of experience of the 
Non-Executive Directors, in terms of their length of tenure,  
is shown on page 60. 
Group Company Secretary
Carolyn Sephton has been Group Company Secretary since 
July 2006. h er biography can be found on page 53. The Group 
Company Secretary reports to the Chairman in her role as 
Secretary to the Board and its Committees. For all other company 
secretariat matters, including the management of the Group’s  
non-rail pension arrangements, she reports to the Group  
Finance Director. 
Under the direction of the Chairman, the Group Company 
Secretary is responsible for ensuring good information flows 
within the Board and its Committees and between senior 
management and Non-Executive Directors, as well as facilitating 
the induction of new Directors and assisting with any Director 
training and development needs as required.
The Group Company Secretary’s responsibilities also include 
ensuring that Board procedures are complied with and that the 
Board is regularly updated on all matters of corporate governance, 
legislative changes and regulatory regimes affecting the Group. The 
appointment and removal of the Group Company Secretary is a 
matter for the Board as a whole.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Group 
Company Secretary and may also take independent professional 
advice, at the Group’s expense, if they believe it necessary, for the 
proper discharge of their duties as Directors.
information and professional development 
The Board is supplied with any such information to enable it to 
discharge its duties effectively. A comprehensive Board Procedures 
Manual is maintained which includes formal procedures for the 
working of the Board and its Committees, delegated authorities, 
the timely provision of appropriate information and the duties  
and responsibilities of Directors, including standards of conduct 
and compliance. 
The Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to update their 
skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Company in order 
to competently carry out their responsibility to Go-Ahead’s 
shareholders. In addition to Board and Committee meeting 
attendance, the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors 
attend the Group’s annual Senior Management Conference each 
year, enabling them to review and discuss the Group’s strategy 
with senior managers from across the Group. The Chairman 
attends most meetings of the Chief Executive Group.
Appointments to the Board
The appointment of new Directors to the Board is based on 
merit and against objective criteria, with due regard to the benefits 
of diversity, including gender. This approach was adopted for the 
appointment of the new Group Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director and further information on this and the process 
undertaken is described in the Nomination Committee’s Report 
on page 67. 
David Brown was appointed as Deputy Group Chief Executive on 
1 April 2011 to succeed Keith Ludeman as Group Chief Executive 
on 3 July 2011. David is a member of the Nomination Committee 
and regularly attends Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee meetings by invitation. David brings a wealth of 
experience to the Board with more than 28 years of working 
in the transport industry. David is returning to the Group after 
serving as Chief Executive of the Group’s London bus division 
between 2003 and 2006. The Board recommends unanimously 
to shareholders that David Brown is elected as Group Chief 
Executive at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Keith Down was appointed as Group Finance Director on  
7 March 2011. Keith replaced Nick Swift, who left on the same date. 
Keith regularly attends Audit Committee meetings by invitation. 
Keith brings a wealth of skills and experience to the Board 
combined with a sharp focus on the interests of shareholders. h is 
experience in businesses with a strong consumer angle alongside 
complex logistics will prove an invaluable contribution to the 
Board. The Board recommends unanimously to shareholders that 
Keith Down is elected as Group Finance Director at the 2011 
Annual General Meeting.
The Chairman has overall responsibility for ensuring that a full 
induction and training programme is provided on appointment 
and that all Directors continually update their skills and knowledge. 
David Brown and Keith Down have received a full and tailored 
induction including visiting all operating companies to meet with 
local senior management, meeting with key Group personnel 
and advisers and receiving briefings on the Group’s strategy, its 
organisational structure, its business and the markets and industry 
within which it operates. 
The Board is confident that all its Directors have the knowledge, 
ability and experience to perform the functions required of  
a director of a listed company.
Re-election of Directors
At the 2011 Annual General Meeting, in addition to shareholders 
being asked to elect David Brown and Keith Down to the Board 
for the first time, Sir Patrick Brown, Rupert Pennant-Rea, Andrew 
Allner and Katherine Innes Ker will all be offering themselves for 
annual re-election. The Board’s annual performance evaluation has 
confirmed that each Director standing for re-election continues to 
contribute effectively and demonstrates commitment to the role.
Sir Patrick Brown joined the Board in 1999 as a Non-Executive 
Director and became Non-Executive Chairman in 2002. h e 
is Chairman of the Nomination Committee, a member of the 
Remuneration Committee and regularly attends the Audit 
Committee by invitation. The Board recognises his industry-wide 
experience and long-standing contribution to the Board and 
unanimously recommends that he should be re-elected for  
a further year.
Rupert Pennant-Rea became a Non-Executive Director of the 
Board in 2002. h e was appointed Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director in 2008 and is Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee as well as a member of the Audit and Nomination 
Committees. Rupert is well known to investors and financial  Corporate Governance

professionals and available to shareholders in his role as Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director. While Rupert will have served 
on the Board for nine years in October 2011, it is the Board’s view 
that Rupert’s longer standing knowledge of the Company will be 
essential in providing continuity and support following the recent 
changes to the executive team. The Board therefore recommends 
unanimously his re-election for a further year. 
Andrew Allner became a Non-Executive Director of the Board 
in 2008 and is Chairman of the Audit Committee and a member 
of the Remuneration and Nomination Committees. Andrew has 
extensive public company board experience in both Executive 
and Non-Executive positions. h e has a sound and robust 
financial background and is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants in England and Wales. The Board recommends 
unanimously Andrew Allner’s re-election for a further year.
Katherine innes Ker became a Non-Executive Director in 2010 
and is a member of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees. Katherine has significant Executive and Non-
Executive experience of helping to grow successful and dynamic 
organisations and has considerable experience as a financial 
analyst, qualifying her to make an effective contribution to the 
Board. The Board recommends unanimously the re-election  
of Katherine Innes Ker for a further year.
Further details of each Director can be found in the Directors’ 
biographies on pages 52 and 53.
Performance evaluation 
The Board is subject to an annual performance review. In light 
of the recent changes to the Board’s composition, it was not 
considered appropriate to undertake an external performance 
evaluation this year. The Board concluded that a review would 
be undertaken by the Group Company Secretary. This was on 
the basis that the Group Company Secretary was well placed 
to devise questions that were relevant and appropriate to the 
Group and that, having attended Board and Committee meetings 
throughout the year, would understand and be able to ensure  
a full and frank discussion around any concerns raised. 
The review this year focused on a number of key areas 
including Board dynamics and effectiveness, Board composition 
and succession planning, development of strategy and risk 
management, the nature and level of the Board’s interaction  
with the Group’s senior management and corporate governance. 
As part of this process, those Directors who had served on the 
Board for a period in excess of six years were subject to  
a particularly rigorous review.
The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, met without the Chairman being present 
to appraise his performance during the year. The performance 
evaluation of the Chairman took into account the views of the 
Executive Directors. 
The evaluation process did not highlight any areas of material 
concern. The overall conclusion was that the Board continued to 
work well and operated effectively in an environment where there 
was constructive challenge and time commitment from the Non-
Executive Directors. Areas of strength identified were in relation 
to the size and composition of the Board and the timely provision 
and appropriateness of information which allowed for optimum 
focus at Board meetings. The search and appointment process 
for the recent Executive Director appointments had been robust 
and successful, with the new Directors receiving a full and tailored 
induction upon joining the Board. The Board also concluded that 
its Committees had operated particularly effectively during  
the year. 
Some changes in Board practice will, however, be implemented  
as a result of the evaluation process. These include increasing  
the interaction between the Board and senior management,  
the continued development of risk management processes  
and reporting and the role of the Board in contributing to  
the development of strategy and the overall effectiveness  
of the Group. 
The Board will continue to review its procedures, effectiveness 
and development in the year ahead and anticipates using an 
external adviser for its 2012 review.
Relations with shareholders
The Group recognises the importance of regular communication 
with all of its shareholders and is committed to maintaining an 
active dialogue with investors throughout the year on the Group’s 
strategy, objectives and governance. The reporting calendar is 
dominated by the publication of the annual and half year results 
each year. In addition, the interim management and trading 
statements provide shareholders with a balanced and regular 
understanding of the Group’s operational performance,  
its financial results and prospects.

BOARD MEETING
QUESTIONNAIRE The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 64
CORPORATE GOv ERNANCE CONTINUED
The Executive Directors meet with the Group’s major 
shareholders (both institutional investors and private shareholders 
with significant holdings) after the announcement of annual and 
half year results and at other times as appropriate, including 
conference calls, site visits and management presentations.
The institutional shareholders have further opportunities to make 
their views known through follow up interviews by the Company’s 
brokers which are then documented and circulated to the Board. 
The Executive Directors also provide feedback to the Board 
following presentations to investors.
Overall responsibility for ensuring that there is effective 
communication with investors and that the Board understands the 
views of major shareholders on matters such as governance and 
strategy rests with the Chairman, who makes himself available to 
meet shareholders, if appropriate, for this purpose. Additionally, the 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and the Chairmen 
of the Board’s Committees are available to meet major investors 
on request. The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director has 
a specific responsibility to be available to shareholders who have 
concerns, and for whom contact with the Chairman, Group Chief 
Executive or Group Finance Director has either failed to resolve 
their concerns, or for whom such contact is inappropriate.
The principal communication with private shareholders is 
through the Annual Report and the Annual General Meeting, 
which is attended by all Directors. All shareholders are invited 
and encouraged to attend the Annual General Meeting which 
provides an opportunity for shareholders to develop their 
understanding of the Company and ask questions on the matters 
put to the meeting (as detailed in the Notice of Meeting sent to 
registered shareholders in advance of the meeting). There is also 
the opportunity to meet informally with the Directors before and 
after the meeting. 
Ordinary business which is raised for consideration at the Annual 
General Meeting each year is:
• to receive the financial statements for the year, together with 
the Directors’ and Auditors’ Reports;
• to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report;
• to approve the final dividend;
• to elect and re-elect members of the Board;
• to re-appoint the Company’s Auditor; and
• to give the Directors the authority to determine the Auditors’ 
remuneration.
Other matters included on the agenda for the Annual General 
Meeting vary from year to year in accordance with the 
requirements of the Company. 
The Company maintains a comprehensive website with a 
dedicated section to shareholders. This provides a wealth of 
information including access to the annual and half year reports, 
presentations, useful fact sheets, as well as share price and general 
shareholder information. Shareholders can contact the Company 
using the email communication system available on the Company’s 
website which will be responded to by the Group’s Investor 
Relations team. For further information visit our website at

internal control and risk management
The Board’s responsibilities 
For the financial year ended 2 July 2011 and up to the date of 
approval of this report, the Board has complied with provision 
C.2.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code and has established 
procedures that implement in full the guidance given in “Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code” 
(the “2005 T urnbull Guidance”).
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Group’s 
Policy and Procedures Manual (the “Manual”) is designed to 
reinforce the Group’s corporate governance, internal control 
processes and management of risk. All operating companies must 
adhere to this Manual and annually certify that they have done so. 
In addition, the Board gains assurance from the Group’s structure 
and the financial, risk management, operating and compliance 
reporting processes which are in place. The Board also considers 
the nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take  
in achieving its strategic objectives. 
Board-level reporting 
The Board is supported by the work of the Audit Committee 
which has delegated responsibility from the Board for reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal 
control systems. During the year the Audit Committee regularly 
reviewed reports from the internal auditors, the external auditors 
and the Executive Directors on matters relating to internal 
controls, financial reporting and risk management. The Audit 
Committee provides the Board with an independent assessment 
of the Group’s position and the Board receives regular updates on 
how specific risks that are assessed as material are being managed 
on at least a biannual basis. 
Group structure 
The Group’s decentralised organisation structure enables the 
Executive Directors to play an active role in communicating 
the objectives, risk strategy and policy of the Group. Open 
communication on risk matters is encouraged and performance 
is monitored against objectives. Risk management is an integral 
part of day-to-day operations where there exists clear ownership 
of risk identification and mitigation at operating company level. 
Operating companies are fully supported by the Executive 
Directors in assessing and managing risks and internal controls. 
The Group’s structure has the benefit of enabling it to respond 
quickly to new, emerging or changing risks, with risk management 
information shared across the Group as well as reported upwards.
Financial reporting and planning processes
In accordance with the Manual, there are formally defined 
lines of financial reporting responsibility, delegated authorities, 
capital investment approval policies and clear operating 
processes. Monthly reporting of financial information to the 
Board encompasses profit and loss, cashflow and balance sheet 
information and key operating ratios. The annual budgeting and 
strategic planning process includes regular re-forecasting of  
results, taking into account key risks and opportunities. 
The use of the Manual by finance teams throughout the Group 
ensures that transactions and balances are recognised and 
measured in accordance with prescribed accounting policies   Corporate Governance

Responsibilities
During the year the Committee met five times and, as part of 
the annual performance evaluation, also undertook a specific 
evaluation of its effectiveness. The main activities undertaken 
during the year included:
• receiving and reviewing reports from management relating 
to the annual and half year profit figures and statements, 
monitoring statutory audit of the annual consolidated Group 
and Parent Company financial statements, reviewing the 
effectiveness of the financial reporting, the controls in force  
and the key judgemental areas at the half year and year end  
to ensure the integrity of the financial information reported  
to shareholders;
• receiving and reviewing reports from the Group’s external  
and internal auditors, including health and safety auditors;
and that information is appropriately reviewed and reconciled  
as part of the reporting process. The use of a standard reporting 
pack by all Group entities ensures that information is gathered and 
presented in a consistent way that facilitates the production of the 
consolidated financial statements. 
There is regular reporting to the Board on specific matters 
including safety, insurance, pensions, tax and treasury management. 
Business planning encompasses due diligence and risk assessments 
where businesses are being acquired or divested and all projects 
and partnerships are entered into taking into account an 
appropriate risk-reward balance. 
Risk management processes
In accordance with the Group’s Manual and Turnbull guidance 
on internal controls, an ongoing process has been established for 
the identification and evaluation of the significant risks faced by 
the Group and the effectiveness of the internal controls in place. 
During the year, and in conjunction with the internal auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Group continued to strengthen 
its ongoing risk management processes, which include top-down 
risk assessment at Group level and bottom-up risk assessments 
at operating company level. A bespoke risk categorisation model 
exists which is used across the Group to ensure that risks are 
identified and reported on a consistent basis and a process is  
in place to aggregate key risks on a Group wide basis. These key 
procedures ensure that the impact of key and emerging risks are 
addressed, with controls and mitigations monitored at monthly 
operating company board meetings. A consolidated review of the 
Group’s risks and controls is undertaken by the Audit Committee 
at least biannually. 
h ealth and safety reporting processes
h ealth and safety standards have been established across all 
operating companies and key performance indicators are closely 
monitored at monthly operating company board meetings. 
The Group Chief Executive reports on health and safety, which 
includes key performance indicators, at each Board meeting. 
Group internal audit
The conduct of the Group’s internal audit function has been 
outsourced to PricewaterhouseCoopers, with overall responsibility 
and direction being retained by the Board. The internal audit 
function provides assurance over the effectiveness of key controls 
as identified as part of the risk assessment process. In addition 
to meetings with local management, the internal auditors report 
on a monthly basis to the Executive Directors and to the Audit 
Committee at least three times a year. 
Disclosure and T ransparency Rules 
Disclosures required under DTR 7.2.6 can be found on pages  
77 to 80.
Committees of the Board
The Board has established a number of Committees to deal with 
specific aspects of the Group’s affairs. The responsibilities of each 
Committee are determined by its terms of reference which are 
available on the Company’s website or upon request from the 
Group Company Secretary. The Committee’s terms of reference 
are reviewed and updated annually in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 66
CORPORATE GOv ERNANCE CONTINUED
• reviewing the relationship with the external and internal 
auditors, including their terms of engagement and fees, 
independence, objectivity and expertise, resources and 
qualification;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial 
control policies, systems and procedures for the identification, 
assessment and reporting of risk, as outlined on pages 64  
and 65;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function;
• making recommendations to the Board, for it to put to the 
shareholders for their approval in general meeting, in relation 
to the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the 
external auditor and to approve the remuneration and terms 
of engagement of the external auditor for both audit and non-
audit work;
• providing a forum for reporting by the Group’s external and 
internal auditors, including health and safety auditors; 
• reviewing the “whistle blowing” arrangements in place across 
the Group; 
• reviewing the Group’s Bribery Act procedures in response  
to the Government’s guidance published in spring 2011; and
• supporting the new Group Finance Director as part of his 
induction to the Group.
At least once a year, the Non-Executive Directors meet with the 
external auditors, without the Executive Directors being present.
Changes to remuneration policy
During the year, the Audit Committee considered the proposals 
made by the Remuneration Committee in respect of the changes 
to remuneration policy for the new Executive Directors. As 
part of these changes, the Committee concluded that a formal 
review of performance versus budget for performance related 
bonus purposes should be introduced. Full details of the new 
remuneration policy can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report from page 69. 
Policy on the Auditors providing non-audit services
In order to ensure auditor objectivity and independence, the 
provision of certain non-audit services (including accounting and tax 
services if the fees exceed a certain level) are subject to approval 
by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has specified that 
the external audit firm may not provide certain categories of non-
audit services to the Group as detailed in the Committee’s terms 
of reference. The ratio of audit fees to non-audit fees charged by 
the external auditors in the year as a proportion of the annual 
external audit fee is kept under review to ensure that neither their 
independence nor their objectivity is put at risk. During the financial 
year, the audit fees of the external auditor were £0.6m and their 
fees for non-audit work were £0.2m. In comparison, non-audit fees 
paid to other audit firms during the financial year were £0.2m.
Review of the external auditors
The Committee has primary responsibility for advising the Board 
on the appointment or re-appointment of the external auditors 
and recommends to the Board the audit fees to be paid. The 
Board’s decision on these matters is subject to the approval of 
shareholders. The independence, objectivity and effectiveness of 
the external auditors have been examined by the Committee  
and, during the year, discussions were held regarding their terms of 
engagement and remuneration. The Committee remains confident 
that the objectivity and independence of the external auditors 
is not compromised in any way and Ernst & young are best 
placed to carry out their professional duties and responsibilities 
as auditors. From the 2010/11 audit, Kathryn Barrow replaced 
Debbie O’h anlon as Senior Statutory Auditor, Debbie O’h anlon 
having served five years and retired by rotation. It is intended that 
Kathryn Barrow’s tenure be for a period of five years. 
Whistle blowing policy
The Group is committed to the highest standards of quality, honesty, 
openness and accountability and a “whistle blowing” policy has been 
issued to all operating companies to ensure a consistent approach 
across the Group. Employees are encouraged to raise genuine 
concerns under the policy and any concerns raised are investigated 
carefully and thoroughly to assess what action, if any, should be 
taken. Any matters of significance are reported to the Audit 
Committee. During the year, no issues of significance were raised. 
Anti-bribery procedures
The Board supports the objectives of the Bribery Act 2010 
(the “Bribery Act”) which came into force on 1 July 2011 and 
measures have been established to ensure that compliance is 
achieved and any issues arising under the Bribery Act are dealt 
with promptly and appropriately. Training has been provided to 
all employees who are in a position to be affected by the Bribery 
Act. This includes the Board of Directors and senior management. 
Training will be refreshed on a regular basis. Any breach of the 
Bribery Act will be regarded as serious misconduct, potentially 
justifying dismissal.
Compliance with the u K Corporate Governance Code
The Audit Committee is made up of three independent Non-
Executive Directors as required by the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”). Under the Code, at least one member of the 
Committee should have recent and relevant financial experience. 
As a Chartered Accountant, and previously the Group Finance 
Director of another listed company between 2004 and 2007,  
the Board has determined that Andrew Allner fully satisfies  
this requirement. 
The Committee is fully compliant with the principles and provisions 
of the Code with regard to its constitution and operation.

the Group’s website at www.go-ahead.com or upon request from

Appointment of new executive Directors
During the year, the Nomination Committee was responsible 
for leading the process of identifying candidates for the roles 
of Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. As part 
of this process, a description of these roles and the capabilities 
required was prepared. In consultation with an external search 
consultancy, and after interviewing a number of potential 
candidates, Keith Down joined the Company as Group Finance 
Director on 7 March 2011. As part of an orderly succession plan, 
David Brown joined the Company as Deputy Chief Executive on 
1 April 2011, succeeding Keith Ludeman as Group Chief Executive 
when he retired on 2 July 2011. 
The Committee followed a process that was both rigorous and 
transparent and both candidates were appointed based on merit 
against objective criteria and with due regard to the benefits  
of diversity.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
en Suring 
the right 
balance Dear Shareholder
During the year, the Board announced two important changes. On 
7 March 2011, Keith Down replaced Nick Swift as Group Finance 
Director. On 1 April 2011, David Brown was appointed as Deputy 
Group Chief Executive, to succeed Keith Ludeman as Group Chief 
Executive when he retired on 2 July 2011. 
In conjunction with these new Board appointments, the 
Remuneration Committee, assisted by independent remuneration 
consultants h ewitt New Bridge Street, undertook a comprehensive 
review of the Group’s remuneration policy. The aim was to ensure 
that the right balance was achieved between recruiting, retaining 
and motivating high calibre individuals and aligning these factors  
with maximising long term shareholder value. In formulating this 
new policy, the Committee were conscious of the continuing 
difficult economic conditions and evolving landscape in 
remuneration developments.
Details of the changes to our incentive arrangements from the 
next financial year, which the Company has discussed with its major 
shareholders, can be found in this report. In summary, these will  
consist of:
• an annual discretionary cash bonus with a maximum opportunity  
of 100% of salary, of which 20% is now based on the achievement 
of safety and good governance objectives;
• a new annual discretionary deferred share bonus with a maximum 
opportunity of 50% of salary, subject to claw-back provisions; and
• a reduced annual Long T erm Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) award over 
shares with a maximum market value at grant of 100% of salary, 
which vests subject to targets for relative total shareholder return 
and earnings per share growth.
While the overall effect of these changes is that the full potential of 
performance-related remuneration is unchanged, the Committee is 
satisfied that there is now a clearer link between performance and 
the pay received. The changes made also more closely reflect our 
corporate goals and are consistent with market and best practice. 
I hope you find this report helpful and informative.

During the year, and following a tendering process, the Committee 
appointed h ewitt New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon 
h ewitt Limited) as new independent remuneration advisers to 
the Committee. Neither Aon h ewitt Limited nor the wider Aon 
Corporation provided any other services to the Company during 
the year. 
Responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee
A summary of the responsibilities of the Committee is shown on 
page 68. The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website at www.go-ahead.com or upon request from 
the Group Company Secretary.
Key Committee activities during the year 
During the year, the Committee met eight times. The Chairman 
of the Committee also held a number of additional meetings 
with the Company’s remuneration advisers. The Committee’s key 
activities, in addition to the routine business as outlined on page 
68, included:
• reviewing the policy for the new Executive Directors, David 
Brown and Keith Down, and the structure of the new executive 
remuneration and incentive packages;
• consulting the Group’s major shareholders and their 
representative bodies on these changes;
• appointing new independent advisers to the Committee 
following a tendering process; and
• considering the application of the Committee’s policy in 
connection with the departing Executive Directors, Keith 
Ludeman and Nick Swift. 
During the year, the Committee’s recommendations were  
all accepted unanimously by the Board and implemented  
without amendment.
Policy on the remuneration of executive Directors
It is the responsibility of the Committee to set the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors. The Group’s overall remuneration 
policy, as adopted by the Committee, is to ensure that we 
are paying enough to attract, retain and motivate high calibre 
individuals to deliver a performance in the interests of the 
Company’s shareholders and the overall objectives of the business. 
T o achieve this, the Group’s remuneration policy is based 
on the following key principles which are aligned with the 
recommendations of the Code on Directors’ remuneration:
• providing executives with a remuneration package that 
recognises the performance and experience of the individual 
concerned and the role fulfilled;
• ensuring considerable emphasis is placed on performance-
driven compensation where targets are aligned with the 
Group’s strategic objectives and targeted shareholder  
returns; and
• ensuring the framework for remuneration is competitive in the 
market in which the Group competes, paying due regard to the 
pay practices of its peer group, to the wider pay market in the 
FTSE 250 and to other factors specific to the Group and to 
each Director.
The Group Chief Executive regularly reports on the pay, incentives 
and conditions of senior managers and other employees across 
the Group and operating companies. The Committee takes  
these into account when determining the remuneration of the  
Executive Directors.
When setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors,  
the Committee ensures that the incentive structure does not  
raise risks by inadvertently encouraging irresponsible behaviour.  
As well as the annual reported financial statements, the 
Committee also considers the mix between fixed and variable 
pay. The Committee recognises that, for this Group’s business, 
shareholder value is dependent on factors not all necessarily 
appearing within the published financial statements, although their 
effect on later financial statements could be significant. Leading 
these factors are safety, control of risk and other executive 
actions of a strategic nature that may take several years to affect 
shareholder value. 
The Executive Directors are also incentivised to take 
environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters seriously 
and to consider the long term implications of their decision 
making. Accordingly, in line with the ABI’s Guidelines on 
Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee has linked  
a proportion of the annual bonus to the achievement of safety 
and good governance objectives.
In accordance with the Committee’s policy, a substantial 
proportion of the Executive Directors’ pay is performance-
related. The chart on page 72 shows the balance between fixed 
and performance related pay at maximum performance levels. 
Maximum performance assumes payment of maximum cash  
and deferred share bonuses and full vesting of shares under the 
Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”).
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Corporate Governance

The overall effect of these changes is that the maximum potential 
of performance-related remuneration is unchanged. h owever, the 
actual remuneration for our new Executive Directors is lower than 
that of their predecessors as follows:
For David Brown, Group Chief Executive
• a starting salary below that of Keith Ludeman;
• reduced benefits through the removal of the car replacement 
allowance; and
• reduced pension costs, both in terms of pension and risk, as 
there is no form of pension provision or replacement cash 
supplement from the Company.
For Keith Down, Group Finance Director
• reduced benefits through the removal of the car replacement 
allowance; and
• reduced pension costs, both in terms of pension and risk, as 
pension provision is for defined contribution benefits, with 
contributions from the Company capped.
Base salary
The base salary of the Executive Directors is determined by 
the Committee upon appointment and is reviewed in April 
each year. When determining this, the Committee considers the 
levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, 
responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size 
and complexity and median salary levels of those comparable 
companies within the peer group. The performance, experience 
and responsibilities of the individual are also taken into account,  
as are the pay and conditions throughout the Group.

Car replacement allowance 
The Group does not allocate company cars to any employees.
h istorically, a car replacement allowance has been provided to 
those employees who would have received a company car as part 
of their benefits, or to accomplish their work. During the year, this 
policy changed and car allowances are no longer given to any new 
employees. This includes the new Executive Directors, neither of 
whom receives the additional car replacement allowance provided 
to their predecessors.

Pension
The Group has traditionally operated an approved defined benefit 
pension scheme. Nick Swift, the former Group Finance Director, 
was a participant during the year. 
The former Group Chief Executive, Keith Ludeman, opted out of 
The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan in December 2006, but retained 
a salary link in relation to his accrued benefit which was provided 
separately through an individual non-registered unfunded pension 
arrangement (UURBS). In lieu of future benefits, he received a 
non-pensionable salary supplement of 15% of base salary. This salary 
supplement was not included with base salary for the purposes of 
calculating performance related cash bonus or LTIP awards. 
The new Executive Directors have not been offered membership  
of this defined benefit pension arrangement. The new Group  
Chief Executive, David Brown, has no specific pension entitlement 
on top of his salary and does not receive the salary supplement  
as given to his predecessor. h e has however elected to invest  
some of his salary into the defined contribution section of  
The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan. This has no incremental  
cost to the Company.
The new Group Finance Director, Keith Down, is a member of 
the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Group Pension 
Plan. h e receives an employer contribution of 13%, which he 
supplements by making a 6% contribution from his own salary. 
Performance-related cash bonus
Each of the Executive Directors has the opportunity to earn a 
performance-related cash bonus which is capped at a maximum  
of 100% of annual base salary. 
For the year ending 2 July 2011, 20% of the total bonus 
opportunity was based on personal performance against 
qualitative objectives agreed with each Executive Director at 
the beginning of the year and 80% was based on actual financial 
performance against budget. The Group’s profit substantially 
exceeded the budget, triggering a bonus of 80% for financial 
performance. The Executive Directors also met their personal 
qualitative objectives and so received a bonus of 20%. 
Keith Ludeman worked for the full financial year and was awarded 
the maximum performance-related cash bonus of 100% of base 
salary. Nick Swift also received the maximum performance-related 
bonus of 100%, reduced to 67% to reflect the fact he left his  
office in March 2011 and so did not work for the full financial year. 
David Brown and Keith Down were also eligible to receive  
a performance-related bonus of 25% and 32% of base salary 
respectively, in accordance with their service periods completed  
and the targets set for the Executive Directors in office at the 
beginning of the year. In order to create an immediate alignment  
of interests with shareholders, the bonus this year will be delivered 
in the form of post-tax shares to be held for a minimum period  
of three years. 
From the 2011/12 financial period, bonus payments will be  
based on a similar structure, with 80% weighted on actual financial 
performance against budget. The remaining 20% previously 
attributable to personal performance will be reallocated to safety 
and good governance metrics. A formal end of year review of the 
quality of profit and the quality of budget will also be introduced.

Deferred Share Bonus Plan 
From the 2011/12 financial period, we are introducing a new  
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP’”) for the Executive Directors 
under which awards worth up to 50% of salary can be earned. This 
will not result in any increase in the overall quantum of remuneration 
as the introduction of the DSBP will be accompanied by a reduction 
in the normal award level under the Long T erm Incentive Plan from 
150% to 100% of salary. 
The DSBP is being introduced to enable the Committee to set 
targets linked to the achievement of important annual strategic 
goals which are key to the delivery of longer term value for 
shareholders. The introduction of deferred shares will also enable 
the new Executive Directors to earn a quicker and more direct 
right to shares in order to promote alignment. 
The main features of the new DSBP are:
• for the year commencing 2 July 2011, the targets will relate to the 
achievement of profit before tax targets that are higher than the 
profit targets set for the annual performance-related cash bonus. 
The Committee will also consider the introduction of additional 
targets linked to the Group’s long term strategic objectives in future 
years. The nature of these targets and outcomes achieved will be 
disclosed in next year’s Annual Report;
• bonuses will be deferred in shares for a period of three years. 
Normal ‘good leaver’ and change of control provisions will apply 
and there will be a dividend equivalent provision in operation 
over the deferral period;
• bonus claw-back will apply during the deferral period; and
• the plan will operate over shares to be bought in the market, 
resulting in no shareholder dilution.

l ong T erm incentive Plan 
Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) consist 
of nil-cost options to acquire shares, exercisable at the end of 
a three year performance period, subject to the satisfaction of 
performance conditions. For the year ended 2 July 2011, the 
Executive Directors were eligible to receive awards with a face 
value worth up to 150% of salary.
In light of the introduction of the new Deferred Share Bonus Plan, the 
maximum award under the LTIP will be reduced from 150% to 100% 
of base salary from the 2011/12 financial period. 
Awards made before July 2011 have been subject to performance 
conditions based on the Group’s relative T otal Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”) performance measured against two comparator groups 
(the Transport Sector Comparator Group – comprising Arriva 
plc, FirstGroup plc, National Express Group plc and Stagecoach 
Group plc – and a group comprising the FTSE 250 excluding 
investment trusts). Following the acquisition of Arriva plc on 
31 August 2010, the Transport Sector Comparator group now 
comprises only three companies. Accordingly the previous policy 
of having a relative TSR versus a transport peer group is no longer 
feasible. The Committee has therefore reviewed the performance 
conditions used in the LTIP and believes it is right to introduce 
new financial and strategic performance conditions in addition  
to the continued use of a revised relative TSR comparator group. 
The performance conditions for the 2011/12 awards will be as 
shown in the table above.
The Committee considers that these performance conditions 
are relevant and challenging, and awards will vest in full only if 
exceptional performance has been achieved. Earnings Per Share 
(“EPS”) and TSR measures were chosen as the measures of the 
Group’s long term performance and are consistent with the 
Group’s objective of providing long term returns to shareholders. 
EPS is an important growth measure and driver, and TSR improves 
shareholder alignment. The EPS targets reflect the fact that over 
85% of the Group’s revenue is regulated.
Share incentive Plan 
The Go-Ahead Group Plc Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) is an 
h MRC approved plan open to all staff permanently employed by a 
Go-Ahead Group Company and who have completed at least six 
months continuous service at the date of application. Participants 
may contribute up to a maximum of £125 per month (or 10% 
of pre-tax salary if less) which the Trustee of the SIP uses to buy 
shares on their behalf. Deductions are made from an employee’s 
gross income so no income tax or National Insurance will be 
payable provided the shares are held in trust for up to five years. 
The Executive Directors do not currently participate in the SIP . 
Share ownership guidelines 
Shareholder guidelines are in place for the Executive Directors which 
provide for them to build up a personal or spouse’s shareholding 
equal to one year’s base salary over a period of five years.
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration 
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Chairman 
and the Executive Directors following an annual review in April 
each year.

The review seeks to recognise the time commitment, responsibility 
and technical skills required to make a valuable contribution to the 
Board. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to receive pension 
entitlements or performance-related remuneration and may not 
participate in share option schemes. The Committee considers the 
remuneration of the Chairman in his absence.
No increase in such fees was made following the annual review 
in April 2011. This is the second year that no increase has been 
made to the fees of the Non-Executive Directors.

cross-directorships.
Directors’ contracts
It is the Group’s policy to restrict the notice periods for Executive 
Directors to a maximum of 12 months. In line with this policy, 
the Executive Directors have service contracts with an undefined 
term but which provide for the Company giving a notice period 
of 12 months. The contracts contain a provision, exercisable at 
the discretion of the Company, to pay an amount in lieu of notice 
on early termination of the contract. Such payments are limited 
to base salary plus certain benefits but would not automatically 
include entitlement to bonus or share awards. There are no 
provisions for special pension benefits, such as beneficial early 
retirement terms. Other than the notice periods specified below, 
the Executive Directors are not due any contractual compensation 
payments in the event of early termination of a service contract. 
If it becomes necessary to consider early termination of a service 
contract, the Company will have regard to all the circumstances of 
the case, including mitigation, when determining any compensation 
to be paid. Neither of the Executive Directors holds any  
external directorships.
There were no termination payments made to Keith Ludeman or 
Nick Swift upon their respective retirement and resignation from the 
Company. There were no incentive payments made to David Brown 
or Keith Down upon their respective appointments to the Company. 
Each Non-Executive Director has a letter of appointment 
which provides for a notice period of six months. The terms of 
appointment contain no entitlement to compensation for early 
termination. The letters of appointment are available for inspection 
at the Company’s Registered Office during normal business hours 
and will also be available for inspection prior to and during the 
Annual General Meeting.

September 2007 awards
In September 2010, three years after the date of grant, the Committee considered the extent to which the awards granted to Keith 
Ludeman and Nick Swift in September 2007 should vest based on the three year performance period commencing with the start of 
the 2007/8 financial period and ending with the 2009/10 financial period. This award was based on TSR performance against the two 
comparator groups, with a minimum requirement that the Group should receive an increase in adjusted EPS over the three year period 
of not less than the increase in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per year. As the minimum EPS requirement had not been met, no shares 
vested to Keith Ludeman and Nick Swift under the September 2007 award. 
October 2008 awards
The award granted to Nick Swift in October 2008 lapsed following his resignation on 7 March 2011. In October 2011, which is three 
years from the date of grant, the Committee will consider the extent to which the award granted to Keith Ludeman in October 2008 
will vest based on the three year performance period commencing with the start of the 2008/9 financial period and ending with the 
2010/11 financial period. This award was made on the basis that only half of the award is linked to comparative TSR against the two 
comparator groups and the other half is linked to real growth in EPS.
October 2009 and 2010 awards
The awards granted to Nick Swift in October 2009 and September 2010 lapsed following his resignation on 7 March 2011. In October 
2012 and September 2013, which is three years from the dates of grant respectively, the Committee will consider the extent to which 
the awards granted to Keith Ludeman will vest. The awards eligible to vest at this time have been reduced accordingly to reflect the 
period over which Keith Ludeman was employed. These awards will be based on TSR performance against the two comparator groups 
only, with no EPS performance conditions. The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 76

The awards granted on 17 November 2009 are held in trust on behalf of the beneficiaries for a period of three years. The Committee 
resolved that the award granted to Nick Swift would lapse following his resignation on 7 March 2011. In accordance with the “good 
leaver” provisions of the Plan, the award granted to Keith Ludeman vested in full after the year end and following his retirement on

Notes
1   At the end of last year, the Government confirmed that statutory increases in payment and in deferment for occupational pension schemes would be linked to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for 
future years. The Trustee took legal advice on the impact of this change on The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan (“the Plan”). This concluded that increases in deferment on pensions in excess of any 
Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) and increases in payment to GMP benefits after 5 April 1988 will now increase in line with CPI, subject to the appropriate cap. In light of this legal advice, changes 
in market conditions and actuarial advice, the Trustee of the Plan reviewed and amended the basis for the calculation of cash equivalent transfer values with effect from 23 March 2011. The transfer 
values at the year end have been calculated in accordance with this basis.
2  Mr Swift accrued benefits within the Group’s approved final salary pension plan during the financial year. Mr Ludeman’s benefits were provided in part through the Group’s approved final salary plan 
and also through an individual unapproved unfunded pension arrangement. Mr Swift left Pensionable Service on 7 March 2011 and Mr Ludeman began receiving his benefits from both arrangements  
on 1 April 2010.
3   Whilst an active member of the Plan, Mr Swift participated in the pensions salary sacrifice arrangement operated by the Group during the year. The notional contributions shown in the table above are 
those Mr Swift would have paid had he not participated in the salary sacrifice arrangement. The figures at 2 July 2011 reflect Mr Swift’s Pensionable Service to his date of leaving, albeit the transfer value 
reflects market conditions at the year end.
4  As at 2 July 2011, Mr Ludeman was in receipt of a pension of £188,520 pa from the Plan and £24,890 pa from the unapproved pension arrangement. The increase in his accrued pension over the year 
reflects the standard inflationary pension increases that he has received in line with the Plan’s Rules and his unfunded arrangement. As Mr Ludeman is in receipt of his pension he is not entitled to a 
transfer value from the Plan. Therefore, the transfer values shown in the above table are notional values. The transfer value at 3 July 2010 included the tax-free cash lump sum that he took at retirement. 
This is excluded from the transfer value at 2 July 2011, which is the primary reason for the fall in his transfer value over the year. 
5 The new Executive Directors, David Brown and Keith Down, are not members of the final salary section.

No Director was interested in any contract or arrangement

Indemnification of Directors
The Company maintains a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance 
which gives appropriate cover for any legal action brought against 
its Directors. The Company has also granted indemnities to each 
of its Directors to the extent permitted by law. Qualifying third 
party indemnity provisions (as defined in section 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006) were in force during the year ended 2 July 
2011 and remain in force, in relation to certain losses and liabilities 
which the Directors may incur to third parties in the course 
of acting as directors or employees of the Company or of any 
associated company. Neither the Company’s indemnity nor the 
insurance provides cover in the event that a Director is proven  
to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently.

a single class of shares referred to as ordinary shares. At this

under the Company’s all-employee share scheme were granted 
throughout the course of the year. The Company did not purchase 
any of its own shares during the year for either cancellation or 
to hold as treasury shares, and no such shares were purchased 
between the year end and the date of this report. h owever, 58,632 
shares (2010: 26,447) were re-purchased for potential LTIP awards 
that may vest in the future (and Directors’ bonus plans 2010).
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in  
the Company other than:
• certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed  
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and

regardless of the total number of shares held. On a show of hands 
at a general meeting of the Company, every holder of shares 
present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have 
one vote (except in the circumstance where a proxy has been 
appointed by more than one member in which case he or she 
will have one vote for and one vote against if he or she has been 
instructed by one or more members to vote for the resolution 
and by one or more members to vote against). On a poll, every 
member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote has 
one vote for every ordinary share held. The Notice of Meeting 
specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights either in person 
or by proxy in relation to resolutions to be passed at the 2011 
Annual General Meeting. All proxy votes are counted and the 
numbers for, against or withheld in relation to each resolution are 
announced at the Annual General Meeting itself and published on

(up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,433,458) and for the 
disapplication of pre-emption rights on the allotment of equity

2010 Annual General Meeting, were not utilised in the financial 
year or up to the date of this report. These authorities will expire 
at the upcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company and 
approval for new authorities will be sought. In the last three years 
no shares have been issued on a non-pre-emptive basis, other 
than those issued under all-employee share schemes which are 
not included for the purposes of this authority.
The authority for the Company to make market purchases of  
its own ordinary shares, as passed by special resolution at the 
2010 Annual General Meeting, was still in effect at the end of  
the financial year and will expire at the upcoming Annual General 
Meeting of the Company, where approval for a new authority 
will be sought. Under the existing authority the maximum 
aggregate number of shares that can be purchased is 4,300,375. 
The authority also limits the maximum number of shares held 
in treasury to 10% of the issued share capital of the Company 
and states minimum and maximum prices payable for shares 
purchased under the authority. During the financial year this 
authority was not utilised. h owever, 58,632 shares (2010: 26,447) 
were re-purchased for potential LTIP awards that may vest in the 
future (and Directors’ bonus plans 2010).

Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
Each of the Group’s rail franchise agreements is subject to change 
of control criteria that would mean, on a change of control, 
there would be deemed to be an “event of default” that could 
potentially terminate the rail franchise. This is, however, subject to 
the discretion of the Secretary of State. Additionally, the Group’s 
sterling bond issue dated 22 February 2010 and Revolving Credit 
Facility dated 3 February 2011 are subject to change of control

asset management companies and may have changed without

Share schemes
At the date of this report, EES Trustees International Limited, as 
Trustee of The Go-Ahead Group Employee Trust, holds 0.3% of 
the issued share capital of the Company in trust for the benefit of 
the Executive Directors of the Group and their dependents under 
the Long Term Incentive Plan. The voting rights in relation to these 
shares are exercised by the Trustee and dividends are waived 
while the shares are held by the Trustee.
Under the rules of the Company’s Share Incentive Plan, employees 
of the Group are entitled to acquire shares in the Company. 
In order to preserve certain tax benefits these shares are held 
in a trust by EES Corporate Trustees Limited for participating 
employees. Whilst these shares are held in trust, the voting rights 
attached to them will not be exercised by the Trustee or the 
employees for whom they are held. As at the date of this report, 
0.8% of the issued share capital of the Company is held by EES 
Corporate Trustees Limited. In the event of an offer being made 
to acquire these shares the employees are entitled to direct EES 
Corporate Trustees Limited to accept an offer in respect of the 
shares held on their behalf.
On 1 June 2010, the Company’s only outstanding Sharesave 
Scheme (a savings related share option scheme) matured 
underwater meaning that the price at which to exercise the 
options was greater than the market price of the underlying 
shares. h ence, no employees chose to exercise their options  
upon maturity and no ordinary shares were allotted under  
the rules of the Sharesave Scheme. No accounts remain 
outstanding. There will therefore be no future exercise of  
share options unless a new Sharesave Scheme is launched,  
and any such launch would be at the discretion of the Board.
vesting of awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan for the 
Executive Directors is satisfied by market purchases of shares,  
and therefore there is no dilution of the issued share capital. 
employees 
The Group’s responsibility is to provide a positive work 
environment conducive to the recruitment and retention of staff 
and one which meets its business objectives by motivating and 
encouraging the Group’s employees to be responsive to the needs 
of its customers, maintaining, and wherever possible, improving 
operational performance. 
The Group is committed to providing equality of opportunity to 
all employees and treats all employees fairly regardless of gender, 
ethnic origin, age, religion, belief, race and, where practical, physical 
disability. Appropriate training, career development and promotion 
opportunities are provided for all employees. The Group gives full 
and fair consideration to applications for employment made by 
disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and 
abilities. It is the Group’s policy to provide continuing employment, 
and arrange appropriate training, for existing employees who 
become disabled during their employment, and to provide  
training, career development and promotion as appropriate  
to all disabled employees.
Our companies maintain relationships with recognised trade 
unions and have established a network of local employee 
representatives who are consulted on key business decisions  
likely to affect their interests. Three of our companies have 
Stakeholder Boards, which bring together employees, individual 
passengers and representative bodies to share views. The Group 
produces a range of internal newsletters, information circulars 
and intranet sites that keep employees abreast of developments 
at their specific employing company and across the Group 
as a whole. The Group has awards to recognise and reward 
outstanding contributions by our employees. 
Employees are encouraged to participate directly in the success 
of the business through the Group’s h MRC approved Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP) which is open to all employees with six 
months’ service and gives the opportunity to buy shares in the 
Company in a tax-efficient manner. 
The Group is committed to developing a culture of openness 
across all its businesses and ensuring the highest standards 
of probity and accountability and aims to achieve a common 
awareness on the part of all employees of the financial and 
economic factors affecting the Company’s performance. The 
Group engages with its employees, who are encouraged to 
discuss matters of interest to them and subjects affecting day-
to-day operations with operating company management. The 
Board also actively encourages employees with serious concerns 
regarding the interests of others or the Group to come forward. 
The Group and its operating companies have policies in place 
to ensure processes exist whereby employees can raise serious 
concerns constructively without fear or victimisation, subsequent 
discrimination or disadvantage. 
Further details of our responsibilities as an employer, including 
operating in a socially and environmentally responsible manner,  
can be found on pages 48 to 51 and also in the Group’s 
Corporate Responsibility Report which is published separately and  
can be found on the Company’s website (www.go-ahead.com).
Charitable donations 
Charitable donations, sponsorship and community support over 
the year amounted to £348,619 (2010: £268,000). The Group 
strives to support many worthwhile causes, including health 
charities and local community projects. For further details, please 
see the Group’s separate Corporate Responsibility Report which 
can be located as detailed above.
Political donations and expenditure
It is the Group’s policy not to make political donations and 
accordingly no such payments were made in the year (2010: £nil). 
Additionally, the Company did not incur any political expenditure 
as defined in the Companies Act 2006 (2010: £nil).
l and and buildings
In the opinion of the Directors, there is no material difference 
between the market value of the Group’s interest in land and 
buildings and its net book value. 
Suppliers
Each Group operating company individually agrees terms and 
conditions for its business transactions with suppliers. Payment is 
then made on these terms, subject to the terms and conditions 
being met by the suppliers, including the timely submission of  The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 80
satisfactory invoices. For the year ended 2 July 2011, the trade 
creditor days for The Go-Ahead Group Plc as a Company  
(not as a Group) were five days (2010: 11), based on the ratio  
of trade creditors at the end of the year to the amounts invoiced 
during the year by trade creditors. 
Post balance sheet events
There are no post balance sheet events. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position, are 
set out in the Directors’ Report on pages 2 to 47. The financial 
position of the Group, its cashflows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 
32 to 35. In addition note 23 to the financial statements includes 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures  
to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Cash generation from the Group’s bus and rail operations was 
excellent and the balance sheet remains strong. Core financing 
is provided by a £200m sterling bond securing financing to 
September 2017 and bank facilities funding of £275m to February 
2016, of which £191m was undrawn and available at the year end. 
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage  
its business risks successfully, despite the current uncertain  
economic outlook.
The Directors have assessed, in the light of current and anticipated 
economic conditions, the Company and Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. The Directors confirm they are 
satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the “going concern” 
basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the financial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
UK law and those International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the Group 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they present 
fairly the financial position of the Group and the financial 
performance and cash flows of the Group for that period.  
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are  
required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 
“Accounting Policies, Change in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors” and then apply them consistently;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) is insufficient to enable users to understand  
the impact of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the Group’s financial position and  
financial performance;
• state that the Group has complied with IFRSs, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group, enabling them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Responsibility statements 
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of 
approving the Directors’ report are listed on pages 52 and 53.  
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
a)  The financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and 
b)  The Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the  
position of the Company and the undertakings included in  
the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors 
h aving made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the Company’s 
auditors, each of the Directors confirm that:
• T o the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is 
no information (that is, information needed by the Company’s 
auditors in connection with preparing their report) of which  
the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• Each Director has taken all the steps a Director might 
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.

Group plc for the year ended 2 July 2011 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet,  
the consolidated cashflow statement, the consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes  
in equity and the related notes 1 to 29. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable  
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as  
adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as  
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.  
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 80, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they  
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to  
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of  
the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and  
non-financial information in the annual report and accounts to  
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs  
as at 2 July 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union; and  
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 80, in relation to going 
concern; and 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to  
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and 
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board  
on Directors’ remuneration. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of the Go-Ahead Group plc for the year ended  
2 July 2011 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report that is described as having been audited.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 2 JULY 2011 
 
1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement  
of compliance with IFRSs 
The consolidated financial statements of The Go-Ahead Group plc 
(the ‘Group’) for the year ended 2 July 2011 were authorised for  
issue by the Board of Directors on 31 August 2011 and the balance 
sheet was signed on the Board’s behalf by Sir Patrick Brown and  
Keith Down. The Go-Ahead Group plc is a public limited company 
that is incorporated, domiciled and has its registered office in England 
and Wales. The Company’s ordinary shares are publicly traded on  
the London Stock Exchange and it is not under the control of any 
single shareholder. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) as they 
apply to the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the 
year ended 2 July 2011, and applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006. The Group is required to comply with 
international accounting requirements under IAS 1 ‘Presentation of 
Financial Statements’ except in extremely rare circumstances where 
management concludes that compliance would be so misleading  
that it would conflict with the objective to ‘present fairly’ its financial 
statements. On that basis, the Group has departed from the 
requirements of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ and has accounted for  
its constructive but not legal obligations for the Railways Pension 
Scheme (RPS) under the terms of its UK rail franchise agreements. 
Details of the background and rationale for this departure are 
provided in note 28. 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
A summary of the Group’s accounting policies applied in preparing 
the financial statements for the year ended 2 July 2011 are set  
out below.  
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling 
and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand 
(£0.1m) except when otherwise indicated. 
As noted above, the Group has taken the decision to depart  
from the requirements of IAS 19 so as to present fairly its financial 
performance, position, and cashflows in respect of its obligation  
for the RPS. 
New standards 
The following new standards or interpretations are mandatory  
for the first time for the financial year ending 2 July 2011: 
• IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial reporting 
Standards – Additional Exemptions for First-time Adopters 
(amendments) 
• IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards – Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 
Disclosures for First-time Adopters 
• IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised) 
• IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Arrangements 
(amendment) 
• IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 
(amendment) 
• IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation – Classification of 
Rights Issues (amendment) 
• IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – 
Eligible Hedge Items (amendment) 
• IFRIC 17 Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners 
• IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers 
• IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments 
• Improvements to IFRS 2009 
• Improvements to IFRS 2010 
The adoption of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements (amendment) has required the reclassification of minority 
interests as non-controlling interests. Also, any transactions with  
non-controlling interests that do not result in gaining or losing control 
will be accounted for as equity transactions. 
The Improvements to IFRS 2009 amended IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
to require segment assets and liabilities to be reported only when they 
are included in measures regularly provided to the chief operating 
decision maker. This is not the case, and therefore, segment assets 
and liabilities are no longer reported. 
Adoption of IFRS 3 Business Combinations (revised) has required  
the legal expenses relating to the acquisition of Thames Travel 
(Wallingford) Limited in the year to be expensed. The legal expenses 
amounted to £0.1m. 
Adoption of the remaining new standards and interpretations did  
not have a material impact on the financial performance or position  
of the Group.  
In accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations, the Group has classified the results of  
the residual ground handling activities at Heathrow Terminal 1 and 
Meteor Parking operations as discontinued and accordingly the 
comparatives in the income statement and related notes have been 
restated. The above treatment is a result of the cessation or sale 
during the period of the above operations. 
Use of estimates 
The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions. Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge, actual results ultimately may differ 
from these estimates. 
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk  
of causing material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are in relation to:  
• the measurement and impairment testing of indefinite life 
intangible assets requires estimation of future cashflows and the 
selection of a suitable discount rate and growth rate, as detailed  
in note 14; 
• the measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires 
the estimation of future changes in salaries, inflation, the expected 
return on assets and the selection of a suitable discount rate, as 
set out in note 28; and 
• the measurement of uninsured liabilities is based on an 
assessment of the expected settlement of known claims and  
an estimate of the cost of claims not yet reported to the Group. 
• the measurement of franchise commitments, comprising 
dilapidation provisions on vehicles, depots and stations and  
also income claims from other rail franchise operators, is based  
on management’s assessment of most probable outcomes, 
supported where appropriate by valuations from professional 
external advisers.   Financial Statements

Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of The Go-Ahead Group plc and its subsidiaries as  
at 2 July 2011. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the  
date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries for use in the consolidation are prepared 
for the same reporting year as the parent company and are based  
on consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances and 
transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group 
transactions, have been eliminated in full. 
Non-controlling interests represent the equity interests not held  
by the Group in Govia Limited, a 65% owned subsidiary, and are 
presented within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately 
from parent shareholders’ equity. 
Interest in joint ventures 
The Group has a contractual arrangement with another party which 
represents a joint venture. This takes the form of an agreement to 
share control over another entity, through an interest in a company 
(a jointly controlled entity). The Group recognises its interest in the 
entity’s assets and liabilities using the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method, the interest in the joint venture is carried  
in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the 
Group’s share of its net assets, less distributions received and less  
any impairment in value of the investment. The Group income 
statement reflects the share of the jointly controlled entity’s results 
after tax. Where there has been a change recognised in other 
comprehensive income of the jointly controlled entity, the Group 
recognises its share of any such changes in the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
income will flow to the Group and the value can be reliably measured. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, 
excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.  
Rendering of services 
The revenue of the Group comprises income from road passenger 
transport and rail passenger transport. 
Bus revenue comprises amounts receivable generated from ticket 
sales and revenue generated from services provided on behalf of local 
transport authorities.  
Rail revenue comprises amounts based principally on agreed models 
of route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited (which administers 
the income allocation system within the UK rail industry), in respect  
of passenger receipts and other related services such as rolling stock 
maintenance and commission on tickets sold. In addition, franchise 
subsidy receipts from the DfT and local Passenger Transport 
Executives (PTEs) are treated as revenue, whereas franchise premium 
payments to the DfT are recognised in operating costs. 
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
customer’s journey or for other services based on the proportion of 
services provided. The attributable share of season ticket or travel 
card income is deferred within liabilities and released to the income 
statement over the life of the relevant season ticket or travel card. 
Rental income 
Rental income is generated from rental of surplus properties  
and subleasing of rolling stock and railway infrastructure access.  
It is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Finance revenue 
Interest on deposits is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. 
Government grants 
Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there  
is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all  
attaching conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates  
to an expense item, it is recognised in the income statement over  
the period necessary to match on a systematic basis to the costs  
that it is intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to a  
non-current asset, value is credited to a deferred income account  
and is released to the income statement over the expected useful  
life of the relevant asset. 
Uninsured liabilities 
The Group limits its exposure to the cost of motor, employer and 
public liability claims through insurance policies issued by third parties. 
These provide individual claim cover, subject to high excess limits and 
an annual aggregate stop loss for total claims within the excess limits. 
A liability is recognised for the estimated cost to the Group to settle 
claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, subject 
to the overall stop loss.  
The estimation of this liability is made after taking appropriate 
professional advice and is based on an assessment of the expected 
settlement on known claims, together with an estimate of settlements 
that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance 
sheet date but that have not yet been reported to the Group by  
the insurer.  
The Group has accumulated considerable experience in the evaluation 
and management of such claims and has historically classified this liability 
as an accrual within the current liabilities. As part of our regular review 
of reporting practices and policies, we have given full consideration to 
the classification of this liability in the balance sheet. In light of developing 
trends relating to the nature of claims and the increasing time involved in 
their resolution, the Group has determined that there is no longer a 
sufficient degree of certainty to classify all of this liability as an accrual 
rather than as a provision. As a result, this liability is now classified within 
provisions and accompanied by the disclosures relating to their creation, 
utilisation and re-measurement of these obligations.  
The Group believes that this change in presentation provides more 
relevant information and aids comparability with our peers in the 
industry. Comparatives have been restated and an additional balance 
sheet presented as at 28 June 2009 to show the effect of these 
changes. The impact of this reclassification in the balance sheet is set 
out in notes 20 and 25. There is no effect on amounts reported in the 
income statement. 
Franchise bid costs 
A key part of the Group’s activities is the process of bidding for and 
securing franchises to operate rail services in the UK. All franchise bid 
costs incurred prior to achieving preferred bidder status are treated  
as an expense in the income statement irrespective of the ultimate 
outcome of the bid. Directly attributable, incremental costs incurred 
after achieving preferred bidder status are capitalised as an intangible 
asset and amortised over the life of the franchise. 
Profit and revenue sharing/support agreements 
The rail companies have certain revenue and, historically, profit sharing 
agreements with the DfT. An accrual is made within amounts payable 
to central Government for the estimated cost to the Group of the 
relevant amounts accrued at the balance sheet date. Payments are 
charged to operating costs. 
Revenue support is provided by the DfT typically in the last two years 
of a franchise. Receipts are shown in revenue.  The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 88
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Exceptional items 
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income 
statement those material items of revenue or expense which, because 
of the size or the nature and expected infrequency of the events 
giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow better 
understanding of financial performance. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on 
transition to IFRSs less accumulated depreciation and any impairment 
in value. Freehold land is not depreciated. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter  
of their expected useful lives and the lease terms. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement based on cost  
or fair value, less estimated residual value of each asset, evenly over  
its expected useful life as follows: 
Short leasehold land and buildings The life of the lease 
Freehold buildings and   Over 10 to 100 years 
long leasehold land and buildings  
Bus vehicles   Over 8 to 15 years 
Plant and equipment   Over 3 to 15 years 
The carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment  
are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  
If any such indication exists the assets are written down to their 
recoverable amount. 
Non-current assets held for sale 
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current 
assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be 
recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing 
use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should 
be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one 
year from the date of classification. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
(a) Business combinations since 4 July 2010 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of 
the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The 
choice of measurement of non-controlling interest, either at fair value 
or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable assets is 
determined on a transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs 
incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses. 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets 
and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation  
in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances 
and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the 
separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be 
recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to 
the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be 
an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either 
in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income. If the contingent 
consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until 
it is finally within equity. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate 
of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and 
the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest (and where 
the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date  
fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree) over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired  
and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination. 
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to  
the business combinations, such as the settlement of pre-existing 
relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements are 
accounted for separately from the business combination in 
accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs. Identifiable 
intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability 
criterion are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities 
representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition-date 
fair value can be measured reliably. 
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling 
interest (and where the business combination is achieved in stages, 
the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree) is lower than the fair value of the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing 
interest held in the business acquired, the difference is recognised in 
profit and loss. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the 
acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating  
units (or groups of cash generating units) that are expected to  
benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets  
or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit or 
group of units to which goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest 
level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment 
before aggregation. 
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of  
the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of 
the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the 
operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured 
based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the 
portion of the cash-generating unit retained. 
(b) Business combinations prior to 4 July 2010 
Acquisitions of businesses since 3 July 2004 are accounted for under 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations using the purchase method. Goodwill 
on acquisition is initially measured at cost being the excess of the 
costs of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, 
meeting the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 at the acquisition 
date. It is capitalised and carried as an asset on the balance sheet. If an 
acquisition gives rise to negative goodwill, this is released immediately 
to the income statement. 
In some instances certain fair value accounting adjustments are 
required to be made using provisional estimates, based on information 
available, and amendments are sometimes necessary in the 12 months 
following the acquisition, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.   Financial Statements 
www.go-ahead.com 89
 
 
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, 
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment  
is recognised immediately in the income statement and not 
subsequently reversed. For the purposes of impairment testing, 
goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored  
by management.  
Impairment of assets 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an 
indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, 
or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group 
makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount, being the higher 
of the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and 
its value in use. Value in use is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and  
the estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down  
to its recoverable amount.  
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the 
income statement in those expense categories consistent with  
the function of the impaired asset. An assessment is made at each 
reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously 
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have 
decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is 
estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed  
only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine 
the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss  
was recognised.  
The reinstated amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. After such a reversal 
the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the 
asset’s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic 
basis over its remaining useful life. 
Franchise assets 
Where the conditions relating to the award of a franchise require  
the Group to assume legal responsibility for any pension liability  
that exists at that point in time, the Group recognises a liability 
representing the fair value of the related net pension deficit that the 
Group expects to fund during the franchise term. When a pension 
deficit exists at the start of the franchise, a corresponding intangible 
asset is recognised, reflecting a cost in acquiring the right to operate 
the franchise. If a pension surplus exists at the start of the franchise, 
then a corresponding deferred income balance is recognised, 
representing a government grant. The intangible asset or deferred 
income balance is amortised through the income statement on  
a straight-line basis over the period of the franchise.  
The carrying value of franchise assets is reviewed for impairment at 
the end of the first financial year following the award of the franchise 
and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Software 
Software, that is not integral to the related hardware, is capitalised  
as an intangible asset and stated at cost less amortisation and any 
impairment in value. Amortisation is charged to the income statement 
evenly over its expected useful life of three to five years. 
Inventories 
Stocks of fuel and engineering spares are valued at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and costs 
incurred in bringing the items to their present location and condition. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs  
of sale. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and short term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash  
at bank and in hand, and short term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated cashflow 
statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.  
Financial assets and derivatives 
Financial assets are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39. Financial 
assets are initially recognised at fair value, being the transaction price 
plus directly attributable transaction costs.  
The Group uses energy derivatives to hedge its risks associated  
with fuel price fluctuations and interest derivatives to hedge its risks 
associated with interest rate fluctuations. Such derivatives are initially 
recognised at fair value by reference to market values for similar 
instruments, and subsequently re-measured at fair value at each 
balance sheet date. 
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are designated 
and effective as hedges of future cashflows are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. When the cashflow hedge 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, then  
at the time that asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or 
losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other 
comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of  
that non-financial asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the 
recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are 
recognised in the income statement in the period which the hedged 
item affects net profit or loss. 
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains  
or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the 
income statement as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative expires or  
is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover,  
or otherwise no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point  
in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in other comprehensive income is kept in equity until  
the forecast transaction occurs, at which point it is taken to the 
income statement or included in the initial carrying amount of the 
related non-financial asset as described above. If a hedged transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 
recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the 
income statement.  The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 90

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds, being  
the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue 
costs. Following initial recognition the carrying amount is measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortisation  
of liabilities and any gains and losses arising on the repurchase, 
settlement or other de-recognition of debt, are recognised directly  
in the income statement. 
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially 
all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to 
the Group, and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance 
sheet, with a corresponding liability being recognised, and are 
depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives and the lease terms.  
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire 
purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. 
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the 
income statement over the periods of the leases and hire purchase 
contracts and represents a constant proportion of the balance of 
capital repayments outstanding. 
Leases where a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals payable under operating leases, and the amortisation of lease 
incentives and initial direct costs in securing leases, are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that  
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and  
a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. If the effect is material, 
expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax  
rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be 
reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset  
but only when recovery is virtually certain. The expense relating  
to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any 
reimbursement. Where discounting is used, the increase in the 
provision due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a  
finance cost. 
As part of our regular review of reporting practices and policies, we 
have reclassified franchise commitments relating to dilapidations as a 
provision, as the Group has determined that there is no longer a 
sufficient degree of certainty to classify all of this liability as an accrual. 
Comparatives have been restated and an additional balance sheet 
presented as at 28 June 2009 to show the effect of these changes. 
The impact of this reclassification in the balance sheet is set out in 
notes 20 and 25. There is no effect on amounts reported in the 
income statement. 
Treasury shares 
Re-acquired shares in the Group, which remain uncancelled, are 
deducted from equity. Consideration paid and the associated costs 
are also recognised in shareholders’ funds as a separate reserve  
for own shares. Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of the Group’s shares is transferred from the reserve  
for own shares to revenue reserves. 
Retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of pension schemes; both defined 
benefit and defined contribution. The costs of these are recognised in 
the income statement within operating costs. As discussed below, the 
Group has invoked the provisions of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial 
Statements and has departed from the requirements of IAS 19 in 
respect of the Rail Pension Schemes (RPS). 
Non-rail schemes 
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is 
determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit 
method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period 
(to determine current service cost) and to the current and prior 
periods (to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation) 
and is based on actuarial advice. The interest element of the defined 
benefit cost represents the change in present value of obligations 
during the period, and is determined by applying the discount rate  
to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into 
account material changes in the obligation during the year. The 
expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the 
beginning of the year of long term market returns on scheme assets, 
adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions 
received and benefits paid during the year.  
The Group has applied the option under IAS 19 to recognise actuarial 
gains and losses in the statement of comprehensive income in the 
period in which they occur.  
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the 
interest cost, along with the current service cost, is recognised in the 
income statement within operating costs. 
The defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet 
comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality 
corporate bonds), less any past service cost not yet recognised and 
less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to  
be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information  
and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price. 
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the 
benefits have vested. When a settlement (eliminating all obligations 
for benefits already accrued) or a curtailment (reducing future 
obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme 
membership or a reduction in future entitlement) occurs, the 
obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current 
actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in  
the income statement during the period in which the settlement  
or curtailment occurs. 
Contributions payable under defined contribution schemes are 
charged to operating costs in the income statement as they fall due.   Financial Statements 
www.go-ahead.com 91
 
 
Rail schemes 
Our train operating companies participate in the RPS, a defined 
benefit scheme which covers the whole of the UK rail industry. This is 
partitioned into sections and the Group is responsible for the funding 
of these schemes whilst it operates the relevant franchise. In contrast 
to the pension schemes operated by most businesses, the RPS is a 
shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% 
employer and 40% employee. A liability or asset is recognised in line 
with other defined benefit schemes in the Group, although this is 
offset by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability or asset 
represents the deficit or surplus that the Group expects to fund or 
benefit from during the franchise term. This represents a departure 
from IAS 19 so as to present fairly the Group’s financial performance, 
position and cashflow in respect of its obligations for the RPS. 
Share-based payment transactions 
The cost of options granted to employees is measured by reference 
to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, determined by 
an external valuation using an appropriate pricing model. In granting 
equity-settled options conditions are linked to some or all of the 
following: the price of the shares of The Go-Ahead Group plc 
(‘market conditions’); to conditions not related to performance or 
service (‘non-vesting conditions’); and to earnings per share criteria. 
The cost of options is recognised in the income statement over the 
period from grant to vesting date, being the date on which the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award, with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense recognised 
at each reporting date reflects the extent to which the period to 
vesting has expired and the Directors’ best estimate of the number  
of options that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument 
subject to a market or non-vesting condition, be treated as vesting  
as described above. This includes any award where non-vesting 
conditions within the control of the Group or the employee are  
not met. 
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except 
for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or  
not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all 
other performance conditions are satisfied. Where an equity-settled  
award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date  
of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised for the award  
is recognised immediately.  
Taxation 
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities  
on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
when the related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based  
on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base of  
assets and liabilities for taxation purposes and their carrying amounts 
in the financial statements. It is provided for on all temporary 
differences, except: 
• on the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of 
the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss; and 
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal  
of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is  
probable that the temporary differences will not reverse  
in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that the temporary differences will be reversed in the 
foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available to allow all  
or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. The carrying 
amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date 
and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred 
income tax asset to be utilised.  
Tax relating to items recognised outside the income statement  
is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity  
in correlation with the underlying transaction. Otherwise, tax is 
recognised in the income statement.

3. Segmental analysis 
In prior years the Group has been organised into three core divisions, Bus, Rail and Aviation Service, which formed the basis for the Group’s 
reportable segments. Following the sale of residual ground handling activities at Heathrow Terminal I and Meteor Parking this year, management 
has reviewed the basis for segment reporting and concluded that there should be four reportable segments, Deregulated Bus, Regulated Bus, 
Rail and Go-Ahead North America. Comparative disclosures have been restated to reflect the new basis of segmentation. Operating segments 
within those reportable divisions are combined on the basis of their long term characteristics and similar nature of their products and services,  
as follows; 
The Deregulated Bus division comprises bus operations outside of London. 
The Regulated Bus division comprises bus operations in London.  
The Rail operation, Govia, is 65% owned by Go-Ahead and 35% by Keolis and comprises three rail franchises: Southern, Southeastern and 
London Midland. 
The Go-Ahead North America division comprises a 50% investment in a US school bus operation. The Group’s share of the profit of this 
division is currently £nil, and it is therefore not included within the tables below. 
The information reported to the Group Chief Executive in his capacity as Chief Operating Decision Maker does not include an analysis of assets 
and liabilities and accordingly IFRS 8 does not require this information to be presented. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating 
profit or loss excluding amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets and exceptional items. 
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis similar to transactions with third parties.  
The following tables present information regarding the Group’s reportable segments for the year ended 2 July 2011 and the year ended  
3 July 2010. Information relating to prior periods has been restated to reflect those elements of the other services division that are classified  
as discontinued operations and to report separately our regulated bus operations in London.   Financial Statements

Sharesave Scheme 
The Group previously operated an HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) approved savings-related share option scheme, known as The  
Go-Ahead Group plc Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 2003 (the ‘Sharesave Scheme’). The Sharesave Scheme was open to all Group 
employees (including Executive Directors) who had completed at least six months’ service with a Group company at the date they were  
invited to participate in the scheme. No invitations have been made during the current or prior year and no accounts remain outstanding. 
The expense recognised for these schemes during the year to 2 July 2011 was £nil (2010: £0.5m).    Financial Statements

was £13.18. 
There were no options outstanding at the end of the year. The exercise price for options outstanding at the end of 2010 was £19.14. 
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The key assumptions input into the model are future share price volatility, future 
dividend yield, future risk free interest rate, forfeiture rate and option life.  
Share incentive plans 
The Company operates an HMRC approved share incentive plan, known as The Go-Ahead Group plc Share Incentive Plan (the SIP). The SIP  
is open to all Group employees (including Executive Directors) who have completed at least six months’ service with a Group company at the 
date they are invited to participate in the plan. 
The SIP permits the Company to make four different types of awards to employees (free shares, partnership shares, matching shares and 
dividend shares), although the Company has, so far, made awards of partnership shares only. Under these awards, the Company invites 
qualifying employees to apply between £10 and £125 per month in acquiring shares in the Company at the prevailing market price. Under  
the terms of the scheme, certain tax advantages are available to the Company and employees. 
Long term incentive plans  
The Executive Directors participate in The Go-Ahead Group Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 (the LTIP). The LTIP provides for Executive 
Directors and certain other senior employees to be awarded shares in the Company conditional on specified performance conditions being  
met over a period of three years. Refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report for further details of the LTIP. 
The expense recognised for the LTIP during the year to 2 July 2011 was £0.4m (2010: £0.2m). 
The fair value of LTIP options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. The inputs to the model used for the options granted in the year to 2 July 2011 were:

has announced its intention to further reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 24% by 1 April 2014. If this reduction had been enacted by  
2 July 2011 the Group’s deferred tax liability would have been reduced by a further £3.9m to £47.0m and the deferred tax asset would have 
been reduced by a further £1.5m to £18.5m.  
The Group’s future tax charge will also be affected by the Government’s intention to reduce the main rate of capital allowance from 20%  
to 18% and from 10% to 8% with effect from 1 April 2012.  The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 104

Rail franchise asset 
This reflects the cost of the right to operate a rail franchise. The brought forward element of the franchise intangible is made up of £17.1m 
relating to the opening deficit in the RPS and £7.8m relating to the cost of the intangible asset acquired on the handover of the franchise assets 
relating to the Southeastern rail franchise. The intangible asset is being amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the franchises (being 
between five and eight years).  
Software costs 
Software costs capitalised exclude software that is integral to the related hardware.  
Customer contracts 
This relates to the value attributed to customer contracts and relationships purchased as part of the Group’s acquisitions. The value is calculated 
based on the unexpired term of the contracts at the date of acquisition and is amortised over that period. 
Impairment 
During the year ended 3 July 2010 an impairment review of the aviation services division resulted in the goodwill of Meteor Parking of £18.4m 
being written down to £2.2m. During the year ended 2 July 2011, Meteor Parking was sold and therefore there is no goodwill left relating to 
Meteor Parking at the year end.  The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 108

14. Intangible assets continued 
Goodwill 
As from 3 July 2004, goodwill is no longer amortised and is tested annually for impairment. 
The goodwill charge of £nil (2010: £1.1m) is in respect of rail businesses which, due to the finite nature of the franchises, require the goodwill  
to be impaired annually. 
Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to individual cash-generating units for impairment testing on the basis of the Group’s 
business operations. The carrying value of goodwill by cash-generating unit is as follows: 
 
2011 
£m 
2010
£m 
Meteor Parking – 2.2
Metrobus 10.6 10.6
Go South Coast 28.6 28.6
Brighton & Hove 2.1 2.1
Plymouth Citybus 13.0 13.0
Go-Ahead London 10.5 10.5
Go North East 2.7 2.7
Konectbus 3.6 3.6
Thames Travel 2.7 –
 73.8 73.3
The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation for each cash-generating unit, using cashflow 
projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three-year period which have then been 
extended over an appropriate period. The Directors feel that the extended period is justified because of the long term stability of the relevant 
income streams. Growth has been extrapolated forward from the end of the three year forecasts over the extended period plus a terminal 
value using a growth rate of 2.25%-3.0% which reflects the Directors’ view of long term growth rates in each business. 
The pre-tax cashflows for all cash-generating units have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.0% (2010: 11.1%), based on  
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, plus an appropriate risk premium for each cash-generating unit of 0.0-2.0% (2010: 0.0-2.0%). 
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the forecast operating cashflows, the discount rate and the 
growth rate used to extrapolate cashflows beyond the budget period. The operating cashflows are based on assumptions of revenue, staff  
costs and general overheads. These assumptions are influenced by several internal and external factors. 
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each unit and to be realistically achievable in 
light of economic and industry measures and forecasts. We have conducted sensitivity analysis on our calculations and confirmed that there is 
no likely movement on assumptions that would lead to an impairment. The cash generating unit with the least headroom is Plymouth Citybus, 
as expected given it has only recently been acquired. The headroom on Plymouth Citybus is £1.1m. An increase of 1% of the Group’s weighted 
cost of capital would result in an impairment of less than £1m.   Financial Statements

15. Business combinations 
Year ended 2 July 2011 
On 24 May 2011, Go-Ahead Holding Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired 100% of the share capital of Thames Travel 
(Wallingford) Limited for a cash consideration of £3.5m. Thames Travel carries around 3 million passengers per year in South Oxfordshire and 
West Berkshire and generates turnover of around £5.5m.

Acquisition costs of £0.1m have been expensed through other operating costs. 
Receivables have been assessed and are considered to be recoverable. 
The goodwill capitalised reflects the access to the markets served by the acquired entities and the potential business synergies that can be 
achieved upon acquisition. Management believes that goodwill represents future growth opportunities and created value in respect of customer 
awareness and an assembled workforce for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.  
From the date of acquisition, in the year ended 2 July 2011, the acquisitions recorded an operating profit of £nil to the Group and revenue of 
£0.5m. Had the combinations taken place at the beginning of the year, it is estimated that they would have recorded £0.4m of operating profit 
and £5.5m of revenue to the Group. This would have resulted in total Group revenue from continuing operations of £2,302.5m, and total 
operating profit from continuing operations (before amortisation and exceptional items) of £115.5m. 
Year ended 3 July 2010 
On 3 October 2009, London General Transport Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the assets of East Thames 
Buses from Transport for London (‘TfL’) for a total cash consideration of £5.0m. East Thames Buses operated a fleet of approximately 120 
vehicles over nine TfL contracted routes. 
On 3 October 2009, Metrobus Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the assets of Arriva’s bus interest in Horsham for a 
total cash consideration of £5.0m. The interests include a fleet of 18 vehicles and 58 employees, and will operate as part of Metrobus Limited 
which provides bus services in Sussex, Surrey and Kent including regulated services for TfL. 
On 1 December 2009, Go-Ahead Holding Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired 100% of the share capital of Plymouth 
Citybus Limited from Plymouth City Council for a cash consideration of £19.0m. Plymouth Citybus operates a fleet of 175 vehicles and employs 
approximately 470 employees in the Plymouth area.  
On 9 March 2010, Go-Ahead Holding Limited also acquired 100% of the share capital of Konectbus Limited which operates a bus fleet  
of 44 vehicles and employs approximately 70 employees in the Norfolk area. On 28 March 2010, Go North East Limited, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Group, entered into a contract to acquire the Hexham operations of Arriva plc for a cash consideration and agreed to sell  
Go North East’s Ashington operations to Arriva. The operations became effective April 2010. The combined consideration for these 
acquisitions was £8.2m.   The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 110

Cash at bank and in hand earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short term deposits are made for varying periods of 
between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective deposit 
rates. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is not materially different from book value. 
Amounts held by rail companies included in cash at bank and on short term deposit can be distributed only with the agreement of the DfT, 
normally up to the value of revenue reserves or based on a working capital formula agreed with the DfT. As at 2 July 2011, balances amounting 
to £189.7m (2010: £204.0m) were restricted. Part of this amount is to cover deferred income for season tickets which was £104.8m at

• Other payables are non-interest-bearing and have varying terms of up to 12 months. 
As described in note 2, accruals for uninsured liabilities and certain franchise commitments have been reclassified as provisions. Accordingly, 
trade and other payables as at 3 July 2010 have been reduced by £13.2m (2009: £13.1m) relating to liabilities for franchise commitments and 
uninsured claims accruals of £40.0m in 2010 (2009: £40.2m) have been reclassified from trade and other payables and included in provisions.  
As part of this revised presentation, the Group has re-assessed the analysis of these obligations between current and non current to reflect 
management’s estimate of the timing of settlements.   Financial Statements

Syndicated loan facility 
On 3 February 2011 the Group re-financed and entered into a new £275.0m five year syndicated loan facility, replacing the previous £280.0m 
syndicated loan facility. The new loan facility is unsecured and interest is charged at LIBOR + Margin, where the margin is dependent upon the 
gearing of the Group. 
As at 2 July 2011, £84.0m (2010: £103.0m) of the facility was drawn down.  
£200m Sterling 7.5 Year Bond 
On 24 March 2010, the Group raised a £200m bond of 7.5 years maturing on 29 September 2017 with a coupon rate of 5.375%.

$6.2m or £3.9m of this facility was drawn down. 
The dollar loan is unsecured and interest is charged at US$ LIBOR + Margin. 
Debt issue costs 
There are debt issue costs of £2.0m (2010: £0.7m) on the syndicated loan facility and £nil (2010: £nil) on medium term loans. 
The £200m sterling 7.5 year bond has debt issue costs of £2.3m (2010: £2.7m). 
The Group is subject to two covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities. The covenants specify a maximum adjusted net debt to EBITDA 
and a minimum net interest cover. At the year end and throughout the year, the Group has not been in breach of any bank covenants.    Financial Statements

23. Financial risk management objectives and policies 
Financial risk factors and management 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, a sterling bond, hire purchase and finance lease contracts, and cash and short 
term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide an appropriate level of net debt to fund the Group’s activities, 
namely working capital, fixed asset expenditure, acquisitions, dividends and share buybacks. The Group has various other financial instruments 
such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations. 
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and fuel swaps. The purpose of these is to manage the interest 
rate and fuel price risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. 
It is, and has been throughout 2011 and 2010, the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken and derivatives are only 
purchased for internal benefit. 
The main financial risks arising from the Group’s activities are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Risks arising from fuel derivatives are 
explained in note 24.  The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 116

23. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued 
Interest rate risk 
The Group borrows and deposits funds and is exposed to changes in interest rates. The Board’s policy toward cash deposits is to deposit cash 
short term on UK money markets. Interest payable on senior bank borrowings is based on re-fixing the rate of interest over short periods of 
time of up to 36 months. During the year the Group has partially managed interest rate risk by hedging. Excluding fixed rate debt, the Group 
has net borrowings and hence the present adverse risk is an increase in interest rates.

Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on financial instruments classified 
as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables 
are non-interest-bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.   Financial Statements

At 2 July 2011, the Group had four interest rate swaps totalling £130.0m. One of these interest rate swaps fixes the interest on part of  
the variable rate syndicated loan – £50.0m was fixed at 2.39% plus margin until December 2012. The remaining three interest rate swaps 
totalling £80.0m are now ineffective. During the year ended 2 July 2011, these four interest swaps have resulted in a realised loss of £2.1m 
(2010: £3.0m). 
These swaps result in a net fixed rate liability of £2.0m at 2 July 2011 (2010: £3.4m liability). Hence the adverse risk at year end is a decrease  
in interest rates.

Liquidity risk 
The Group has in place a £275.0m syndicated loan facility which allows the Group to maintain liquidity within the desired gearing range.  
Available liquidity as at 2 July 2011 was as follows:

2010
£m 
Amount drawn down under syndicated loan facility 84.0 103.0
Total available facility 275.0 280.0
Headroom 191.0 177.0
On 24 March 2010, the Group raised a £200m bond of 7.5 years maturing on 29 September 2017. The level of drawdown and prevailing 
interest rates are detailed in note 21.  
The Group’s road passenger vehicles can be financed by hire purchase or finance lease arrangements, or term loans at fixed rates of interest 
over two to five year primary borrowing periods. This provides a regular inflow of funding to cover expenditure as it arises. 
Foreign currency risk 
On 26 July 2010, a $10.0m facility was agreed with RBS to ensure dollar investment in our US joint venture is funded by dollar borrowings  
to provide an effective foreign currency hedge. 
The amount drawn on the facility reflects the investment in and the working capital requirements of the Group’s share in its US joint venture. 
As the investment and borrowings are both denominated in US $ this provides a natural hedge over the Group’s foreign currency exposure. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash deposits (see note 18). The maximum credit risk exposure of 
the Group comprises the amounts presented in the balance sheet, which are stated net of provisions for doubtful debt. A provision is made 
where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of future cashflows. 
The majority of the Group’s receivables are with public (or quasi-public) bodies (such as the DfT). The Group does not consider these 
counterparties to be a significant credit risk. Outside of this, the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.  
Risk of exposure to non-return of cash on deposit is managed through a treasury policy of holding deposits with banks rated A+ or Aa3  
or above by at least one of the credit rating agencies. Our treasury policy outlines the maximum level of deposit that can be placed with  
any one given financial institution.  The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 118

Managing capital 
During the year the Group obtained investment grade long term credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s as follows: 
Standard & Poor’s  BBB – (Stable outlook) 
Moody’s  Baa3 (Stable outlook) 
The Group manages its capital structure such that net debt (adjusted to exclude restricted cash) to EBITDA (before exceptionals) is within  
a range which retains an investment grade debt rating. Adjusted net debt at the year end was £259.5m (2010: £292.3m), equivalent to  
1.58x (2010 restated: 1.94x) EBITDA in line with the Group’s aim to maintain an adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x to 2.5x through  
the cycle. 
Operating leases 
The Group uses operating leases for bus and coach purchases across the Group primarily where the vehicles service specific contracts to 
mitigate the risk of ownership at the end of the contract. This results in £1.5m (2010: £1.2m) of cost within operating charges which would 
otherwise have been charged to interest. The Group holds operating leases for its bus fleet with an asset capital value of 38.0m (2010: £31.2m). 
The majority of assets in the rail division are financed by operating leases, in particular rolling stock. Leases are entered into by the respective 
operating companies and are not the subject of parent company guarantees.   Financial Statements

The fair value of all other assets and liabilities in notes 18, 20 and 21 is not significantly different to their carrying amount with the exception  
of the £200m sterling 7.5 year bond which has a fair value of £207.0m but is carried at its amortised cost of £200.0m. The fair value of the 
£200m sterling 7.5 year bond has been determined by reference to the price available from the market on which the bond is traded. The fuel 
price derivatives and interest rate swaps were valued externally by the respective banks by comparison with the market fuel price for the 
relevant date. 
All other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates. 
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: 
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: 
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or 
indirectly; and 
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. 
As at 2 July 2011, the Group has used a level 2 valuation technique to determine the fair value of all financial instruments. During the year 
ended 2 July 2011, there were no transfers between valuation levels. 
b. Hedging activities 
Fuel derivatives 
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of fuel usage. The Group closely monitors fuel prices and uses fuel derivatives  
to hedge its exposure to increases in fuel prices, when it deems appropriate.  
At the year end, the Group had various fuel price swaps in place. For the 2012, 2013 and 2014 financial years cashflow hedges were placed 
over 122, 72 and 31 million litres of fuel respectively. The fair value of the asset or liability has been recognised on the balance sheet. The value 
has been generated since the date of the acquisition of the instruments due to the movement in market fuel prices. 
As at 2 July 2011 the Group had derivatives against bus fuel of 105 million litres for the year ending 30 June 2012, representing approximately 
91.0% of the anticipated fuel usage in our bus division. As at 2 July 2011 the Group also had derivatives against bus fuel for the 2013 and 2014 
financial years of 58 and 31 million litres respectively.  
As at 2 July 2011 the Group had derivatives against rail fuel of 17 million litres for the year ending 30 June 2011, representing the anticipated 
fuel usage in London Midland and Southern. As at 2 July 2011 the Group also had further derivatives for the 2013 financial year of 14 million 
litres of rail fuel.  The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 120

At 2 July 2011 the depots provision has been maintained at £7.3m, representing ongoing legal actions relating to planning consent issues 
expected to be incurred within four years. 
During the year ended 2 July 2011 the onerous contract provision in the aviation services division reduced from £0.6m to £nil as a result of  
the sale of the remaining aviation services in the year. The onerous contract provision in the bus division reduced from £1.0m to £0.4m as the 
expected costs were incurred on operating lease commitments served by articulated buses being phased out. Onerous contracts provisions are 
expected to be incurred within three years, with £0.2m being classified as current. 
Franchise commitments comprise £40.1m dilapidation provisions on vehicles, depots and stations across our three active rail franchises and 
£4.7m claims of other disputes. Of the dilapidation provisions, £1.4m are classified as current, and all of the £4.7m income claims are classified 
as current. The provisions are based on management’s assessment of most probable outcomes, supported where appropriate by valuations 
from professional external advisers. The dilapidations will be incurred as part of a rolling maintenance contract  
over the next six years. 
Following a management review, it was decided that uninsured claims be classified as provisions given the expected timing and nature of  
these claims. Of the uninsured claims, £15.6m are classified as current and £33.4m are classified as non current based on past experience of 
uninsured claims paid out annually. It is estimated that the majority of uninsured claims will be settled within the next six years. 
Provisions at 27 June 2009 have been increased by the uninsured claims liability of £40.2m and by £13.1m in respect of franchise commitments, 
previously included within trade and other payables. Provisions at 3 July 2010 have been increased by the uninsured claims liability of £40.0m 
and by £13.2m in respect of franchise commitments, previously included within trade and other payables. The accounting policies in note 2

The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. 
Share capital 
Share capital represents proceeds on issue of the Company’s equity, both nominal value and share premium. 
Reserve for own shares 
The reserve for own shares is in respect of 4,034,657 ordinary shares (8.6% of share capital), of which 132,427 are held for Directors’ bonus 
plans and LTIP arrangements. 
The remaining shares were purchased in order to enhance shareholders’ returns and are being held as treasury shares for future issue in 
appropriate circumstances. During the year ended 2 July 2011 the Company has purchased 58,632 shares (2010: 26,447 shares) for potential 
LTIP awards that may vest in the future (and Directors’ bonus plans 2010). A consideration of £0.8m (2010: £0.3m) including expenses was 
made for the shares purchased during the year. The Company has not cancelled any shares during the year (2010: no shares). 
Other reserve 
The other reserve represents the premium on shares that have been issued to fund or part fund acquisitions made by the Group.  
This treatment is in line with Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve records the movement in value of fuel price derivatives, offset by any movements recognised directly in equity. 
Capital redemption reserve 
The redemption reserve reflects the nominal value of cancelled shares.

Performance bonds 
The Group has provided bank guaranteed performance bonds of £87.1m (2010: £111.0m), and season ticket bonds of £128.6m (2010: 
£116.7m) to the DfT in support of the Group’s rail franchise operations.  
These bonds are supported by a 65% several guarantee from The Go-Ahead Group plc and a 35% several guarantee from Keolis S.A. 
To support subsidiary companies in their normal course of business, the Group has indemnified certain banks and insurance companies who 
have issued certain performance bonds and a letter of credit. The letter of credit at 2 July 2011 is £38.0m (2010: £35.0m).

The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan 
For the majority of non-rail employees, the Group operates one main pension scheme, The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan (the ‘Go-Ahead 
Plan’), which consists of a funded defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution section as follows: 
The defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is not contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new 
entrants. The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is £5.2m (2010: £5.4m) being the contributions 
paid and payable. 
The defined benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benefits based on a 
member’s final salary. The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Contributions to this section are assessed in 
accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. The section is effectively closed to new entrants. As a result, it can be expected 
that the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll. However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total 
pensionable payroll. 
The Go-Ahead Plan is a Group plan for related companies where risks are shared. The overall costs of the Go-Ahead Plan have been 
recognised in the Group’s financial statements according to IAS 19. Each of the participating companies accounts on the basis of contributions 
paid by that company. The Group accounts for the difference between the aggregate IAS 19 cost of the scheme and the aggregate 
contributions paid. 
Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme and Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan 
Some employees of our Go South Coast operations participate in the Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme or the Southern Vectis Group Pension 
Plan. These are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme. Contributions to 
the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. The schemes are closed to new entrants, however 
eligible employees can join the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan. 
The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of the Wilts & Dorset Scheme and Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan is £0.1m 
(2010: £01.m) being the contributions paid and payable.    Financial Statements

Other pension plans 
A defined benefit plan exists for a small number of employees who transferred from East Thames Buses. Similarly some employees of Plymouth 
Citybus have entitlement to a Devon County Council defined benefit plan. Both schemes are externally funded. Contributions to the scheme 
are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. Both schemes are now closed to new entrants. 
Other pension arrangements 
A small number of employees in aviance had access to separate defined contribution pension arrangements as part of legacy agreements.  
The expense recognised for this is £nil (2010: £0.1m), being the contributions paid.

The expected return on assets has been derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes  
(i.e. equities and bonds). The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking 
views of the financial markets (suggested by the yields available), and the views of investment organisations.  
Sensitivity analysis 
In making the valuation, the above assumptions have been used. For non-rail pension schemes, the following is an approximate sensitivity 
analysis of the impact of the change in the key assumptions. In isolation the following adjustments would adjust the pension deficit and cost  
as shown.

Rail schemes 
The Railways Pension Scheme (the RPS) 
The majority of employees in our train operating companies are members of sections of the RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme. The RPS  
is a shared costs scheme, with assets and liabilities split 60%/40% between the franchise holder/employee respectively. The RPS sections are all 
open to new entrants and the assets and liabilities of each company’s section are separately identifiable and segregated for funding purposes. 
In addition to the defined benefit cost, BRASS matching AVC company contributions of £0.9m (2010: £1.2m) were paid in the year. 
It is our experience that all pension obligations to the RPS cease on expiry of the franchises without cash or other settlement, and therefore the 
obligations recognised on the balance sheet under IAS 19 are only those that are expected to be funded during the franchise term. However, in 
spite of our past experience and that of other train operating companies proving otherwise, our legal obligations are not restricted. On entering 
into a franchise, the operator becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the RPS rules is obliged to meet the 
schedule of contributions agreed with the scheme trustees and actuaries, in respect of which no funding cap is set out in the franchise contract.

IAS 19 would require the Group to account for its legal obligation under the formal terms of the RPS and its constructive obligation under  
the terms of each franchise agreement. Following industry practice, the Group has concluded that the appropriate accounting policy for the  
RPS to ensure that the financial statements present fairly the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cashflows, is to recognise its 
constructive but not its legal RPS defined benefit obligations. In all other respects the Group’s accounting policy is consistent with IAS 19 and 
the treatment adopted for non-rail defined benefit schemes. In doing so, the Group has applied the provisions of paragraph 17 of IAS 1 and 
departed from the requirements of IAS 19 in order to achieve a fair presentation of the Group’s obligations regarding its rail schemes and 
prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new franchise owner at exit. 
The total surplus or deficit recorded is adjusted by way of a ‘franchise adjustment’, which is that portion of the deficit or surplus projected  
to exist at the end of the franchise which the Group will not be required to fund or benefit from.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF  
GO-AHEAD GROUP PLC 
 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of the  
Go-Ahead Group Plc for the year ended 2 July 2011 which comprise 
the parent company balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 15.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to  
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility  
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions  
we have formed.  
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 80, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied  
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit  
and express an opinion on the parent company financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply  
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the annual report and accounts to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements  
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs  
as at 2 July 2011; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited  
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters  
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the  
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have  
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not  
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by  
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements  
of the Go-Ahead Group plc for the year ended 2 July 2011.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION TO THE  
PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.  
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.  
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:  
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;  
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;  
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and  
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis  
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.  
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They  
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities.  
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.  The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 132
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
1. Parent company accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as 
required by the Companies Act 2006 and were approved for issue  
on 31 August 2011. They have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. 
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as  
permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and the 
Company has taken the exemptions under FRS 1 to not present  
a cashflow statement.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available to 
parent companies under FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures so 
as not to provide the information otherwise required by the standard, 
as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the 
Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group 
under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. 
Tangible fixed assets 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Freehold land 
is not depreciated. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter  
of their expected useful lives and the lease terms. 
Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account based on cost 
or valuation, less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over  
its expected useful life as follows: 
Short leasehold land and buildings The life of the lease 
Freehold buildings and  
long leasehold land and buildings Over 10 to 100 years 
Plant and equipment   Over 3 to 15 years 
The carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment  
are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  
If any such indication exists the assets are written down to their 
recoverable amount. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at 
cost less provision for impairment. 
Pension benefits 
The Company is a member of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan 
operated by The Go-Ahead Group plc for the majority of its 
employees. This defined benefit scheme is a multi-employer scheme 
for which the individual employer’s share of the underlying assets and 
liabilities cannot be identified and accordingly the Company accounts 
for them as defined contribution schemes. 
For the defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the 
profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-
retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year. 
Differences between contributions payable in the year and 
contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or 
prepayments in the balance sheet. 
Share based payments 
Amendment to FRS 20 
The amendment clarifies the accounting for Group cash-settled share 
based payment transactions, where a subsidiary receives goods or 
services from employees or suppliers but the parent or another entity 
in the Group pays for those goods or services.  
Adoption of the amendment to FRS 20 did not have a material 
impact on the financial performance or position of the Company. 
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provision  
of FRS 20 and has applied FRS20 only to those options granted  
after 7 November 2002. The cost of options granted to employees  
is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they  
are granted, determined by an external valuation using an appropriate 
pricing model. In valuing equity-settled options, no account is taken  
of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the 
price of the shares of The Go-Ahead Group plc (‘market conditions’), 
to conditions not related to performance or service (‘non-vesting 
conditions’) and to earnings per share criteria. 
The cost of options is recognised in the profit and loss account  
over the period from grant to vesting date, being the date on which 
the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award, with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The cumulative expense recognised, 
at each reporting date, reflects the extent to which the period to 
vesting has expired and the Directors’ best estimate of the number  
of options that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument 
subject to a market or non-vesting condition, be treated as vesting  
as described above. This includes any award where non-vesting 
conditions within the control of the Group or the employee are  
not met. 
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except 
for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or  
not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all 
other performance conditions are satisfied. Where an equity-settled 
award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of 
cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised for the award is 
recognised immediately.  
Deferred tax 
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes 
into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. 
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences which have 
originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date. Except where 
otherwise required by accounting standards, no timing differences are 
recognised in respect of: 
• property revaluation surpluses where there is no commitment to 
sell the asset; 
• gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over 
into replacement assets; 
• deferred tax assets except to the extent that it is more likely than 
not that they will be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the enacted rates at which it is estimated 
the tax will be payable. The deferred tax provision is not discounted 
to net present value.   Financial Statements 
www.go-ahead.com 133
 
 
Uninsured liabilities 
The Company limits its exposure to the cost of motor, employer and 
public liability claims through insurance policies issued by third parties. 
These provide individual claim cover, subject to high excess limits and 
an annual aggregate stop loss for total claims within the excess limits. 
A liability is recognised for the estimated cost to the Company to 
settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, 
subject to the overall stop loss.  
The estimation of this liability is made after taking appropriate 
professional advice and is based on an assessment of the expected 
settlement on known claims, together with an estimate of settlements 
that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance 
sheet date but that have not yet been reported to the Company. 
The Group has accumulated considerable experience in the 
evaluation and management of such claims and has historically 
classified this liability as an accrual within the current liabilities.  
As part of our regular review of reporting practices and policies,  
we have given full consideration to the classification of this liability  
in the balance sheet. In light of developing trends relating to the 
nature of claims and the increasing time involved in their resolution, 
the Group has determined that there is no longer a sufficient degree 
of certainty to classify all of this liability as an accrual rather than as a 
provision. As a result, this liability is now classified within provisions 
and accompanied by the disclosures relating to their creation, 
utilisation and re-measurement of these obligations. We believe that 
this change in presentation provides more relevant information and 
aids comparability with our peers in the industry. Comparatives have 
been restated to show the effect of these changes. 
The impact of this reclassification on the balance sheet is set out  
in notes 5 and 7. There is no effect on amounts reported in the 
income statement. 
Treasury shares 
Re-acquired shares in the Company, which remain uncancelled,  
are deducted from equity. Consideration paid and the associated 
costs are also recognised in shareholders’ funds as a separate reserve 
for own shares. Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of the Company’s shares is transferred from the reserve 
for own shares to profit and loss. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are accounted for in accordance with FRS 26.  
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, being the 
transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs. 
The Company uses energy derivatives to hedge its risks associated 
with fuel price fluctuations. Such derivatives are initially recognised at 
fair value by reference to market values for similar instruments, and 
subsequently remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date. 
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are designated 
and effective as hedges of future cashflows are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the profit and loss account. When the cashflow hedge 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, then  
at the time that asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or 
losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other 
comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of that 
non-financial asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the 
recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are 
recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which the 
hedged item affects net profit or loss. 
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains  
or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the 
profit and loss account as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative expires or  
is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover,  
or otherwise no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point  
in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in other comprehensive income is kept in equity until  
the forecast transaction occurs, at which point it is taken to the profit 
and loss account or included in the initial carrying amount of the 
related non-financial asset as described above. If a hedged transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 
recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the profit 
and loss account. 
Leasing commitments 
Leases where a significant portion of all the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals payable under operating leases, and the amortisation of lease 
incentives and initial direct costs in securing leases, are charged to the 
profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Debt 
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds, being the 
fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs. 
Following initial recognition the carrying amount is measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortisation of 
liabilities and any gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement 
or other derecognition of debt are recognised directly in the profit 
and loss account.  The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 134

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
8. Pension commitments 
Defined contribution: 
The Company participates in the defined contribution scheme of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan. This scheme is not contracted-out of  
the State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new entrants. The expense recognised in these accounts for the year is £0.2m (2010: £0.1m) 
being the contributions paid and payable.  
Defined benefit: 
The Company participates in a scheme which is part of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan. The assets of the scheme are held separately  
from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.  
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2009 and was updated by Towers Watson LLP to take account of the 
requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 2 July 2011 and 3 July 2010. The contributions paid to the scheme are 
paid in line with the schedule of contributions, being 13.3% and 11.2% of pensionable salaries paid to upper and lower tier sections respectively.  
The defined benefit scheme is effectively closed to new entrants. As a result it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future,  
as a percentage of payroll. However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.  
The scheme is a multi-employer scheme and in accordance with FRS 17, the Company has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as  
if it were a defined contribution scheme because it is not possible to identify the Company’s share of the net assets and liabilities in the scheme 
on a consistent and reasonable basis due to the high volume of members/pensioners and the historic interaction between Group companies.  
The following disclosures provide details of the entire defined benefit scheme.

via the Company’s website: www.go-ahead.com. Receiving the 
Company’s communications electronically offers advantages 
in terms of speed and convenience; it is a secure method of 
delivering shareholder documentation and allows the Company  
to communicate with its shareholders in a more environmentally 
and cost effective way. 
If you have not done so already, and now wish to register to 
receive future shareholder communications electronically, please 
sign up via Shareview (details under ‘Managing your shares’ 
above). The default option during this online registration is that 
your preferred method of delivery of Company communications 
is electronic. 
Dividend payments
Dividends are paid in April and November each year. We 
recommend that all shareholders have their dividends paid directly 
into their bank or building society account. This is more secure 
than receiving your dividend by cheque which could be slow 
to arrive or get lost in the post. The dividend is paid into your 
account on the payment date which means you do not have to 
wait for a cheque to clear before the funds are available. We will 
send you a tax voucher following each dividend payment. T o select 
this method of dividend payment, please contact Equiniti.
Duplicate documents
Many of our shareholders have more than one account on the 
share register, which means they receive duplicate documentation 
and split dividend payments. T o request that your accounts be 
combined, please contact Equiniti. 
Shareholder security 
Shareholders are advised to be extremely cautious of any 
unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount, or offers of 
free reports about the Company. The Company does not endorse 
any specific share dealing facilities and will not pass on shareholder 
information to any third party, however, the Company’s register is, 
by law, open to public inspection. Any requests for access to the 
register are subject to ‘proper purpose’ requirements to ensure 
that the information is not used unlawfully.

Company information 3 Annual report 2012
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the annual report and accounts of Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc for
the year ended 31 December 2012. This was a successful year for Nostra Terra. We continued to
implement our growth strategy, expanding both our asset base and our production.
Exploration & production highlights
A key development in 2012 was our acquisition of a 20% interest in the Chisholm Trail Prospect. The
first four wells have all exceeded our expectations, contributing to greater revenues for Nostra Terra
and helping us to pass breakeven on an operational basis in January 2013. A horizontal well in the
Warrior Prospect began producing in the first half of the year and a well at the Bale Creek Prospect
was producing oil and generating revenue by November. The initial Verde well has exceeded our
expectations, reaching payout within nine months. In March 2013, we purchased a 5% working interest
(“WI”) in the High Plains Prospect in Texas, which we have since increased to 20%. High Plains gives
us a higher-risk exploration opportunity, with large upside potential. We are now identifying potential
drill targets and expect to have multiple prospect areas.
Financial highlights
Growth in production led to higher revenues, which increased from £244,000 in 2011 to £352,000 in
2012, a rise of 44%. We achieved a gross profit of £90,000, compared with a loss of £126,000 in the
previous year. As the company grows we keep tight control of administrative expenses, which decreased
by  6% to £876,000. This contributed to a reduced loss before tax of £840,000, against a loss of
£996,000 in 2011.
I am pleased to report that as we moved into 2013 production increased significantly, enabling us to
achieve break even on an operational basis. We were also successful with our litigation with Richfield
leading to a judgment, enabling us to begin collection.
Summary
Nostra Terra made strong progress in 2012. We are encouraged by the start we have made to 2013
and believe we are well positioned to achieve further success. I would like to thank our executive
directors, Matt Lofgran and Alden McCall, for their considerable achievements and their hard work,
which includes significant analysis of the many opportunities they decided not to pursue. I also wish to
thank Nostra Terra’s shareholders for their continuing loyalty. We look forward to keeping you informed
about our progress.

Chairman’s statement 4 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
Chief Executive’s review
Nostra Terra is an exploration and production company, focused on finding and producing oil from conventional
reservoirs. We accelerate production by applying modern technologies, including 3D seismic mapping, logging, precision
horizontal and vertical drilling, and multi-stage well completions. 
We target regions of low political and geological risk, specifically the United States mid-continent. Goldman Sachs has
predicted that by 2017 the US will once again be the world’s largest oil producer, generating 10.9m barrels a day. This
is the result of highly sophisticated drilling technologies of the types we use, which are opening new fields. The states
in which we operate – Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas and Texas – are all achieving their highest daily productions in several
decades because of the widespread application of these technologies.
Continuing our progress
A significant development in 2012 was our agreement with Ward Petroleum to acquire an interest in the Chisholm Trail
Project, which we announced in August. This is our third multi-well drilling project in Oklahoma. We have a 20% interest
in the overall play, with varying WIs in the individual wells, due to differences in the net acres leased in each well.
This play is a good example of how horizontal drilling and completion techniques can revive areas that were thought to
be fully exploited. Ward has made rapid progress, with the first two wells entering production towards the end of 2012
and two further wells now in production. The fifth well, in which we have a 2.2% WI, has been completed and is
currently in production testing. Our initial expectation was that each well would produce 200 barrels of oil equivalent
per day (“BOEPD”). However, all of the first four wells have done considerably better than this and we expect that the
fifth well will demonstrate similar results.
An ongoing leasing program has also expanded the Prospect holdings. The acquisition of additional acreage means that
Nostra Terra is now exposed to 21 potential drilling locations, including the five wells drilled so far.
We are excited by the Chisholm Trail Prospect’s potential, a view supported by a recent, larger acquisition in the play by
Gastar Exploration Limited (NYSE:GST), as well as other companies recently investing in the area. Our estimate is that
these wells each need to produce 75,000 BOE to reach payback and we are encouraged by Gastar’s announcement that
it expects to recover several times this from its most recent wells. We believe Chisholm Trail is a low-risk, high-return
play. A reserve report has now been commissioned and is anticipated shortly. Nostra Terra will then be able to put in
place reserve-based lending, an attractive alternative to more dilutive forms of financing.

We also made progress with our two other prospects in Oklahoma, Bale Creek and Warrior. Nostra Terra owns a 30%
WI in the Bale Creek Prospect, which is operated by Pathfinder Development Capital LLC. Bale Creek lies within a highly
productive and extensively mapped trend, with multi-pay potential from as many as eight reservoirs. Following the
acquisition of 3D seismic data, two wells were drilled at Bale Creek. The first well, which was horizontal, produced oil
in swab testing but the pressure was unusually low. While drilling the second well, we and our partner saw the
opportunity to test two stacked formations that were prominent anomalies in the 3D seismic interpretation, and decided
to continue drilling the well vertically. In November, we announced positive results from prolonged testing of the second
well, which was producing oil and generating revenue. Work on the first well has been discontinued, allowing us to
focus our resources on future wells.
In January 2012, Nostra Terra agreed with Crown Energy Company Inc. to acquire a 10% WI in the Warrior Prospect.
Like Bale Creek, Warrior lies within a prolific oil system in Oklahoma and contains multiple, stacked reservoirs. A horizontal
well was drilled in the first half of the year and put into production. 
Nostra Terra owns a 16.25% WI in the Verde Prospect Unit, which covers 636 acres in Colorado and is operated by
Plainsmen Partners LLC. At the start of 2012, one vertical well was in operation and producing approximately 50 barrels
of oil per day. This well has exceeded our expectations and reached payout within the first nine months of continuous
production. 
Since the end of the financial year, we have made another strategically important acquisition, with the purchase of an
initial 5% WI in the High Plains Program in Texas. This strengthens our portfolio by giving us a higher-risk exploration
opportunity, with the potential for large upside for our shareholders. Brown and Borelli is our highly experienced and
respected operator-partner.
The area of mutual interest (“AMI”) covers 66 contiguous square miles (42,000 acres) and is in a region where subsurface
mapping, 3D seismic, vertical and horizontal drilling and completion technologies have achieved varying degrees of
success. We aim to increase that success rate by applying a new “proof of concept” with Brown and Borelli.
The first step was to re-enter a previously drilled well, which we believed to have been mis-drilled. This re-entry confirmed
that the original well had missed its target by a wide margin. As a result, the partnership are now reprocessing 35,000
acres of proprietary seismic data, integrating that with 42,000 acres of detailed subsurface mapping and identifying
other potential drill targets. We expect to identify multiple prospect areas within the AMI, each of which could comprise
up to 2,500 acres and have multiple drilling locations. The encouraging results so far have led us to increase our WI to
20%.
2012 net production
Our portfolio of interests has continued to expand and oil and gas production increased during 2012, as shown in the
table below. As we move through 2013, it is pleasing that both of these trends have continued, enabling us to surpass
break even at the operational level in January, a significant milestone in our development.

Improving financial performance
Growth in production led to higher revenues, which increased from £244,000 in 2011 to £352,000 in 2012, a rise of
44%. We achieved a gross profit of £90,000, compared with a loss of £126,000 in the previous year. As the company
grows we keep tight control of administrative expenses, which decreased by 6% to £876,000. This contributed to a
reduced loss before tax of £840,000, against a loss of £996,000 in 2011.
We have continued to put in place the financial resources we need to support our growth. In May 2012, we entered
into a 360-day loan facility of up to US$3 million with YA Global Master SPV Ltd (“YA Global”), an investment fund
managed by Yorkville Advisors LLC. The initial advance on the loan facility was US$1 million and we may request further
advances of up to US$2 million. The facility attracts interest at 10% per annum.
In September, we successfully raised finance through two placings, allowing us to further fund the drilling campaign in
Oklahoma. In total we raised £1,070,000 before expenses, by placing 297,222,223 new shares at 0.36 pence per share. 
Since the year end, we have raised £502,750 under the SEDA by issuing 123,546,296 new shares at an average price
of 0.407p per share. We have used the majority of the proceeds to acquire additional leases and expand the Chisholm
Trail Prospect, along with developing further opportunities.
Also since the year end, Nostra Terra has reached a milestone in its legal proceedings against Richfield Oil & Gas Company
(formerly Hewitt Energy Group, Inc.). On 14 April 2011, Richfield issued a US$1.3 million secured loan note to Nostra
Terra, which accrued interest at 10% per annum and matured on 31 January 2012. At a hearing on 1 March 2013,
Nostra Terra’s motion for partial summary judgment went unopposed. We have received a judgement against Richfield
in excess of US$1.5 million in principal and interest, plus an additional amount to be determined to cover the costs of
collection. Collection has now begun and we will aggressively pursue all remedies available under the judgement, which
include garnishment of cash and the forced sale of corporate assets, until the entire amount has been collected.
An encouraging outlook
Nostra Terra has made a strong start to 2013, both operationally and financially. In January, we surpassed breakeven on
an operational basis – a major milestone in our development. This was the result of greater than expected production
from the Chisholm Trail wells, combined with production from the rest of our portfolio. We expect most of the revenue
from Chisholm Trail to come through from 2013 onwards.
With production now comfortably covering our operating overheads, we can apply our operating margins and all new
funds raised to the leasing and drilling of new wells. Several wells are planned for 2013 within Chisholm Trail, as well as
in other prospects. We will continue to minimise overheads and remain focused on growing our production throughout
the year.

Directors’ report
The directors present their report with the financial statements of Nostra T erra Oil and Gas Company plc (“the Company”)
and its subsidiaries (collectively “the Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Principal activity
The Group’s principal activity is the exploitation of hydrocarbon resources in the US mid-continent.
Review of business and future developments
The results for the year and financial position of the Company and the Group are shown in the financial statements on
pages 16 to 25, and are noted in the Chairman’s statement on page 3 and the Chief Executive’s review on pages 4 to 6.
Key performance indicators
At this stage in the company’s development, the directors regularly monitor key performance indicators associated with
managing liquid resources, namely: cash flows and bank balances; general administrative expenses, which are tightly
controlled; and the level of production.
Key risks and uncertainties
The key risk in exploration and production is the technical risk of not finding hydrocarbons when an exploration well is
drilled. While the US mid-continent is a proven hydrocarbon region and is seeing resurgence through the application of
new drilling and well completion technologies, there are environmental and economic risks, as there are in any
hydrocarbon region.
Results and dividends
The loss for the year was £840,000, which has been allocated against reserves. No dividends will be distributed for the
year ended 31 December 2012.

Political and charitable contributions
The Group made no political or charitable contributions during the year.
Group policy on supplier payment
The Group’s normal practice is to pay suppliers in accordance with agreed terms, provided the supplier has performed
in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions. The Group does not follow any code or statement policy. Creditor
days at the end of the year were 201 (2011: 30) days.
Events after the reporting period
Refer to note 25 for details.
Publication of accounts on company website
The Company publishes financial statements on its website. The directors are responsible for the website’s maintenance
and integrity, and their responsibility also extends to the financial statements contained therein.
Indemnity of officers
The Group may purchase and maintain, for any director or officer, insurance against any liability. The Group maintains
appropriate insurance cover against legal action bought against its directors and officers.
Financial instruments
The Group does not have formal policies on interest rate risk or foreign currency risk. The Group is exposed to foreign
currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than pounds sterling (£). The Group
maintains a natural hedge that minimises its foreign exchange exposure by matching foreign currency income with
foreign currency costs.
For the time being, the Group does not consider it necessary to enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage its
foreign currency risk, given the nature of its business. 10 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
Listing
The Company’s ordinary shares have traded on London’s Alternative Investment Market since 20 July 2007. Shore Capital
and Corporate Limited is the Company’s Nominated Advisor and Alexander David Securities Limited was the Company’s
sole Broker during the year. On 15 February 2013, the Company announced the appointment of XCAP Securities plc as
joint Broker.
The closing mid-market price at 31 December 2012 was 0.472p (2011: 0.39p).
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
as adopted for use in the European Union. The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing these
financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company
will continue in business; and
• follow IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the Companies Act
2006) of which the Group’s auditors are unaware, and each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken
as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditors
are aware of that information.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 485 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution that Jeffreys Henry LLP be reappointed as
auditors of the Company will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
On behalf of the Board:
M B Lofgran
Director
4 June 2013
Directors’ report continued 11 Annual report 2012
Corporate governance report
The directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance, commensurate with the Group’s size and
shareholders’ interests. As the Group grows, policies and procedures that reflect the FRC’s UK Corporate Governance
Code will be developed. So far as is practicable and appropriate, the directors will take steps to comply with the UK
Corporate Governance Code.
The Board of Directors
The Board comprises two executive directors and two non-executive directors. It meets at least four times a year, as
issues arise which require Board attention. The Board has a formal schedule of matters specially referred to it for decision.
The directors are responsible for:
• management structure and appointments;
• consideration of strategy and policy;
• approval of major capital investments and transactions; and
• significant financing matters.
The Board has Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, the roles and responsibilities of which are discussed
below.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises A M Blennerhassett as Chairman, and S V Oakes. Both have considerable and relevant
financial experience.
The Audit Committee has terms of reference agreed by the Board and meets at least twice a year. The committee provides
an opportunity for reporting by the Company’s auditors, and is responsible for:
• monitoring, in discussion with the auditors, the integrity of the financial statements and announcements of the
Company;
• reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls and risk management systems; and
• reviewing and monitoring the external auditor’s independence, and the objectivity and effectiveness of the audit
process, taking into consideration relevant UK and other professional and regulatory requirements.
The Audit Committee is also responsible for making recommendations to the Board to be put to shareholders for their
approval in general meeting in relation to the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditors and to
approve the external auditors’ remuneration and terms of engagement. Other responsibilities include considering annually
whether there is a need for an internal audit function and making a recommendation to the Board, and reviewing
arrangements by which the Group’s staff will be able to raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial
reporting or other matters related to the Group. 12 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
Remuneration and Nomination Committees
The Remuneration and Nomination Committees, which meet at least twice a year, consist of A M Blennerhassett as
Chairman and S V Oakes. Based on the terms of reference approved by the Board, the Remuneration Committee is
responsible for:
• determining and agreeing with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chief Executive
Officer, the Chairman and other members it is designated to consider;
• setting the remuneration for all executive directors, the Chairman and the Company Secretary;
• recommending and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management;
• determining targets for any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group;
• determining the policy and scope of pension arrangements for each executive director; and
• ensuring that contractual terms on termination and any payments made are fair to the individual and the Company.
The Remuneration Committee determines the terms and conditions of service of executive directors. This includes
agreeing the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman and, within
the terms of the agreed policy, recommending the total individual remuneration package of each executive director
including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options. 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for ensuring all director appointments are considered by the Committee before
their formal recommendation to the Board for approval.
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are very important and are given a priority. The Company maintains a website,
www.ntog.co.uk, to improve information flow to shareholders and potential investors. It contains information about
the Company’s activities, and annual and interim reports. Shareholders are welcome to make enquiries on any matters
relating to the business and to their shareholdings. The Company encourages shareholders to attend the Annual Meeting,
at which they will be given the opportunity to put questions to the Chairman and other members of the Board.
Internal financial control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Company’s system of internal controls and for reviewing
their effectiveness. They are designed to safeguard the Company’s assets and to ensure the reliability of the financial
information for both internal use and external publication. The controls that include inter alia financial, operational and
compliance matters and management are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
A system of internal control can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities
will be detected or that risk of failure to achieve business objectives is eliminated. The Board has considered the need
for an internal audit function but because of the size and nature of its operations does not consider it necessary at this
time.

Independent auditors’ report 
to the shareholders of Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements of Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc for the
year ended 31 December 2012, which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated and parent company statements of financial position, the consolidated and
parent company statements of cash flow, consolidated and company statements of changes in equity and related notes.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as regards the parent company financial statements,
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent
company's circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition we
read all financial and non-financial information in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, Directors’ Report
and Corporate Governance Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view, of the state of the Group’s and Parent Company's affairs as at 
31 December 2012 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS’s as adopted by the
European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006;and
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 15 Annual report 2012
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2012
GENERAL INFORMATION
Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales and quoted on the AIM market
of the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office is disclosed on the company information page of
this annual report. The principal activity of the Group is described in the directors’ report. 
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Group is a going concern. When assessing the
foreseeable future, the directors have looked at a period of 12 months from the date of approval of this report. 
The Group’ s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position
are set out in the Chief Executive Officer’s Report and Directors Report. In addition, note 19 to the financial statements
includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives;
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, show that
the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current cash resources. In addition, the Group has entered
into a £5 million financing agreement (expandable to £10 million) and US$1 million promissory note (expandable to
US$3 million) with Yorkville Advisors.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the annual report and financial statements.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC
interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and
with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements
have been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
New and amended standards adopted by the Company
• There are no IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time in this financial period that would be
expected to have a material impact on the group.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective 
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for
the financial year beginning 1 January 2012 and have not been early adopted:
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments: classification and measurement’, as issued reflects the first phase of the IASB work on
the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets as defined in IAS 39. The
standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will
address classification and measurement of financial liabilities, hedge accounting and derecognition. The adoption of
the first phase of IFRS 9 might have an effect on the classification and measurement of the company’s assets. At this
juncture it is difficult for the company to comprehend the impact on its financial position and performance.
There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material
impact on the group. 27 Annual report 2012
Basis of consolidation
Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another
entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial
statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In
the statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially
recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date
control ceases.
Subsidiaries
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed
at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date,
irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s
share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value
of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Associates
An associate undertaking (“associate”) is an enterprise over whose financial and operating policies the Group has the
power to exercise significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the Group. The equity
method of accounting for associates is adopted in the Group financial statements, such that they include the Group’s
share of operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest, taxation and net assets of associates (“the equity method”).
In applying the equity method, account is taken of the Group’s share of accumulated retained earnings and movements
in reserves from the effective date on which an enterprise becomes an associate and up to the effective date of disposal.
The share of associated retained earnings and reserves is generally determined from the associate’s latest interim or final
financial statements. Where the Group’s share of losses of an associate exceeds the carrying amount of the associate,
the associate is carried at nil. Additional losses are only recognised to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations
or made payments outside the course of ordinary business on behalf of the associate.
Joint Activity Agreement
The Group’ s interest in the Joint Activity Agreement (“JAA”) (see note 10) is accounted for by proportionate consolidation.
The Group combines its share of the JAA’s individual income and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash flows on a line
by line basis with similar items in the Group’s financial statements. The Group recognises the portion of gains and losses
on the sale of assets by the Group to JAA that is attributable to the other ventures. The Group does not recognise its
share of profits or losses from JAA that result from the Group’s purchase of assets from JAA until it resells the assets to
an independent party. However, a loss on the transaction is recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a
reduction in the net realisable value of current assets, or an impairment loss. 28 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2012
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable
assets of the acquired subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included
in ‘intangible assets’. Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an
entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those
cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in
which the goodwill arose. The Group allocates goodwill to each business segment in each country in which it operates.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually
for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount
by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than
goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Property, plant and equipment
Tangible non-current assets are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.   
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the
item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and
maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial year in which they are incurred. Depreciation is
provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life: 
Plant and machinery – 20% on cost
The assets’ residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet
date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount
is greater than its estimated recoverable value.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised
within other (losses) or gains in the income statement. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in other
reserves are transferred to retained earnings.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment value.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of hydrocarbons and services in
the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts
and after eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue is recognised when the oil and gas produced is despatched and
received by the customers. 29 Annual report 2012
Functional currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency), which is mainly United States Dollars (US$). The
financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£), which is the Group’s presentation currency.
ii)    Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the presentational currency using exchange rates prevailing at the
dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and
from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are recognised in the income statement.
iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary
economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the
presentation currency as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that 
balance sheet;
(b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average
is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in
which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity.
When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised
in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of
the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on
the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differed from net profit as reported in the income statement because it
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are
never taxable or deductible. The entity’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, the deferred income tax
is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income
tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date
and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is
settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 30 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2012
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Operating leases
Rental leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified
as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged
to the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks, other short-term highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.  
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant
financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default
or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised
in the income statement over the year of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Financial Instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables,
cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through
profit or loss, any directly attributable transactions costs, except as described below. Subsequent to initial recognition,
non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
A financial instrument is recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised if the Group’s contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if
the Group transfers the financial assets to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and rewards
of the asset. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at trade date, i.e. the date that the
Group commits itself to purchase or sell the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Group’s obligations specified
in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled. 
Fair values 
The carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables
of the Group at the balance sheet date approximated their fair values, due to the relatively short-term nature of these
financial instruments.
The Company provides financial guarantees to licensed banks for credit facilities extended to a subsidiary company. The
fair value of such financial guarantees is not expected to be significantly different as the probability of the subsidiary
company defaulting on the credit lines is remote. 31 Annual report 2012
Share-based compensation
The fair value of the employee and suppliers services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as
an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting year is determined by reference to the fair value of the
options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth
targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to
vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding
adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and
share premium when the options are exercised.
The fair value of share-based payments recognised in the statement of comprehensive income is measured by use of the
Black Scholes model, which takes into account conditions attached to the vesting and exercise of the equity instruments.
The expected life used in the model is adjusted; based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The share price volatility percentage factor used in
the calculation is based on management’s best estimate of future share price behaviour and is selected based on past
experience, future expectations and benchmarks against peer companies in the industry.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of
tax, from the proceeds.
Oil and gas assets 
The Group applies the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas assets and has adopted IFRS 6 Exploration
for and evaluation of mineral resources.
Exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) assets
Under the successful efforts method of accounting, all licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs are initially
capitalised in well, field or specific exploration cost centres as appropriate, pending determination. Expenditure incurred
during the various exploration and appraisal phases is then written off unless commercial reserves have been established
or the determination process has not been completed.
Pre-licence costs
Costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area are expensed directly to the income statement
as they are incurred.
Exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) costs
Costs of E&E are initially capitalised as E&E assets. Payments to acquire the legal right to explore, together with the
directly related costs of technical services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploratory drilling and testing are capitalised
as intangible E&E assets.
Tangible assets used in E&E activities (such as the Group’s drilling rigs, seismic equipment and other property, plant and
equipment used by the Company’s exploration function) are classified as property, plant and equipment. However, to
the extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that
consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset. Such intangible costs include directly attributable
overheads, including the depreciation of property, plant and equipment utilised in E&E activities, together with the cost
of other materials consumed during the exploration and evaluation phases.
E&E costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities. 32 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2012
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Treatment of E&E assets at conclusion of appraisal activities
Intangible E&E assets relating to each exploration licence/prospect are carried forward until the existence (or otherwise)
of commercial reserves has been determined, subject to certain limitations including review for indications of impairment.
If commercial reserves are discovered the carrying value, after any impairment loss of the relevant E&E assets, is then
reclassified as development and production assets. If, however, commercial reserves are not found, the capitalised costs
are charged to expense after conclusion of appraisal activities.
Development and production assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of
developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures
incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets as outlined above.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets,
directly attributable overheads and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Depletion, amortisation and impairment of oil and gas assets
All expenditure carried within each field is amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production
basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the
end of the period plus the production in the period, on a field-by-field basis. Costs used in the unit of production
calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs to access
the related commercial reserves. Changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are
dealt with prospectively.
Where there has been a change in economic conditions that indicates a possible impairment in an oil and gas asset, the
recoverability of the net book value relating to that field is assessed by comparison with the estimated discounted future
cash flows based on management’s expectations of future oil and gas prices and future costs. Any impairment identified
is charged to the income statement as additional depletion and amortisation. Where conditions giving rise to impairment
subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of
any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
Commercial reserves
Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of
crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a
specified degree of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered
commercially producible. 33 Annual report 2012
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below:
a) Impairment of investments
Costs of investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined
based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates for each cash
generating unit.
b) Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is
determined based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
c) Recoverability of exploration and evaluation costs
E&E assets are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its
recoverable value. This assessment involves judgment as to (i) the likely future commerciality of the asset and when
such commerciality should be determined, and (ii) future revenues and costs pertaining to the asset in question,
and the discount rate to be applied to such revenues and costs for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value. 
d) Share-based payments
Note 1 sets out the Group’s accounting policy on share-based payments, specifically in relation to the share options
and warrants that the Company has granted. The key assumptions underlying the fair value of such share-based
payments are discussed in note 22. The fair value amounts used by the Group have been derived by external
consultants using standard recognised valuation techniques. 34 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc

2. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
In the opinion of the directors, the Group has one class of business, being the exploitation of hydrocarbon resources.
The Group’s primary reporting format is determined by geographical segment according to the location of the
hydrocarbon assets. The Group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8 in the year are as follows:
United Kingdom being the head office.
Ukraine: a 25 per cent profit share in the onshore Oktyabrskoe oil field.
US Mid-Continent properties at year end included the following:
(i) Kansas: 100% working interest in the Bloom property located within the Chase-Silica Field;
(ii) Texas: 1% working interest in the Vintage Hills Prospect Unit located within the Giddings Field; 3% working interest
in the Nesbitt Prospect Unit located within the Woodlawn Field;
(iii) Colorado: 16.25% working interest in the Verde Prospect Unit;
(iv) Oklahoma: 30% working interest in the Bale Creek Prospect Unit. 
The chief operating decision maker’s internal report is based on the location of the oil properties as disclosed below. 35 Annual report 2012

8. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of
ordinary shares in issue during the year. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares
in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group had two classes of dilutive
potential ordinary shares, being those share options granted to employees and suppliers where the exercise price is less
than the average market price of the Group’s ordinary shares during the year, and in 2009 Convertible Loans.

The assets expensed in the year relate to the plugging and abandonment of 2 wells in the Bloom Field. 41 Annual report 2012
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that the intangible assets may be impaired, by
considering the net present value of discounted cash flows forecasts. If an indication exists an impairment review is
carried out. At the year end, the directors are of the opinion that there has been no impairment in value. 
On 13 April 2011, the company entered into an agreement with Hewitt Petroleum, Inc. (now Richfield Oil & Gas
Company) and Hewitt Energy Group, Inc. (together the “HPI Entities”).
The principal terms of the agreement, which on closing led to termination of the operational relationship between the
Company and the HPI Entities, were as follows:
Nostra Terra acquired 100% working interest (WI) in, and assumed operatorship of, the producing Bloom property; 
Nostra Terra’s existing 75% WI before payout (50% WI after payout) in the Boxberger property, where operations remain
suspended pending the resolution of title issues, was assigned to the HPI Entities;
Nostra Terra assigned to the HPI Entities its interests in all other HPI-operated assets (including Hoffman, the undeveloped
adjoining acreage within the Trapp field and the Koelsch property) and the Liberty #1 exploration well;
Nostra Terra received a US$1.3 million note to be secured by other assets of the HPI Entities (the “HPI Note”). The HPI
Note was extended by a month, matured on 31 January 2012 and accrues interest at 10% per annum.  
Nostra Terra has the right, but not the obligation, to convert the principal amount outstanding under the HPI Note into
shares of Richfield at US$2.50 per share; and
Richfield has issued Nostra Terra a Warrant, exercisable in whole or in part, to subscribe for up to 600,000 shares of
Richfield common stock with an aggregate exercise price of US$1.5 million, at a strike price of US$2.50 per share,
expiring one year after admission to trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange or the TSX Venture Exchange. The warrant
will be transferable, subject to the provisions of the US Securities Act 1933 (as amended).
However, as no funds were received by the maturity date, the Company began the process of recovering against the
collateral which consists of producing leases in Kansas and non-producing leases in Utah. 42 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc

On 25 May 2007, the Company issued pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement a promissory note in the sum of
US$1,838,928 to be issued to the Vendors of Nostra Terra (Overseas) Limited.
The Company will be obliged to repay the sums due under the terms of the promissory note relating to the Ukraine
properties quarterly in arrears, based on the Group’s cash flow from all of its wells which have been producing for at
least 30 days for the most recently completed quarter. No repayments shall be made until the net income from such
wells exceeds US$225,000 for the relevant quarter.
However, on 24 December 2009, the Company agreed with its wholly owned subsidiary, Nostra Terra (Overseas) Limited
(“NTOL“), and Nikea Nominees Limited and Nikea Trustees Limited (together “Nikea“) to an assignment and variation
of the promissory note dated 25 May 2007 in the sum of US$1,838,928, whereby the amount due from the Company
to Nikea is reduced by 75% to US$459,732 (the “Nikea Sum“) and the obligation to repay the Nikea Sum is assigned
to NTOL. In addition, interest will no longer be payable on the Nikea Sum, and the Nikea Sum will be due for repayment
on or before 30 November 2012 with no contingency based on the cash flow from the Company's wells. A provision
allowing the parties to assign the promissory note has also been inserted.
On 25 June 2007, the Company issued £327,679.38 of zero coupon Creditors Convertible Loan Stock 2009 to the
Nostra Terra (Overseas) Limited Vendors. The principal amount of the Creditors Convertible Loan Stock is convertible at
the rate of one ordinary share for each 2p of the principal amount of the stock in the period to 25 June 2009. The stock
was to be repaid on or before 31 December 2009. The Company would have been able to give notice at any time to
convert any stock at 120% of its nominal value. 
On 25 June 2007, the Company issued £88,483 of zero coupon Creditors Non-convertible Loan Stock 2009, to be issued
to the Vendor under the Acquisition Agreement. The Redeemable Loan Stock may be redeemed at any time by the
Company and was repayable on or before 31 December 2009. 
On 30 June 2009, the Company reached agreement with all holders of outstanding loan notes issued in 2007 whereby
the outstanding £252,951 (together with an additional £4,000 owing to one of the loan note holders) is settled by the
payment of £35,131 in cash and the issue of 110,910,200 new ordinary shares at an effective issue price of 0.2 pence
per ordinary share.  46 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc

Loan notes issued by Nostra Terra (Overseas) Limited
On 25 May 2007, a promissory note was issued to Nikea and Masterworks (Overseas) Limited (“Masterworks”) in the
sum of US$436,460, which bears interest at 4.9% per annum. 
Repayment of the sums due under the terms of this promissory note is to be quarterly in arrears based on cash flow
from the group’s wells which have been producing for at least 30 days for the most recently completed quarter. No
repayments shall be made until the net income from such wells exceeds US$225,000 for the relevant quarter. 
On 24 December 2009, NTOL agreed with Nikea and Masterworks to a variation of the promissory note dated 25 May
2007 as partially assigned by deed of assignment dated 14 November 2007 in the total sum of US$436,460, whereby

19. RISK AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, capital
risk and credit risk. The Group’s activities also expose it to non-financial risks: market, legal and environment risk. The
Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on unpredictability and seeks to minimise the potential adverse
effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Board, on a regular basis, reviews key risks and, where appropriate,
actions are taken to mitigate the key risks identified.
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern in order to
provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce
the cost of capital.
Market risk
The Group also faces risks in conducting operations in US mid-continent, which include but are not limited to:
• Fluctuations in the global economy could disrupt the Group’s ability to operate its business in the US Mid-Continent
and could discourage foreign and local investment and spending, which could adversely affect its production.
Environmental risks
The Group faces environmental risks in conducting operations in the US Mid-Continent which include but are not 
limited to:
• If the Group is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, it could be exposed to additional
costs, which might hinder the Group’s ability to operate its business.
Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables. The Group’s credit risk is
primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for
doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss which, based on previous
experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Foreign currency risk
The Group does not have formal policies on interest rate risk or foreign currency risk. 
The Group reports its results in Pounds Sterling. A significant share of the exploration and development costs and the
local operating costs are in United States Dollars. Any change in the relative exchange rates between Pounds Sterling,
and United States Dollars could positively or negatively affect the Group’s results. 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency
other than Pounds Sterling. The Group maintains a natural hedge that minimises the foreign exchange exposure by
matching foreign currency income with foreign currency costs.
The Group does not consider it necessary to enter into foreign exchange contracts in managing its foreign exchange risk
resulting from cash flows from transactions denominated in foreign currency, given the nature of the business for the
time being. 49 Annual report 2012

United States Dollars (US$) 0.6185 0.6470 0.6185 0.6470
Volatility of crude oil prices
A material part of the Group’s revenue will be derived from the sale of oil that it expects to produce. A substantial or
extended decline in prices for crude oil and refined products could adversely affect the Group’s revenues, cash flows,
profitability and ability to finance its planned capital expenditure. The movement of crude oil prices is shown below:
2012 2011
Per barrel – US$ 101.17 104.26
Per barrel – £ 62.57 67.46
Liquidity risk
The Group expects to fund its exploration and development programme, as well as its administrative and operating
expenses throughout 2013, principally using existing working capital and expected proceeds from the sale of future
crude oil production. The Group had a bank balance of approximately £309,000 at 31 December 2012.

22. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued
The estimated fair value of the warrants issued during the year was calculated by applying the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. Expected volatility was originally stated at 30%. This has been revised to 50% because the volatility over
the past year has been used rather than the past 5 years. The directors consider this is more appropriate due to a
significant share price drop in 2008 which is attributable to a one-off event where work stopped during the opening of
a well in Ukraine. The assumptions used in the calculation were as follows;
23. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND GUARANTEES
The Group has no contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims arising from the ordinary course of business and it is not
anticipated that any material liabilities will arise from contingent liabilities other than those provided for.
24. ULTIMATE CONTROLLING PARTY
The Company is quoted on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. At the date of the annual report there was
no one controlling party.
25. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
In January 2013 the Company surpassed break even on an operational basis. The primary contribution was the additional
production from the first four wells in the Chisholm Trail prospect.
On 13 March 2013, the Company entered into an agreement acquiring 5% working interest in the High Plains Prospect
operated by Brown & Borelli. The Company subsequently increased its interest to 20% on 31 May 2013.
On 2 April 2013, the Company was awarded a judgment against Richfield Oil & Gas in excess of US$1.5 million.
Collection efforts have since begun.
On 1 May 2013, a further £0.5 million was raised £502,750 under its aggregated stand-by equity distribution agreement
with Yorkville Global Advisors, as amended on 23 October 2012, through the issue of 123,546,296 new ordinary shares
of 0.1p (“Ordinary Shares”) at an average price of 0.407p per share. The majority of the proceeds have been deployed
to acquire additional leases and expand the Prospect, along with developing further opportunities.
On 1 May 2013, the Company also announced that additional acreage was acquired in the Chisholm Trail Prospect,
giving exposure to 21 potential drilling locations.

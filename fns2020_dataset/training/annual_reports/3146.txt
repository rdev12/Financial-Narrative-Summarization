Centamin Plc
Centamin plc (“Centamin” or “the Company”) is the 
ultimate holding company in the mining 
group (“Centamin Group” or “the Group”) that has been 
actively exploring in Egypt since 1995.
The principal asset of Centamin is its interest in the Sukari 
Gold Mine (‘Sukari’), located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. 
Construction at the Sukari Gold Mine commenced in March 
2007 with ﬁrst gold being produced on 26 June 2009.
The Sukari Gold Mine is the ﬁrst large-scale modern gold 
mine in Egypt. Centamin’s operating experience in Egypt 
gives it a signiﬁcant ﬁrst-mover advantage in acquiring and 
developing other gold projects in the prospective Arabian-
Nubian Shield.
In 2011, the Group acquired Sheba Exploration (UK) plc 
(now Sheba Exploration Holdings Limited) and now has 
interests in four exploration licences in Ethiopia where  
it is conducting further exploration activities. In addition, 
Centamin currently has a 17.0% shareholding in Nyota 
Minerals Ltd, which owns the Tulu Kapi advanced 
exploration project in Ethiopia.
On 30 December 2011, the Centamin Group successfully 
implemented a Scheme of Arrangement whereby Centamin 
plc, a company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, 
became the ultimate holding of the Group. Under the 
Scheme the shares in Centamin plc were exchanged on 
a one for one basis for shares in Centamin Egypt Limited. 
Trading in the shares of Centamin plc on the London Stock 
Exchange and on the Toronto Stock Exchange began on 
30 December 2011, immediately following the cessation of 
trading of shares in Centamin Egypt Limited.
For the purposes of this document, references to acts, 
omissions, operations, results, plans and intentions of 
Centamin plc shall, as the context may require, include 
references to acts, omissions, operations, results, plans and 
intentions of Centamin Egypt Limited.

Centamin at a Glance
Our performance versus our peer group is built 
upon these competitive differentiators.
1. Rapid Growth
In 2012 Centamin achieved increased gold production 
of 262,828oz (2011: 202,699oz) and solid earnings 
of US18.27 cents per share (2011: US17.90 cents per 
share), despite the inclusion of an exceptional provision 
against prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal 
of fuel subsidies which occurred in January 2012 (refer 
to Note 6 of the Financial Statements). Our aim is to 
ramp up production at Sukari to 450-500,000 ounces 
of gold per annum from 2015 onwards, at which level 
current reserves would support a mine life of more than 
20 years. We are projecting a further rise in output during 
2013 to 320,000oz at US$700 per ounce cash operating 
cost at international fuel prices, as robust open pit and 
underground productivity and grades continue. We are 
also projecting the US$325 million (including contingency) 
“Stage 4” plant expansion to double nameplate capacity 
from 5 to 10 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) and to 
achieve full commissioning by the end of 2013.
2. Exploration Upside Potential
Centamin has a large resource and reserve base  
and this is expected to grow further in the coming years 
through the continued exploration of the Sukari Hill  
and surrounding 160km
2
 Sukari tenement area.  
In particular, the underground mine and regional 
prospects offer signiﬁcant potential to deﬁne further 
resources. In addition, exploration continues on our  
four exploration licences in northern Ethiopia.
3. First Mover Advantage
Sukari is the only producing gold mine in Egypt.  
Our operating experience in Egypt gives us signiﬁcant 
ﬁrst-mover advantage in acquiring and developing  
other gold projects in Egypt and in the prospective 
Arabian-Nubian shield and beyond.
4. An Experienced Team
Centamin’s management team and Board of Directors 
have considerable expertise in the gold mining industry. 
This ranges from the early stage identiﬁcation of deposits, 
project ﬁnancing, construction and development, to the 
operating of large mines. Some of the leadership team 
has been based at Sukari for almost a decade, taking it 
from an early stage exploration project to the operating 
gold mine it is today.
5. Financial Strength and Flexibility
With US$220 million (2011: US$208 million) of Cash, 
Bullion, Gold Sales Receivables and Available-For-Sale 
Financial Assets on our balance sheet, and with strong 
cash ﬂow generation, no debt and no hedging, Centamin 
is well positioned to beneﬁt from continued high gold 
prices, an environment we expect for the foreseeable 
future. We have the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to grow our 
business both organically as well as through strategic 
acquisitions in the Arabian-Nubian Shield and beyond.
 
Overview – What Sets Us Apart 8 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Our business spans the full mining value chain: from 
early stage exploration, through development and 
construction and into mining operations. Our focus is on 
projects that provide, or offer the potential for, signiﬁcant 
growth and returns on investment. This is typiﬁed by our 
core operation, the Sukari Gold Mine in Egypt, which 
delivered 262,828 ounces of gold production in 2012, 
in excess of guidance and on track to ramp-up to 
450-500,000 ounces from 2015 onwards. With reserves 
of circa-10 million ounces, Sukari has a projected mine 
life of over 20 years, with potential to increase further 
as exploration continues. Our company remains debt 
and hedge free with a strong cash position and  
is therefore well placed to fund further growth  
as suitable opportunities arise.
Centamin at a Glance
What We Do 9
Operate
Our ﬂagship project, the Sukari Gold Mine, is located  
in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, 700km from Cairo and 
25km inland from the Red Sea. Production commenced 
in June 2009, making Sukari the ﬁrst modern mine in  
a country which in ancient times was a highly proliﬁc  
gold producer. 
Develop
Production at Sukari has grown steadily since our 
maiden year of production in 2010, driven by a rapid 
expansion and optimisation programme. Completion of 
the “Stage 4” plant expansion by the end of 2013 will 
lay the foundations for consistent annual production 
of between 450,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold per 
annum from 2015 onwards.
Explore
Centamin has resources (inclusive of production since 
30 September 2011) of 13.13 million ounces Measured 
and Indicated, and 2.3 million ounces Inferred, and 
reserves (inclusive of production since 31 December 
2011) of 10.1 million ounces. Our exploration strategy  
is aimed at providing cost-effective opportunities for 
future growth, from two primary areas:
1.  Growth at Sukari – resource expansion at the main 
Sukari Hill deposit and multiple other prospects  
on the 160km
2
 tenement area.
2.  Regional organic growth – exploration on our 
tenements outside of Sukari, currently represented 
by our interests in Ethiopia.
Acquire
Centamin is ﬁnancially and technically well placed 
to evaluate opportunities for increased returns to 
shareholders through acquisition. The acquisition  
of Sheba Exploration (UK) plc (now Sheba Exploration 
Holdings Limited) in 2011 marked the Company’s ﬁrst 
step in its strategy to diversify geographically. In addition, 
Centamin currently has a 17% shareholding (13.6% at 
the end of 2012) in Nyota Minerals Ltd, which owns  
the Tulu Kapi advanced exploration project in Ethiopia.
Sustain
Our licence to operate is dependent upon the  
safety and health of our employees, good environmental 
stewardship, the wellbeing of the communities  
in which we operate, and adherence to best governance 
practices, from the earliest stages of exploration until 
mine closure.

Our Performance and  
Key Performance Indicators
2012 production of 262,828 ounces gold at unit cash operating costs of US$669 per ounce exceeded our  
target of 250,000oz at US$700 per ounce. The Group has a strong growth proﬁle and a robust balance sheet  
and is well positioned among mid-tier gold producers to generate value for shareholders.
We monitor our performance in implementing our strategy with reference to the following key performance indicators 
(“KPIs”), applied on a Group wide basis.

(1) Results now reﬂect adoption of IFRIC 20 (restatement of 2011) and an exceptional provision against prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal 
of fuel subsidies which occurred in January 2012 (refer to Notes 3 and 6 respectively of the Financial Statements for further details). The provision had 
no impact on the 2011 results.
(2) Excluding fuel subsidy, (refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements for further details).
(3) Including fuel subsidy, (refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements for further details).
Improved Health and Safety performance is indicated by 
LTIFR of 0.69 (versus 1.25 in 2011). All HSE incidents are 
investigated and corrective actions are taken.
Open pit ore tonnes mined amounted to 6.4Mt, versus 
6.3Mt in 2011. Production was hampered by industrial 
disputes and temporary disruptions to the fuel supply.
The underground mine delivered a total of 0.39Mt of ore 
at 8.96g/t from both stoping and development headings, 
compared with 0.21Mt at 13.51g/t in 2011. The expansion of 
the underground mine continued with the connection of the 
new “Ptah” decline into the primary ventilation circuit.
Ore processed had a record year of 4.5Mt, versus 3.6Mt 
in 2011. Nameplate capacity of 5Mtpa was achieved 
regularly throughout the year, although plant availability 
was hampered by stoppages due to industrial disputes and 
temporary disruptions to the fuel supply.
Gold recovery rates increased to 86.0%, from 84.4%  
in 2011. The higher gold recovery was realised due to 
tighter operating parameters and increased circuit stability. 
Circuit optimisation planning is ongoing to improve the 
recovery rates.
Gold produced amounted to 262,828 ounces, versus 
202,699oz in 2011, which was above guidance of 250,000 
ounces. The increase is due to improved mill throughput, 
higher plant feed grades and increased plant recovery.
Revenue increased to US$426.1 million, from 
$340.5 million in 2011, due to increases in production  
and higher realised gold prices.
The cash operating cost of production was US$669 per 
ounce, versus US$556 per ounce in 2011. The increase 
is due to the inclusion of an exceptional provision against 
prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal  
of fuel subsidies which occurred in January 2012 which,  
if included, bring the like-for-like cash operating cost  
of production to US$530 per ounce, highlighting the 
success of the cost monitoring controls at Sukari.
Proﬁt for the year of US$198.6 million increased in 
comparison to US$194.0 million in 2011 (which has also 
driven the increase in Earnings Per Share of 18.27 cents), 
despite the recognition of a provision against prepayments 
during Q4 to reﬂect the removal of the fuel subsidy,  
as a result of the increase in revenue and production. 
On 30 October 2012, the Company was notiﬁed of the 
outcome of a court case brought by, amongst others,  
an independent member of the previous parliament,  
in which he argued for the nulliﬁcation of the concession 
and exploitation permit that confers on the Group rights to 
operate in Egypt. The litigation is on-going and is described 
in more detail in Note 20 to the Financial Statements and 
in the most recently ﬁled Annual Information Form (‘AIF’) 
which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. 11
Our growth strategy seeks to optimise exposure through 
the mining value chain: exploration, development and 
operations. Whilst disciplined and sustainable growth  
on our existing projects remains a key focus, we continue 
to evaluate potential opportunities to grow through the 
acquisition of projects which offer the potential for the 
Company to realise strong investment returns.
2013 will mark the year when the Stage 4 plant expansion 
is commissioned, the Sukari project concludes its 
investment phase and our annual capital expenditure 
requirements for the mine begin to reduce signiﬁcantly. 
Based on the Company’s calculation there was no ‘Net 
Proﬁt Share’ due to EMRA as at 30 June 2012, nor is any 
likely to be due as at 30 June 2013. Furthermore, it is 
expected that there will be proﬁt share due to EMRA for 
the SGM ﬁnancial year ending 30 June 2014, based on 
production, gold price and operating expense forecasts. 
Following discussions with EMRA and with a view to 
demonstrating goodwill toward the Egyptian government, 
an advance payment has been made subsequent to year 
end to the value of US$8.2 million.
Maintaining our Social License
Maintaining good community relations is a core part 
of our operational strategy and corporate governance 
standards. As the ﬁrst mining company in Egypt in 
modern times, we strive to set an example of a socially 
responsible industry through adopting a good neighbour 
policy. We take every action to ensure Sukari has the 
minimum impact on the social environment, as well  
as to deliver positive beneﬁts to Egypt and the 
community as a result of our investment. 
In 2012 we nurtured dialogue, maintained open 
channels of communication and built positive and 
constructive relations with all our stakeholders including 
the community in areas in which we operate. The Board 
approved principles and strategies for the pursuit of 
corporate sustainable development (CSD) initiatives. 
Our work force is remunerated well above the average 
for Egypt and our career development programmes 
are highly valued. In general we enjoy a very positive 
and constructive relationship with our employees. 
Unfortunately, however, we had two strikes at Sukari 
during the year. The ﬁrst was a legal strike and was settled 
on the basis of a broad and above-inﬂation increase  
in employee allowance payments. The second strike  
was illegal, involving only a small element of our work 
force, and was settled with no pay increases and with 
the help of the Ministry of Labour. These disputes are set 
against a background of multiple and prolonged industrial 
disputes in many quarters of the Egyptian economy. 
Strategic Review
We strive to set an example of a socially 
responsible industry through adopting  
a good neighbour policy. 12 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Targets for 2013
For the year 2013, we project production of 320,000 
ounces at a cash operating cost of US$700 per ounce,  
at international fuel prices, which will mark the third year 
of successive growth in output from Sukari, and another 
step on the way to our long-term target for the project  
of 450-500,000 ounces per annum from 2015  
onwards at an industry-competitive cost of production.  
The key drivers of production growth this year will be 
a continued period of elevated head grades from both 
the open pit and underground mines and increasing the 
underground ore tonnes mined to 500,000t, as well as 
commissioning of the Stage 4 plant expansion to double 
the processing plant’s nameplate capacity to 10 million 
tonnes per annum.
Although construction of Stage 4 was steady during the 
ﬁrst half of 2012, the second half saw an impact from 
strikes at Sukari, in some of the ports and at some of the 
local Egyptian suppliers, as well as temporary disruptions 
to the operation’s fuel supply and gold exports, hence 
our in-country working capital position. This translated 
to delivery delays for key items, materials and services 
and thus a delay to the anticipated commissioning of the 
expanded plant, the bulk of which is now expected to 
commence in the second half of 2013 and with completion 
before the end of the year. As part of the implementation 
of Stage 4 the Company is in discussions with EMRA and 
other government departments in relation to securing the 
necessary permits to increase daily ammonium nitrate 
(“AN”) consumption and blasting accessories in order 
to increase open pit mining rates to the required level to 
feed the expanded plant. This process is expected to be 
completed during the year. 
The capital expenditure programme for 2013 has 
two key focus areas: completion of the Stage 4 plant 
expansion and the on-going development of the 
underground mine. The total Stage 4 capital expenditure 
estimate is US$325 million including contingency, with 
US$228.5 million spent by the end of 2012 and the bulk  
of the remaining capital expenditure due in 2013.  
The budget for the underground expansion is 
US$20 million and will take the new decline (“Ptah”) 
to its target depth below the existing area of operation. 
Underground drilling will continue to test the potential 
for signiﬁcant resource and reserve expansion and the 
development of multiple production sources.
Legal Actions
Concession Agreement Court Case
On 30 October 2012, the Administrative Court in 
Egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim 
brought by, amongst others, an independent member 
of the previous parliament, in which he argued for 
the nulliﬁcation of the agreement that confers on the 
Group rights to operate in Egypt. This agreement, the 
Concession Agreement, was entered into between the 
Arab Republic of Egypt, the Egyptian Mineral Resources 
Authority (“EMRA”) and Centamin’s wholly owned 
subsidiary Pharaoh Gold Mines (“PGM”), and was 
approved by the People’s Assembly as Law 222 of 1994.
In summary that judgment states that, although the 
Concession Agreement itself remains valid and in force, 
sufﬁcient evidence had not been submitted to Court 
in order to demonstrate that the 160km
2
 “exploitation 
lease” between PGM and EMRA had received approval 
from the relevant Minister as required by the terms of 
the Concession Agreement. Accordingly, the Court 
found that the exploitation lease in respect of the area of 
160km
2
 was not valid although it stated that there was 
in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km
2
. 
Centamin, however, is in possession of the executed 
original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 
160km
2
 exploitation lease was approved by the Minister 
of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. It appears that an 
executed original document was not supplied to the Court. 
Upon notiﬁcation of the judgment the Group took various 
steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the 
mine at Sukari. These included both lodging a formal 
appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court on 
26 November 2012 and, in the ﬁrst instance, lodging 
an “Objection to Enforcement” in respect of the original 
ruling with the Civil Court on 31 October 2012, which had 
the effect of “staying” (postponing) implementation for an 
initial period. In addition, in conjunction with the formal 
appeal the Group applied to the Supreme Administrative 
Court to suspend the initial decision until such time as 
the Court is able to consider and rule on the merits of 
the appeal. On 20 March 2013, the Court upheld this 
application thus suspending the initial decision and 
providing assurance that normal operations will be able to 
continue whilst the appeal process is underway. 
EMRA lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 
27 November 2012, the day after the Company’s appeal 
was lodged. Furthermore, in late December 2012, the 
Minister of Petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and 
shortly thereafter publicly indicated that, in his view, 
the terms of the Concession Agreement were fair and 
Strategic Review 13
that the exploitation lease was valid. The Minister of 
Petroleum also expressed support for the investment and 
expertise that Centamin brings to the country. We believe 
this demonstrates the government’s commitment to our 
investment at Sukari and the desire to stimulate further 
investment in the Egyptian mining industry.
We do not yet know when the appeal will conclude, 
although are aware of the potential for the process  
in Egypt to be lengthy. The Company has taken extensive 
legal advice on the merits of its appeal from two leading 
Egyptian law ﬁrms who have conﬁrmed that the proper 
steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km
2
 
exploitation lease. We therefore remain of the view that the 
appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will ultimately 
be successful. In the event that the appellate court fails to 
be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the 
Group, the operations at Sukari may be adversely effected 
to the extent that the Company’s operation exceeded the 
exploitation lease area of 3km
2
 referred to in the original 
court decision.
The Company remains conﬁdent that normal operations 
at Sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal process  
is underway.
Diesel Fuel Court Case
In January 2012, the Group received a letter from 
Chevron to the effect that Chevron would only be able to 
supply Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO”) to the mine at Sukari at 
international prices rather than at local subsidised prices, 
which had the effect of adding approximately US$150 
per ounce to the cost of production. It is understood that 
the reason that this letter was issued was that Chevron 
had received a letter instructing it to do so from the 
Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). 
It is further understood that EGPC itself issued this 
instruction because it had received legal advice from 
the Legal Advice Department of the Council of State 
(an internal government advisory department) that the 
companies operating in the gold mining sector in Egypt 
were not entitled to such subsidies. In November, the 
Group received a further demand from Chevron for the 
repayment of fuel subsidies received during the period 
from late 2009 through to January 2012, amounting to 
EGP403 million (approximately US$60 million at current 
exchange rates).
The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter 
(and, in particular, on the opinion given by Legal Advice 
Department of the Council of State) and in June 2012 
lodged an appeal against EGPC’s decision in the 
Administrative Courts. Again, the Group believes that its 
grounds for appeal are strong and that there is a good 
prospect of success. However, as a practical matter, 
and in order to ensure the continuation of supply whilst 
the matter is resolved, the Group has since January 
advanced funds to our fuel supplier, Chevron, based on 
the international price for fuel.
As at the date of this document, no decision had been 
taken by the courts regarding this matter. The Group 
remains of the view that an instant move to international 
fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome and will look 
to recover funds advanced thus far should the court 
proceeding be successfully concluded. However, 
management recognises the practical difﬁculties 
associated with re-claiming funds from the government 
and for this reason have fully provided against the 
prepayment of US$41.4 million, as an exceptional item. 
Refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements for further 
details on the impact of this exceptional provision  
on the Group’s results for 2012.
No provision has been made in respect of the historic 
subsidies prior to January 2012 as, based on legal 
advice, the Company believes that the prospects  
of a court ﬁnding in its favour in relation to this matter 
remain very strong. 14 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Dear Shareholders
2012 represented the third full year of production 
at Sukari, a period in which your company further 
extended its track record of successive annual 
production growth. The operation delivered a record 
262,828 ounces of gold at a cash cost of production 
of US$669 per ounce, which was ahead of guidance 
of 250,000 ounces at US$700 per ounce (with fuel at 
international prices) set out at the beginning of the year. 
The operating team in Egypt deserve immense credit 
for this performance in a year where challenges were 
again presented and overcome. The ability to perform 
well in all circumstances is key to a successful operation, 
particularly one that is growing as rapidly as Sukari, 
and shareholders should take comfort from the team’s 
demonstrated ability to deliver growth, whilst maintaining 
a strong emphasis on rigorous cost control. 
Sukari’s safety performance was also a signiﬁcant 
improvement on the previous year with a lost time injury 
frequency rate of 0.69 per 200,000 man-hours achieved 
during the period. It was again pleasing to note that no 
signiﬁcant environmental incidents have taken place.
The Stage 4 expansion to double the processing plant’s 
nameplate capacity to 10 million tonnes per annum is 
the key to the next stage of output growth and delivery 
of our stated long-term production target for Sukari of 
450-500,000 ounces per annum from 2015 onwards. 
The construction team made great inroads through 2012 
on what is a major construction effort, which continued 
to be funded out of the proceeds of production at Sukari. 
Although construction was steady during the ﬁrst half 
of the year, the second half saw an impact from strikes, 
both at Sukari and within the local supply chain, and also 
disruptions to gold exports and hence our in-country 
working capital position. This translated to delivery delays 
for key items, materials and services, with the effect that 
the bulk of commissioning will commence in the second 
half of 2013 and be complete before year end. The capital 
cost estimate of the Stage 4 expansion which is funded by 
PGM out of cost recoveries, is US$325 million including 
contingency, with expenditure at the end of 2012 of 
US$228.5 million.
Chairman’s Statement
2012 represented the third full year of production at 
Sukari, a period in which your company further 
extended its track record of successive 
annual production growth.  15
Production growth 
was complemented by 
continued drilling of Sukari 
Hill from both surface and 
underground, with the 
aim of replenishing and 
increasing the resource 
and reserve base, and 
an update resource and 
reserve statement will be 
delivered in the second half 
of 2013. The expanding 
underground development in particular provides 
increasing drilling access to the northern and depth 
extents of the deposit.
Exploration activities continued on the seven other 
prospects in the 160km
2
 Sukari exploitation lease 
within trucking distance of the Sukari plant. The ﬁrst 
signiﬁcant signs of low grade porphyry away from Sukari 
Hill were identiﬁed at the V-Shear prospect and work 
continues to determine the extents and controls on 
this mineralisation. Elsewhere, on-going drilling at the 
Kurdeman prospect offers the potential to fast-track 
high grade ore to supplement the existing underground 
production. Further regional drilling of the Sukari licence 
is planned for 2013. 
Drilling in Ethiopia continued on our four exploration 
licences in the north of the country. Centamin intends 
to continue to grow and diversify its project pipeline 
through targeted acquisitions of exploration and 
development prospects in the region and beyond.
Despite the negative effect of having to pay higher costs 
for fuel for much of 2012, costs that were incurred 
as direct consequence of a decision taken by EGPC, 
which we are robustly contesting in Court, ﬁnancially, 
our position remains strong with approximately US$220 
million held in cash, bullion, gold sales receivables and 
available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, no debt and no hedging. 
With revenues of US$426 million and a proﬁt for the 
year of US$199 million, Sukari continued to demonstrate 
in 2012 that it remains highly cash generative and well 
placed to fund its growth from cost recoveries. We have 
exited the year as we had planned with a strong cash 
position and having made a signiﬁcant investment and 
progress toward completing Stage 4. Completion of Stage 
4 will mark the end of a major expansion and investment 
programme at Sukari.
Our appeal against the 30 October 2012 ruling by  
the Egyptian Administrative Court, which we believe  
is based on an incorrect assertion that there was a lack 
of evidence with respect to our exploitation lease at 
Sukari, remains on-going. Very importantly on 20 March 
2013 the Supreme Administrative Court approved our 
application to suspend enforcement of the 30 October 
ruling until the conclusion of the appeal process and 
this will allow operations at Sukari to continue whilst the 
court process runs its course. We have full conﬁdence 
in our legal title and our appeal case and also highlight 
the separate supporting appeals lodged by the Ministry 
of Petroleum and the Egyptian Mineral Resource 
Authority (EMRA). It is our belief that this re-enforces 
the government’s publicly-stated view that the terms of 
our Concession Agreement are fair and that Centamin’s 
continued investment and operation at Sukari are both 
necessary and welcome. I would like to thank the 
Minister of Petroleum and EMRA for standing by us 
throughout the year and I look forward to the continued 
co-operation as we deliver on our stated goals. 
I would like to close by thanking all those at Sukari,  
in Alexandria, London, Jersey and Perth for their 
efforts in 2012 as Centamin continued on its journey 
to becoming an established gold producer. In a year 
where there were many events that required your board’s 
attention it was a year that the depth, professionalism 
and dedication of your Non-Executive Directors came  
to the fore. I would like to thank deeply the Board for 
their counsel.
Despite and because of the challenges that we have 
faced in 2012, your company remains well positioned  
to deliver outstanding growth and shareholder returns  
in the coming years. I look forward to updating you 
further over the course of 2013 either at our AGM,  
which this year will be held in Jersey on 23 May,  
or at our presentation to shareholders that will be  
held in London on 16 May.

(2) EBITDA and Cash Operating Costs are non-GAAP ﬁnancial performance measures with no standard meaning under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation IFRS. For further information and a detailed 
reconciliation, please see page 39 of this report.
(3) Results now reﬂect adoption of IFRIC 20 (restatement of 2011) and an exceptional provision against prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the 
removal of fuel subsidies which occurred in January 2012, refer to Notes 3 and 6 respectively of the Financial Statements for further details.  
The provision had no impact on the 2011 results.
(4) The Group has no non-current ﬁnancial liabilities in 2012 and 2011.
Revenues from gold and silver sales amounted to 
US$426.1 million, a 25% increase on $340.5 million  
in 2011. This was mainly driven by a 19% increase in 
the volume of gold sold as well as higher realised prices. 
Proﬁt before tax of US$198.6 million was 2% higher 
compared to 2011, driven by the increase in revenue 
offset by the inclusion of an exceptional provision against 
prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal of 
fuel subsidies which occurred in January 2012. Similarly, 
Earnings Per Share (EPS) increased against 2011 to 
US18.27 cents.
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation 
and amortisation), excluding fuel subsidies, of US$233.3 
million reﬂected a 10% increase year-on-year from 
US$211.3 million in 2011, reﬂecting the strength of 
operations. The Sukari operation’s strong cash generation 
was also reﬂected in a 44% increase in “net cash 
generated by operations” of US$220.5 million. 
Cash and equivalents decreased by 10% to 
US$147.1 million due to an increase in acquisition of 
property, plant and equipment; mainly a result of the 
Stage 4 expansion.
The cash operating cost of production was US$669 per 
ounce, versus US$556 per ounce in 2011. The increase 
is due to the inclusion of an exceptional provision 
recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal of fuel subsidies 
which occurred in January 2012 which, if included, 
bring the like-for-like cash operating cost of production 
to US$530 per ounce, highlighting the success of the 
cost monitoring controls at Sukari. 
EPS serves as an indicator of proﬁtability, being used 
in determining the share price and value of companies, 
and are calculated as the net proﬁt divided by the 
weighted average of the number of Ordinary Shares 
issued. Both EBITDA and Cash Costs are non-IFRS 
ﬁnancial performance measures with no standard 
meaning under IFRS. Management uses these measures 
internally to better assess performance trends. EBITDA 
is the net proﬁt or loss for the period excluding income 
tax cost, ﬁnance cost, ﬁnance income and depreciation 
and amortization and is a gauge of the Group’s ability 
to generate operating cash ﬂow to fund its working 
capital needs and capital expenditures. The cash cost 
of production is calculated by dividing the aggregate 
of production cash costs by attributed gold ounces 
produced. For further information and a detailed 
reconciliation, please see page 39 of this report.
Financial Highlights 17
OVERVIEW
Centamin’s principal asset is the Sukari Gold Mine, 
which is located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, 
approximately 700km from Cairo and 25km from the 
Red Sea. For the 12 months ended 31 December 2012, 
production from Sukari was 262,828 ounces (2011: 
202,699 ounces) of gold at an operating cash cost of 
US$669 per ounce. 
The ﬁrst pillar of Centamin’s growth strategy is the 
expansion of Sukari, which includes the growth of  
Sukari Hill’s resources and reserves, the development  
of the underground mine and the Stage 4 expansion, 
which will double the plant’s processing capacity from 
5Mtpa to 10Mtpa.
Construction of the Stage 4 expansion was steady during 
the ﬁrst half of the year, although the second half saw 
some delays, meaning that, whilst some commissioning 
activities will still begin in Q1 2013, we now anticipate 
the bulk of commissioning to commence in the second 
half of 2013, versus the previously-expected Q2, with 
completion before year end. The capital cost of the 
Stage 4 expansion which is funded by PGM out of cost 
recoveries, is US$325 million including contingency, 
with expenditure to date of US$228.5 million. 
Our exploration team at Sukari focused on identifying 
high grade mineralization from both the underground 
mine and other prospects in the wider Sukari tenement 
area. An update resource and reserve statement will  
be delivered in the second half of 2013.
Centamin continued exploration on its tenements  
in northern Ethiopia where exploration drilling 
commenced in the ﬁrst half of 2012. Centamin intends 
to continue to grow and diversify its project pipeline 
through targeted acquisitions of exploration and 
development prospects in the region and beyond.

EGYPT – SUKARI GOLD MINE
Health and Safety 
The Lost Injury Time (LTI) incident rate for 2012 was 
0.69 per 200,000 man-hours (2011: 1.25 per 200,000 
man-hours), with a total of 5,819,877 man hours worked 
during 2012 (2011: 4,312,043). Developing the Health 
and Safety culture on site has resulted in improved 
reporting of incidents compared to previous years and 
although there is room for improvement, Centamin views 
its LTI frequency rate as a solid achievement considering 
Sukari is the ﬁrst modern gold mine in Egypt.
Open Pit Mining
During 2012, open pit mine development has continued 
to access the higher grade sulphide zones with improving 
production rates. A total of 6.4Mt of ore at 1.04g/t Au 
was mined for the period from Stage 1 and 2 of the open 
pit at an average waste to ore ratio of 2.9:1. Mining was 
primarily from the Stage 2 area which progressed down 
to the 1016 Reduced Level (RL). Mining also progressed 
in the Stage 3 pit area of Gazelle in preparation for large 
scale load and haul activities to commence in 2013 and 
the ﬁrst large face shovel commenced in the Stage 3 
Eastern Hills area.
Underground Mining
The underground mine delivered a total of 393,569t 
of ore at 8.96g/t from both stoping and development 
headings. The development of both the Amun and Ptah 
declines continued and over 10,000 metres of total 
development have been completed to date.
Development advanced a total of 2,924 metres in 2012, 
of which 2,532m were driven through ore. The project 
development total to date is 10,248m, of which 5,414m 
were through ore.
The Amun decline, which is under the current open 
pit workings, reached the 814 level, 263m below the 
“portal wadi” area. Ore development has been mined 
on the 905, 890, 875, 870, 860, 850, 845, 830 and 
815 levels. Stoping was completed on the 920 level, 
continued on the 905 and 890 levels and commenced 
on the 875 level. Broken stope ore is removed with  
a conventional bogger until the brow is open and then 
a teleremote bogging system is employed. Stoping has 
broken 157,000 tonnes for the year, with development 
contributing 196,000 tonnes.
The expansion of the underground mine continued with 
the connection of the Ptah decline into the primary 
ventilation circuit. The ﬁrst phase of development of the 
Ptah decline is schedule to be completed mid-2013, 
with diamond drilling commencing in the ﬁrst quarter 
2013. This secondary decline will provide both a 
ventilation intake and haulage way to the central and 
northern portion of Sukari Hill and give access to ore 
blocks under the current ultimate pit base once the 
Amun decline is removed by the open pit in the coming 
years. This will allow Centamin to maintain at least 
two separate underground production areas and also 
potentially increase the current production rates.
9,500m of grade control drilling was completed for  
a project total of 18,000m. Deeper exploration drilling 
was completed from the Amun decline on the 895 level, 
the rig moving to 860S3 to explore the porphyry at lower 
depths. A second rig commenced drilling deep holes to 
the south of the current Horus zone from the 850 level. 
Processing
The Sukari plant processed 4.5Mt in 2012, a 25% 
increase on 2011 (3.6Mt). Industrial disputes affected 
availability during the ﬁrst and third quarters although 
the nameplate rate of 5Mtpa was achieved in the second 
and fourth quarters. Productivity of the processing plant 
averaged 656tph for the year, 5% above the nameplate 
design rate of 625tph, as the operations team continued 
to optimise availability and throughput.
Metallurgical recoveries were 86.0% for the year,  
a 0.7% increase on 2011. Tighter operational controls 
and improved circuit stability resulted in the recovery 
steadily increasing throughout the year to 87.7% in the 
fourth quarter. Whilst operational improvements continue 
to have some impact, recoveries are expected to remain 
consistent until the new carbon regeneration kiln is 
commissioned in 2013.
The dump leach operation produced 6,686oz in 2012, 
which was a signiﬁcant decrease from 2011. With the 
increase in process plant productivity, dump leach 
volumes pumped back to the CIL circuit were reduced 
to minimise the impact on recoveries. It is expected 
that dump leach gold production will increase in early 
2013 and return to planned levels when the new carbon 
regeneration kiln is commissioned. To date 5.94Mt of 
low grade oxide ore have been delivered to the pads  
at a grade of 0.51g/t.

Stage 4 Expansion
Stage 4 Expansion
The Stage 4 expansion programme continued throughout 
2012, having commenced in late 2011. During the 
second half of the year there was an impact from strikes 
at Sukari, in some of the ports and at some of the local 
Egyptian suppliers, as well as temporary disruptions 
to the operation’s fuel supply and gold exports, hence 
our in-country working capital position. This translated 
to delivery delays for key items, materials and services 
and thus a delay to the anticipated commissioning of 
the expanded plant, the bulk of which is now expected 
to commence in the second half of 2013 and with 
completion before the end of the year. 
The capital cost of the Stage 4 expansion which  
is funded by PGM out of cost recoveries (refer to note  
on page 25), is US$325 million including contingency,  
with expenditure to date of US$228.5 million.
The Stage 4 expansion will incorporate additional milling, 
ﬂotation and thickening capabilities to provide a parallel 
processing route, as well as upgrade to the existing regrind 
circuit. Secondary crushed ore with a P
80
 of 50mm will 
be transferred to a second crushed ore stockpile prior to 
grinding through a new milling circuit. The new milling 
circuit will be a two stage circuit, consisting of a SAG mill 
and ball mill, with hydrocyclone classiﬁcation and a pebble 
crushing facility. 
Milled ore with a particle size of 150μm will be sent 
to a new ﬂotation circuit to recover the bulk sulphide 
concentrate. The concentrate will be thickened and 
discharged to an upgraded regrind circuit, capable of 
treating up to 100tph of concentrate to achieve a ﬁnal 
milled particle size of 10μm. The regrind circuit will 
combine the two concentrate streams from each of the 
separate ﬂotation circuits. The regrind product will  
be treated through the two CIL circuits in series to 
maximise leach circuit residence time.
The ﬂotation tails of the new circuit will be thickened  
and discharged to the tailings storage facility. It is 
expected that the ore treated through the new ﬂotation 
circuit will be predominantly sulphide based ore, 
amenable to recovery by ﬂotation. Any ore that may be 
oxide or transitional in nature will be treated through the 
existing processing circuit by adjustment of the crushed 
ore product splits to each of the crushed ore stockpiles. 20 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Exploration Activities 
Growth of Sukari Hill
The main focus of exploration to date has been on the Sukari Hill porphyry. Surface drilling in 2012 continued north 
through the Ra and Gazelle zones and into the northern Pharaoh zone. Underground drilling was progressively 
stepped-up during the year as new development provided improved access from below surface to test potential high 
grade extensions of the deposit. The ore body has not yet been closed off by drilling to the north, or at depth.
Further exploration of the Sukari deposit will take place during 2013, predominantly from both the Amun and Ptah 
declines and an update resource and reserve statement will be delivered in the second half of 2013.

Operational and Exploration Review  21
Regional Exploration
The second pillar of Centamin’s growth strategy is 
regional exploration. Seven other prospects besides 
Sukari Hill have been identiﬁed on the 160km

 Sukari 
tenement area and exploration is being conducted under 
the principle that ore from these prospects would be 
trucked to the existing processing plant. 
Geochemistry, reverse circulation and diamond drilling 
programmes have been underway on the Quartz Ridge 
and V-Shear prospects to the east and north-east of the 
hill respectively during 2012. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant signs of 
low grade porphyry away from Sukari Hill were identiﬁed 
at the V-Shear prospect. On-going drilling to the south at 
the Kurdeman prospect offers the potential to fast-track 
near surface high grade ore to supplement the existing 
production. Further regional drilling of the Sukari licence 
is planned for 2013. 
A gravity survey, aimed at targeting and deﬁning 
porphyries beneath the wadi sediments, was completed 
in late 2012 with results due in early 2013. 
ETHIOPIA 
Growth Beyond Sukari
The third pillar of Centamin’s strategy is growth 
beyond Sukari. Centamin continued exploration on 
its four tenements in northern Ethiopia where drilling 
commenced in the ﬁrst half of 2012. Results to date 
have conﬁrmed the presence of mineralisation and 
follow-up drilling continues.
In February 2012, Centamin participated in an equity 
capital raising by Nyota Minerals Ltd (“Nyota”),  
which owns the Tulu Kapi advanced exploration project 
in Ethiopia. The investment of US$6.4 million took 
Centamin’s ownership to 14%. Subsequent to year 
end, Centamin acquired a further interest in Nyota for 
US$1.2 million, bringing our total ownership to 17%.
We will continue to grow and diversify our asset base 
through targeted acquisitions in this region and beyond 
in the coming years. 
AUSTRALIAN PROJECTS
The Group is entitled to a royalty over the Nelson’s Fleet 
gold project near St Ives, Western Australia, from the  
St Ives Gold Mining Co Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Gold 
Fields Ltd, through its subsidiary, Viking Resources 
Limited. The Company has not been informed of any 
mining of the tenement to date.

in acquiring and developing other gold projects  
in the prospective Arabian-Nubian Shield.  25
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
The report contains certain forward-looking statements 
and attention is drawn to the cautionary statement that 
appears at the front of this document. 
OVERVIEW
Centamin is a mining company that has been actively 
exploring in Egypt since 1995. The principal asset of 
Centamin is its interest in the Sukari Gold Mine, located 
in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Sukari Gold Mine 
commenced construction in March 2007 with the ﬁrst 
gold bar being produced on 26 June 2009. Sukari is the 
ﬁrst modern large-scale mine in Egypt, a country which 
in ancient times was a proliﬁc gold producer.
Optimal design throughput at the Sukari Gold Mine 
was achieved during December 2012 and the ‘Stage 4’ 
expansion program commenced in 2011 to target  
450-500,000 production per annum from 2015. 
Centamin’s operating experience in Egypt gives it  
a signiﬁcant ﬁrst-mover advantage in acquiring and 
developing other gold projects in the prospective 
Arabian-Nubian Shield. 
ACCOUNTING FOR SUKARI GOLD MINES
The operating company of Sukari, Sukari Gold Mines 
(“SGM”), is jointly owned by Pharaoh Gold Mines NL 
(“PGM”) and the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority 
(“EMRA”) on a 50% equal basis. For accounting 
purposes, SGM is 100% proportional consolidated 
within the Centamin group of companies reﬂecting the 
substance and economic reality of the Concession. 
Pursuant to the Concession Agreement, the provisions 
of which are described more fully below, PGM 
solely funds SGMs activities. PGM is also entitled to 
recover the following costs and expenses payable 
from sales revenue (excluding the royalty payable to 
the Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”)) (a) all current 
operating expenses incurred and paid after the 
initial commercial production; (b) exploration costs, 
including those accumulated to the commencement of 
commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of total 
accumulated cost per annum); and (c) exploitation 
capital costs, including those accumulated prior to the 
commencement of commercial production (at the rate  
of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum).
Since the commencement of commercial production  
on 1 April 2010, the cash ﬂows generated by SGM 
through the sale of gold are used to fund the on-going 
operating expenses incurred in its own right and to fund 
the cost recovery due to PGM for exploration  
and exploitation capital costs at a rate of 33.3%  
of total accumulated cost per annum. 
In return, on-going capital expenditure incurred  
in connection with the Sukari mine is funded solely  
by PGM out of cash ﬂows received from SGM through 
the cost recovery process as described above.  
The expenditure incurred by PGM in relation to Stage 4 
will become recoverable once the infrastructure has 
been commissioned, which is currently planned at the 
end of 2013, at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated 
cost per annum.
EMRA is entitled to a share of SGM’s net production 
surplus “proﬁt share” (deﬁned as revenue less payment 
of the 3% production royalty to ARE and recoverable 
costs). Based on the Company’s calculation there was  
no Net Proﬁt Share due to EMRA as at 30 June 2012,  
nor is any likely to be due as at 30 June 2013. It is 
expected that there will be a net production surplus 
(revenue in excess of production royalty and cost 
recoveries) available for sharing between EMRA and 
PGM for the SGM ﬁnancial year ending 30 June 2014 
(SGM’s accounting period is 1 July to 30 June) based  
on current gold prices, production forecasts and 
operating expenses. Any disruption to operations or 
reduction in gold price realised will delay this proﬁt 
sharing. This expected proﬁt sharing takes into account 
the costs incurred on paying for fuel at international 
prices. Any recovery of these prepayments, discussed in 
Note 20 to the Financial Statements, will result in further 
amounts to be shared between EMRA and PGM. Any 
payment made to EMRA pursuant to these provisions 
of the Concession Agreement will be recognised as a 
variable charge to the income statement of Centamin, 
which will lead to a reduction in the earnings per share.
Following discussions with EMRA, and with a view to 
demonstrating goodwill toward the Egyptian government, 
subsequent to year end, PGM has made an advance 
payment in relation to this likely 2014 proﬁt share to 
the value of US$8.2 million and this advance payment 
will be netted off against any future proﬁt share that 
becomes payable.
Separate accounts are prepared in respect of SGM. 
These are independently audited and certiﬁed by 
Egyptian certiﬁed accountants approved by EMRA. 
Any expected proﬁt share payable to EMRA and PGM 
becomes payable on completion of the audit of the 
SGM accounts. Centamin will be working together with 
EMRA to ensure that these can be approved as soon as 
possible so that the proﬁt share can be paid to EMRA 
and PGM. Centamin is looking forward to paying the ﬁrst 
proﬁt share to EMRA. 26 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE YEAR
(1) (2) (3) 
Centamin delivered strong operational and ﬁnancial 
results in 2012, producing 262,828 ounces of gold 
(2011: 202,699 ounces) and generating proﬁt after tax 
for the year of US$199 million (2011: US$194.0 million). 
Through the Group’s emphasis on rigorous cost control, 
Centamin has continued to reap the beneﬁts of the 
high gold price, and this was enhanced further by its 
debt-free and unhedged position. Now in its third year 
of production, the Sukari Gold Mine is highly cash 
generative, providing EBITDA of US$233.3 million (2011: 
US$211.4 million), a 10% increase on 2011, and a robust 
cash and cash equivalents balance of US$147.1 million 
(2011: US$164.2 million) as at 31 December 2012.  
See Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for the 
deﬁnition of EBITDA.
2012 presented some operating environment challenges, 
however a solid second quarter and a record fourth 
quarter of production have shown that a substantially 
larger production proﬁle is achievable for Sukari.  
This potential for production growth combined with the 
Group’s reserves, a signiﬁcant expansion programme,  
a solid ﬁnancial position, and an experienced team 
means Centamin is well positioned for 2013, as is shown 
by the following:
 Basic earnings per share 18.27 cents, up 2%  
on prior year.
 Record EBITDA $233.3 million, up 10%  
on the prior year.
 Full year production was 262,828 ounces,  
a 30% increase on 2011 and above guidance  
of 250,000 ounces.
 Cash costs of production of US$669 per ounce 
(equivalent to US$530 per ounce versus US$556  
per ounce in 2011 at subsidized fuel prices).
 Stage 4 plant expansion (to 10Mtpa) commissioning 
activities began in Q1 2013 with the new power 
station commissioned in January 2013 and new 
blowers and compressors to be commissioned  
in Q2 2013. The bulk of commissioning will 
commence, and be complete, in the second half of 
2013. Expenditure to date is US$228.5 million of the 
total forecast US$325 million including contingency.
 Centamin remains debt-free and unhedged with cash, 
bullion on hand, gold sales receivable and available-
for-sale ﬁnancial assets of US$219.4 million as at 
31 December 2012.
 Drilling continued at the V-Shear porphyry and 
commenced at the Kurdeman prospect. 
 A gravity survey, aimed at targeting and deﬁning 
porphyries beneath the wadi sediments was 
completed late in 2012 with results due in Q2 2013.
 Results in Ethiopia conﬁrm the existence of low grade 
mineralisation, with drilling continuing.
During the year Centamin was involved in two separate 
court cases directly relevant to the operation of the  
mine at Sukari. The ﬁrst of these was triggered by  
a decision taken by the Egyptian General Petroleum 
Company (EGPC) to charge international prices,  
not local (subsidised) prices for the supply of Diesel 
Fuel Oil (“DFO”). The second case saw a judgment 
by an Egyptian Administrative Court in relation to the 
validity of the Company’s 160km
2
 exploitation lease, 
although on 20 March 2013 the Supreme Administrative 
Court upheld the Company’s application to suspend 
this decision until the merits of the Company’s appeal 
are considered and ruled on, thus providing assurance 
that normal operations would be able to continue during 
this process. Both of these cases are described in 
detail elsewhere in this report (refer to Note 20 to the 
Financial Statements). Every action is being taken to 
contest the decisions, including the making of formal 
legal appeals and, although their resolution may take 
some time, we remain conﬁdent that a satisfactory 
outcome will ultimately be achieved. With respect to 
the DFO case, management however recognises the 
practical difﬁculties associated with re-claiming funds 
from the government and, for this reason, have fully 
provided against the prepayment of US$41.4 million 
as an exceptional item (refer to Note 6 to the Financial 
Statements). In the meantime the Group is continuing  
to pay international prices for DFO.
In addition the Group during the year received  
a demand from Chevron for the repayment of fuel 
subsidies received in the period from late 2009 through 
to January 2012, amounting to some US$60 million 
(EGP403 million). No provision has been made in respect 
of the historic subsidies prior to January 2012 as, based 
on legal advice that it has received to date, the Company 
believes that the prospects of a court ﬁnding in its favour 
in relation to this matter remain strong.
Management Discussion & Analysis  
and Business Review
(1) Cash cost of Production, EBITDA and cash, bullion on hand and available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are non-GAAP measures. For further information  
and a detailed reconciliation, please see ”Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below.
(2) Basic EPS, EBITDA, Cash Costs of Production reported inclues an exceptional provision against prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal of fuel 
subsidies which occurred in January 2012 (refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements for further details). The provision had no impact on the 2011 results.
(3) Historic Cash Cost of Production, EBITDA and Basic EPS now reﬂect adoption of IFRIC 20 (refer to Note 3 of the Financial Statements for further details). 27

NR – Not Reported. 28 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Centamin produced 262,828 ounces of gold in 2012, 
which is a 30% increase on 202,699 ounces in 2011. 
The higher year-on-year production was a result of:  
(a) a 25% increase in tonnes milled (to 4.5Mt) due  
to the improved plant productivity and availability,  
(b) an 18% increase in production from the 
underground due to improved underground mining 
contractor equipment availability, and (c) a 7% higher 
feed grade to the mills (2.04g/t in 2012 compared to 
1.91g/t in 2011) as underground and open pit head 
grades increased in line with the budget.
Open Pit
The open pit delivered total material movement of 
25,108kt for the year, an increase of 18% on the prior 
year, although impacted by stoppages in December due 
to a temporary disruption to the fuel supply. 
Ore production from the open pit was 6.4Mt at 1.04g/t 
with an average head grade fed to the plant of 1.35g/t. 
The ROM ore stockpile balance increased by 1kt to 
722kt by the end of the year. Mining was primarily from 
the Stage 2 area, with the completion of Stage 2A and 
Stage 2B down to the 1040RL and 1016RL respectively. 
In Stage 3 development work progressed in the Gazelle 
area and the new face shovel commenced in the Eastern 
Hills area of Stage 3. 
Underground Mine
Ore production from the underground mine was 393kt. 
The ratio of ore from stoping versus development 
decreased during the year, with 52% of development ore 
(203kt) and 48% of stoping ore (190kt). Production from 
stoping was affected by the availability of the teleremote 
bogging system in quarters three and four, which was 
offset by increased ore deliveries from development  
as a result of an increased development effort. 
A total of 2,934.8m of diamond drilling was completed 
for both short-term stope deﬁnition and underground 
resource development, of which 2,532m were driven 
through ore. The project development total to date  
is 10,248m, of which 5,414m were through ore.
Development of the Ptah Decline had reached the 
position of the ﬁrst drill cuddy and was connected to the 
exhaust system by the end of 2012. The anticipated  
ﬁrst-phase capital cost of the Ptah Decline is 
US$18 million, with expenditure to date of US$17.5 
million, which will see the decline reach the ﬁrst ore 
blocks to be developed below the middle of Sukari Hill. 
It is expected that this initial development work will be 
complete in early 2013. 
Processing
The annual throughput in the Sukari plant was  
4.5Mt in 2012, a 25% increase on 2011 (3.6Mt). 
Industrial disputes affected availability during the ﬁrst 
and third quarters although the nameplate rate of 
5Mtpa was achieved in the second and fourth quarters. 
Productivity of the processing plant averaged 656tph  
for the year, 5% above the nameplate design rate of 
625tph, as the operations team continued to optimise 
availability and throughput.
Plant metallurgical recoveries were 86.0% in the year,  
a 1.0% increase on 2011. Tighter operational controls 
and improved circuit stability resulted in the recovery 
steadily increasing throughout the year. Whilst operational 
improvements continue to have some impact, recoveries 
are expected to remain consistent until the new carbon 
regeneration kiln is commissioned in 2013.
The dump leach operation produced 6,686oz in 2012,  
a 37% decrease from 2011. 
Fuel Costs
In light of the on-going dispute with the Egyptian 
Government regarding the price at which Diesel Fuel Oil 
is supplied to the mine at Sukari, it has been necessary 
since January 2012 to advance funds to our fuel supplier, 
Chevron, based on the international price for diesel. 
Management however have fully provided against the 
prepayment of US$41.4 million, as an exceptional item, 
during Q4. Refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements for 
further details on the impact of this exceptional provision 
on the Group’s results for 2012. For comparative 
purposes, had these prepayments been expensed during 
the year, the fuel cost differential would have had the 
following impact on the cash costs: the cash costs for  
Q1 increased by US$108 to US$717 per ounce,  
Q2 increased by US$164 per ounce to US$729 per 
ounce, Q3 increased by US$185 to US$724 per ounce 
and Q4 increased by US$112 to US$558 per ounce. 
As noted previously, the Company has commenced 
proceedings in the Administrative Court in Egypt in 
relation to this matter.  The Company remains of the view 
that an instant move to international fuel prices is not a 
reasonable outcome and will look to recover any funds 
advanced thus far at the higher rate should the court 
proceedings be successfully concluded. Please refer 
to Note 20 to the Financial Statements and the most 
recently ﬁled Annual Information Form (‘AIF’) for  
further information.
Management Discussion & Analysis  
and Business Review 29
In addition the Group during the year received a demand 
from Chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies 
received in the period from late 2009 through to January 
2012, amounting to some US$60 million (EGP403 
million). No provision has been made in respect of the 
historic subsidies prior to January 2012 as, based  
on legal advice that it has received to date, the Company 
believes that the prospects of a court ﬁnding in its favour 
in relation to this matter remain strong.
STAGE 4 EXPANSION
Construction continued on Stage 4 of the process 
plant expansion, which commenced in late 2011, 
which will expand Sukari nameplate capacity from 
5Mtpa to 10Mtpa. The estimated capital cost of the 
Stage 4 expansion which is funded by PGM out of cost 
recoveries, is US$325 million including contingency, 
with expenditure to date of US$228.5 million. 
Some unforeseen delays have meant that commissioning 
of the plant is now expected to commence in the second 
half of 2013 (previously the bulk of commissioning was 
expected in Q2 2013) and be complete by year end. 
These delays have been caused by:
 strikes at Sukari, in some of the ports and at some  
of the local suppliers, and
 suspension of operations at Sukari due to lack  
of fuel and a temporary prohibition of gold exports, 
resulting in delays for critical path items, materials 
and services.
Main Plant
Detail engineering of the main plant is complete and 
85% of the mechanical equipment has now arrived 
on site. All major civil works have been completed, the 
erection of structural steel and installation of mechanical 
equipment is in progress. Procurement of electrical 
equipment, cables and instrumentation is proceeding 
and the piping contractor is mobilising to site. Installation 
of both sag and ball mills is in progress, however late 
arrival of structural steel is impacting on the schedule in 
this area. 
Power Station
The ﬁfth MAK engine has been installed, commissioned 
and is fully operational in the existing plant. The 
new Wartsila plant has been completed, load bank 
commissioned and is ready to operate, although the 
cables to the new plant still have to be installed. 
Sea Water Pipeline
Excavation of the trench for the new pipeline has 
been completed. Welding and installation of the 
pipe is continuing, approximately 50% is complete. 
Construction of the booster station is proceeding with 
most of the civil work completed. Delivery of the intake 
and booster pumps is scheduled to take place in April 
and May.
Tailings Storage Facility
Construction of the embankment is 100% complete and 
installation of the HDPE liner has commenced.
New Primary Crusher
Excavation has been completed and construction of the 
crusher building is 20% complete. Some delays with 
cement deliveries have been experienced due to diesel 
shortages in Egypt.
Capital Expenditure
A breakdown of the major cost areas up to  
31 December 2012 is as follows:
 Mining Equipment US$34.9 million
 Processing Plant US$115.5 million
 Power Plant US$43.5 million
Other US$34.6 million
 US$228.5 million
Major contributors to the payments made in 2012  
were as follows: 
 Mining Equipment US$28.9 million
 Processing Plant US$85.2 million
 Power Plant US$32.5 million
Other US$29.3 million

EXPLORATION UPDATE
Sukari Hill
Centamin has resources (inclusive of production since 
30 September 2011) of 13.13 million ounces Measured 
and Indicated, and 2.3 million ounces Inferred, and 
reserves (inclusive of production since 31 December 
2011) of 10.1 million ounces. Underground drilling 
was progressively stepped-up during the year as new 
development provided improved access from below 
surface to test potential high grade extensions of the 
deposit. The ore body has not yet been closed off by 
drilling to the north, or at depth. Further exploration 
of the Sukari deposit will take place during 2013, 
predominantly from both the Amun and Ptah declines. 
We aim to provide an updated resource and reserve 
statement during the second half of 2013.
Regional Exploration
Geochemistry, reverse circulation and diamond drilling 
programmes have been underway on the Quartz Ridge 
and V-Shear prospects to the east and north-east of the 
hill respectively during 2012. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant signs of 
low grade porphyry away from Sukari Hill were identiﬁed 
at the V-Shear prospect. On-going drilling to the south at 
the Kurdeman prospect offers the potential to fast-track 
near surface high grade ore to supplement the existing 
production. Further regional drilling of the Sukari licence 
is planned for 2013. 
A gravity survey, aimed at targeting and deﬁning 
porphyries beneath the wadi sediments, was completed 
in late 2012 with results due in early 2013. 
Growth Beyond Sukari
Centamin continued exploration on its four tenements 
in northern Ethiopia where drilling commenced in 
the ﬁrst half of 2012. Results to date have conﬁrmed 
the presence of mineralisation and follow-up drilling 
continues.
We will continue to grow and diversify our asset base 
through targeted acquisitions in this region and beyond 
in the coming years.

Results of operations
The Group recorded net proﬁt before tax for the year ended 31 December 2012 of US$198.6 million  
(2011: US$194.0 million). The increase is driven by higher volumes of gold sold, higher gold prices obtained and 
lower costs due to management’s rigorous cost control offset by the inclusion of an exceptional provision against 
prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal of the fuel subsidy which occurred in January 2012  
(refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements). 32 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
Management Discussion & Analysis  
and Business Review 33
Revenue has increased by 25% to US$426.1 million, 
as a result of a 19% increase in gold sold to 254,959oz 
together with a 7% increase in the average gold price to 
US$1,667 per ounce. 
Cost of sales has increased by 58% to S$202.9 million, 
as a result of:
(a)  a 57% increase in mine production costs to 
US$176.7 million, primarily due to the inclusion 
of an exceptional provision in Q4 to reﬂect the 
removal of the fuel subsidy which occurred 
in January 2012 (including fuel subsidy mine 
production costs would have increased by 25% to 
US$140.1 million) and due to an increase in tonnes 
mined and milled,
(b)  a 91% increase in depreciation and amortisation 
from US$18.6 million to US$35.6 million, a 
result of an increase in the underlying capitalised 
preproduction costs and mine development 
properties offset by:
(c)  a US$9.4m credit for movement in production 
inventory a result of additions to stockpiles.
Finance income. The movements in ﬁnance income are 
in line with the movements in the Company’s available 
cash and term deposit amounts.
Other comprehensive income has decreased by 
US$1.2 million to a US$2.8 million loss.
Other operating costs increased by 30% to 
US$25.5 million, as a result of: 
(a)  a US$4.6 million increase in net foreign exchange 
movements, offset by the inclusion of the 2011 
executive bonuses,
(b)  a provision in relation to the 2012 executive and 
senior management bonuses, together with, 
amongst other matters,
(c)  additional costs associated with the new corporate 
head ofﬁce, costs associated with the re-domicile, 
the ongoing litigation, and the share of loss  
of Associate.

Current assets have increased by US$14.5 million  
to US$283 million, as a result of:
(a)  a US$22 million increase in inventory to 
US$94.6 million. Stores inventory has increased  
by US$12.6 million to US$71.8 million in 
preparation for the increase of the processing 
nameplate capacity from 5 to 10Mtpa by the end  
of 2013. Mining stockpiles and ore in circuit 
inventory has increased by US$9.4 million to 
US$22.8 million, offset by:
(b)  self-funding of the stage 4 expansion amounting  
to a cash outﬂow of US$160.7 million.
Non-current assets have increased by US$223.8 million 
or 39% to US$802 million, as a result of:
(a)  exploration and evaluation assets have increased 
by US$14.6 million to US$45.7 million as a result 
of the drilling programs in Sukari Hill, the Sukari 
tenement area and Ethiopia, 
(b)  available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets have increased  
by US$3.8 million to US$5.6 million as a result 
of an acquisition via a placement of 67 million 
shares in Nyota at GB£0.06 (US$0.10) per share 
amounting to US$6.4 million offset by the loss  
on fair value of the investment and loss on foreign 
exchange movement of US$2.8 million and 
US$0.2 million respectively, and
(c)  a US$241.3 million increase in property, plant of 
equipment, mainly relating to the net capitalised 
work-in-progress costs of US$184.5 million, 
of which $175.9 million relates to the Stage 4 
processing plant development and US$8.6 million 
relates to additional mining equipment, together 
with a US$56.6 million increase in mine 
development properties, offset by:
(d)  a depreciation and amortisation charge of  
US$35.6 million.
Current liabilities have increased by US$33.9 million 
to US$59.6 million mainly driven by the rise in supply 
relating to higher production at the Group’s Sukari Gold 
Mine and an increase in the accruals in relation to the 
Stage 4 processing plant development, together with the 
provision in relation to the 2012 executive and senior 
management bonuses.
Non-current liabilities reported during the period have 
increased by US$2.9 million as a result of:
(a)  a US$2.7 million increase arising from a change  
in estimate of the future rehabilitation costs; and
(b)  the unwinding of the discount on the provision  
for rehabilitation.
Issued capital increased by US$3.9 million to 
US$612.5 million as a result of the issue of forfeited 
shares under the Loan Funded Share Plans (LFSP). 
Reserves reported have increased by US$1.5 million  
to US$3.5 million as result of the recognition of the 
share based payments.
Accumulated proﬁts increased by US$196.2 million 
as a result of the increase in the proﬁt for the year 
attributable to the shareholders of the Company of 
US$199 million offset by a US$2.8 million loss on 
available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets.
Current ratio is calculated by dividing the current assets 
by the current liabilities. The decrease in the current 
ratio is a result of the increase in current liabilities driven 
by the rise in supply relating to higher production at the 
Sukari Gold Mine and an increase in the accruals in 
relation to the Stage 4 plant expansion development.
The return on equity ratio is calculated by dividing the 
proﬁt for the year attributable to the shareholders of the 
company for the period (which includes an exceptional 
provision against prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect 
the removal of fuel subsidies which occurred in January 
2012) by total shareholders’ equity and measures the 
return on ownership. The return on equity ratio showed  
a decrease from 23 for 2011 to 20 for 2012 as a result 
of the increase in the shareholders equity.

Net cash ﬂows generated by operating activities comprise 
receipts from gold and silver sales and interest revenue, 
offset by operating and corporate administration costs. 
Cash ﬂows have increased by US$67.0 million to 
US$220.5 million, primarily attributable to:
(a)  an increase in revenue, due to higher gold sales 
volumes and a higher average realised price, and
(b)  an increase in cash ﬂows in relation to payables 
and prepayments, largely a result of the 
management of the settlement of trade payables  
in December 2012, both offset by

removal of fuel subsidies in January 2012  
and the payment of higher international fuel 
prices, and

receivables and inventories resulting from the 
ramping up of the Stage 4 processing plant 
development and the increase in stockpiles.
Net cash ﬂows used in investing activities comprise 
exploration expenditure and capital development 
expenditures at Sukari including the acquisition of 
ﬁnancial and mineral assets. Cash ﬂows have decreased 
by US$96 million to US$243.8 million. The primary use 
of the funds during the year was for investment in capital 
work-in-progress in relation to the Stage 4 development. 
In addition cash used in the purchase of available-for-
sale ﬁnancial assets was US$6.4 million compared to 
US$17.4 million in 2011.
Net cash ﬂows generated by ﬁnancing activities 
comprise the exercising of shares issued under the 
Company’s Loan Funded Share Plans (“LFSPs”) and 
options under the Employee Share Option Plan (“ESOP”) 
respectively. 
Effects of exchange rate changes have increased

subsidies which occurred in January 2012 (refer to Note 6 of the Financial Statements for further details).
The Company’s results over the past several quarters 
have been driven primarily by ﬂuctuations in gold price 
and increases in gold equivalent ounces produced. 
Additionally, increases in input costs and foreign 
exchange rates have impacted results.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, revenue increased to 
$138.5 million on gold equivalent ounces sold of 82,316 
compared with revenue of $84.5 million on sales of 
56,513 gold equivalent ounces during the fourth quarter 
of 2011. The average realized gold price per ounce in 
the fourth quarter of 2011 was $1,666 compared with 
the average realised gold price during this quarter of 
US$1,697 per ounce. 
Cost of sales increased by 111% to US$79.5 million  
in the ﬁnal quarter of 2012 versus US$37.6 million  
in the prior year, primarily as a result of the inclusion  
of an exceptional provision against prepayments 
recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal of the fuel subsidy 
which occurred in January 2012, together with higher 
input costs in areas such as energy and labour,  
as well as higher throughput.
Liquidity and capital resources
At 31 December 2012, the Group had cash and cash 
equivalents of US$147.1 million compared to US$164.2 
million at 31 December 2011. The majority of funds have 
been invested in short term deposits. The decrease in 
cash position is primarily due to the payments in relation 
to the Stage 4 processing plant development together 
with the inclusion of an exceptional provision against 
prepayments to reﬂect the removal of fuel subsidies offset 
with increased production and favourable gold prices. 
Centamin has a strong and ﬂexible ﬁnancial position 
with no debt, no hedging and cash, bullion, gold sales 
receivables and available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets of 
US$219.4 million at 31 December 2012. Cash, bullion, 
gold sales receivables and available-for-sale ﬁnancial 
assets is a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure and includes 
cash, bullion, gold sales receivable and available-for-sale 
ﬁnancial assets. 
Liquidity risk is the risk associated with not having 
access to sufﬁcient funds to meet planned and 
unplanned cash requirements. Centamin manages its 
exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring that its operating 
and strategic liquidity levels are well above minimum 
company requirements.
In the day to day business, the Group receives cash from 
its operations and is required to fund working capital and 
capital expenditure requirements. The cash is managed 
to ensure surplus funds are invested to maximise 
returns while ensuring that capital is safeguarded to the 
maximum extent possible by investing only with ﬁnancial 
institutions with a strong credit rating. 
The Group’s primary source of liquidity is operating cash 
ﬂow. The principal risk factor affecting operating cash 
ﬂow is cost, gold prices, timing of gold sales and the 
legal actions in relation to the Concession Agreement 
and Diesel Fuel matters.
The Group’s ﬁnancial commitments are limited 
to planned and discretionary spending on work 
programmes at the Sukari Gold Mine, planned and 
discretionary spending on work programmes at the 
exploration licences owned by Sheba, administration 
expenditure at the Egyptian, Australian and London 
ofﬁce locations and for general working capital purposes.
Management considers that the Group has adequate 
current assets and forecast cash ﬂow from operations  
to manage liquidity risks arising from settlement of 
current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
We had no debt for both the 2012 and the 2011 period.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, 
ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, 
which are described in Note 3 of the Notes to the 
Financial Statements, management is required to 
make judgments, estimates, and assumptions about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of 
which form the basis of making the judgments. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is 
revised if the revision affects only that period or in the 
period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgments that 
management has made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies and that have the most 
signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
Financial Statements:
Litigation
The Group is currently a party to two legal actions both 
of which could affect its ability to operate the mine at 
Sukari in the manner in which it is currently operated 
and adversely affect its proﬁtability. The details of this 
litigation, which relate to the loss of the Egyptian national 
subsidy for Diesel Fuel Oil and the ability of the Group 
to operate outside the area of 3km
2
 determined by the 
Administrative Court of ﬁrst instance to be the area of 
the Sukari exploitation lease, are available in Note 20 
to the Financial Statements and in the most recently  
ﬁled Annual Information Form (‘AIF’) which is available 
on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.  Although it is possible  
to quantify the effects of the loss the national fuel 
subsidy, it is not currently possible to quantify with 
sufﬁcient precision the effect of restricting operations  
to an area of 3km
2
. 
Every action is being taken to contest these decisions, 
including the making of formal legal appeals and, 
although their resolution may take some time, 
management remain conﬁdent that a satisfactory 
outcome will ultimately be achieved. In the meantime, 
however, the Group is continuing to pay international 
prices for Diesel Fuel Oil. With respect to the 
Administrative Court ruling, on 20 March 2013 the 
Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Company’s 
application to suspend this decision until the merits of 
the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus 
providing assurance that normal operations would be 
able to continue during this process.
Recovery of Capitalised Exploration Evaluation 
and Development Expenditure
The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and 
evaluation expenditure results in exploration and 
evaluation expenditure being capitalised for those 
projects where such expenditure is considered likely to 
be recoverable through future extraction activity or sale or 
where the exploration activities have not reached a stage 
which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence 
of reserves. This policy requires management to make 
certain estimates and assumptions as to future events 
and circumstances, in particular whether the Group will 
proceed with development based on existence of reserves 
or whether an economically viable extraction operation 
can be established. Such estimates and assumptions 
may change from period to period as new information 
becomes available. If, subsequent to the exploration and 
evaluation expenditure being capitalised, a judgment 
is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely or 
the project is to be abandoned, the relevant capitalised 
amount will be written off to the income statement. 38 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Accounting treatment of Sukari Gold Mines (SGM)
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin Group 
of companies, reﬂecting the substance and economic 
reality of the Concession Agreement (see Note 23 of the 
Financial Statements).
The following are the key assumptions concerning the 
future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty 
at the reporting date, that have a signiﬁcant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year:
Provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs
The Group is required to decommission, rehabilitate and 
restore mines and processing sites at the end of their 
producing lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant 
authorities. The provision has been calculated taking into 
account the estimated future obligations including the 
costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration 
and monitoring of the affected areas. The provision 
for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the 
present value of the expenditure required to settle the 
restoration obligation at the reporting date.
Ore reserve estimates
Estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include 
assumptions on commodity prices, exchange rates, 
discount rates and production costs for future cashﬂows. 
It also involves assessment and judgment of difﬁcult 
geological models. The economic, geological and technical 
factors used to estimate ore reserves may change 
from period to period. Changes in ore reserves affect 
the carrying values of mine properties, property, plant 
and equipment, provision for rehabilitation assets and 
deferred taxes. Ore reserves are integral to the amount of 
depreciation and amortisation charged to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and the calculation of inventory.
Production forecasts from the underground mine at 
Sukari are partly based on estimates regarding future 
resource and reserve growth. It is the opinion of 
management and Directors that these estimates are both 
realistic and conservative, based on current information. 
However, as the mine relies on continued deeper 
development and exploration drilling for further reserve 
deﬁnition, the life of this part of the mine remains limited 
and there is a risk that some or all of this growth will 
not materialise with a consequent negative impact on 
current production forecasts.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group changed its accounting policy on production-
phase stripping costs with effect from 1 January 2012. 
As a result, the 2011 results have been restated. Refer 
to Note 3 of the Financial Statements for further details. 
There have been no further changes to the Group’s 
accounting policies during the year. 
GOING CONCERN STATEMENT
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in this business review. The ﬁnancial 
position of the Group, its cash ﬂows, liquidity position  
and borrowing facilities are also described in this 
business review above. In addition, Note 26 of the 
Financial Statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital;  
its ﬁnancial risk management objectives; details of its 
ﬁnancial instruments; and its exposure to credit risk  
and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in Note 26 of the Financial Statements, 
the Group meets its day to day working capital 
requirements through cash generated by its operations. 
The current economic conditions create uncertainty 
particularly over a) the level of demand of the Group’s 
products; b) the price at which its products can be sold; 
and c) the price at which its main raw materials can  
be procured. 
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account 
of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
show that Group should be able to continue generating 
sufﬁcient cash in order to ﬁnance its operations and 
capital expansions. 
As discussed elsewhere in this document, during the 
year the operation of the mine was affected by two legal 
actions. The ﬁrst of these followed from a decision taken 
by EGPC to charge international, not local (subsidised) 
prices for the supply of Diesel Fuel Oil, and the second 
arose as a result of judgment of an Administrative Court 
of ﬁrst instance in relation to, amongst other matters, the 
Company’s 160km
2
 exploitation lease. In relation to the 
ﬁrst decision, the Company remains conﬁdent that in the 
event that it is required to continue to pay international 
prices, the mine at Sukari will remain commercially viable. 
Similarly, the Company remains conﬁdent that the appeal it 
has lodged in relation to the decision of the Administrative 
Court will ultimately be successful, although ﬁnal 
Management Discussion & Analysis  
and Business Review 39
resolution of it may take some time. On 20 March 2013 
the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Company’s 
application to suspend the decision until the merits of 
the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus 
providing assurance that normal operations would be able 
to continue during this process.
In the unlikely event that the Group is unsuccessful  
in either or both of its legal actions, and that the 
operating activities are restricted to a reduced area,  
it is the Directors’ belief that the Group will be able  
to continue as going concern.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting  
in preparing the Annual Financial Statements.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
Three non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures are used  
in this report:
1)  EBITDA: “EBITDA” is a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure, 
which excludes the following from proﬁt before tax:
 Finance costs;
 Finance income; and
 Depreciation and amortisation.
Management believes that EBITDA is a valuable 
indicator of the Group’s ability to generate liquidity 
by producing operating cash ﬂow to fund working 
capital needs and fund capital expenditures. 
EBITDA is also frequently used by investors and 
analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA 
is multiplied by a factor or “EBITDA multiple” that 
is based on an observed or inferred relationship 
between EBITDA and market values to determine 
the approximate total enterprise value of a company. 
EBITDA is intended to provide additional information 
to investors and analysts and does not have any 
standardized deﬁnition under IFRS and should 
not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for 
measures of performance prepared in accordance 
with IFRS. EBITDA excludes the impact of cash costs 
and income of ﬁnancing activities and taxes, and 
therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating 
proﬁt or cash ﬂow from operations as determined 
under IFRS. Other companies may calculate 
EBITDA differently. The following table provides 
a reconciliation of EBITDA to proﬁt for the year 
attributable to the Company.

2)  Cash Cost per Ounce Calculation: “Cash costs per ounce” is a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Cash Cost per 
ounce is a measure of the average cost of producing an ounce of gold, calculated by dividing the operating costs 
in a period by the total gold production over the same period. Operating costs represent total operating costs less 
administrative expenses, royalties, depreciation and amortization. Management uses this measure internally to better 
assess performance trends for the Company as a whole. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional 
measures prepared in accordance with GAAP , certain investors use such non-GAAP information to evaluate the 
Company’s performance and ability to generate cash ﬂow. The Company believes that these measures provide 
an alternative reﬂection of the Group’s performance for the current period and are an alternative indication of its 
expected performance in future periods. Cash costs is intended to provide additional information, does not have any 
standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures 
of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP . This measure is not necessarily indicative of operating proﬁt or 
cash ﬂow from operations as determined under GAAP . Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

INTERNAL CONTROLS
Financial reporting controls and procedures are 
designed to provide reasonable assurance that all 
relevant information is gathered and reported to 
management, including the CEO, CFO and COO,  
on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions can 
be made regarding public disclosure. Management, 
with the participation of the certifying ofﬁcers, has 
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation, 
as of 31 December 2012, of the Company’s disclosure 
controls and procedures (as deﬁned by the Canadian 
Securities Administrators). Based on that evaluation,  
the certifying ofﬁcers have concluded that such 
disclosure controls and procedures are effective and 
designed to ensure that material information relating  
to the Company and its subsidiaries is made known  
to them by others within those entities. 
Internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting are designed 
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of our ﬁnancial reporting and compliance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in our Financial 
Statements. Management  evaluated at implementation 
the design of internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting and 
has concluded that such internal controls over ﬁnancial 
reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the 
preparation of Financial Statements for external purposes 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) adopted by the European Union  
(‘EU IFRS’). In addition, there have been no changes  
in the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting 
during the year ended 31 December 2012 that have 
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially 
affect, its internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
At 31 December 2012, the Group has exposure to 
interest rate risk which is limited to the ﬂoating market 
rate for cash.
The Group does not have foreign currency risk for 
non-monetary assets and liabilities of the Egyptian 
operations as these are deemed to have a functional 
currency of United States dollars. The Group has 
no signiﬁcant monetary foreign currency assets and 
liabilities apart from Australian dollar and United States 
dollar cash term deposits.
The Group currently does not engage in any hedging or 
derivative transactions to manage interest rate or foreign 
currency risks.
FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN EGYPT
Foreign investments in the petroleum and mining sectors 
in Egypt are governed by individual production sharing 
agreements (concession agreements) between foreign 
companies and the Ministry for Petroleum and Mineral 
Resources or the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority 
(“EMRA”) (as the case may be) and are individual Acts of 
Parliament.
Title, exploitation and development rights to the 
Sukari Gold Mine are granted under the terms of the 
Concession Agreement promulgated as Law No. 222  
of 1994, signed on 29 January 1995 and effective from 
13 June 1995. The Concession Agreement was issued 
by way of Presidential Decree after the approval of the 
People’s Assembly in accordance with the Egyptian 
Constitution and Law No. 61 of 1958. The Concession 
Agreement was issued in accordance with the Egyptian 
Mines and Quarries Law No. 86 of 1956 which allows for 
the Ministry to grant the right to parties to explore and 
mine for minerals in Egypt.
Whilst the Company is the ﬁrst foreign company to 
develop a modern large-scale gold mine in Egypt there 
is signiﬁcant foreign investment in the petroleum sector. 
Several large multinational oil and gas companies 
operate successfully in Egypt, some of which have long 
histories in the country and have dedicated signiﬁcant 
amounts of capital. The Company believes that the 
successful track record of foreign investment established 
by these companies in the petroleum sector is an 
important indication of the ability of foreign companies to 
attract ﬁnancing and receive development approvals for 
the construction of major mining projects in Egypt.
Egyptian Court Litigation 
As discussed elsewhere in this document the Company 
was involved in two separate actions. The ﬁrst followed 
from a decision taken by EGPC to charge international, 
not local prices (subsidised), prices for the supply of 
Diesel Fuel Oil, and the second arose as a result of 
judgment of an Administrative Court of ﬁrst instance  
in Cairo in relation to the Company’s 160km
2
  
exploitation lease. 42 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Concession Agreement Court case
On 30 October 2012, the Administrative Courts in Egypt 
handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by, 
amongst others, an independent member of the previous 
parliament, in which he argued for the nulliﬁcation of the 
agreement that confers on the Group rights to operate 
in Egypt. This agreement, the Concession Agreement, 
was entered into between the Arab Republic of Egypt, 
the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority (“EMRA”) and 
Centamin’s wholly owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold Mines 
(“PGM”), and was approved by the People’s Assembly as 
Law 222 of 1994.
In summary that judgment states that, although the 
Concession Agreement itself remains valid and in force, 
sufﬁcient evidence had not been submitted to Court 
in order to demonstrate that the 160km
2
 “exploitation 
lease” between PGM and EMRA had received approval 
from the relevant Minister as required by the terms of 
the Concession Agreement. Accordingly, the Court 
found that the exploitation lease in respect of the area of 
160km
2
 was not valid although it stated that there was 
in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km
2
. 
Centamin, however, is in possession of the executed 
original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 
160km
2
 exploitation lease was approved by the Minister 
of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. It appears that an 
executed original document was not supplied to the Court. 
Upon notiﬁcation of the judgment the Group took various 
steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine 
at Sukari. These included both lodging a formal appeal 
before the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 November 
2012 and, in the ﬁrst instance, lodging an “Objection  
to Enforcement in respect of” the original ruling with the 
Civil Court on 31 October 2012, which had the effect of 
“staying” (postponing) implementation for an initial period.  
In addition, in conjunction with the formal appeal the 
Group applied to the Supreme Administrative Court to 
suspend the initial decision until such time as the Court 
is able to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal. 
On 20 March 2013 the Court upheld this application thus 
suspending the initial decision and providing assurance 
that normal operations will be able to continue whilst the 
appeal process is underway. 
EMRA lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 
27 November 2012, the day after the Company’s appeal 
was lodged. Furthermore, in late December 2012, the 
Minister of Petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and 
shortly thereafter publicly indicated that, in his view, 
the terms of the Concession Agreement were fair and 
that the exploitation lease was valid. The Minister of 
Petroleum also expressed support for the investment and 
expertise that Centamin brings to the country. We believe 
this demonstrates the government’s commitment to our 
investment at Sukari and the desire to stimulate further 
investment in the Egyptian mining industry.
We do not yet know when the appeal will conclude, 
although are aware of the potential for the process in 
Egypt to be lengthy. The Company has taken extensive 
legal advice on the merits of its appeal from two leading 
Egyptian law ﬁrms who have conﬁrmed that the proper 
steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km
2
 
exploitation lease. We therefore remain of the view that the 
appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will ultimately 
be successful. In the event that the appellate court fails to 
be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the 
Group, the operations at Sukari may be adversely effected 
to the extent that the companies operation exceeded the 
exploitation lease area of 3km
2
 referred to in the original 
court decision.
The Company remains conﬁdent that normal operations  
at Sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal process  
is underway.
Further details about this litigation are set out in Note 20 
to the Financial Statements and in the most recently ﬁled 
Annual Information Form (‘AIF’) which is available on 
SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Diesel Fuel Court Case
In January 2012 the Group received a letter from 
Chevron to the effect that Chevron would not be able 
to continue supplying Diesel Fuel Oil (DFO) to the 
mine at Sukari at local subsidised prices, thereby 
adding approximately US$150 per ounce to the cost 
of production. It is understood that the reason that this 
letter was issued was that Chevron had received  
a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General 
Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). Subsequent to this 
ﬁrst letter, the Group received a demand from Egyptian 
General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) for LE403 
million (US$60 million) being the amount of the subsidy 
received in respect of the diesel fuel supplied from 
December 2009 until January 2012.
The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter 
and in consequence in June lodged an appeal against 
EGPC’s decision in the Administrative Courts. Again, the 
Group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong  
and that there is good prospect of success. However, 
as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the 
continuation of supply, the Group has since January 
advanced funds to our fuel supplier, Chevron, based 
on the international price for fuel. Further details about 
this litigation are set out in Note 20 to the Financial 
Statements and in the most recently ﬁled AIF which  
is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Management Discussion & Analysis  
and Business Review 43
OVERVIEW OF SUKARI CONCESSION 
AGREEMENT
Pharaoh Gold Mines NL (“PGM”) a 100% wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Company, EGSMA (now “EMRA”) and 
the Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) entered into the 
Concession Agreement dated 29 January 1995, granting 
PGM and EMRA the right to explore, develop, mine and 
sell gold and associated minerals in speciﬁc concession 
areas located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt identiﬁed in 
the Concession Agreement. The Concession Agreement 
came into effect under Egyptian law on 13 June 1995.
A summary of the main terms of the Concession 
Agreement is as follows:
 PGM provides funding to the Operating Company, 
Sukari Gold Mining Company, (SGM) and is 
responsible for the day-to-day management  
of that company.
 PGM is entitled to recover: 
 - all current operating expenses incurred and paid 
after the initial commercial production;
 - exploration costs, including those accumulated to 
the commencement of commercial production  
(at the rate of 33.3% per annum); and
 - exploitation capital costs, including those 
accumulated prior to the commencement  
of commercial production (at the rate of  
33.3% per annum).
 The ARE is entitled to a royalty of 3% of net sales 
revenue from the sale of gold and associated minerals 
from the Sukari Gold Mine.
 Commencing on the date of commercial production, 
PGM is entitled to a 15 year exemption from any taxes 
imposed by the Egyptian government, with an option 
to extend this entitlement for further 15 years. 
 After the deduction of recoverable expenses and the 
payment of the 3% royalty, the proﬁts are shared 
equally between PGM and EMRA (with an additional 
10% of proceeds paid to PGM in the ﬁrst 2 years that 
there are net proceeds and an additional 5% in the 
following 2 years).
 PGM, EMRA and the Operating Company are 
exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect 
to the importation of machinery, equipment and 
consumable items required for the purpose of 
exploration and mining activities at Sukari. 
 PGM, EMRA, the Operating Company and their 
respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or 
taxes on the export of gold and associated minerals 
produced from the Sukari Gold Mine.
In addition, the Concession Agreement establishes 
a procedure for the conversion of any exploration 
lease granted in favour of PGM into an exploitation 
lease. Upon following the procedure prescribed by the 
Concession Agreement, the Company was granted such 
an exploitation lease in respect of 160km
2
 in 2005 and 
is in possession of the original document granting this 
lease duly signed by all relevant parties. The validity 
of this lease is, however, the subject of the litigation 
referred to above.
For the accounting treatment of the Concession 
Agreement refer to Note 23 of the Financial Statements. 44 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
PRINCIPAL RISKS AFFECTING THE CENTAMIN GROUP
The Group faces a variety of risks which could adversely affect its performance, earnings, ﬁnancial position and 
prospects. In addition, there may be additional risks unknown to Centamin and other risks, which are currently believed 
to be immaterial and could turn out to be material. These risks, whether they materialise individually or simultaneously, 
could signiﬁcantly affect the group’s business and ﬁnancial results. In addition, Centamin could also be affected by 
risks relating to the gold mining industry generally and the risks and hazards involved in the business of mining metals, 
which are largely outside its control.
It is for this reason that the Group conducted a variety of risk assessments throughout the year as part of its normal 
business performance and operational reviews, the results of which have been considered by the Audit and Risk 
Committee, and the Board, on a regular basis as required by the UK Code on Corporate Governance and relevant 
Canadian requirements. Centamin has taken a number of steps to mitigate some of these risks and will continue to 
evaluate ways in which it can manage and mitigate risks accordingly. Notwithstanding this, due to the very nature of 
risks no assurance can be given that mitigating actions taken or planned will be wholly effective.
A description of the key risks affecting the Company and the steps taken to mitigate them is set out in the table below. 
This table should be read in conjunction with the commentary under the heading “Concession Agreement Court case” 
which describes in detail the risks to the Group’s operations in Egypt raised by the judgment handed down on 30 October 
by the Administrative Court. 
RISK CATEGORY DESCRIPTION OF POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION / COMMENTARY
Single project 
dependency
 The Sukari Gold Mine currently 
constitutes all of the group’s 
mineral resources and reserves 
and the potential for the future 
generation of revenue (with the 
exception of the group’s small 
exploration portfolio in Ethiopia). 
 Any adverse development 
affecting the progress of the 
Sukari Project could have a 
material and adverse effect 
on the group’s ﬁnancial 
performance and results.
 In order to ensure continued growth, the group has been 
active in identifying new resources and development 
opportunities through exploration and acquisition targets both 
inside and outside Egypt. 
 Centamin assesses and continues to assess a wide range of 
potential growth opportunities both within Egypt, the wider 
area of the Arabian-Nubian Shield and beyond. 
 Until further production growth beyond Sukari is delivered 
the risk remains high.
Management Discussion & Analysis  
and Business Review 45
RISK CATEGORY DESCRIPTION OF POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION / COMMENTARY
Single country 
dependency
 All of the group’s operational 
revenue is derived from 
production in Egypt.
 Future policies regarding 
foreign development and 
ownership of mineral resources 
may change.
 The courts may interpret 
existing legislation in new ways. 
 Changes in government policy and/or law may affect both 
the group’s ability to undertake exploration, development 
and operational activities in respect of future properties as 
well as its ability to continue to explore, develop and operate 
those properties in respect of which it has obtained mineral 
exploration and exploitation rights to date. 
 Changes in policy in Egypt may result in changes in laws 
affecting ownership of assets, land tenure and mineral 
concessions, fuel subsidies, taxation, royalties, rates of 
exchange, environmental protection, labour relations, 
employment of expatriates, repatriation of income and 
return of capital.
 The current political situation in Egypt has not affected the 
safety of the Group’s employees or its day-to-day operations 
at its ﬂagship project, Sukari.
 Comments under “Litigation risk” also apply here.
 The Directors of the Group continue to monitor the situation 
and there are no matters to report outside of what is already 
publicly available.
 The actions with regard to the “Single project dependency” 
risk apply here.
 Until further production growth outside Egypt is delivered 
the risk remains high.
Operational risks Interruptions to normal 
operations and/or construction 
projects may be caused by 
a number of factors, such as 
late delivery of equipment and 
supplies, adverse weather, 
equipment failures, delays  
in obtaining/renewing permits. 
 Any failure or unavailability  
of operational infrastructure 
could adversely affect 
production output and/
or impact exploration and 
development activities. 
 Some of these factors (particularly delays to supplies, 
material and services) have led to short-term delays in the 
commissioning of the Stage 4 expansion at Sukari.
 Expansion projects at Sukari have been, and continue to 
be, self-funded out of operational cash ﬂow and the cost 
recovery process. The capital investment funding for the 
Stage 4 expansion is therefore to a large extent reliant on 
normal operations continuing. The temporary disruption to 
gold exports and fuel supply in late-2012 caused a shortage 
in working capital within SGM which caused some payment 
delays to suppliers and therefore some minor delays to the 
supply of materials, equipment and services to the project.
 The group’s mining, processing, development and 
exploration activities at Sukari depend on the continuous 
availability of its operational infrastructure, in addition to 
reliable utilities and water supplies and access to roads.
 Management assesses the critical components of the 
group’s operational infrastructure on a continuous basis and 
keep a large inventory of critical spares; however spares for

External risks The current Egyptian political 
situation may affect the safety 
of the group’s employees and/
or adversely affect the group’s 
ability to operate the Sukari 
Gold Mine.
 Civil unrest, war, ﬁghting, 
terrorism or similar events in 
Egypt, Ethiopia or elsewhere 
could adversely affect 
operations.
 Management closely monitors events external to its normal 
operations in all countries in which it operates.
 The current political situation in Egypt has not to date had 
any signiﬁcant effect the safety of the Group’s employees 
or its day-to-day operations at Sukari nor has it had 
any material adverse impact on the group’s investment, 
though the value of the Company’s shares may have been 
adversely affected.
 There have been disruptions to the domestic, subsidised 
fuel supply throughout Egypt which has affected some of 
our suppliers and has contributed towards delays in the 
completion of the Stage 4 expansion project. To date the 
supply of diesel for normal operations, which is priced and 
supplied on an international basis, has not been affected.
 Future disruptions due to external factors are likely,  
but to date have only had a moderate impact.
Political, legal 
and regulatory 
risks
 Changes to existing law and 
regulations, or more stringent 
application or interpretation of 
current laws and regulations 
by relevant government 
authorities, could adversely 
affect the group’s operations 
and development projects.
 Operations may be affected by government regulations 
with respect to production, price controls, export controls, 
income taxes, expropriation of property, maintenance of 
claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of 
local people, water use and safety regulations on adverse 
judicial rulings. 
 Exports of gold from Sukari were temporarily disrupted in 
late-2012 due to a delay in securing the relevant approvals 
from the Egyptian customs authority, causing a temporary 
adverse impact on the working capital position of SGM.
 The group actively monitors legal and political developments 
in Egypt and Ethiopia and actively engages in dialogue with 
relevant government and legal policy makers to discuss all key 
legal and regulatory developments applicable to its operation 
environmental legislation.
 The potential for serious impact should be balanced 
against the Egyptian government’s support of the 
Company’s investment and contribution to both revenue  
and development of the mining industry.

Relationship with 
EMRA
 A dispute with EMRA may 
adversely affect the group’s 
ability to manage the Sukari in 
the most effective way.
 A dispute may arise under the 
Sukari Concession Agreement 
regarding the cost recovery 
process and the level of Proﬁt 
Share due to EMRA.
 EMRA may pressure for more 
operational control at Sukari.
 The successful management of the Sukari Gold Mine is in 
part dependent on maintaining a good working relationship 
with EMRA.
 The group has regular meetings with ofﬁcials from EMRA 
and invests time in liaising with relevant ministry and 
other governmental representatives. Management and the 
Board of Directors believe the group has a positive and 
constructive working relationship with EMRA.
 The group complies with all terms and conditions of the 
Concession Agreement covering the Sukari Gold Mine.
 EMRA has equal representation on the Board of Sukari 
Gold Mines and is involved to that extent in approving and 
auditing all work programs and expenditures.
 EMRA inspectors are closely involved in monitoring all 
aspects of the Sukari operations.
 Current discussions with EMRA are focussed on 
determining the exact timing and quantum of the ﬁrst 
payment of Proﬁt Sharing for Sukari.
 Whilst the impact would be high, management believes 
there is a low probability of a material deterioration 
in relationships with EMRA, particularly following the 
prepayment in relation to future proﬁt share made 
subsequent to year end.
Government 
inexperience  
in mining
 Egypt has limited experience 
of modern large scale mining 
operations.
 Current laws do not reﬂect 
current mining practices.
 The Company has ‘ﬁrst mover’ status in Egypt, with Sukari 
being the ﬁrst and only modern mine in the country.  
This, however, means that many of the laws, permitting/
licencing procedures and general bureaucracy in relation 
to mining are under-developed relative to those in other 
countries with a more advanced mining industry.
 Management regularly engage in dialogue with all levels  
of government with regard to the challenges that this  
general level of inexperience in dealing with the mining 
industry presents.
 The Company has a solid track record of overcoming 
challenges caused by government inexperience, despite 
occasional impacts on production. For example, the Sukari 
mine operates, with a high degree of efﬁciency, under  
what management considers excessive restrictions  
on blasting activities.
 The Egyptian government has stated publicly that it intends 
to support and assist in the development of the country’s 
mining industry.
 The Company is currently in discussion with EMRA and 
other government departments in relation to securing 
the permissions and supply of ammonium nitrate (AN) 
necessary for open pit mining rates to increase to the 
required level as dictated by the current mine plan.
 The potential for serious impact is balanced by the 
Egyptian government’s support of the Company’s 
investment and contribution to both revenue and 
development of the mining industry. 48 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

Monitoring of 
Concessions
 Inadvertent breach of the 
Concession Agreement 
 The agreement itself could 
be terminated by presidential 
decree or on public  
policy grounds
 The Concession Agreement between the Arab Republic of 
Egypt, the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority (“EMRA”) 
and Centamin’s wholly owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold 
Mines (“PGM”) was approved by the People’s Assembly as 
law 222 of 1994.
 The agreement imposes certain obligations on PGM and 
there is a risk that any failure by PGM to comply with 
any such obligation may constitute a material breach, 
regardless of actual operational signiﬁcance.
 The Company maintains a register of all its obligations 
under the Concession Agreement, and on a quarterly 
basis this is reviewed by a committee of the Board, and if 
necessary appropriate remedial action taken.
 Steps taken to mitigate this risk are a reviewed during the 
audit process of the Company’s accounts.
 Given the controls in place and the support of the Egyptian 
government, this risk is judged to be low.
Employees and 
contractors
 Industrial unrest may negatively 
impact on the group’s 
operations and production. 
 The loss of, or inability to 
source, skilled workers and 
professional labour may cause 
a medium-term threat to 
operations.
 The Group depends on 
certain key contractors and 
interruptions in contracted 
services could result in loss of 
production.
 Management believes its labour relations, with both 
employees and contractors are satisfactory. 
 Egyptian employment law affords extensive protection to 
employees and the group is committed to keeping the pay, 
beneﬁts, training and conditions for its Egyptian work force 
competitive. 
 A workers’ representative group has been established for 
the purpose of facilitating a better dialogue with those 
employed at the Sukari Gold Mine.
 However, strikes have occurred in the past at Sukari and 
there can be no assurance that a future work slowdown,  
a work stoppage or strike will not occur here or at any of the 
group’s other projects.
 The group’s business signiﬁcantly depends upon its ability 
to recruit and retain qualiﬁed personnel, in particular 
members of the senior management team and its skilled 
team of engineers and geologists.
 The group regularly assesses its staff recruitment and 
retention policies, including its reward structures and 
incentive plans, to assist with labour stability, and maintains 
appropriate investment in training and development to 
safeguard the skills of its work force. 
 Regular reviews are carried out in order to attract, retain and 
incentivise key employees, including the expatriate workforce.
 Assessments of arrangements with key contractors are 
undertaken on a regular basis to ensure that contracted 
services and support meet business requirements and 
expectations.
 Whilst the group and its underground and drilling sub-
contractors are actively training local Egyptians they rely 
also on expatriate workforce and visas for such expats.
 The risk of future disruptions within the work force remains 
elevated but the impacts are judged to be manageable.

Gold price The group’s ﬁnancial 
performance is highly 
dependent upon the price of 
gold, which is affected by a 
number of factors beyond the 
group’s control.
 Rapid ﬂuctuations in pricing of gold will have  
a corresponding impact on the ﬁnancial position.
 The group’s objective is to provide maximum exposure to 
the price of gold and, as such, a policy of not hedging gold 
has been adopted. 
 The group manages its exposure to gold price ﬂuctuations 
by retaining a focus on keeping operating costs as low as 
possible.
Litigation risks The Company’s ﬁnances, and 
its ability to operate in Egypt, 
may be severely adversely 
affected by current and any 
future litigation proceedings. 
 As discussed above, the Company is currently involved in 
litigation that relates both to a) the validity of its exploitation 
lease at Sukari; and b) the price at which can purchase 
Diesel Fuel Oil . 
 The Company has engaged appropriate legal advice and 
continues to actively pursue its legal rights with respect to 
the existing litigation.
 The Company and its legal advisors believe that the 
on-going appeals in relation to both of these cases will be 
successful, although this outcome cannot be guaranteed.
 It is possible that further litigation could be initiated against 
the Company at any time.
 Management and the Company’s legal advisors monitor 
both activity in court and local media for signs of any 
litigation that may threaten its operations, ﬁnances  
or prospects.
 The potential for serious impact should be balanced 
against the Company’s adherence to local laws and 
agreements, as well as the Egyptian government’s support 
of the Company’s investment. 50 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

Reserve and 
resource 
estimates
 Mineral reserves and resources 
are estimates based on a range 
of assumptions, including 
geological, metallurgical and 
technical factors.
 There can be no guarantee that 
the anticipated tonnages or 
grades will be achieved.
 Management has implemented processes to continuously 
monitor and evaluate the current life of the Sukari Gold 
Mine, mine plans and production targets. 
 The group’s resources and reserves are regularly reviewed 
and are presented in accordance with the 2004 Australian 
Code for the Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves (“JORC Code”) which provides an equivalent 
presentation to NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of 
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards  
(the “CIM Standards”).
 The nature of underground mining operations makes it 
difﬁcult to calculate resources in advance of expending 
money on development. As a consequence, underground 
reserves and resources are likely to remain low compared 
with the levels of expected production.
 Production forecasts from the underground mine at Sukari 
are partly based on estimates regarding future resource 
and reserve growth. It is the opinion of management 
and Directors that these estimates are both realistic and 
conservative, based on current information. However, 
as the mine relies on continued deeper development 
and exploration drilling for further reserve deﬁnition, the 
life of this part of the mine remains limited and there is 
a risk that some or all of this growth will not materialise 
with a consequent negative impact on current production 
forecasts.
 Whilst there are no certainties, production to date has 
provided conﬁdence in management’s estimation and mine 
planning methods. 
Health and safety Potential for fatalities and/or 
a signiﬁcant increase in the 
number of serious injuries at 
the mine to materially affect 
operations
 A signiﬁcant rise in the number 
of safety-related incidents could 
cause a deterioration of the 
Company’s relationship with its 
work force.
 The local safety culture in Egypt has been observed to be 
poor, with low standards of risk-awareness and familiarity 
with the risks associated with mining.
 There are active monitoring, communicating and reporting 
systems in place to assess the risk levels and appropriate 
courses of action.
 Safety induction and training programs for staff are an 
essential component of their duties.
 Sukari has a strong safety culture and a good track record 
with a LTIFR of 0.69 per 200,000 man hours in 2012, a 
strong improvement on 1.25 in 2011.
 The group manages effectively the risks to health and 
safety and so the risk is low.

RISK CATEGORY DESCRIPTION OF POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION / COMMENTARY
The cost of 
self-generated 
electricity
 The cost of diesel fuel oil 
may ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly 
depending on market prices 
and the extent to which the 
group can continue to take 
advantage of the fuel subsidies 
currently offered by the ARE.
 The Sukari Gold Mine relies on self-generation  
by diesel power generators located on site.
 Since January 2012 the group has paid the full international 
price for its diesel supply in Egypt and does not beneﬁt 
from any government subsidies.
 Management is reviewing alternative energy sources of grid 
power and gas pipelines.
 The risk is low since the Sukari operation does not 
beneﬁt from subsidies and increases in market prices for 
oil products have historically been offset by concurrent 
increases in the gold price.
Environmental 
hazards and 
rehabilitation
 Environmental hazards may 
cause losses and costs, 
licences and permits to be 
withdrawn or suspended, 
or enforced clean-up and 
remediation action. 
 Any such action could have  
a material adverse effect on the 
group’s business, operations 
and ﬁnancial condition.
 Mining operations have inherent risks and liabilities 
associated with pollution of the environment and the 
disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral 
exploration and production.
 No signiﬁcant environmental incidents have occurred to 
date at any of the Company’s projects.
 Laws and regulations involving the protection and 
remediation of the environment and the governmental 
policies for implementation of such laws and regulations 
are constantly changing and are generally becoming more 
restrictive. 
 The Directors believe that the group is in compliance in all 
material respects with applicable environmental laws and 
regulations and holds all necessary approvals, licences and 
permits under those laws.
 Compliance with these standards is monitored  
by the HSES committee. 
 Remediation and rehabilitation costs are assessed and 
reviewed on at least an annual basis.
 Given the monitoring and control procedures  
in place, whilst the impact of an incident would be 
material, the risk of occurrence is judged to be low.
Community 
relations
 A failure to adequately engage 
or manage relations with local 
communities and stakeholders 
could have a direct impact  
on the group’s ability to operate 
at Sukari.
 In addition to its existing corporate social responsibility 
programmes, the group is implementing a number 
of additional initiatives to improve and build on local 
community relations, and has increased its social 
management capacity. 52 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
As referred in Note 20 to the Financial Statements and in 
the most recently ﬁled Annual Information Form (“AIF”), 
the Group is involved in on-going litigation in respect of 
both the price at which Diesel Fuel Oil is supplied to the 
mine at Sukari and the validity of the 160km
2
 exploitation 
lease at Sukari.
Subsequent to year end the Company acquired a further 
interest in Nyota Minerals Limited and Sahar Minerals 
Limited for US$1,163,969 and US$500,000 respectively.
Pursuant to the provisions of the Concession Agreement, 
any Proﬁt Share payments made to EMRA are due on 
an annual basis at the end of SGM’s ﬁnancial year, 
being 30 June. Based on the Company’s calculation 
there was no Proﬁt Share due to EMRA as at 30 June 
2012. Furthermore, it is expected that there will be 
Proﬁt Share due to EMRA for the current SGM ﬁnancial 
year ending 30 June 2013, based on budgeted 
production, gold price and operating expense forecasts. 
Following discussions with EMRA, and with a view to 
demonstrating goodwill toward the Egyptian government, 
subsequent to year end PGM has made an advance 
payment to EMRA of US$8,200,000. Calculations 
for Proﬁt Share will be done annually on the audited 
accounts of SGM and this advance payment will be 
netted off against any future Proﬁt Share that becomes 
payable to EMRA. 
There were no other signiﬁcant events occurring  
after the reporting date requiring disclosure in the 
Financial Statements.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITY INSURANCE
In accordance with Centamin’s articles of association 
and to the extent permitted by law, Centamin may 
indemnify its Directors out of its own funds to cover 
liabilities incurred as a result of their ofﬁce.
The Company has entered into indemnity agreements 
with each Director to indemnify each Director to the 
extent permitted by applicable law and excluding any 
matters involving fraud, dishonesty, wilful default or bad 
faith on the part of a Director.
During the year, the Company paid a premium in respect 
of a contract insuring the Directors and ofﬁcers of the 
Company and any related body corporate against a 
liability incurred as a director or ofﬁcer to the extent 
permitted by law. This provides insurance cover for any 
claim brought against Directors or ofﬁcers for wrongful 
acts in connection with their positions. The insurance 
provided does not extend to claims arising from fraud 
or dishonesty and it does not provide cover for civil or 
criminal ﬁnes or penalties imposed by law.

or ﬁnancial instruments are outlined in the Directors’ 
Remuneration report on page 79.
AUDITOR
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of 
approval of this annual report conﬁrms that:
 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditor

will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual  
General Meeting.

Directors’ Report 61
Corporate Governance Statement 
LETTER FROM  
THE CHAIRMAN
Corporate governance 
is both a framework by 
which the interests of 
various stakeholders 
are balanced and 
a structure through 
which the objectives of 
a company are set. It 
also includes how the 
path to achieving those objectives is outlined and how 
performance is measured along the way. As a company 
with a premium listing on the Main Market of the London 
Stock Exchange, the Company is subject to the Financial 
Services Authority’s Listing Rules and the requirement 
to explain how it has applied the Main Principles of the 
Financial Reporting Council’s UK Corporate Governance 
Code (“the Code”). A copy of the Code is available from 
the FRC’s website, www.frc.org.uk. The Listing Rules 
also require a company with such a listing to conﬁrm 
that it has complied with all relevant provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code or explain areas of  
non-compliance. 
The Board is also committed to the principles of 
corporate governance contained in the best practice 
recommendations of the Toronto Stock Exchange 
and the best practice recommendations prescribed 
under National Policy 58-201 – Corporate Governance 
Guidelines (“NP 58-201”), for which the board is 
accountable to shareholders.
The Board considers that throughout the year, the 
Company has complied with the relevant provisions 
of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code and has 
applied such best practice recommendations with the 
exception that, for the period under review, the roles of 
Chairman and Chief Executive were both exercised by 
me. This was due initially to the sudden and unexpected 
death of Mr Harry Michael, our Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, 
in November 2011. Since then, taking account of the 
current political circumstances of Egypt and the need 
accordingly for continuity in the leadership of the company 
at this important juncture the Board has concluded the 
interests of both the Company and shareholders are best 
served by my continuing in those roles until such time as 
a suitable successor can be identiﬁed. The Board has also 
agreed that for so long as the roles remained combined, 
certain corporate governance functions undertaken by 
me in my capacity as Chairman will be delegated to the 
Senior Independent Director. These functions include 
chairing the board meetings, ensuring that the Board 
receives timely information and ensuring the efﬁcient 
organization and conduct of the Board’s functioning. It 
should also be noted that both the Code and the best 
practice recommendations favour that the Chairman be 
an independent Director whereas until 3 March 2010 the 
Company retained my services as Managing Director/CEO 
and accordingly I am not an independent non-executive 
Chairman within the meaning of the Code. The reasons 
why the Board believed that my appointment to the 
position of Chairman was appropriate were set out in last 
year’s Annual Report and Accounts, and in compliance 
with the Code, major shareholders were consulted 
before my appointment was conﬁrmed. In addition, the 
effectiveness of the group’s risk management and internal 
control systems and the policy on how concerns could be 
raised by staff were not formally reviewed in the period 
ended 31 December 2012. A formal review of these 
matters is scheduled for the second quarter of 2013, 
which review will cover all material controls, including 
ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls.
Succession planning
A key part of my role as Chairman is to ensure the 
right people are doing the right jobs and that there is a 
sufﬁcient core of individuals being nurtured throughout 
the Company to enable effective succession planning.
The Board remains committed to succession planning 
and the untimely passing of Harry Michael in 2011 
reinforced its importance to us. Reviews of management 
capabilities and potential are performed on a routine 
basis and I am satisﬁed that sufﬁcient resource within 
the Group exists and continues to be developed. Where 
a need for improvement to management resources is 
identiﬁed, the necessary attention is provided to ensure 
full strength is attained as soon as practicable, which 
was demonstrated by Andrew Pardey’s appointment 
as Chief Operating Ofﬁcer and Andrew Davidson’s 
appointment as Head of Business Development and 
Investor Relations. 62 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Board appointments
The Board was further strengthened during 2012  
by the appointment of Kevin Tomlinson. In this respect, 
the Company accordingly remains compliant with the 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code  
to the extent that it dictates the Board should have  
a greater number of non-executive directors than 
executive directors.
Board committees
Our committees are a valuable part of Centamin’s 
corporate governance structure. The workload of the 
committees is far greater than the table of scheduled 
meetings would indicate, as ad hoc meetings and 
communications between meetings frequently require 
considerable amounts of time. 
I believe strongly that the blend of behaviours and  
skills around the Centamin Board table are well suited  
to the task and consistent with the Company’s values, 
and I am keen for a formal system to reconﬁrm this.  
With a Board that is free to openly express concerns 
comes more considered outcomes emphasising 
collective responsibility, transparency, clarity and 
sustainable conduct.
Shareholder communication
I would like to encourage all shareholders to ﬁnd the time 
to attend our AGM on 23 May 2012, which this year will 
be held in Jersey. This will be an excellent opportunity 
to meet the Board, the Executive Board and members 
of our Senior Management team. An opportunity will 
also be afforded to those shareholders who are unable 
to attend the AGM to receive a presentation from senior 
management in London on 16 May 2013.

Chairman
 
Corporate Governance Statement  63
THE BOARD – COMPOSITION AND BALANCE
The Board currently comprises the Chairman and CEO, ﬁve non-executive and one other executive director.  
One of the non-executive directors has been appointed Senior Independent Director. All the non-executive directors  
are considered by the Board to be independent and biographies of all the directors appear on pages 54 and 55, 
together with descriptions of their expertise, experience and qualiﬁcations and a note of their other signiﬁcant 
commitments. Membership of the Board’s Committees is set out in this section. The Board is satisﬁed that this  
range of expertise, experience and qualiﬁcations is appropriate for the current needs of the business.
The names of the Directors of the Company in ofﬁce at the date of this Report are:

Non-Executive directors have the right to seek independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties  
as directors, at the Group’s expense. Written approval must be obtained from the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer prior  
to incurring an expense on behalf of the Group.
When determining whether a Director is independent, the Board has established a Directors’ Test of Independence 
Policy, which is based predominantly on the deﬁnition of independence as deﬁned in Canadian Securities 
Administrators’ National Instrument 52-110 – Audit Committees (“NI 52-110”), and is available on the Company’s 
website or to shareholders upon request. The criteria in NI 52-110 are mandatory and are more stringent in certain 
respects than the independence criteria suggested by the Code. Based on this Policy, the majority of the Board are 
considered by the Board to be independent Non-Executive directors.
The Company has considered certain recommendations put forward in the UK in respect of gender diversity on the 
boards of listed companies but has not adopted a formal policy in this regard. The matter is however kept under 
constant review.

Corporate Governance Statement
HOW THE BOARD OPERATES
The Board of Directors supervises the management of 
the business and affairs of the Company. The Board 
of Directors assumes responsibility for the stewardship 
of the Group, and the functions the Company has 
established that are reserved to the Board include:
 Strategic Planning: The Board of Directors regularly 
reviews and approves strategic plans and initiatives 
of the Company at Board of Directors meetings, and 
otherwise as required.
 Risk Assessment: The Board of Directors has  
primary responsibility to identify principal risks  
in the Company’s business and ensures the 
implementation of appropriate systems to manage 
these risks. See “Managing Risks” below.
 Succession Planning: The Board of Directors is 
responsible for succession planning, including the 
appointment, training and monitoring of senior 
management.
 Communications: The Board of Directors oversees the 
Company’s public communications with shareholders 
and others interested in the Company.
 Internal Control: The Board of Directors and the  
audit committee of the Board of Directors oversee  
the Group’s internal control and management 
information systems.
In addition to its general oversight responsibilities, 
signiﬁcant transactions out of the ordinary course of the 
Company’s business or which may be material to the 
Company are considered and approved by the Board of 
Directors. The Board of Directors generally has at least 
4 regularly scheduled meetings in each year. Additional 
meetings may be held depending upon opportunities or 
issues to be dealt with by the Company from time to time.
A full copy of the Company’s Board Charter is available 
on the Company’s website or upon request. 
The following table sets out the number of Directors’ 
meetings (including meetings of the Board) held during 
the year and the number of meetings attended by 
each Director (while they were a Director or committee 
member). During the year ended 31 December 2012, 
20 Board meetings (of which 4 were scheduled and 
16 were convened at short notice to deal with emerging 
developments in Egypt), 2 Nomination Committee 
meetings, 3 Remuneration Committee meetings, 
6 Compliance/Corporate Governance Committee 
meetings, 3 HSES Committee meetings and 6 Audit 
Committee meetings were held.

In addition, Josef El-Raghy, whilst not a member of the Board Committees referred above, is by invitation typically 
in attendance at committee meetings save for those where his remuneration is being discussed.
Meetings of Independent Directors 
Mr G. Edward Haslam was appointed Senior Independent Director of Centamin Egypt Limited on 22 March 2011  
and has retained this position with the Company. He has regular meetings with the other Non-Executive Directors and, 
in connection with the evaluation of the Board’s performance referred to below, undertook a performance evaluation  
of the Chairman, taking into account the views of the other executive director and the Company Secretary. 65
Allocation of responsibilities 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 
are strictly separated as deﬁned in the Group’s Board 
Charter and their individual employment contracts. 
However, as discussed elsewhere in this section, 
following the sudden passing away of Harry Michael in 
November 2011, the Group’s former CEO, Josef El-
Raghy has undertaken the role of CEO. Notwithstanding 
this combining of roles, and with a view to ensuring 
that there is not undue concentration of authority in the 
hands of one individual, the Board has agreed that for so 
long as the roles remained combined, certain corporate 
governance functions undertaken by Josef El-Raghy in 
his capacity as Chairman will be delegated to the Senior 
Independent Director. These functions include chairing 
the board meetings, ensuring that the Board receives 
timely information and ensuring the efﬁcient organization 
and conduct of the Board’s functioning.
BOARD COMMITTEES
As indicated by the table above, the Board has 
established Audit and Risk, Compliance/Corporate 
Governance, Nomination, Remuneration and the Health 
Safety Environmental and Sustainability (“HSES”) 
committees. Copies of the current Board and Committee 
Charters and Policies are available on the Group’s 
website www.centamin.com. 
Audit and Risk Committee
As at the date of this report, the Audit Committee 
comprises Mr Mark Arnesen (Chairman), Mr Mark 
Bankes and Mr G. Edward Haslam, all of whom are 
considered by the Board to be independent within the 
terms of Group’s Directors’ Test of Independence Policy. 
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee are laid 
out in its charter, and amongst other things, include 
the responsibility to ensure that an effective internal 
control framework exists within the entity, and to review 
quarterly, half yearly and annual Financial Statements 
for submission to the Board for approval. The Committee 
receives regular reports from management. This includes 
the safeguarding of assets, the maintenance of proper 
accounting records, the need for an internal audit 
function and the reliability of ﬁnancial information as well 
as non-ﬁnancial considerations. The Audit Committee 
will also recommend the appointment, and will review the 
fees, of external auditors. 
The Code states that the Board should satisfy itself 
that at least one member of the Audit Committee has 
recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. Furthermore, 
all members of the Audit Committee are expected to 
be ﬁnancially literate as per the deﬁnition of ﬁnancial 
literacy contained in section 1.5 of the Canadian 
National Instrument 52-110. For the purposes of that 
instrument, an individual is ﬁnancially literate if he or 
she has the ability to read and understand a set of 
Financial Statements that present a breadth and level 
of complexity of accounting issues that are generally 
comparable to the breadth and complexity of the issues 
that can reasonably be expected to be raised by the 
Group’s Financial Statements. Both these conditions 
were satisﬁed during the relevant period.
During the year the Committee particularly focused  
on the following areas: 
 consideration and approval of the audit plan; 
 consideration and approval of the scope of external 
audit and related processes;
 consideration and review of the full-year and  
interim results;
 consideration of announcements to the London Stock 
Exchange by the Group on its performance; and
 accounting implications for the Group of the ongoing 
litigation, described elsewhere in this report.
External auditor
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on 
external audit. The policy assigns oversight responsibility 
for monitoring the independence, objectivity and 
compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements 
to the Audit Committee, and day to day responsibility 
to the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. It states that the external 
auditor is jointly responsible to the board and the Audit 
Committee and that the Audit Committee is the primary 
contact. The policy also sets out the categories of 
non-audit services which the external auditor will and 
will not be allowed to provide to the Group, including 
those that are pre-approved by the Audit Committee and 
those which require speciﬁc approval before they are 
contracted for, subject to de minimis levels.
To fulﬁl its responsibility regarding the independence of 
the external auditor, the Audit Committee reviewed:
 the external auditor’s plan for the current year, noting 
the role of the senior statutory audit partner, who 
signs the audit report and who, in accordance with 
professional rules, has not held ofﬁce for more than 
ﬁve years, and any changes in the key audit staff;
 the arrangements for day-to-day management of the 
audit relationship;
 a report identifying the number of former external 
audit staff now employed by the Group and their 
positions within the Group; 66 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Corporate Governance Statement
 a report from the external auditor describing their 
arrangements to identify, report and manage any 
conﬂicts of interest; and
 the overall extent of non-audit services provided by 
the external auditor, in addition to its case-by-case 
approval of the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor. 
A policy has been approved by the Audit Committee 
in relation to the provision of non-audit services by the 
auditors. Essentially the policy states that the auditor 
may not provide certain deﬁned services that are 
considered to be inconsistent with the role of the auditor. 
For other services, an authorisation procedure  
is in place. Any signiﬁcant work must be authorised  
by the Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
During 2012 the auditor provided both limited 
tax advisory and other services in relation to the 
establishment of a Deferred Bonus Share Plan and 
related matters. In the prior ﬁnancial period, other 
non-audit services included the provision of advice and 
undertaking due diligence investigations in relation to the 
main board listing on the London Stock Exchange.
To the extent necessary, the auditor obtained 
pre-approval from the Audit Committee before 
performing these services and have used separate 
teams for the tax advisory services and other related 
services, than the team performing the audit. There were 
no contingent fee arrangements in place during 2012, 
2011 and 2010.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditor, the 
Audit Committee reviewed:
 the arrangements for ensuring the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity;
 the external auditor’s fulﬁlment of the agreed audit 
plan and any variations from the plan; and
 the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditor  
in their handling of the key accounting and  
audit judgements.
The auditors of the Group, Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”), 
have open access to the Board of Directors at all times. 
Deloitte have audited the Group and its subsidiaries 
for a number of years and have adopted a policy of 
rotating audit partners every ﬁve years. The last rotation 
of the audit partner occurred as a consequence of the 
re-domicile on the 30 December 2011 and took effect 
on 29 December 2011.
It is the Group’s policy to put the Group’s audit out to 
tender at least every ﬁve (5) years.
Following the above, the Audit Committee has 
recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP is 
re-appointed.
Internal Audit
In light of the size and relative complexity of the Group,  
no internal audit function has to date been established, but 
it is the intention of the Group, following a recommendation 
of the Audit Committee, to do so as the Stage 4 project 
draws nearer to completion.
A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on 
the Company’s website or to shareholders upon request.
Overview
As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee 
has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its 
terms of reference and has ensured the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor. The Chairman of  
the Audit Committee will be available at the Annual 
General Meeting to answer any questions about the  
work of the committee.
Compliance/Corporate Governance Committee
The Compliance/Corporate Governance Committee is 
chaired by Mr Mark Bankes and its other members are 
Mr G. Edward Haslam and Professor Robert Bowker. 
The Committee assists the Board in fulﬁlling its ﬁduciary 
responsibilities by making recommendations to the 
Board with respect to the formulation or re-formulation  
of and implementation, maintenance and monitoring 
of the Company’s Corporate Compliance Program and 
Code of Conduct as may be modiﬁed, supplemented 
or replaced from time to time, designed to ensure 
compliance with corporate governance policies and legal 
rules and regulations. Fundamental to the Company’s 
corporate governance policy and practice is that all 
Directors and employees reﬂect the Company’s key 
values of accountability, fairness, integrity and openness. 
The Committee oversees the Company’s activities  
in the area of corporate compliance that may impact the 
Company’s business operations or public image, in light 
of applicable government and industry standards, legal 
and business trends and public policy issues. 67

Corporate Governance Statement
Managing risks
The Board meets regularly to evaluate, control, review 
and implement the Group’s operations and objectives.
Regular controls established by the Board include:
 timely and detailed monthly ﬁnancial and operational 
reporting;
 implementation of operating plans, cash ﬂows and 
budgets by management and Board monitoring of 
progress against projections; and
 procedures to allow Directors, and management in 
the furtherance of their duties, to seek independent 
professional advice via the utilisation of various 
external technical consultants.
Attention is also drawn to the text appearing in the 
section above headed “Principal Risks Affecting the 
Centamin Group” relating to the monitoring of risks, 
which is incorporated into this section by reference.
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving 
the Group’s risk management strategy, policy and key 
risk parameters, including determining the Group’s 
appetite for country risk and major investment decisions. 
Management reports to the Board on the Group’s key 
risks and the extent to which it believes these risks are 
being managed. This is performed periodically. The Board 
is also responsible for satisfying itself that management 
has developed and implemented a sound system of 
risk management and internal control. The Board has 
delegated oversight of the Risk Management Policy, 
including review of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control framework and risk management process, to the 
Audit Committee, which is reviewed at least annually. 
Management is responsible for designing, implementing, 
reviewing and providing assurance as to the effectiveness 
of the Policy. This responsibility includes developing 
business and functional risk identiﬁcation, speciﬁc risk 
treatment, controls, monitoring and reporting capability. 
The Board regularly discusses risks associated with the 
Group’s business and operations along with the Group’s 
risk tolerance. The Group has developed a series of 
operational risks which the Group believes to be inherent 
to the Group. These operational risks are summarized in 
the Management, Discussion and Analysis section of this 
annual report. Mitigation and optimization strategies are 
considered equally important in risk management. 
The Risk Management Policy is available on the 
Company’s website or upon request. 
Monitoring of the Board’s performance 
In order to ensure that the Board continues to discharge its 
responsibilities in an appropriate manner, the performance 
of all Directors is constantly reviewed by the Chairman. 
The Company deployed a formal process for evaluation of 
the Board, the Board members, and Board committees 
during the relevant period. A formal Board evaluation 
questionnaire was delivered to each member of the Board 
for completion. The questionnaire covered questions on 
the structure of the Board, the selection of management, 
strategy determination, etc, as well questions on each 
Director’s personal contribution to the board and the 
Company’s Committees. 
The Company has engaged a third party facilitator to 
undertake an external Board Evaluation during the 
second quarter of the 2013.
Under the Company’s current Articles of Association:
 the minimum number of Directors is two and there is 
no maximum; 
 a Director may not retain ofﬁce for more than one 
year without submitting for re-election; and
 any Director appointed by the Board must have their 
election conﬁrmed by shareholders at the next AGM.
Where a Non-Executive Director has served six years or 
longer on the Board, his or her re-election will be subject 
to particularly rigorous review and will take into account 
the need for progressive refreshing of the Board. 
The Company has established a Remuneration Policy 
which sets out the structure of the remuneration of key 
senior executives, Executive Directors, Non-Executive 
Directors, termination, disclosure of remuneration etc. 
The Board has also established a Selection, Appointment 
and Re-Appointment of Directors Policy which details the 
procedures for the selection, appointment, re-appointment 
and evaluation of the Company’s Directors. The Committee 
considers both policies before making recommendations 
to the Board on nomination and remuneration matters. 
Both Policies, along with the Charters of the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees are available on the 
Company’s website or to shareholders upon request.
All compensation arrangements for Directors and senior 
executives are determined (or in the case of senior 
executives, reviewed) by the Remuneration Committee 
and approved by the Board, after taking into account the 
current competitive arrangements prevailing in the market.  69
The amount of remuneration for all Directors including 
the full remuneration packages, comprising all 
monetary and non-monetary components of the 
Executive Directors and executives, are detailed in the 
Remuneration Report. Non-Executive Directors receive 
annual fees within an aggregate Directors’ fee pool 
limited to an amount which is approved by shareholders. 
The Board Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
reviews and recommends, for Board approval, 
remuneration levels and policies for Directors within this 
overall Directors’ fee pool. The fees which are paid are 
also periodically reviewed. The current annual fee for 
Non-Executive Directors is a base fee of US$79,235 p.a. 
(£50,000 p.a.). Due to the additional time required, the 
Chairmen of the Board’s various Committees receive an 
additional fee (currently US$15,847 p.a. (£10,000 p.a.)) 
for Chairing that Committee, and the members of each 
committee also receive an additional fee (currently 
US$7,923 p.a. (£5,000 p.a.)) for being a Committee 
member. For the period to 28 February 2013, 
Senior Independent Director received an additional 
US$15,847 p.a. (£10,000 p.a.). From 1 March 2013  
the fees payable to the Senior Independent Director were 
restructured such that he receives an amount equal 
to US$198,088 p.a. (£125,000 p.a.) in aggregate for 
this position, being a member of the Board Committees 
and for chairing the Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees.  For the avoidance of doubt, all amounts 
referred to in this paragraph include any statutory 
superannuation payments where applicable. It is 
proposed to review the fees payable to Non-Executive 
Directors in Q2 2013. 
As a matter of practice, and in line with the Group’s 
approach to ﬁnancial and risk management, the senior 
executives are responsible for:
 developing corporate strategy, performance 
objectives, business plans, budgets etc for review and 
approval by the Board;
 managing the day to day business of the Company;
 managing the risk and compliance frameworks 
including reporting to the Board and, where 
necessary, the market;
 appointing staff, evaluating their performance and 
training requirements as well as development of 
Company policies; and
 ensuring all available information in connection with 
items to be discussed at a meeting of the Board is 
provided to each Director prior to the meeting.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is responsible for ensuring 
senior executives properly discharge the responsibilities 
delegated to them and for keeping the Board informed 
on these matters.
The performance of senior executives is evaluated by 
the Remuneration Committee, often taking into account 
recommendations from the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and/
or Chairman. The Board can exercise its discretion in 
relation to approving incentives, bonuses and options 
and can recommend changes to the Committee’s 
recommendations. All executives receive base salary 
and superannuation (if applicable) and in some cases, 
performance incentives and fringe beneﬁts.  
These packages are reviewed on an annual basis.  
All remuneration paid to executives is valued at the cost 
to the Company and is measured in accordance with the 
applicable accounting standards. 
The performance of our senior executives was evaluated 
in the current year by the Remuneration Committee.  
The Committee reviewed recommendations received 
from the Chairman, considered the performance of the 
senior executive, his/her current contract, and whether 
a bonus and/or the grant of employee options were 
warranted. In the previous ﬁnancial year, the Board 
believed it to be appropriate to base performance on 
how well the executive performs his/her role, and not 
necessarily base it on the Company meeting ﬁnancial 
objectives. The Company has now established a 
structured short term incentive scheme, details of which 
can be found in the Remuneration Report contained 
within this Annual Report. 
Historically, the Directors, executives and employees have 
in the past been invited to participate in the shareholder 
approved Centamin Egypt’s 2006 Employee Option Plan, 
and separate shareholder approval was sought before any 
Director could be issued options under the plan. However, 
Centamin Egypt ceased issuing options under the 2006 
Employee Option Plan in August 2009 and received 
approval from shareholders in February 2011 to establish 
the Executive Director Loan Funded Share Plan 2011 and 
the Employee Loan Funded Share Plan 2011. These two 
plans were rolled over into equivalent plans in Centamin 
PLC as part of the re-domicile that took place in December 
2011, referred to elsewhere in this report. In addition, 
a new employee option plan was created (the “2011 
Employee Option Plan”).
Options have been issued under these new plans to 
senior employees as set out on page 134. 
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to hold shares 
in the Company to align their interests more closely to  70 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Corporate Governance Statement
those of the Company’s shareholders. However, share 
ownership is not enforced by the Company. 
The Board expects that the remuneration structure that 
is implemented will result in the Company being able 
to attract and retain the best executives to manage 
the Group. It will also provide the Executives with the 
necessary incentives to grow long-term shareholder 
value. Please refer to the Remuneration Report which 
forms part of the Directors’ Report for information  
on remuneration paid to Directors and executives  
during the ﬁnancial year.
There are no schemes for retirement beneﬁts other than 
statutory superannuation for Non-Executive Directors.
Securities Trading Policy
The Company has adopted a formal Securities Trading 
Policy restricting Directors, senior executives and 
employees from acting on material information until it 
has been released to the market in accordance with the 
requirements of continuous disclosure. Directors and 
senior management of premium listed companies on 
the LSE are restricted in a number of ways, by statute, 
common law and by the Model Code to deal in the 
Company’s securities. This rule imposes restrictions 
beyond those imposed by law in that the Directors and 
certain employees and persons connected with them do 
not abuse and do not place themselves under suspicion 
of abusing price-sensitive information that they have or 
are thought to have, especially in periods leading up to 
announcement of results (close periods). The Company’s 
Securities Trading Policy is available on the Company’s 
website or to shareholders upon request. 
Commitment to stakeholders and ethical 
standards
The Board supports the highest standards of corporate 
governance and requires its members and the 
management and staff of the Company to act with 
integrity and objectivity in relation to:
 Compliance with laws and regulations affecting the 
Group’s operations;
 Listing rules, the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
and NP 58-201;
 Employment practices;
 Responsibilities to the community;
 Responsibilities to the individual;
 The environment;
 Conﬂict of interests;
 Conﬁdentiality;
 Ensuring that shareholders and the ﬁnancial 
community are at all times fully informed in 
accordance with the spirit and letter of the Model 
Code and the Canadian Securities Administrators’ 
National Instrument 51-102;
 Corporate opportunities or opportunities arising from 
these for personal gain or to compete with the Group;
 Protection of and proper use of the Group’s assets; and
 Active promotion of ethical behaviour.
The Company has a formal Code of Conduct, which all 
Directors, employees and contractors are required to 
observe, and a range of corporate policies which detail  
the framework for acceptable corporate behaviour.  
These set out the procedures that personnel are required 
to follow in a range of areas, including compliance with  
the law, dealing with conﬂicts of interest, use of knowledge 
and information, gifts and entertainment, responsibility  
to shareholders and the ﬁnancial community etc.  
The Company’s policies are reviewed periodically. 
A copy of the Code of Conduct is available on the 
Company’s website or to shareholders upon request. 
Communication to shareholders
The Board of Directors aims to ensure that shareholders 
are provided with important information in a timely 
manner through written and electronic communications. 
It is for this reason that the Company established  
a Shareholder Communications Policy.
The Board of Directors aims to ensure that the 
shareholders, on behalf of whom they act, are informed 
of all information necessary to assess the performance 
of the Company. Information is communicated to the 
shareholders through:
 the Annual Report;
 the Annual Information Form;
 the availability of the Company’s Quarterly Report, 
Half-Yearly Report and other announcements 
distributed to shareholders so requesting;
 adherence to continuous disclosure requirements;
 webcasts of the Company’s quarterly results;
 the Annual General Meeting and other meetings 
called to obtain shareholder approval for Board action 
as appropriate; and
 the provision of the Company’s website containing 
all of the above mentioned reports and its constant 
update and maintenance. 71
The Chairman and CEO and other Directors, 
communicate with major shareholders on a regular 
basis in the way of face to face contact, telephone 
conversations, and analyst and broker brieﬁngs,  
to help better understand the views of the shareholders. 
Any material feedback is then discussed at Board level.
The Board recognises the importance of keeping  
the market fully informed of the Group’s activities and  
of communicating openly and clearly with all 
stakeholders. The Company established a formal 
Continuous Disclosure Policy to ensure that this occurs. 
The Policy is designed to ensure compliance with the 
listing rules in all jurisdictions in which the Company is 
listed. A copy of this Policy is available on the Company’s 
website or by request. 
In accordance with the Policy, Company information 
considered to be material and which requires 
announcement is announced immediately to the LSE  
and TSX. All key communications are placed immediately 
on the Company website, and when necessary, provided 
directly to shareholders. As a premium listed company 
on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, 
the Company also complies with the various obligations 
imposed on it pursuant to the Disclosure Rules and the 
Transparency Rules (“DTRs”).
Statement by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer
The Board receives written assurance from the Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer to conﬁrm 
that to the best of their knowledge and belief, the Group’s 
ﬁnancial position presents a true and fair view and that 
the Financial Statements are founded on a sound system 
of risk management, internal compliance and control. 
Further, it is conﬁrmed that the Group’s risk management 
and internal compliance is operating efﬁciently and 
effectively. The Board notes that due to its nature, internal 
control assurance from the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer can only be reasonable rather than 
absolute, and therefore is not and cannot be designed to 
detect all weaknesses in control procedures.
Market purchase of shares
The Company was authorised by shareholders, at the 
2012 AGM, to purchase in the market up to 55,069,869; 
ordinary shares in the share capital, as permitted under 
the Company’s Articles. No shares have been bought 
back under this authority. This standard authority is 
renewable annually and the directors will seek to have it 
renewed at the forthcoming AGM.  72 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Remuneration Report
The following section of this remuneration report  
has not been audited by Deloitte LLP. 
Introduction from Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee
During the Financial Year ended 31 December 2012 the 
Remuneration Committee comprised three independent 
non-executive Directors and myself as Chairman. The 
Committee met three times during the year and was 
supported by the Company Secretary who also acts as 
secretary to the Committee.
Mindful of the feedback from some institutional 
shareholders the Committee undertook a review of 
all aspects of the executives’ remuneration and in 
particular the introduction of safety targets which if not 
achieved would reduce any bonus otherwise payable 
by a proportionate amount. In conducting this review 
the Committee was conscious not only of the need to 
balance the return to shareholders with the need to 
motivate and retain the executive team but also of the 
need to create a remuneration structure that would:
 Lock in the key individuals
 Reduce the overall remuneration potential for the 
Chairman and other directors 
 Enhance the link between individual and  
corporate performance
 Be simpler to operate 
 Address certain governance issues relating  
to notice periods
The work the Committee has undertaken to take account 
of the above has been to:
 Change the annual bonus arrangements
 Agree a new service agreement with the Chairman
 Establish new long-term incentive arrangements 
under which the executive directors are no longer 
able to participate
In addition, base salaries have been adjusted to be  
in line with those of similar sized mining companies 
and we have introduced both short and long term 
incentive plans for senior management with deﬁned key 
performance indicators. These changes are described  
in more detail below.
In considering levels of remuneration, the Committee 
took into account the performance of the Company, 
which saw an improvement in all the major  
operational indicators.
 Gold production: up 5.2% on expectations
 Cost of production: US$30 lower per ounce  
than targeted
 Revenue: 25% increased to US$426million  
from US$340million in 2011
 An increase in proﬁt since 2011
 Improved health and safety performance
The executive directors have been very supportive 
of these initiatives, including in particular the 
Chairman Josef El-Raghy, who with no corresponding 
compensation, voluntarily agreed to sacriﬁce his 2011 
share award over 1 million shares as well as to the 
acceptance of substantial changes to his employment 
conditions, including the removal of a 24 month notice 
period which had been applicable in the event of  
a change of control.
Finally, the Committee again discussed the combining 
of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive under 
one person. Whilst recognizing that this does not 
conform to best practice, the Committee concluded, 
nevertheless, that the current arrangement remained 
in the shareholders’ best interests but agreed that as 
Senior Independent Director I would, as detailed in the 
Chairman’s Statement on page 14, take on additional 
responsibilities that will include the chairmanship of the 
Company’s meetings. 
G. Edward Haslam
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 73
Remuneration Governance
The Committee
As mentioned above, the Committee currently comprises 
four non-executive directors all of whom are regarded as 
wholly independent. 
No member of the Committee has any ﬁnancial interest, 
other than as shareholder, in the matters decided by 
the Committee. None of the members of the Committee 
participate in any bonus scheme, long term incentive, 
pension or other form of remuneration other than the fees 
disclosed below (other than statutory superannuation 
for the Australian resident directors). There is no actual 
or potential conﬂict of interest arising from the other 
directorships held by members of the Committee.
The members of the Committee, joining dates and 
number of meetings attended during the year are shown 
in the table below. The Company Secretary acts as 
secretary to the Committee.

Terms of Reference
The responsibilities of the Committee include:
 Framework of remuneration for the company and in 
particular the executive team
 Remuneration of executive directors 
 Long term incentives
Advisers
During the year the Committee was supported by the 
Company Secretary. Centamin commissioned research 
papers from Meis on executive remuneration levels and 
share scheme practice, which were made available to 
the Committee. Meis was subsequently appointed as 
adviser to the Committee. Advice was also received from 
the Company’s legal counsel, Norton Rose in London 
and Canada in respect of the deferred bonus plan and 
service agreements. Other than advice on executive 
remuneration Meis provides no other services to the 
Company. Norton Rose provides on going legal advice to 
the Company.
The Chairman attends meetings of the Committee to 
make recommendations relating to the performance and 
remuneration of his direct reports. The Chairman and the 
Company Secretary are not in attendance at meetings 
when their own remuneration is under consideration.
Matters Considered by the Committee
The Committee considered the following items during  
the year:
 Review of executive director remuneration 
 The proposed structure of the share scheme 
arrangements for employees and the executive team 
 The introduction of the new deferred bonus plan and 
the grant of awards under the plan 
 New service agreement for the Chairman
 The provision of advice to the Committee
 The annual bonus plan for 2012
 The annual bonus plan for 2013
Remuneration policy for 2012 and 2013
Introduction
In developing its remuneration policy the Committee has 
had regard to the fact that the business of the Company  
is operated outside the UK and in a market which requires 
very particular operational and managerial skills.  
The remuneration policy therefore seeks to:
 Position remuneration packages to ensure that they 
remain competitive, taking account of all elements  
of remuneration and reﬂective of the performance  
of the Company
 Use external benchmark data on a transparent and 
open basis using comparator groups that reﬂect the 
industry and size of the Company
 Provide incentive arrangements for relevant 
employees that are based upon pre agreed 
performance criteria that individuals will then be 
tested against.  Such incentives should be relevant 
and stretching. A “balanced score card” approach  
to annual bonuses will generally be adopted
 Provide long term incentives that encourage the 
involvement, in the long term, of the performance of 
the Company. Performance criteria should be relevant 
and capable of being inﬂuenced. Executive directors 
will, from 2012, no longer be offered participation in 
any long term incentive arrangements 
 Encourage executives, and in particular executive 
directors, to build and then maintain a meaningful 
shareholding in the Company 74 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Remuneration Summary for Executive Directors
ELEMENT OBJECTIVE DETAILS
Base pay Base pay to be set competitively 
so as to allow the motivation and 
retention of executives
Normally reviewed in the ﬁrst quarter  
of year with changes effective as  
of 1st January.
Salaries are benchmarked against 
a number of comparator groups as 
described below to provide a balanced 
approach.
Pension Positioned to ensure competitive 
packages. 
The Chairman receives a cash payment in 
lieu of a pension equivalent to 20% of his 
base salary. A 20% contribution rate is 
the market median for the FTSE 250.
Beneﬁts There are no beneﬁts
Annual Bonus To provide a reward for short term 
performance
Performance criteria set at the beginning 
of the year based upon a balanced 
score card approach. For the Chairman 
a maximum annual bonus opportunity is 
175% and for other executive director, 
whose performance criteria are strongly 
linked to the completion of Stage 4, a 
multi-year project , no annual bonus 
opportunity has been ﬁxed.
Share Ownership Requirement To encourage ownership of shares 
and thereby create a link of interest 
between shareholder and executive
Although the Company has no formal 
policy, executive directors are encouraged 
over time, to acquire shares of a value of 
not less than 100% of their base salary. 
This is consistent with the market practice 
for the FTSE 250. Executive directors 
already exceed this requirement.
Long Term Incentive To link an executives interest to the 
longer term share performance
The current intention is to make no 
further awards under the loan funded 
schemes. For management, but not 
directors, the Company has introduced 
a deferred bonus scheme as part of the 
annual bonus. The Company can require 
up to 100% of a bonus to be deferred into 
shares. Such shares will then be released 
as to a third at the end of each of 12, 24 
and 36 month period. For the executive 
directors the Committee is of the view, 
following the review, that the existing 
shareholdings of the directors already 
create sufﬁcient union of interest between 
executives and shareholders.
Remuneration Report 75
Balance of Remuneration
The balance of remuneration for 2013 is shown in the graph below and is based upon maximum pay-out for Josef 
El-Raghy. The graph does not however show the bonus opportunity for Trevor Schultz, which has not yet been ﬁxed. 
Please refer to the text under the heading “2012 Bonus” below for more detail.
Josef El-Raghy max
Base Pension Annual Variable
0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%
Relationship between pay and performance
It is important that executive pay is grounded in the good performance of the Company. While the operational 
performance of the Company over 2012 (a summary of which is set out in the “Performance Highlights” section above) 
has been impressive, the pre-tax proﬁt growth and share price performance over the longer term were also taken into 
account by the Committee. Total shareholder return performance against the FTSE 250 and the FTSE 350 Mining 
indices, which are regarded as being appropriate comparator groups for the Company are shown in the graph below.

Remuneration Paid 
Remuneration History for Josef El-Raghy
The remuneration packages of the executive directors, and in particular Josef El-Raghy, have been restructured  
so as to reduce the overall remuneration opportunity. The following table shows the remuneration history and future 
potential for Josef El-Raghy. The table shows both the maximum opportunity under the remuneration package and the

Remuneration Report 77
Base salaries 
Base salaries are usually reviewed in the ﬁrst quarter 
of each year. However, as part of the remuneration 
review that was undertaken in the middle of 2012, 
Josef El-Raghy’s remuneration was considered against 
companies of similar complexity and size (bespoke 
group) and, as was noted in last year’s remuneration 
report, his remuneration was shown to be materially 
below the median. Consideration was also given to  
the remuneration information obtained from four 
additional groups of comparable companies in order  
to gain a balanced view of the market data. The groups 
are the FTSE 250, the Mining Sector, companies with  
a similar market capitalisation, and ﬁnally companies 
with a similar turnover. As a result of this exercise,  
Josef El-Raghy base salary was increased with effect 
from July 2012 to bring him into line with the median  
of the data and allow the restructuring of his 
remuneration package.
In deciding to increase the base pay of Josef El-Raghy 
his position against the market data was only one of the 
factors taken into account.  The following factors were 
also taken into account:
 When appointed in 2010 he was given an increase 
which did not take his base pay to the median position 
for his new position. In the subsequent year his base 
pay was frozen and without an increase in 2012 his 
base pay would fall further behind the market.
 The removal of long term incentives substantially 
reduce the overall value of his package and therefore 
it was appropriate to position the base pay at no lower 
than the median.
 A desire to maintain a consistency across the 
business of the Company by paying a market rate  
at about the median.
The base of Trevor Schultz was A$ 550,000 (£351,000) 
in 2012.
Approach to Annual Bonuses
The bonus plan for the executive directors is based upon 
a balanced score card approach designed to encourage 
and reward the delivery of operational performance.  
The bonus is split 70% business and 30% individual 
targets. In particular:
 The business targets are based on ﬁnancial, 
operational, strategic measures and speciﬁc business 
tasks. These targets therefore capture both the 
normal ﬁnancial targets as well as operational targets 
such as health and safety, production targets and 
efﬁciency, new exploration and M&A opportunities 
and business diversity. 
 The individual targets reﬂect the delivery of individual 
task as well as leadership and management.
Furthermore in assessing the bonus to be paid to Josef 
El-Raghy, the Committee took into consideration the fact 
that his overall remuneration opportunity was reduced 
in the course of 2012 by the voluntary forfeiture, without 
payment, of shares awarded to him under the Director 
Loan Funded Share Plan 2011.
2012 Bonus 
The Committee during the year reviewed the annual 
bonus scheme and the bonus scheme that operated for 
substantially all of 2012 which was based upon the same 
balanced score card approach as above. On this basis the 
Committee determined that 80% of the maximum bonus 
of 175% of Josef El-Raghy’s 2012 base salary had been 
achieved by Josef El-Raghy. This reﬂects the operational 
performance of the Company with many of the targets 
being met or exceeded. No bonus was awarded to Trevor 
Schultz as his remuneration structure is strongly linked to 
the stage 4 expansion project and whilst good progress 
was made it was decided that only upon satisfactory 
completion of stage 4 will any bonus become payable. 
The sum of A$750,000 (US$777,847) has been provided 
for as at 31 December 2012 representing that amount of 
the bonus which may become payable to Trevor Schultz 
upon satisfactory completion of the Stage 4 project.
2013
The bonus for 2013 will be based upon the balanced 
score card approach above. 78 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Pension Arrangements and Beneﬁts in Kind
Josef El-Raghy is entitled to a payment in respect  
of pension entitlement equal to 20% base pay.  
Trevor Schultz has no such entitlement. Other than 
statutory superannuation for Australian resident 
directors, Professor Robert Bowker and Mr. Mark 
Arnesen and the payments in lieu of pension above,  
no pensions or payments in lieu of pensions are made. 
No beneﬁts in kind are provided to any director.
Service Agreements for Executive Directors
During the year, and as part of the review, Josef El-Raghy 
voluntarily agreed to the early cancellation of his service 
agreement, without compensation, and agreed to enter 
into a new service agreement. The new contract, dated 
24 September 2012, provides for 12 months’ notice by 
either party to terminate the contract and does not provide 
for an enhanced notice period in the case of a change  
of control. However, in the case of notice given in 
connection with and shortly following a change of control, 
Josef El-Raghy will be entitled to payment in lieu of an 
amount equal to 12 month’s basic salary together with  
any bonus that, in the opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee, would have been due to him in the 12 month 
period following the giving of the notice.
The service agreement for Trevor Schultz dated  
15 August 2008 provides for six months’ notice from  
the company and three months from Trevor Schultz  
to terminate the agreement.
Shareholding Requirement
While the Board has not adopted a formal shareholding 
requirement for executive directors it is keeping this matter 
under review and further monitors the actual shareholding 
to ensure that the actual holding is equal to or exceeds 
the current market practice for the FTSE 250, which is 
typically that such number of shares should be held the 
aggregate market value of which on the date of purchase 
is greater than 100% of the annual base salary.  
Both Josef El-Raghy’s and Trevor Schultz’s shareholdings 
signiﬁcantly exceed this amount.
Non-Executive Directors
Under the Articles of Association adopted by the 
Company all directors are now subject to annual 
re-election. All members of the Board offered 
themselves for either election or re-election at the  
last Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Long Term Incentive Arrangements 
Introduction
Centamin has a number of share schemes intended to 
facilitate employee and executive participation in the 
capital value of the Company. A number of these share 
schemes were developed to take account of Australian 
tax law. With the review this year the Committee felt that 
the existing schemes were too complex and failed to 
provide any meaningful motivation or link to shareholder 
interests. The following table shows a summary of the 
plans and details on their operation.
This year a new, simple deferred bonus share plan has 
been adopted to replace participation in the other plans.

Employee Loan Funded Share Plan 2011
This is the roll-over plan for the Centamin Egypt Ltd 
2011 Employee Loan Funded Share Plan.  Under the 
plan, employees receive a loan to buy shares in the 
Company.  The shares are then held in trust for the 
employee and at the end of three years the employees 
can repay the loan and receive the shares. The loan 
is subject to a maximum repayment period of 3 years.  
Shares under this plan vest in tranches on the ﬁrst, 
second and third year following grant and vesting is 
subject to the satisfaction of applicable performance 
criteria and the performance criteria in respect of senior 
management are based upon share price, ﬁnancial, 
production or key tasks.  Comparator companies, where 
used, are selected by the Remuneration Committee from 
peers in the mining sector.
As indicated above, there is no current intention to make 
further awards under this scheme.
Director Loan Funded Share Plan 2011
This is again a roll-over plan of the Centamin Egypt 2011 
Executive Director Loan Funded Share Plan.  The plan 
operates in exactly the same way as the Employee Plan, 
except that there are mandatory performance conditions 
attached to the Director Plan, and that the shares vest 
in one tranche, three years from the date of grant.  The 
release of award is dependent upon the achievement of 
comparative Total Shareholder Return with 50% based 
upon the FTSE 250 and 50% based upon comparator 
companies.  25% of the award will vest for median 
performance and 100% for upper quartile performance 
under each element.   Comparator companies are selected 
by the Remuneration Committee from peers in the mining 
sector and are as follows: New Gold Inc, Centerra Gold 
Inc; Randgold Resources; Hochschild Mining; Alamos 
Gold Inc; European Goldﬁelds Ltd; Eldorado Gold Corp; 
African Barrick Gold; Petropavlovsk Plc.
As indicated above, there is no current intention to make 
further awards under this scheme.
Employee Share Option Plan
This plan was introduced for UK participants in order to 
provide similar beneﬁts to those which were available to 
participants in the other plans. This plan was established 
as part of the re-domicile given that the provision of loans 
and the holding of shares was not appropriate for UK 
participants. Performance criteria are included in respect 
of senior management based upon share price, ﬁnancial, 
production or key tasks. Comparator companies are 
selected by the Remuneration Committee from peers in 
the mining sector.
Shareholding 
There is no formal shareholding requirement but the 
directors are encouraged to hold a meaningful quantity 
of shares. The following table shows the current 
shareholding of each of the directors. Josef El-Raghy’s 
holding is 6.44%.

Centamin is committed to working with the highest 
level of respect for our employees and the communities 
and environments in which we operate, while pursuing 
value for our shareholders. Sustainable development 
considerations form an integral part of our business 
plan and decision making processes. We expect every 
one of our employees to uphold our core value of 
honesty and integrity as well as maintain a safe work 
place, respect for the environment and respect for 
people. All employees are required to understand and 
act in accordance to the company requirements and 
to integrate fully within the work team. We always treat 
people with respect, dignity and common courtesy 
regardless of position, background or lifestyle. 
As 2010 was the Sukari Gold Mine’s ﬁrst year of 
commercial production, many of our sustainability 
initiatives are in their infancy. However our reporting 
process continues to evolve, as we strive to attain best 
practice levels of transparency and accountability. 
Our Approach
We are mindful of our accountability to our people in 
whom we invest, the community in which we work and 
the environment in which we operate. This approach  
is central to our business philosophy and is the basis  
to our future ﬁnancial growth.
Centamin is committed to minimizing health and safety 
risks to the reasonable practical level, while striving for  
a zero harm and a healthy productive work place.  
To achieve such objectives, we work hard to set a culture 
where safety conscious behaviour is fully embedded 
across all operations. Our key objective is for every 
employee to go home healthy and safe after every 
shift. We strive to improve our safety performance as 
Sukari expands. Our efforts in this area are guided by 
Centamin’s corporate health and safety policy that aims 
to ensure high standards of safety and wellbeing of 
the workforce. The policy outlines our commitment to 
safeguarding our employees, educating our employees 
and contractors and applying safe work systems.
Corporate Social Responsibility Statement
We expect every one of our employees to uphold our 
core value of honesty and integrity  
as well as maintain a safe work place 83
Health and Safety
As a result of the systems and programs implemented  
to enhance safety performance in our workplace and  
a determined effort at all levels, 2012 saw an 
improvement in the lost time due to injury (LTI) 
frequency rate as compared to 2011. We are proud that 
Centamin has never experienced any safety-related 
employee fatalities. 
Creating a Safety Conscious Culture
We relentlessly pursue the development of the safety 
culture of our site through empowering the sense of 
responsibility of our employees and embedding the 
concepts of doing work the right safe way. To ensure that 
employees are fully aware of the safety requirements and 
procedures a comprehensive safety induction system is 
in place for new employees, contractors and visitors.  
The content and level of induction varies according to 
the time the person will spend on-site as well as the 
activities he will undertake.
A training plan is set and safety-speciﬁc training 
is rolled out to all employees. In 2012, training 
modules addressed Job Hazard Analysis, ﬁrst aid, ﬁre 
extinguishing, hazard identiﬁcation, conﬁned space 
entry, hot work, risk assessment, incident investigation, 
work permits, driving policy as well as lifting procedures. 
More comprehensive area-speciﬁc training subjects are 
also provided. Full time trainers were available in almost 
all operational departments to provide in-ﬁeld training 
and coaching for the work force.
Tracking Safety Performance
A core element of our management system is to assess 
our performance and identify needs for improvement. 
Such assessment addresses the level and effectiveness 
of controls, performance enhancement initiatives 
and actions. In 2012 we pursued a multi-functional 
monitoring system to track performance on a periodic 
basis with different frequencies and approaches. 
The Sukari monitoring plan addressed such occupational 
health and safety issues as: 
 Workplace environment to detect zones that need 
further controls or required speciﬁc PPE 
 Stability of structures to detect any potential 
movement, cracks or other instabilities 
 Occupational health parameters for speciﬁc work areas
 Ensuring ﬁtness to work by testing for alcohol  
and drugs
 Implementation of safety procedures and standards 
to ensure they are adhered to and well assimilated 
into the work culture
Monitoring methodology included data collection, 
medical surveillance, auditing, visual inspection,  
as well as systematic observation of the work and 
behaviour of staff. Measurement and evaluation  
of performance were undertaken both in-house  
as well as through third party entities. 
Reactive monitoring was also undertaken to provide 
information on incidents and insights into the need 
for corrective or preventive actions. A comprehensive 
Incident Investigation and Reporting System analysed 
the root causes of incidents was used to address or 
rectify their causes. Employees were required to report 
any incident or near-miss for investigation and analysis. 
All corrective or preventive actions were followed up 
using a tracking system to ensure closure of issues and 
actions. Lessons learnt from incidents were shared and 
discussed in pre-start and safety meetings.

Proactive Approach to Safety
To minimize and control risks, we ﬁrst identiﬁed assessed 
and incorporated risk assessment procedures into all our 
operations and activities. We analysed hazards for their 
probability to actually progress to a loss event, as well  
as the likely consequences of such an event.
New jobs and maintenance operations were preceded 
by a Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) of the activity to 
eliminate or control risks and hazards. A Work Permit 
System was developed for risky operations and speciﬁc 
permits and procedures were applied within the 
system including conﬁned space, hot work and lifting 
operations. Continuous communication was maintained 
with employees through safety meetings, daily pre-shift 
meetings, tool box talks as well as safety alerts. 84 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Emergency Response Planning
Centamin implements a diligent and rigorous approach 
to its Emergency Preparedness and Response program, 
which represents an important element of our safety 
management system. Being alert and fully prepared 
for any emergency will minimize the magnitude and 
consequences for any unprecedented event. 
A detailed emergency plan was in place throughout 
2012 with full emergency response procedures for 
different scenarios. The plan delineates communication 
arrangements and external resources and facilities 
that might provide support to in-house capabilities. 
We maintained a well qualiﬁed emergency response 
and rescue team able to be immediately and efﬁciently 
mobilized. The team is equipped with response 
equipment, supplies and rescue facilities. 
The emergency arrangements include ﬁre rings of 
different hydrants at different areas, ﬁre control panels 
with manual call points and smoke detectors, foam and 
water ﬁre suppression systems as well as a ﬁre truck for 
heavy ﬁres. A medical evacuation scheme (MEDIVAC) is 
in place, supported by ﬁrst aid facilities, a fully equipped 
clinic with doctors and qualiﬁed nurses as well as an 
ambulance for transportation to the nearest medical 
centres and hospitals. In addition, we coordinate with 
external entities and authorities, including ﬁre station,  
air transport companies, police and hospitals  
– for support during a ﬁre.
A preventive maintenance and inspection program was 
maintained to ensure that all equipment is ﬁt for use 
at all times. We undertook periodic drills to test our 
performance, equipment as well as training. The drills 
were analysed to provide feedback to the emergency 
planners. All employees were reminded of the emergency 
procedures, especially in relation to securing the work 
area, reporting emergency cases as well as evacuation. 
Health Performance
The Sukari site maintained a well-equipped clinic 
providing health and emergency related services on a 
24/7 basis. A doctor and qualiﬁed nurse managed the 
clinic and provided professional services. The clinic 
was also equipped to respond to emergency situations 
and medical cases. An ambulance was continuously on 
call to transfer any cases that needed higher medical 
treatment to the Marsa Alam hospital. 
We paid utmost attention to the protection of employees 
from exposure to chemicals, dust, noise and other 
elements that might cause health problems. Area-
speciﬁc instructions were in place regarding control 
measures and speciﬁc personal protective equipment 
requirements. Awareness and training programs were 
implemented to discuss potential occupational health 
hazards and measures to address them. 
Medical surveillance programs were in place, including 
blood lead analysis for laboratory personnel involved 
in ﬁre assays. Periodic measurements for work 
environment parameters throughout 2012 conﬁrmed that 
employee safety is maintained within the limits speciﬁed 
by Egyptian law and supported by best international 
mining practice.
Our Employees
Our people are our most valuable resource. Centamin’s 
activities provide direct and indirect employment, 
training and work experience to many Egyptians, as well 
as creating an immediate revenue stream for the local 
economy and the Government. At the end of 2012, 
Centamin had just over 1,000 employees on site and 
94% were Egyptian. Approximately 50% of our employees 
are from Upper Egypt, the area where Sukari is situated, 
which typically has less economic activity than the richer 
areas around the Nile delta. Centamin is committed to 
providing new employment opportunities and assisting the 
economic advancement of Upper Egypt.

Given that we are the ﬁrst modern gold mine in Egypt,  
our aim is to support the development of a workforce 
which will have the competency and experience to form 
the basis for a robust mining industry in Egypt. We pride 
ourselves that about 60% of our employees are less than 
30 years old.
The Group also uses contractors, primarily involving 
construction activities with some involved in drilling 
and blasting activities. The number of employees and 
contractors involved in construction is expected to rise 
and fall in future in line with the further development of 
expansion projects at Sukari.
We are committed to attracting, energizing, developing  
and retaining a highly skilled and experienced workforce. 
We value individuals with outstanding technical, 
professional and managerial skills, working in a positive 
environment and demonstrating willingness to lead,  
take responsibility and display initiative. We aim to foster 
a relation of trust and open dialogue between employees 
and management.
Communicating with Our People
2012 saw a formal system developed through which 
employees are encouraged to express their concerns in 
relation to ethical issues, reasonable workplace issues or 
work arrangements. Grievances will be comprehensively 
and transparently investigated and resolved to ensure 
prompt and fair tackling of any concerns that might 
arise. The system will provide feedback to those 
concerned, without any retribution.
We paid much attention to ideas provided by employees 
regarding their work, including modiﬁcations to work 
organization that saved time and increased performance 
and safety levels. 
We kept employees informed of new procedures, 
circumstances or interests through an internal 
information dissemination system, as well as meetings, 
notice boards, emails and informal gatherings.
Training and Development
The training and development of our team at Sukari and 
in our ofﬁces around the world was ongoing. It involved 
a variety of theoretical, practical and on-the-job courses 
and took place both at Sukari and abroad. We strongly 
encouraged our employees to realise their ambitions 
and we supported employees who aspire to progress 
up the career ladder and learn new skills. Through an 
inter-departmental mobility programme, we offered our 
people the chance to rotate into other teams to gain 
new knowledge and experience. In 2012, several of our 
employees took part in this programme and they have 
shown great potential in a number of roles.
Social and Community Activities
In addition to creating a positive work environment, we 
believe in the importance of helping our employees to 
enjoy their time before and after work. The majority of 
our people live in the Sukari camp, and thus we have 
invested in a variety of leisure facilities such as playing 
ﬁelds, a gymnasium, a library, internet access, satellite 
television and a swimming pool. Special barbecue dinners 
are also held at the beach or around Sukari and sports 
tournaments are regularly organised. 
For our married employees, we have implemented  
a relocation programme that allows them to live in Marsa 
Alam, a coastal town 25km from the mine, with their 
spouses. We provide transportation to and from  
Sukari and we plan to expand this programme further 
in coming years. 
We are proud to have brought mining back to a country 
that was once an important gold-producing country and 
we are paving the way for new investment in Egypt’s 
mining industry. 86 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
The Environment
We believe that environment responsibility is an inherent 
core part of to our business. Centamin’s corporate 
environmental policy outlines our commitment to 
safeguarding the environment, educating our employees 
and communities, and applying sound environmental 
management practices to minimize the risks of the 
environmental impacts of its operations to the  
reasonably practical level. 
Throughout 2012 we pursued programs and systems to 
ensure that the environment is appropriately managed and 
protected in all phases of our exploration, development, 
mining and processing activities. We are committed to 
maintaining and where possible enhancing the high level 
of environmental performance that we have reached. 
Creating an Environmentally Responsible Culture 
We maintained the training system through which all 
new employees and visitors undertook an induction to 
introduce them to the company’s systems, procedures and 
instructions as well as inform them of their responsibilities 
and expected performance. Area speciﬁc inductions 
highlighted environmental obligations and impacts related 
to speciﬁc work operations.
Tracking Environmental Performance
A core element of our management system is to asses 
our performance against our objectives and obligations 
and to provide feedback and assurance regarding 
the level and effectiveness of controls, performance 
enhancement initiatives and actions.
In 2012, we focused on strengthening our in-house 
monitoring capabilities. We have built a self-sustained 
monitoring station with equipment such as ambient and 
point source gas analysers, dust meters, noise meters, 
water kits and equipment to monitor meteorological 
conditions. The station is managed by experienced 
personnel. We are currently ﬁnalizing the documentation 
of operational procedures that includes sampling 
instructions, calibration requirements as well as quality 
control/assurance procedures. 
In 2012, we did not have any signiﬁcant environmental 
incidents. Minor incidents onsite did not impact areas 
outside our boundaries. 
Resource Management 
We use ore and process materials such as consumables 
and reagents to extract gold and to produce gold doré. 
Key consumables used are diesel fuel, explosives, 
lubricants and oils, sodium cyanide, lime and grinding 
media. Our environmental management systems 
include processes to manage all consumables and as a 
minimum, we import, transport, store, use and dispose 
of residues of such material according to Egyptian 
regulations. All chemical solutions used in the process 
plant are recycled and reused after regeneration. 
Water
Sukari is situated in the eastern desert of Egypt,  
a hot, dry region with very low annual rainfall (<10mm/
annum). There are no fresh water sources in the area 
and no productive groundwater reservoirs. Water is very 
important to a mining operation and is mainly used for ore 
processing, dust suppression and rock blasting.  
We obtain our water through a pipeline to the Red Sea, 
which is approximately 25km from Sukari. Beach wells 
where seawater inﬁltrates into groundwater are also used 
as a secondary source of water. In 2012, Sukari used 
about 4.2 million cubic metres of water. We actively 
pursued water conservation opportunities and through  
an internal recycling technique, we optimised its use.
Energy
We obtain our energy from diesel fuel oil with low sulphur 
content. Direct energy produced and consumed at Sukari 
includes fuel to run mobile equipment, to produce power 
and heat onsite and for explosives used to mine ore. 
In 2012, Sukari consumed 64.5 million litres of diesel, 
an increase of about 12% over 2011. Since the largest 
consumption element was power generation (c.70%)  
we continued to seek ways to utilize energy more 
efﬁciently, with stringent monitoring of diesel consumption 
for different users to indicate opportunities for 
conservation. We monitored our emissions due to fuel 
combustion and established that our emissions were well 
within allowable limits. In 2013, we will start calculating  
our greenhouse gases emissions. 
Corporate Social Responsibility Statement 87
Emissions, efﬂuents and wastes
We monitor emissions, efﬂuents and waste generated 
by Sukari. Programmes are in place to manage dust, 
hazardous and non-hazardous non-process waste, 
waste rock and tailings. We recycled and reused our 
waste to the maximum practical level. Material that could 
not be recycled was disposed of in a manner that was 
environmentally sound. We maintained an inventory 
of all types of waste, their quantities and the method 
of management and disposal as part of our waste 
management programme. 
Biodiversity
The 160km
2
 Sukari tenement area has very low coverage 
of ﬂora, with mostly barren soil. Due to the scarcity of 
water in the area, desert animals such as the Dorcas 
Gazelle and the red fox are not found, but they do inhabit 
the nearby Wadi El-Gemal protectorate. Centamin is 
committed to protecting the wildlife unique to the eastern 
desert through minimising the negative impact of our 
operations. Biodiversity conservation principles are 
applied to all of our activities and were integrated into the 
project design for Sukari from the outset. 
Rehabilitation
A draft restoration and rehabilitation plan has been 
prepared during construction and is updated and reﬁned 
annually to account for changes in mine development 
and operation as well as environmental and social 
conditions and requirements. A ﬁnal version of the plan 
will be reached as closure approaches and after due 
consultation with stakeholders. The main activities of 
the rehabilitation process will range from dismantling of 
infrastructure of equipment, winning, hauling, dumping, 
spreading of waste rock, ripping off compacted surfaces 
and grading area to blend with the surroundings. Given 
Sukari area is an arid desert with no topsoil, there will 
be a need to vegetate the surface so as not to alter the 
nature of the area. 
A provision for restoration and rehabilitation is included 
in the annual budget. The provision for future restoration 
costs is the best estimate of the present value of the 
expenditure required to settle the restoration obligation 
at the reporting date. Future restoration costs are 
reviewed annually and any changes in the estimate are 
reﬂected in the present value of the restoration provision 
at each reporting date. 
In addition to the long term rehabilitation plan, we 
undertake short-term rehabilitation and restoration 
activities especially for construction sites and for spills. 
We have a wide range of spill kits and personnel are 
trained for clean-up operations. 88 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2 88 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Community and Society
Centamin’s concession agreement gives us 30 years 
of operation at the Sukari Gold Mine with a potential 
extension for another 30 years. With such a long tenure, 
which is supported by a long life-of-mine, we take a long 
term view in matters relating to the local community. 
Centamin recognises that it has a responsibility to 
support and enhance the community in which it 
operates. We consider good community relations as a 
key component of continued operational success as 
well as a corporate requirement. We are committed to 
making a long lasting positive impact on the community 
where we do business. We act at all times in a socially 
responsible manner and aim to give back to the 
community in which we operate.
The four key ways in which we do this are:
1.  Identifying and mitigating any potential negative 
impacts of our activities
Sukari is situated in barren desert, so the closest 
town (Marsa Alam) is 25km from site. We do not 
have any resettlement, relocation or compensation 
requirements as a result of the development of 
Sukari, however we take into account the potential 
impact of our operations on local people at every 
stage of our activities.
2.  Engaging in dialogue with our stakeholders and 
listening to their suggestions and concerns
We nurture dialogue and build relations with the 
local community in areas in which we operate.  
A public consultation system has been developed 
and implemented since the project design phase, 
during construction phase and through operation. 
We maintain open channels of communication 
 with all our stakeholders, including two Marsa 
Alam-based development associations, for the 
purpose of information disclosure, raising concerns 
and grievances as well as public consultation. In 
2012, no material concerns were raised concerning 
our operations. 
3.  Optimising the opportunity for people from the area 
(Upper Egypt) to gain employment at Sukari
Since about 50% of Sukari’s employees are from 
Upper Egypt, we are strongly contributing to the 
development of this area. Where possible, we tender 
contracts to local companies to aid local economic 
activity and progress. Across Egypt, we use 
more than 6,000 local suppliers and contractors, 
providing jobs and income to a much larger group of 
people than our 1,000 direct employees.
4.  Assisting the local community with its economic 
development
From the commencement of our activities in 1995, 
we have strived to contribute to the development 
of Marsa Alam. Based on the Environmental 
and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and in 
consultation with the Board we have established 
a number of projects and initiatives to support 
infrastructure provision for deprived areas and 
settlements. Such activities respond to needs 
assessments periodically updated and coordinated 
with governmental plans and projects. Projects are 
implemented through direct interaction with the 
community, though local NGOs and community 
support associations or through full cooperation 
with the governmental authorities. In 2012, our 
focus was on supporting infrastructural projects. 
Case study
‘Awlad Baraka’ or Children of Baraka from the El Gergab 
clan live in Umm Tundubah 14km from Marsa Alam and 
22km away from the mine. There are around 40 houses 
including 200 people in the unofﬁcial settlement. Some 
of Awlad Baraka men work as boat drivers in the near-by 
diving center as well as safari guides. Most households 
have cars which they rent to tourists or local inhabitants. 
Women who are not yet married work in herding.  
After they are married, they remain at home for taking 
care of children.
The city council has announced that they will provide 
land to people living in the unofﬁcial settlement, which 
however has no infrastructure. 
The houses of the settlement are much more modern 
than those of the families in Wadi Sukari. The houses 
have sofas, kitchen, and bedrooms. However, because 
there is no electricity in the houses, families have to rely 
on candles at night.
Through public consultation activities, Centamin 
identiﬁed electricity as a priority need for the Awlad 
Baraka. Being near the water intake area for the mine, 
it was possible to have access installed to the power 
line and its transformers. Connections were therefore 
made to Awlad Baraka and power lines were extended to 
every house. Currently, each household has a television, 
satellite and most importantly, refrigerators. The families 
are very happy with the project, which has brought light 
to their lives.
Corporate Social Responsibility Statement 89 89
Directors’ Responsibility Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the 
directors are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Under company law the directors must not approve 
the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting policies,  
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information; 
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance; and
 make an assessment of the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and 
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position 
of the company and enable them to ensure that the 
ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information 
included on the company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom and Jersey governing the preparation 
and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
 the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial 
position and proﬁt or loss of the Group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and
 the management report, which is incorporated into 
the directors’ report, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Group and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Independent Auditor’s Report  
to the Members of Centamin Plc
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements  
(the “ﬁnancial statements”) of Centamin plc for the 
year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise of the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, and the related notes 
1 to 30. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  
as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for  
being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion  
on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to 
give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In 
addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial 
information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. 
Emphasis of matter – signiﬁcant uncertainty 
relating to the outcome of the Sukari 
exploitation lease judgement
In forming our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements,  
which is not modiﬁed, we have considered the adequacy 
of the disclosures made in Notes 3, 4, 6 and 20 to 
the ﬁnancial statements concerning the judgement of 
the Egyptian Administrative Court, which found the 
Company’s 160km
2
 exploitation lease for the Sukari mine 
to be invalid, but separately found that there was  
in existence a valid 3km
2
 exploitation lease. The company 
has ﬁled an appeal before the Supreme Administrative 
Court in Egypt to challenge this judgement and on 
20 March 2013 the Court suspended the enforcement  
of the 30 October 2012 judgement pending a hearing on 
the merits of the appeal. Whilst the Directors are conﬁdent 
based on legal advice that the matter will be resolved in 
the Company’s favour, the ultimate outcome of the appeal 
cannot presently be determined with any certainty, and 
no impairment or other impact that may result has been 
recorded in the ﬁnancial statements.
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of the Group’s 
proﬁt for the year then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by European Union; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRS as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB)
As explained in the accounting policies to the ﬁnancial 
statements, the Group, in addition to complying with its 
legal obligation to comply with IFRS’s as adopted by the 
European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by 
the IASB. In our opinion the group ﬁnancial statements 
comply with IFRSs as issued by IASB. 91
Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 proper accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or proper returns adequate for 
our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
 the ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with  
the accounting records and returns; or
 we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the 
part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code speciﬁed for our review.
Other matters
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 
2006 as if that Act had applied to the company.
We have reviewed the Directors’ Statement, contained 
within the Directors’ Report in relation to going concern 
as if the company had been incorporated in the UK and 
have nothing to report to you in that respect.

2.  Adoption of new and revised 
accounting standards
In the current year, the following new and revised 
Standards and Interpretations have been adopted  
and have affected the amounts reported in these 
ﬁnancial statements.
Standards affecting the ﬁnancial statements
IFRIC 20 
Stripping Costs 
in the Production 
Phase of a 
Surface Mine
IFRIC 20 provides clarity on how 
to account for and measure the 
removal of mine waste materials 
which provide access to mineral  
ore deposits.
Refer to Changes in Accounting 
Policy in Note 3 for further 
information.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor 
the ﬁnancial position
The following new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. 
Their adoption has not had any signiﬁcant impact on the 
amounts reported in these ﬁnancial statements but, with 
the exception of the amendment to IFRS 1, may impact 
the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
IFRS 7 
(amended) 
Disclosures – 
Transfers of 
Financial Assets
The amendments introduce 
additional disclosures, designed  
to allow users of ﬁnancial 
statements to improve their 
understanding of transfer 
transactions of ﬁnancial assets, 
including understanding the 
possible effects of any risks that 
may remain with the entity that 
transferred the assets.  
The amendments also require 
additional disclosures if a 
disproportionate amount of transfer 
transactions are undertaken around 
the end of a reporting period.
IAS 12 
(amended) 
Deferred Tax: 
Recovery of 
Underlying 
Assets
The amendment provides an 
assumption that recovery of  
the carrying amount of an asset 
measured using the fair value model 
in IAS 40 Investment Property will, 
normally, be through sale.
IFRS 1 
(amended) 
Severe 
Hyperinﬂation 
and Removal 
of Fixed Dates 
for First-time 
Adopters
The amendment replaces 
references to a ﬁxed date with the 
date of transition to IFRSs’ and 
provides guidance on how an entity 
should resume presenting ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with 
IFRSs after a period when the entity 
was unable to comply with IFRSs 
because its functional currency was 
subject to sever hyperinﬂation.
IAS 19 (revised) 
Employee 
Beneﬁts
The amendments provide revised 
requirements for pensions and 
other post-retirement beneﬁts, 
termination beneﬁts and  
other changes.
IAS 1 (amended) 
Presentation of 
Items of Other 
Comprehensive 
Income
The amendment revises the way 
other comprehensive income is 
presented. 97
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, 
the following Standards and Interpretations which have 
not been applied in these ﬁnancial statements were in 
issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not 
yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 1 (amended) Government Loans
IFRS 7 (amended) Disclosures – Offsetting 
Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial 
Statements
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests  
in Other Entities
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates  
and Joint Ventures (2011)
IAS 32 (revised) Offsetting Financial Assets  
and Financial Liabilities
Improvements to 
IFRSs 2009 - 2011 
Annual Improvements 
2009 - 2011 Cycle 
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the 
standards listed above will have a material impact on 
the ﬁnancial statements of the Group in future periods, 
except as follows:
 IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and 
disclosures of Financial Instruments;
 IFRS 11 will affect joint venture accounting, however 
will have no impact on the accounting of the 
Concession Agreement;
 IFRS 12 will impact the disclosure of interests the 
Group has in other entities;
 IFRS 13 will impact the measurement of fair value  
for certain assets and liabilities as well as the 
associated disclosures.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to 
provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these 
standards until a detailed review has been completed.
3.  Summary Of Significant  
Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) adopted by the European Union  
(‘EU IFRS’) and therefore the Group ﬁnancial statements 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
There are no changes in these accounting policies for 
the year ended 31 December 2012 except as disclosed 
in Note 3 below “Changes in accounting policy”.
Changes in accounting policy
IFRIC 20 “Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a 
Surface Mine”.
The Group changed its accounting policy on stripping 
costs in the production phase of a surface mine effective 
1 January 2012. IFRIC 20 provides clarity on how to 
account for and measure the removal of mine waste 
materials which provide access to mineral ore deposits. 
This waste removal activity is known as ‘stripping’. There 
can be two beneﬁts accruing to the entity from the 
stripping activity:
 usable ore that can be used to produce inventory; and 
 improved access to further quantities of material that 
will be mined in future periods.
IFRIC 20 considers when and how to account separately 
for these two beneﬁts arising from the stripping activity, 
as well as how to measure these beneﬁts both initially 
and subsequently.
The costs of stripping activity to be accounted for in 
accordance with the principles of IAS 2 Inventories to 
the extent that the beneﬁt from the stripping activity is 
realised in the form of inventory produced.
The costs of stripping activity which provides a beneﬁt 
in the form of improved access to ore is recognised as a 
non-current ‘stripping activity asset’ where the following 
criteria are met: 
i.  it is probable that the future economic beneﬁt 
(improved access to the ore body) associated with 
the stripping activity will ﬂow to the entity;
ii.  the entity can identify the component of the ore 
body for which access has been improved; and
iii.  the costs relating to the stripping activity associated 
with that component can be measured reliably. 98 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
for the year ended  31 December 2012
3.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(CONTINUED)
When the costs of the stripping activity asset and the 
inventory produced are not separately identiﬁable, 
production stripping costs are allocated between the 
inventory produced and the stripping activity asset by 
using an allocation basis that is based on a relevant 
production measure.
A stripping activity asset is accounted for as an addition 
to, or as an enhancement of, an existing asset and 
classiﬁed as tangible or intangible according to the 
nature of the existing asset of which it forms part.
A stripping activity asset is initially measured at cost and 
subsequently carried at cost or its revalued amount less 
depreciation or amortisation and impairment losses.  
A stripping activity asset is depreciated or amortised 
on a systematic basis, over the expected useful life of 
the identiﬁed component of the ore body that becomes 
more accessible as a result of the stripping activity. 
The stripping activity asset is depreciated using a units 
of production method based on the total ounces to be 
produced over the life of the component of the ore body.
IFRIC 20 includes transitional provisions which permit 
the Group to reclassify any ‘predecessor stripping asset’ 
at the start of the earliest period presented as part of the 
existing asset to which the stripping activity is related, 
which will be 1 January 2011. 
In line with IFRIC 20, our 2012 results now include a 
restatement of the 2011 year as follows:
Impact of IFRIC 20
Year ended 31 December 2011 
US$’000 
Increase in Proﬁt for the period and Total comprehensive income 12,049
Increase in Net Assets 12,049
Increase in basic earnings per share (cents per share) 1.11
Increase in fully diluted earnings per share (cents per share) 1.11
The adoption of IFRIC 20 had no impact on the Group’s retained earnings as at 1 January 2011.
These ﬁnancial statements are denominated in United States Dollars, which is the functional currency of Centamin plc. 
All companies in the Group use the United States Dollar as their functional currency except for Sheba Exploration (UK) 
plc and Sheba Exploration Limited that use Great British Pound. All ﬁnancial information presented in United States 
Dollars has been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated.
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, except for the revaluation of certain 
non-current assets and ﬁnancial instruments. Cost is based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange 
for assets. 99
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared  
by combining the ﬁnancial statements of all the 
entities that comprise the consolidated entity, being 
the company (the parent entity) and its subsidiaries 
as deﬁned in IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements”. Consistent accounting policies 
are employed in the preparation and presentation of the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the 
information and results of each subsidiary from the date 
on which the company obtains control and until such 
time as the company ceases to control such entity. 
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to 
govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity so 
as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, all 
intercompany balances and transactions, and unrealised 
proﬁts arising within the consolidated entity are 
eliminated in full.  
Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”) is jointly controlled by 
PGM and EMRA on a 50% equal basis. For accounting 
purposes, SGM is wholly consolidated within the 
Centamin Group of companies reﬂecting the substance 
and economic reality of the Concession Agreement  
(see Note 23). Pursuant to the Concession Agreement, 
PGM solely funds SGMs activities. PGM is also entitled 
to recover the following costs and expenses payable 
from sales revenue (excluding the royalty payable to 
ARE) (a) all current operating expenses incurred and 
paid after the initial commercial production;  
(b) exploration costs, including those accumulated  
to the commencement of commercial production (at the 
rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum); 
and (c) exploitation capital costs, including those 
accumulated prior to the commencement of commercial 
production (at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated 
cost per annum). 
EMRA is entitled to a share of SGM’s net production 
surplus (deﬁned as revenue less payment of the ﬁxed 
royalty to ARE and recoverable costs). Accordingly,  
no EMRA entitlement has been recognised to date.  
Any payment made to EMRA pursuant to these 
provisions of the Concession Agreement will be 
recognised as a variable charge in the income statement. 
Going concern
These ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2012 have been prepared on a going 
concern basis, which contemplate the realisation of 
assets and liquidation of liabilities during the normal 
course of operations. 
As discussed in Note 20, during the year the operation 
of the mine was affected by two legal actions. The ﬁrst of 
these followed from a decision taken by EGPC to charge 
international, not local (subsidised) prices for the supply 
of Diesel Fuel Oil, and the second arose as a result of 
judgment of an Administrative Court of ﬁrst instance 
in relation to, amongst other matters, the Company’s 
160km
2
 exploitation lease. In relation to the ﬁrst decision, 
the Company remains conﬁdent that in the event that it is 
required to continue to pay international prices, the mine 
at Sukari will remain commercially viable. Similarly, the 
Company remains conﬁdent that the appeal it has lodged 
in relation to the decision of the Administrative Court will 
ultimately be successful, although ﬁnal resolution of it 
may take some time. On 20 March 2013 the Supreme 
Administrative Court upheld the Company’s application  
to suspend the decision until the merits of the 
Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus 
providing assurance that normal operations would be 
able to continue during this process. 
In the unlikely event that the Group is unsuccessful  
in either or both of its legal actions, and that the 
operating activities are restricted to a reduced area,  
it is the Director’s belief that the Group will be able  
to continue as going concern. 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that  
the Group will have adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the Annual Financial Statements.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner 
which ensures that the resulting ﬁnancial statements 
satisfy the concepts of relevance and reliability, thereby 
ensuring that the substance of the underlying transactions 
or other events is reported.
The following signiﬁcant policies have been  
adopted in the preparation and presentation  
of these ﬁnancial statements:
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. 
Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash 
and which are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes 
in value. 100 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
for the year ended  31 December 2012
3.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(CONTINUED)
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised in 
the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classiﬁed as either 
ﬁnancial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the 
substance of the contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences  
a residual interest in the assets of an entity after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued 
by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as either ﬁnancial 
liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other ﬁnancial liabilities’.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as at FVTPL when 
the ﬁnancial liability is either held for trading or it is 
designated as at FVTPL. A ﬁnancial liability is classiﬁed 
as held for trading if: 
 it has been incurred principally for the purpose  
of repurchasing it in the near term; or
 on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of 
identiﬁed ﬁnancial instruments that the Group 
manages together and has a recent actual pattern  
of short-term proﬁt-taking; or
 it is a derivative that is not designated and effective  
as a hedging instrument.
 A ﬁnancial liability other than a ﬁnancial liability held 
for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon 
initial recognition if:
 such designation eliminates or signiﬁcantly reduces a 
measurement or recognition inconsistency that would 
otherwise arise; or
 the ﬁnancial liability forms part of a Group of 
ﬁnancial assets or ﬁnancial liabilities or both, which 
is managed and its performance is evaluated on 
a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s 
documented risk management or investment strategy, 
and information about the grouping is provided 
internally on that basis; or
 it forms part of a contract containing one or more 
embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement permits 
the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be 
designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, 
with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement 
recognised in proﬁt or loss. The net gain or loss 
recognised in proﬁt or loss incorporates any interest 
paid on the ﬁnancial liability and is included in the ‘other 
gains and losses’ line item in the income statement.
Other ﬁnancial liabilities
Other ﬁnancial liabilities, including borrowings, are 
initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. 
Other ﬁnancial liabilities are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, with 
interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating 
the amortised cost of a ﬁnancial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective 
interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash payments through the expected life of the 
ﬁnancial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of ﬁnancial liabilities
The Group derecognises ﬁnancial liabilities when, and 
only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, 
cancelled or they expire.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised and derecognised on 
trade date where the purchase or sale of a ﬁnancial 
asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of 
the ﬁnancial asset within the timeframe established by 
the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair 
value, net of transaction costs except for those ﬁnancial 
assets classiﬁed as at fair value through the proﬁt or loss 
which are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments in 
subsidiaries are measured at cost in the company 
ﬁnancial statements. Other ﬁnancial assets are “loans 
and receivables”. The classiﬁcation depends on the 
nature and purpose of the ﬁnancial assets and is 
determined at the time of initial recognition.
Effective interest method 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating 
the amortised cost of a ﬁnancial asset and of allocating 
interest income over the relevant period. The effective 
interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimate 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
ﬁnancial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, 
to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. 101
Available for sale ﬁnancial assets
Listed shares and listed redeemable notes held by the 
Group that are traded in an active market are classiﬁed 
as being AFS and are stated at fair value. The Group also 
has investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in 
an active market but that are classiﬁed as AFS ﬁnancial 
assets and stated at fair value (because the directors 
consider that fair value can be reliably measured). 
Fair value is determined in the manner described in 
note 26. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value are recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in the investments revaluation 
reserve with the exception of impairment losses, 
interest calculated using the effective interest method 
and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary 
assets, which are recognised directly in proﬁt or loss. 
Where the investment is disposed of or is determined 
to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is 
reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised 
in proﬁt or loss when the Group’s right to receive the 
dividends is established.
The fair value of AFS monetary assets denominated  
in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign 
currency and translated at the spot rate at the balance 
sheet date. The foreign exchange gains and losses that 
are recognised in proﬁt or loss are determined based on 
the amortised cost of the monetary asset. Other foreign 
exchange gains and losses are recognised in other 
comprehensive income. 
Loans and receivables 
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have 
ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market are classiﬁed as “loans and receivables”. 
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest rate method less impairment. 
Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest 
rate except for short-term receivables when the 
recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets 
Financial assets, other than those at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment 
at each reporting date. Financial assets are impaired 
where there is objective evidence that as a result of one 
or more events that occurred after the initial recognition 
of the ﬁnancial asset the estimated future cash ﬂows of 
the investment have been impacted. For ﬁnancial assets 
carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment 
is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows, 
discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset is reduced by 
the impairment loss directly for all ﬁnancial assets with the 
exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount 
is reduced through the use of an allowance account. 
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off 
against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are credited against the 
allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of 
the allowance account are recognised in proﬁt or loss.
With the exception of available-for-sale equity instruments, 
if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment 
loss decreases and the decrease can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was 
recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed through proﬁt or loss to the extent the carrying 
amount of the investment at the date the impairment is 
reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would 
have been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of available-for-sale equity instruments, any 
subsequent increase in fair value after an impairment 
loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Derecognition of ﬁnancial assets
The Group derecognises a ﬁnancial asset only when 
the contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from the asset 
expire, or when it transfers the ﬁnancial asset and 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of 
the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers 
nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, 
the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset 
and an associated liability for amounts it may have to 
pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of a transferred ﬁnancial asset,  
the Group continues to recognise the ﬁnancial asset 
and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the 
proceeds received. 102 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
for the year ended  31 December 2012
3.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(CONTINUED)
Employee beneﬁts
A liability is recognised for beneﬁts accruing to 
employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual 
leave, long service leave and sick leave when it is 
probable that settlement will be required and they are 
capable of being measured reliably.
Liabilities recognised in respect of employee beneﬁts 
expected to be settled within 12 months, are measured 
at their nominal values using the remuneration rate 
expected to apply at the time of settlement. Liabilities 
recognised in respect of employee beneﬁts which are not 
expected to be settled within 12 months are measured 
as the present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows to 
be made by the consolidated entity in respect of services 
provided by employees up to reporting date.
Superannuation 
The Company contributes to, but does not participate 
in, compulsory superannuation funds on behalf of the 
Employees and Directors in respect of salaries and 
directors’ fees paid. Contributions are charged against 
income as they are made.
Exploration, evaluation and development 
expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditures in relation to 
each separate area of interest are recognised as an 
exploration and evaluation asset in the year in which they 
are incurred where the following conditions are satisﬁed:
i)  the rights to tenure of the area of interest are 
current; and
ii) at least one of the following conditions is also met:
a)  the exploration and evaluation expenditures are 
expected to be recouped through successful 
development and exploration of the area of 
interest, or alternatively, by its sale; or
b)  exploration and evaluation activities in the 
area of interest have not at the reporting date 
reached a stage which permits a reasonable 
assessment of the existence or otherwise of 
economically recoverable reserves, and active 
and signiﬁcant operations in, or in relation to, 
the area of interest are continuing.
Exploration and evaluation assets are initially measured 
at cost and include acquisition of rights to explore, 
studies, exploration drilling, trenching and sampling and 
associated activities. General and administrative costs 
are only included in the measurement of exploration 
and evaluation costs where they are related directly to 
operational activities in a particular area of interest.
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for 
impairment when facts and circumstances (as deﬁned 
in IFRS 6 “Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral 
Resources”) suggest that the carrying amount of 
exploration and evaluation assets may exceed its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the 
exploration and evaluation assets (or the cash-generating 
unit(s) to which it has been allocated, being no larger 
than the relevant area of interest) is estimated to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent 
that the increased carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in 
previous years.
Where a decision is made to proceed with development 
in respect of a particular area of interest, the relevant 
exploration and evaluation asset is tested for impairment, 
reclassiﬁed to development properties, and then 
amortised over the life of the reserves associated with the 
area of interest once mining operations have commenced.
Development expenditure is recognised at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. 
When commercial production in an area of interest has 
commenced, the associated costs are amortised over 
the estimated economic life of the mine on a units of 
production basis.
Changes in factors such as estimates of proved and 
probable reserves that affect unit-of-production 
calculations are dealt with on a prospective basis.
Foreign currencies
The individual ﬁnancial statements of each Group 
entity are presented in its functional currency being the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements, the results and ﬁnancial position 
of each entity are expressed in United States dollars, 
which is the functional currency of the Group and the 
presentation currency for the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements. All companies in the group use the United 
States Dollar as their functional currency except for 
Sheba Exploration Holdings Limited (previously, Sheba 
Exploration (UK) plc) and Sheba Exploration Limited that 
use Great British Pound. 103
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements of the individual 
entities, transactions in currencies other than the  
entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.  
At each reporting date, monetary items denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
at the reporting date. Non-monetary items carried at 
fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated. Exchange differences are recognised 
in proﬁt or loss in the period in which they arise.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Costs including an appropriate portion 
of ﬁxed and variable overhead expenses are assigned 
to inventory on hand by the method appropriate to each 
particular class of inventory, with the majority being 
valued on a weighted average cost basis. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price less all 
estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to 
make the sale.
Ore stockpiles, gold in circuit and bullion are valued 
applying absorption costing.
Interests in joint ventures
Jointly controlled entities 
Where the Group is a venturer (and so has joint control) 
in a jointly controlled entity, the Group recognises its 
share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses, line 
by line, in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin Group 
of companies, reﬂecting the substance and economic 
reality of the Concession Agreement (see Note 23). 
Leased assets
Leased assets are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases when the 
terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the 
lessee. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where 
other systematic basis is more representative of the time 
pattern in which economic beneﬁts from the leased 
asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under 
operating leases are recognised as an expense in the 
period in which they are incurred.
Property, plant and equipment (‘PPE’)
Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment. Plant and equipment 
will include capitalised development expenditure. Cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the item as well as the estimated cost 
of abandonment. In the event that settlement of all or 
part of the purchase consideration is deferred, cost is 
determined by discounting the amounts payable in the 
future to their present value as at the date of acquisition.
Depreciation is provided on plant and equipment. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis so 
as to write off the net cost or other revalued amount of 
each asset over its expected useful life to its estimated 
residual value.
The estimated useful lives, residual values and 
depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each 
annual ﬁnancial period, with the effect of any changes 
recognised on a prospective basis.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The following estimated useful lives are used in the 
calculation of depreciation:
Plant and Equipment - 2- 50 years
Ofﬁce Equipment - 3 - 7 years 
Motor Vehicles - 2 - 13 years
Land and Buildings - 4 - 20 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of 
an asset is determined as the difference between the 
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and 
is recognised in income.
Mine development properties
Where mining of a mineral resource has commenced,  
the accumulated costs are transferred to mine properties.
Amortisation is ﬁrst charged to new mine development 
ventures from the date of ﬁrst commercial production. 
Amortisation of mine properties is on a unit of 
production basis resulting in an amortisation charge 
proportional to the depletion of the proved and probable 
ore reserves. The unit of production can be on a tonnes 
or an ounce depleted basis.
Capitalised underground development costs incurred 
to enable access to speciﬁc ore blocks or areas of the 
underground mine, and which only provide an economic 
beneﬁt over the period of mining that ore block or area, 
are depreciated on a unit of production basis, whereby 
the denominator is estimated ounces of gold in proven 
and probable reserves within that ore block or area where 
it is considered probable that those resources will be 
extracted economically. 104 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

Financial Statements

3.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(CONTINUED)
Stripping activity assets
The group defers stripping costs incurred (removal of 
mine waste materials which provide improved access to 
further quantities of material that will be mined in future 
periods). During the current year, the Group changed its 
accounting policy on stripping costs in the production 
phase of a surface mine “IFRIC 20” effective 1 January 
2012. IFRIC 20 provides clarity on how to account for 
and measure the removal of mine waste materials which 
provide access to mineral ore deposits. This waste 
removal activity is known as ‘stripping’. There can be two 
beneﬁts accruing to the entity from the stripping activity:
 usable ore that can be used to produce inventory; and 
 improved access to further quantities of material that 
will be mined in future periods.
The costs of stripping activity to be accounted for in 
accordance with the principles of IAS 2 Inventories to the 
extent that the beneﬁt from the stripping activity is realised 
in the form of inventory produced. The costs of stripping 
activity which provides a beneﬁt in the form of improved 
access to ore is recognised as a non-current ‘stripping 
activity asset’ where the following criteria are met: 
i.  it is probable that the future economic beneﬁt 
(improved access to the ore body) associated with 
the stripping activity will ﬂow to the entity;
ii.  the entity can identify the component of the ore 
body for which access has been improved; and
iii.  the costs relating to the stripping activity associated 
with that component can be measured reliably.
When the costs of the stripping activity asset and the 
inventory produced are not separately identiﬁable, 
production stripping costs are allocated between the 
inventory produced and the stripping activity asset by 
using an allocation basis that is based on a relevant 
production measure. A stripping activity asset is 
accounted for as an addition to, or as an enhancement 
of, an existing asset and classiﬁed as tangible or 
intangible according to the nature of the existing asset of 
which it forms part. A stripping activity asset is initially 
measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost or 
its revalued amount less depreciation or amortisation 
and impairment losses. A stripping activity asset is 
depreciated or amortised on a systematic basis, over 
the expected useful life of the identiﬁed component of 
the ore body that becomes more accessible as a result 
of the stripping activity. The stripping activity asset is 
depreciated using a units of production method based 
on the total ounces to be produced over the life of the 
component of the ore body.
Deferred stripping costs are included in ‘Stripping 
Assets’, within tangible assets. These form part of the 
total investment in the relevant cash-generating unit, 
which is reviewed for impairment if events or a change in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable. Amortisation of deferred stripping costs 
is included in operating costs.
Impairment of assets (other than exploration and 
evaluation and ﬁnancial assets)
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not 
generate cash ﬂows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reﬂects current market assessment of the time value of 
money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset for which the 
estimates of future ﬂows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-
generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying 
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-
generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but only to the extent that the increased 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset (cash generating unit) 
in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in proﬁt or less, unless the relevant asset is 
carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal 
of an impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable for goods and services in the 
normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and 
other sales-related taxes.  105
Sale of goods 
Revenue from the sale of mineral production is 
recognised when the Group has passed the signiﬁcant 
risks and rewards of ownership of the mineral production 
to the buyer, it is probable that economic beneﬁts 
associated with the transaction will ﬂow to the Group, 
the sales price can be measured reliably, and the Group 
has no signiﬁcant continuing involvement and the costs 
incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction 
can be measured reliably. This is when insurance risk 
has passed to the buyer and the goods have been 
collected at the agreed location.
Where the terms of the executed sales agreement allow 
for an adjustment to the sales price based on a survey 
of the mineral production by the buyer (for instance an 
assay for gold content), recognition of the revenue from 
the sale of mineral production is based on the most 
recently determined estimate of product speciﬁcations.
Pre-production revenues 
Income derived by the entity prior to the date of 
commercial production (being 1 April 2010) was offset 
against the expenditure capitalised and carried in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  
All revenues recognised after 1 April 2010 are 
recognised in accordance with the revenue policy stated 
above. 1 April 2010 was selected as the commencement 
date of commercial production due to the fact that 
sufﬁcient, stable and sustained production capacity  
had been achieved as at that date.
Interest revenue 
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that 
the economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the Group and the 
amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Interest revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference 
to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest 
rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life 
of the ﬁnancial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Production royalty 
The Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) is entitled to a 
royalty of 3% of net sales revenue as deﬁned from the 
sale of gold and associated minerals from the Sukari 
Project. This royalty is calculated and recognised on 
receipt of the ﬁnal certiﬁcate of analysis document 
received from the reﬁnery. Due to its nature, the 
production is not recognised in cost of sales.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are 
accounted for using the acquisition method. The 
consideration for each acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of 
assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised 
in proﬁt or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition 
includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-
date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values 
are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where 
they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see 
below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of 
contingent consideration classiﬁed as an asset or liability 
are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. 
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration 
classiﬁed as equity are not recognised.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the 
Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity 
are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. 
the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain 
or loss, if any, is recognised in proﬁt or loss. Amounts 
arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the 
acquisition date that have previously been recognised in 
other comprehensive income are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or 
loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that 
interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for 
recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are recognised at their 
fair value at the acquisition date, except that: 
 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or 
assets related to employee beneﬁt arrangements 
are recognised and measured in accordance with 
IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Beneﬁts 
respectively;
 liabilities or equity instruments related to the 
replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s  
share based
 payment awards are measured in accordance with 
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and
 assets (or disposal Groups) that are classiﬁed as held 
for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Noncurrent. 106 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
for the year ended  31 December 2012
3.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
(CONTINUED)
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are 
measured in accordance with that Standard. If the initial 
accounting for a business combination is incomplete by 
the end of the reporting period in which the combination 
occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for 
the items for which the accounting is incomplete. 
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period (see below), or additional assets 
or liabilities are recognised, to reﬂect new information 
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed 
as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have 
affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date 
of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete 
information about facts and circumstances that existed 
as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum 
of one year.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has 
signiﬁcant inﬂuence and that is neither a subsidiary nor 
an interest in a joint venture. Signiﬁcant inﬂuence is 
the power to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating 
policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint 
control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates 
are incorporated in these ﬁnancial statements using 
the equity method of accounting, except when the 
investment is classiﬁed as held for sale, in which case it 
is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current 
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Under the equity method, investments in associates 
are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost 
as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s 
share of the net assets of the associate, less any 
impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses 
of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that 
associate (which includes any long-term interests that, 
in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in 
the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the 
Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s 
share of the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate 
recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised 
as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the 
carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for 
impairment as part of that investment. Any excess of 
the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identiﬁable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the 
cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised 
immediately in proﬁt or loss.
Where a Group entity transacts with an associate of the 
Group, proﬁts and losses are eliminated to the extent of 
the Group’s interest in the relevant associate.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments with employees 
and others providing similar services are measured at 
the fair value of the equity instrument at grant date. Fair 
value is measured by the use of the Black and Scholes 
model. Where share-based payments are subject to 
market conditions, fair value was measured by the use 
of a Monte-Carlo simulation. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed over the vesting period, based 
on the consolidated entity’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest.
Equity-settled share based transactions with other 
parties are measured at the fair value of the goods or 
services received, except where the fair value cannot 
be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured 
at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, 
measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the 
counter party renders the service.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural 
considerations. Further details on how the fair value 
of equity-settled share-based transactions has been 
determined can be found in Note 27. At each reporting 
date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of 
equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the 
revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised 
in proﬁt or loss over the remaining vesting period, with 
corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee 
beneﬁts reserve.
Issued capital
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue 
of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company or other members of the 
consolidated Group purchases the Company’s equity 
share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from 
the total shareholders’ equity of the Group and/or of the 
Company as treasury shares until they are cancelled. 
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, 
any consideration received is included in shareholders’ 
equity of the Group and/or the Company. 107
Taxation 
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax 
currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for 
the period. Taxable proﬁt differs from proﬁt as reported 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
because of items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other periods and items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax 
is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all 
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets 
are generally recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
proﬁts will be available against which those deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the taxable proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable 
temporary differences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the 
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences associated with such 
investments and interests are only recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that there will be sufﬁcient 
taxable proﬁts against which to utilise the beneﬁts of the 
temporary differences and they are expected to reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed 
at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable 
proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to 
be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in 
which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based 
on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets 
reﬂects the tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the 
reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount 
of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there 
is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and 
the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Special considerations
In Australia, Centamin Egypt Limited and Pharaoh Gold 
Mines NL have elected to form a tax consolidated group 
and therefore are treated as a single entity for Australian 
income tax purposes. Pharaoh Gold Mines NL has 
elected into the ‘Branch Proﬁts Exemption’ whereby 
foreign branch income will generally not be subject to 
Australian income tax.
In Egypt, Centamin has entered into a concession 
agreement that provides that the income generated by 
Sukari Gold Mining Company’s activities is granted a 
long-term tax exemption from all taxes imposed in Egypt. 
Restoration and rehabilitation
A provision for restoration and rehabilitation is 
recognised when there is a present obligation as a result 
of exploration, development and production activities 
undertaken, it is probable that an outﬂow of economic 
beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation, and 
the amount of the provision can be measured reliably. 
The estimated future obligations include the costs of 
dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration and 
monitoring of the affected areas. The provision for future 
restoration costs is the best estimate of the present 
value of the expenditure required to settle the restoration 
obligation at the reporting date. Future restoration costs 
are reviewed annually and any changes in the estimate 
are reﬂected in the present value of the restoration 
provision at each reporting date.
The initial estimate of the restoration and rehabilitation 
provision relating to exploration, development and mining 
production activities is capitalised into the cost of the 
related asset and amortised on the same basis as the 
related asset, unless the present obligation arises from the 
production of the inventory in the period, in which case the 
amount is included in the cost of production for the period. 
Changes in the estimate of the provision of restoration 
and rehabilitation are treated in the same manner, except 
that the unwinding of the effect of discounting on the 
provision is recognised as a ﬁnance cost rather than being 
capitalised into the cost of the related asset. 108 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

4.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING 
JUDGEMENTS 
i)  Critical Judgements in Applying the Entity’s 
Accounting Policies
The following are the critical judgements that 
management has made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies and that have the most 
signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
ﬁnancial statements:
Litigation
The Group is currently a party to two legal actions both 
of which could affect its ability to operate the mine at 
Sukari in the manner in which it is currently operated 
and adversely affect its proﬁtability. The details of this 
litigation, which relate to the loss of the Egyptian national 
subsidy for Diesel Fuel Oil and the ability of the Group 
to operate outside the area of 3km
2
 determined by the 
Administrative Court of ﬁrst instance to be the area of 
the exploitation lease, are given on in Note 20 to the 
Financial Statements, and in the most recently ﬁled 
Annual Information Form (“AIF”) which is available on 
www.sedar.com. Although it is possible to quantify the 
effects of the loss the national fuel subsidy, it is not 
currently possible to quantify with sufﬁcient precision  
the effect of restricting operations to an area of 3km
2
. 
Every action is being taken to contest these decisions, 
including the making of formal legal appeals and, 
although their resolution may take some time, 
management remain conﬁdent that a satisfactory 
outcome will ultimately be achieved. In the meantime, 
however, the Group is continuing to pay international 
prices for Diesel Fuel Oil. With respect to the 
Administrative Court ruling, on 20 March 2013 the 
Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Company’s 
application to suspend this decision until the merits of 
the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus 
providing assurance that normal operations would be 
able to continue during this process.
In the unlikely event that the Group is unsuccessful  
in either or both of its legal actions, and that the 
operating activities are restricted to a reduced area,  
it is management’s belief that the Group will be able  
to continue as going concern.
Accounting treatment of Sukari Gold Mines 
(SGM)
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin Group 
of companies, reﬂecting the substance and economic 
reality of the Concession Agreement (see Note 23).
Recovery of Capitalised Exploration Evaluation 
and Development Expenditure
The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and 
evaluation expenditure results in exploration and 
evaluation expenditure being capitalised for those 
projects where such expenditure is considered likely to 
be recoverable through future extraction activity or sale or 
where the exploration activities have not reached a stage 
which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence 
of reserves. This policy requires management to make 
certain estimates and assumptions as to future events 
and circumstances, in particular whether the Group will 
proceed with development based on existence of reserves 
or whether an economically viable extraction operation 
can be established. Such estimates and assumptions 
may change from period to period as new information 
becomes available. If, subsequent to the exploration and 
evaluation expenditure being capitalised, a judgement 
is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely or 
the project is to be abandoned, the relevant capitalised 
amount will be written off to the income statement.
ii)  Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
The following are the key assumptions concerning the 
future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty 
at the reporting date, that have a signiﬁcant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year:
Provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs
The Group is required to decommission, rehabilitate and 
restore mines and processing sites at the end of their 
producing lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant 
authorities. The provision has been calculated taking into 
account the estimated future obligations including the 
costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration 
and monitoring of the affected areas. The provision 
for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the 
present value of the expenditure required to settle the 
restoration obligation at the reporting date. 109
Ore reserve estimates
Estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include assumptions on commodity prices, exchange rates, discount rates 
and production costs for future cashﬂows. It also involves assessment and judgement of difﬁcult geological models.  
The economic, geological and technical factors used to estimate ore reserves may change from period to period. Changes 
in ore reserves affect the carrying values of mine properties, property, plant and equipment, provision for rehabilitation 
assets and deferred taxes. Ore reserves are integral to the amount of depreciation and amortisation charged to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and the calculation of inventory.
Production forecasts from the underground mine at Sukari are partly based on estimates regarding future resource and 
reserve growth. It is the opinion of management and Directors that these estimates are both realistic and conservative, 
based on current information. However, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for 
further reserve deﬁnition, the life of this part of the mine remains limited and there is a risk that some or all of this growth 
will not materialise with a consequent negative impact on current production forecasts.

Exceptional items
The Directors consider that items of income or expense which are material by virtue of their unusual, irregular or 
non-recurring nature should be disclosed separately if the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are to fairly present 
the ﬁnancial position and underlying business performance. In order to allow a better understanding of the ﬁnancial 
information presented within the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, and speciﬁcally the Group’s underlying business 
performance, the effect of exceptional items are shown below.

In January 2012 the Company received a letter from 
Chevron to the effect that Chevron would not be able to 
continue supplying Diesel Fuel Oil (DFO) to the mine at 
Sukari at local subsidised prices. It is understood that 
the reason that this letter was issued was that Chevron 
had received a letter instructing it to do so from the 
Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). It 
is further understood that EGPC itself took the decision 
to issue this instruction because it had received legal 
advice from the Legal Advice Department of the Council 
of State (an internal government advisory department) 
that the companies operating in the gold mining sector 
in Egypt were not entitled to such subsidies. In addition, 
the Company during the year received a demand from 
Chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies received 
in the period from late 2009 through to January 2012, 
amounting to some US$60 million (EGP403 million).
The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter 
(and, in particular, on the opinion given by Legal Advice 
Department of the Council of State) and in consequence 
in June lodged an appeal against EGPC’s decision in the 
Administrative Courts. Again, the Group believes that 
its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is every 
prospect of success. However, as a practical matter, and 
in order to ensure the continuation of supply, the Group 
has since January advanced funds to our fuel supplier, 
Chevron, based on the international price for diesel. 
As at the date of this document, no ﬁnal decision 
had been taken by the courts regarding this matter. 
Furthermore, the Group remains of the view that 
an instant move to international fuel prices is not a 
reasonable outcome and will look to recover funds 
advanced thus far should the court proceeding 
be concluded in its favour. However, Management 
recognises the practical difﬁculties associated with 
re-claiming funds from the government and for this 
reason have, fully provided against the prepayment of 
US$41.4 million, as an exceptional item, as follows: 
(a) a US$33.1 million increase in cost of sales,
(b) a US$0.6 million increase in stores inventories, 
(c)  a US$3.6 million increase in mining stockpiles  
and ore in circuit, and
(d)  a US$4.1 million increase in property, plant and 
equipment (capital WIP).
This has resulted in a net decrease of US$33.1 million  
in the proﬁt and loss.

Tax consolidation
Relevance of tax consolidation to the consolidated entity
Companies within the Groups wholly-owned Australian 
resident entities formed a tax-consolidated Group with 
effect from 1 July 2003. The head entity within the  
tax-consolidated Group is Centamin Egypt Limited.  
The members of the tax-consolidated Group are 
identiﬁed at Note 21.
Nature of tax funding arrangements and tax sharing 
agreements
Entities within the tax-consolidated Group have entered 
into a tax funding arrangement and a tax-sharing 
agreement with the head entity. Under the terms of the 
tax funding agreement, Centamin Egypt Limited and 
each of the entities in the tax-consolidated Group has 
agreed to pay a tax equivalent payment to or from the 
head entity, based on the current tax liability or current 
tax asset of the entity. Such amounts are reﬂected  
in amounts receivable from or payable to other entities  
in the tax-consolidated Group.
The tax sharing agreement entered into between 
members of the tax-consolidated Group provides for the 
determination of the allocation of income tax liabilities 
between the entities should the head entity default on 
its tax payment obligations. No amounts have been 
recognised in the ﬁnancial statements in respect of this 
agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax 
sharing agreement is considered remote.
8. SEGMENT REPORTING
The Group is engaged in the business of exploration 
and mining of precious and base metals only, which 
represents a single operating segment. The Board is 
the Group’s chief operating decision maker within the 
meaning of IFRS 8.  114 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

Gold sales debtors 40,736 29,976
Other receivables -22
40,736 29,998
Trade and other receivables are classiﬁed as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost. 
The average age of the receivables is 35 days (2011: 32 days). No interest is charged on the receivables. There are 
no trade receivables past due and impaired at the reporting date, and thus no allowance for doubtful debts has been 
recognised. Of the trade receivables balance, the gold sales debtor is all receivable from Johnson Matthey of Canada. 
The amount due has been received subsequent to year-end and was considered to be fully recoverable. 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value.

20. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND 
CONTINGENT ASSETS
Contingent Liabilities
Fuel Supply
In January 2012, the Group received a letter from 
Chevron to the effect that Chevron would only be able to 
supply Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO”) to the mine at Sukari at 
international prices rather than at local subsidised prices, 
which had the effect of adding approximately US$150 
per ounce to the cost of production. It is understood that 
the reason that this letter was issued was that Chevron 
had received a letter instructing it to do so from the 
Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). 
It is further understood that EGPC itself issued this 
instruction because it had received legal advice from 
the Legal Advice Department of the Council of State 
(an internal government advisory department) that the 
companies operating in the gold mining sector in Egypt 
were not entitled to such subsidies. In November, the 
Group received a further demand from Chevron for the 
repayment of fuel subsidies received during the period 
from late 2009 through to January 2012, amounting to 
EGP403 million (approximately US$60 million at current 
exchange rates).
The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter 
(and, in particular, on the opinion given by the Legal 
Advice Department of the Council of State) and in June 
2012 lodged an appeal against EGPC’s decision in the 
Administrative Courts. Again, the Group believes that its 
grounds for appeal are strong and that there is a good 
prospect of success. However, as a practical matter, 
and in order to ensure the continuation of supply whilst 
the matter is resolved, the Group has since January 
advanced funds to our fuel supplier, Chevron,  
based on the international price for fuel.
As at the date of this document, no decision had been 
taken by the courts regarding this matter. The Group 
remains of the view that an instant move to international 
fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome and will look 
to recover funds advanced thus far should the court 
proceeding be successfully concluded. However, 
Management recognises the practical difﬁculties 
associated with re-claiming funds from the government 
and for this reason have fully provided against the 
prepayment of US$41.4 million, as an exceptional 
item. Refer to Note 6 of the accompanying ﬁnancial 
statements for further details on the impact of this 
exceptional provision on the Group’s results for 2012.
No provision has been made in respect of the historic 
subsidies prior to January 2012 as, based on legal advice, 
the Company believes that the prospects of a court ﬁnding 
in its favour in relation to this matter remain very strong.
Egyptian Court Litigation 
On 30 October 2012, the Administrative Court in Egypt 
handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by, 
amongst others, an independent member of the previous 
parliament, in which he argued for the nulliﬁcation of the 
agreement that confers on the Group rights to operate 
in Egypt. This agreement, the Concession Agreement, 
was entered into between the Arab Republic of Egypt, 
the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority (“EMRA”) and 
Centamin’s wholly owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold Mines 
(“PGM”), and was approved by the People’s Assembly as 
Law 222 of 1994.
In summary that judgment states that, although the 
Concession Agreement itself remains valid and in force, 
sufﬁcient evidence had not been submitted to Court 
in order to demonstrate that the 160km
2
 “exploitation 
lease” between PGM and EMRA had received approval 
from the relevant Minister as required by the terms of 
the Concession Agreement. Accordingly, the Court 
found that the exploitation lease in respect of the area of 
160km
2
 was not valid although it stated that there was 
in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km
2
. 
Centamin, however, is in possession of the executed 
original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 
160km
2
 exploitation lease was approved by the Minister 
of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. It appears that an 
executed original document was not supplied to the Court. 
Upon notiﬁcation of the judgment the Group took various 
steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine 
at Sukari. These included both lodging a formal appeal 
before the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 November 
2012 and, in the ﬁrst instance, lodging an “Objection 
to Enforcement” in respect of with the Civil Court on 31 
October 2012; this was an interim measure which had 
the effect of “staying” (postponing) implementation of the 
original ruling until such time as the Objection is heard. 
In addition, in conjunction with the formal appeal the 
Group applied to the Supreme Administrative Court to 
suspend the initial decision until such time as the court 
is able to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal. 
On 20 March 2013 the Court upheld this application thus 
suspending the initial decision and providing assurance 
that normal operations would be able to continue whilst 
the appeal process is underway.  122 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2
Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
for the year ended  31 December 2012
EMRA lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 
27 November 2012, the day after the Company’s appeal 
was lodged. Furthermore, in late December 2012, the 
Minister of Petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and 
shortly thereafter publicly indicated that, in his view, 
the terms of the Concession Agreement were fair and 
that the “exploitation” lease was valid. The Minister of 
Petroleum also expressed support for the investment and 
expertise that Centamin brings to the country. We believe 
this demonstrates the government’s commitment to our 
investment at Sukari and the desire to stimulate further 
investment in the Egyptian mining industry.
We do not yet know when the appeal will conclude, 
although are aware of the potential for the process in 
Egypt to be lengthy. The Company has taken extensive 
legal advice on the merits of its appeal from two leading 
Egyptian law ﬁrms who have conﬁrmed that the proper 
steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 
160km² lease.  We therefore remain of the view that 
the appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will 
ultimately be successful.  In the event that the appellate 
court fails to be persuaded of the merits of the case 
put forward by the Group, the operations at Sukari may 
be adversely effected to the extent that the companies 
operation exceeded the exploitation lease area of 3km² 
referred to in the original court decision.
The Company remains conﬁdent that normal operations 
at Sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal case  
is heard.

Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
for the year ended  31 December 2012
Through its wholly owned subsidiary, PGM, the Company 
entered into the Concession Agreement with EMRA 
and the Arab Republic of Egypt granting PGM and 
EMRA the right to explore, develop, mine and sell gold 
and associated minerals in speciﬁc concession areas 
located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Concession 
Agreement came into effect under Egyptian law on 
13 June 1995. 
In 2001 PGM, together with EMRA, were granted an 
Exploitation Lease over 160 km
2
 surrounding the Sukari 
Project site. The Exploitation Lease was signed by 
PGM, EMRA and the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum 
and gives tenure for a period of 30 years, commencing 
24 May 2005 and extendable by PGM for an additional 
30 years upon PGM providing reasonable commercial 
justiﬁcation. 
In 2006 SGM, was incorporated under the laws of Egypt. 
SGM was formed to conduct exploration, development, 
exploitation and marketing operations in accordance 
with the Concession Agreement. Responsibility for the 
day-to-day management of the Project rests with the 
General Manger, who is appointed by PGM. 
The ﬁscal terms of the Concession Agreement require that 
PGM solely funds the SGM. PGM is however entitled to 
recover from sales revenue recoverable costs, as deﬁned 
in the Concession Agreement. EMRA is entitled to a share 
of SGM’s net production surplus or proﬁt share (deﬁned 
as revenue less payment of the ﬁxed royalty to ARE and 
recoverable costs). As at 31 December 2012, PGMs 
has not recovered its cost and accordingly, no EMRA 
entitlement has been recognized to date, it is anticipated 
that the ﬁrst payment to EMRA will become payable during 
2013, any payment made to EMRA pursuant to these 
provisions of the Concession Agreement will be recognised 
as a variable royalty charge to the income statement. 
The Concession Agreement grants certain tax 
exemptions, including the following: 
 From 1 April 2010, being the date of Commercial 
Production, the Sukari Project is entitled to a 15 year 
exemption from any taxes imposed by the Egyptian 
government on the revenues generated from the 
Sukari Project. PGM and EMRA intend that SGM 
will in due course ﬁle an application to extend the 
tax-free period for a further 15 years. The extension 
of the tax-free period requires that there has been 
no tax problems or disputes in the initial period and 
that certain activities in new remote areas have been 
planned and agreed by all parties; 
 PGM and SGM are exempt from custom taxes and 
duties with respect to the importation of machinery, 
equipment and consumable items required for the 
purpose of exploration and mining activities at the 
Sukari Project. The exemption shall only apply if 
there is no local substitution with the same of similar 
quality to the imported machinery, equipment or 
consumables. Such exemption will also be granted 
if the local substitution is more than 10% more 
expensive than the imported machinery, equipment 
or consumables after the additional of the insurance 
and transportation costs; 
 PGM, EMRA and SGM and their respective buyers 
will be exempt from any duties or taxes on the export 
of gold and associated minerals produced from the 
Sukari Project; 
 PGM at all times is free to transfer in US dollars or 
other freely convertible foreign currency any cash 
of PGM representing its share of net proceeds and 
recovery of costs, without any Egyptian government 
limitation, tax or duty; and 
 PGM’s contractors and sub-contractors are entitled 
to import machinery. Equipment and consumable 
items under the “Temporary Release System” which 
provided exemption from Egyptian customs duty.  127

(a) Group risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the cash and equity balance. The Group’s overall 
strategy remains unchanged from the previous ﬁnancial period.
The Group has no debt and thus not geared at year-end or in the prior year. The capital structure consists of cash 
and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital and reserves 
as disclosed in Notes 17 and 18. The Group operates in Australia, London, Jersey, Egypt and Ethiopia. None of the 
Group’s entities are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group utilises inﬂows of funds toward the ongoing exploration and development of the Sukari Gold Project in Egypt.

(b) Financial risk management and objectives
The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seeks to 
minimise potential risk adverse effects and ensure that net cash ﬂows are sufﬁcient to support the delivery of the 
Group’s ﬁnancial targets whilst protecting future ﬁnancial security. The Group continually monitors and tests its forecast 
ﬁnancial position against these objectives.
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks: market; commodity; credit; liquidity; foreign exchange; 
and interest rate. These risks are managed under Board approved directives through the Audit Committee. The Group’s 
principal ﬁnancial instruments comprise interest bearing cash and cash equivalents. Other ﬁnancial instruments 
include trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, Group policy that no speculative trading in ﬁnancial 
instruments be undertaken. 130 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
(c) Market risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, 
primarily with respect to the Australian dollar. Great British pound and Egyptian pound. Exposure to Canadian dollars 
has diminished considerably when compared to prior periods. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial 
transactions and recognised assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional 
currency. The risk is measured by regularly monitoring, forecasting and performing sensitivity analyses on the Group’s 
ﬁnancial position.
Financial instruments denominated in Great British pound, Australian dollar and Egyptian pound are as follows:

The Group’s sensitivity to foreign currency has decreased at the end of the current period mainly due to the decrease  
in foreign currency cash holdings in Australian dollars and Great British pounds and a corresponding increase  
in US dollar cash holdings.
The Group has not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts. Natural hedges are utilised wherever possible to 
offset foreign currency liabilities. The Company maintains a policy of not hedging its currency positions and maintains 
currency holdings in line with underlying requirements and commitments. 131
(d) Commodity price risk
The Group’s future revenue forecasts are exposed to commodity price ﬂuctuations, in particular gold prices.  
The Group has not entered into forward gold hedging contracts. 
(e) Interest rate risk
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from cash and short term deposits and is not considered to be a material risk 
due to the short term nature of these ﬁnancial instruments. Cash deposits are placed on term period of no more than 
30 days at a time.

(f) Liquidity risk 
The Group’s liquidity position is managed to ensure that sufﬁcient funds are available to meet its ﬁnancial 
commitments in a timely and cost effective manner.
Ultimate responsibility or liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, who has established an 
appropriate management framework for the management of the Group’s funding requirements. The Group manages 
liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity 
on the basis of expected cash ﬂow. The tables above reﬂect a balanced view of cash inﬂows and outﬂows and shows 
the implied risk based on those values. Trade payables and other ﬁnancial liabilities originate from the ﬁnancing of 
assets used in the Group’s on-going operations. These assets are considered in the Group’s overall liquidity risk. 
Management continually reviews the Group liquidity position including cash ﬂow forecasts to determine the forecast 
liquidity position and maintain appropriate liquidity levels.

(g) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter-party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in ﬁnancial loss to 
the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit-worthy counter-parties and obtaining sufﬁcient 
collateral or other security where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of ﬁnancial loss from defaults. The Group 
measures credit risk on a fair value basis. The Group’s credit risk is concentrated on one entity, but the Group has good 
credit checks on customers and none of the trade receivables from the customer has been past due. Also, the cash 
balances held in Canadian and Australian dollars which are held with a ﬁnancial institution with a high credit rating.
The gross carrying amount of ﬁnancial assets recorded in the ﬁnancial statements represents the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of collateral or other security obtained.
(h) Fair value
The carrying amount of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded in the ﬁnancial statements represents their 
respective fair values, principally as a consequence of the short term maturity thereof.
(i) Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of ﬁnancial position
The following table provides an analysis of ﬁnancial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at 
fair value grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities;
 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that 
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or 
liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

27. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP)
The consolidated entity had an Employee Share Option 
Plan (ESOP) in place for executives and employees. 
Options were issued to key management personnel 
under the Employee Option Plan 2006 (previously 
the Employee Option Plan 2002) as part of their 
remuneration. Options were offered to key management 
personnel at the discretion of the Directors, having 
regard, among other things, to the length of service 
with the consolidated entity, the past and potential 
contribution of the person to the consolidated entity 
and in some cases, individual performance. Each share 
option converts into one ordinary share of the Company 
on exercise. The options carry neither rights to dividends 
nor voting rights and are not transferable. Options vest 
over a period of 12 months, with 50% vesting and 
exercisable after six months and the other 50% vesting 
and exercisable after 12 months of issue. All options 
are issued with a term of three years. At the discretion 
of the Directors part or all of the options issued to an 
executive or employee may be subject to performance 
based hurdles. No performance based hurdles have 
been applied for options granted to date. Upon exercise 
of the options the ordinary shares received rank equally 
with the existing ordinary shares. No options have been 
offered under the ESOP in 2011 or 2012.
Executive Directors Loan Funded Share Plan 
(EDLFSP) & Employee Loan Funded Share Plan 
(ELFSP)
Shares were issued to Executive Directors under the 
Executive Directors Loan Funded Share Plan EDLFSP 
2011 and Employees under the ELFSP as part of their 
remuneration package.
Under the terms of the EDLFSP and ELFSP, the 
Company has provided a limited recourse and interest 
free loan to certain employees of the Company for the 
purpose of acquiring the New Shares (the “Loan”). The 
purchase of the shares has been funded by the Loan 
and the shares will not vest until certain performance 
conditions are met. In the event the performance 
conditions are not met, or the shares are forfeited by 
the participant, the Company can either re-acquire the 
shares or direct the trustee to sell them on, offsetting 
the proceeds against the outstanding loan amount 
and waiving the remainder of the loan. Subject to 
performance conditions and time based hurdles being 
met, the loan will be repayable by the relevant employee 
in full on the earlier of the termination date of the loan 
(three years from the date of issue) or the date on which 
the shares are disposed of.
Further details of the EDLFSP and ELFSP can be found 
in the Notice of General Meeting for the shareholder 
meeting held on Tuesday, 15 February 2011, and full 
copies of the plan are available upon request.
Further details of the performance conditions can be 
found in the remuneration report.
 2011 Employee Option Scheme
Options were issued under the 2011 Option Scheme 
(EOS) made in accordance with thresholds set in plans 
approved by shareholders at the Extraordinary General 
Meeting of Shareholders on 14 December 2011. All 
employees of the Group other than directors shall be 
able to participate in the 2011 EOS. The Committee 
shall select from time to time from such group the actual 
participants in the 2011 EOS.
The 2011 EOS provides for employees (other than 
Directors) to receive up to an annual aggregate of options 
over ordinary shares, with an exercise price calculated 
by either the volume weighted average closing price of 
Ordinary Shares sold on an exchange for the ﬁve trading 
days most recently preceding the day as at which the 
market value is calculated or if market value is required 
to be determined in another manner or another amount 
for the purposes of tax legislation in another jurisdiction, 
then the value is so determined at the date of issue. 
The ability to exercise the options is conditional on the 
Group achieving its performance hurdles. For the initial 
grants to be made under the 2011 EOS it is the current 
intention that the performance criteria will be the TSR 
performance criteria as detailed in the 2011 Executive 
LFSP. Further details of the performance conditions can 
be found in the remuneration report.
Under the 2011 EOS the exercise price of the options 
is denominated in pound sterling. All options expire 
on the earlier of their expiry date or termination of the 
individual’s employment. 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan
During the year the Company implemented a Deferred 
Bonus Share Plan (DBSP) which is a long term share 
incentive arrangement for senior management (but not 
executive directors) and other employees (participants).
Under the DBSP , the Board shall, at its absolute discretion, 
require such eligible participants to defer up to one 
hundred per cent (100%) of their bonus opportunity and 
such eligible participants shall not be paid their deferred 
bonus in cash but shall instead be granted a Deferred 
Bonus Award over such number of Shares provided that 
the eligible participant remains in employment on the 
date of grant (effectively the vesting date). The award of 
the deferred shares will not have any performance criteria 
attached. They will however be subject to a service period. 135
The total share-based payment charge relating to Centamin plc shares for the year is split as follows:
2012  
US$’000
2011  
US$’000
2011 EOS 110 -
LFSP 1,650 1,496
DBSP 221 -
 
1,981 1,496
LFSP awards and EOS options granted during the year:
The fair value of the share-based payments awarded under the LFSP and granted under the 2011 EOS was measured 
by the use of the Black and Scholes model where share-based payments have non-market based performance 
conditions. Where share-based payments are subject to market conditions, fair value was measured by the use of a 
Monte-Carlo simulation. The Monte-Carlo simulation has been used to model the Company’s share prices against the 
performance of the chosen comparator group and the FTSE 250 at the relevant vesting dates. 
The assumptions used in these are set out below:

and shareholder of Cowden Limited, which provided 
insurance broking services to the Company.  
All dealings with Cowden Limited were on normal 
terms and conditions. Cowden Limited was paid 
A$2,293 or US$2,397 during the period for which 
Mr C Cowden was a related party during the year 
ended 31 December 2011, with A$ 11,815 or 
US$12,349 paid to Cowden Limited to be passed  
on to underwriters for premiums during the period  
for which Mr C Cowden was a related party during 
the year ended 31 December 2011.
f) Transactions with the Government of Egypt
Royalty costs attributable to the Government of Egypt  
of US$12,769,084 (2011: US$13,360,000) were 
incurred in 2012.
g) Transactions with other related parties
Other related parties include the parent entity, 
subsidiaries, and other related parties.
During the prior ﬁnancial period, the Company 
recognised tax payable in respect of the tax liabilities 
of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Payments to/from the 
Company are made in accordance with terms of the 
tax funding arrangement. 
During the ﬁnancial period the Company provided 
funds to and received funding from subsidiaries.
All amounts advanced to related parties are 
unsecured. No expense has been recognised in the 
period for bad or doubtful debts in respect of amounts 
owed by related parties.
Transactions and balances between the Company and 
its subsidiaries were eliminated in the preparation of 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group.
30. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
As referred to in Note 20, the Group is involved in  
on-going litigation in respect of the both the price at 
which Diesel Fuel Oil is supplied to the mine at Sukari 
and the validity of the 160km
2
 exploitation lease.  
Subsequent to year end the Company acquired  
a further interest in Nyota Minerals Limited and Sahar 
Minerals Limited for US$1,163,969 and US$500,000 
respectively.
Pursuant to the provisions of the Concession Agreement, 
any Proﬁt Share payments made to EMRA are due on 
an annual basis at the end of SGM’s ﬁnancial year, 
being 30 June.  Based on the Company’s calculation 
there was no Proﬁt Share due to EMRA as at 30 June 
2012.  Furthermore, it is expected that there will be 
Proﬁt Share due to EMRA for the current SGM ﬁnancial 
year ending 30 June 2013, based on budgeted 
production, gold price and operating expense forecasts.  
Following discussions with EMRA, and with a view to 
demonstrating goodwill toward the Egyptian government, 
subsequent to year end PGM has made an advance 
payment to EMRA of US$8,200,000. Calculations 
for Proﬁt Share will be done annually on the audited 
accounts of SGM and this advance payment will be 
netted off against any future Proﬁt Share that becomes 
payable to EMRA.  
There were no other signiﬁcant events occurring  
after the reporting date requiring disclosure in the  
Financial Statements. 142 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2 142 An n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 1 2

Inferred Resource
as deﬁned in the JORC Code, is that part of a mineral 
resource for which the tonnage and grade and mineral 
content can be estimated with a low level of conﬁdence. 
It is inferred from the geological evidence and has 
assumed but not veriﬁed geological and/or grade

the appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which 
may be limited or of uncertain quality and reliability

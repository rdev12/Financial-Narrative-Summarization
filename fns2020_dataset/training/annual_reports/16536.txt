The Listing of Vedanta Resources plc on the
London Stock Exchange in December last year
was a watershed for the Group. Thanks to 
the growing awareness among international
investors of the potential of the Indian
economy, and thanks equally to the strong
growth prospects of the Group, we were 
able to raise US$825 million, net of expenses. 
This was an amount we judged sufficient 
to complete the capital programmes at our
existing operations, and to bring our two new
mega-projects to full production. That outcome
constituted the second largest listing on the
London Stock Exchange in 2003 and the first
primary listing there of an Indian company, 
a tribute to the initiative of Anil Agarwal in
building the Group.
At the time of the Listing, we committed ourselves 
to a four-pillar strategy which, if successfully
implemented, will give the Group a growth profile
unrivalled in our industry. Sound progress has been
made since then and so far there have been no
material set-backs. 
The first pillar is to achieve OPTIMUM OPERATING
EFFICIENCY at our existing operations. Committed
capital expenditure, totalling around US$400 million,
will enable us to modernise, de-bottleneck and expand
the output of our plants, with beneficial impact on 
our unit costs. Progress this past year was particularly
evident at our zinc operation, HZL, where costs have
come down significantly, particularly helped by control
of energy input costs. The new copper smelter at
Tuticorin is now mechanically complete after some
disappointing delays. The new acid and power plants
are in use, and full start up will occur as soon as the
authorities issue the final permits. We expect to receive
these in a few weeks.
The second pillar of our strategy is to COMPLETE
OUR TWO MEGA-PROJECTS, the 250,000 tpa
Korba aluminium smelter at a capital cost of US$900
million, and the 1 million tpa Orissa alumina refinery
(capital cost US$800 million). First metal output 
at Korba is planned for March 2006; successfully
achieved, this will constitute a rapid construction
programme by international standards. At Orissa,
production is scheduled to commence by March
2007. Our studies suggest that the bauxite resources
and regional potential could sustain substantially
larger outputs in the years ahead. Good progress is
being made on both projects. The civil engineering
works at Korba were completed ahead of the
monsoon and some 120 of the 288 pots were in
place by the end of May 2004. At Orissa, the designs
and plans are well developed and civil engineering
work has begun on the site and the surrounding
facilities. The project involves some 40 engineering
packages and orders for around half of these have
already been placed. Our project managers have
embraced the challenges of delivering these projects
on time and within budget, and remain confident of
successful delivery. We are considering the possibility
of introducing a partner into the Orissa project, 
to join us in developing the substantial regional
potential to its full capacity in the decades ahead.
The third pillar of our strategy is to release the 
value trapped within the Group structure, by
CONSOLIDATING OWNERSHIP. Here, satisfactory
progress has been achieved in the six months since
Listing. We have made two purchases of Sterlite
shares. The first of 4.98% in January 2004 for 
US$58 million and then 2.4% in April 2004 for
US$21.4 million and we recently announced terms
for a US$440 million rights issue in Sterlite, all of
which are likely to increase our holding. Studies are
currently under way to establish how further
consolidation might best be achieved. 
Another opportunity open to us is our option to
acquire the Government’s 49% holding in BALCO. 
A valuer is to be appointed by the Government and
the Board will then be in a position to report back to
shareholders.
Increased ownership of assets with growing profits
is a happy outcome. As detailed in the Financial
Review which appears on pages 16 to 21,
consolidated Group operating profit for the year
ended 31 March 2004 was US$237 million, up
107% from US$115 million in the previous year.
Our EBITDA margin has climbed from 23% to 25%,
and our Return on Capital Employed has reached
16.8% (14.4% in 2003). As our capital projects are
completed – effectively tripling our pre-Listing capital
base – and start contributing to Group cash flows,
the financial benefits to our shareholders should be
material. On the basis of this year’s results and future
prospects, and in keeping with the announced
progressive dividend policy, the Directors are
recommending a dividend of 5.5 US cents per share,
representing a dividend for the four months from
Listing to the end of the financial year equivalent to
16.5 US cents for the full year. This dividend reflects
our confidence in the cash flows and stability of the
Group, and translates to a yield of 3.16% at current
market prices.
The fourth and final pillar of our strategy is to seek
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES
where we believe we have the necessary skills 
to add value. We remain preferred bidder for

Konkola Copper Mines, which was indicated as a
possible investment in our Listing Particulars. We 
are in the final stages of evaluating an acquisition
structure that should bring substantial benefits to 
our shareholders.
The currently planned investment programme will be
funded from the IPO proceeds, from the Free Cash
Flow and an increase in debt, which is covered by
our balance sheet. We expect our gearing to remain
at prudent levels, rising towards 40% during the
investment phase.
Shortly after the year end the general election in
India brought a new coalition Government into
power. There was much market uncertainty in the
immediate aftermath of that unexpected change.
Initial statements by the incoming Government 
on its privatisation policy have not alleviated investor
concerns and we hope for greater clarity in the
months ahead. Although Vedanta’s growth targets
over the next few years will be determined almost
entirely by its already committed projects, in the
longer term we would welcome further investment
opportunities, including privatisations, in an
economy that has such potential.
We should also recognise that the outcome reflects 
a well-functioning democratic process in what is the
world’s second most populous nation, and brings 
to power a Government committed to improved
economic circumstances for the vast numbers that
are poor. Such improvement can only come from
growth in the overall economy; and that in turn 
will fuel demand for Vedanta’s commodities –
aluminium, copper and zinc – without which growth
in a modern economy is not possible. 
In the light of our progress since Listing, the
trajectory of the Vedanta share price has been most
disappointing. Issued at £3.90, the shares have 
since traded well below that level. In my judgement,
Vedanta is today a very undervalued share, and 
this situation will inevitably correct itself as we
methodically deliver the key results of our corporate
strategy over the next two years.
Our Listing carries with it the commitment to 
the highest standards of corporate governance.
Responsibility for delivering on this commitment
rests in the first instance with the Board of Directors.
The one week delay in reporting our results was
therefore most disappointing to the Board, as it 
was to shareholders. We have undertaken to review
our reporting structures and authorities to prevent
any recurrence. 
On 22 May 2004, Mr P Chidambaram resigned from
the Board, following his appointment as Finance
Minister in the new Indian Government. I would like
to thank him for his contribution and I am sure that he
will play a pivotal role in the continuing development
of India. I am very pleased to welcome as new
Directors, Mr Naresh Chandra (who has had a
distinguished career in Government in India, with
much recent experience in governance matters) and
Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier (the successful former Chairman
and Chief Executive of Pechiney, a leading aluminium
producer, who also has wide previous experience in
copper and zinc). In preparation for Listing we
appointed Mr Peter Sydney-Smith as Finance Director,
formerly Finance Director of BPB. 
These Directors will strengthen and complement 
the skills and experience of the Board, and bring
sound judgement to our future deliberations. 
The appointment of these Directors gave us the
opportunity to further strengthen the Board
Committees and bring our Board structures in line
with the new Combined Code. This reaffirmed our
commitment to best practice corporate governance.
I commend the Vedanta executive team, and our
employees throughout the Group, for the sound
progress achieved since Listing. Their talents and
commitment will be the critical ingredients in
delivering on the ambitious targets that are set 
for the year ahead.

Finance greenfield growth: 
Two large greenfield projects, the 250,000 tpa GAMI-based aluminium smelter at
the Korba complex and the proposed 1.0 million tpa alumina refinery in Orissa,
offer attractive economics and future growth; 
Consolidate the Group structure: 
Vedanta will seek to increase its direct ownership in the underlying Businesses; and
Optimise the performance of the existing assets: 
Vedanta’s plans for its Businesses will de-bottleneck plants, improve efficiency,
expand output and drive down unit costs. Major projects include a new power
plant and zinc smelter at Chanderiya, expansion of the Rampura Agucha zinc mine
and the expansion of the Tuticorin copper smelter;
Leverage established skills: 
Vedanta will seek further growth opportunities in India, including the Government’s
privatisation programmes and also outside its traditional Indian base, in operations
where its proven transactional, operating and turnaround skills can provide a
competitive advantage. Vedanta Resources plc

It has only been six months between our Listing
and the production of our first Annual Report,
but a great deal has been achieved in that time
and the progress made has been encouraging.
Over that period we have seen good production
growth in several areas, which when combined with
cost control and strong metal prices, has resulted in
strong financial results. Turnover has increased by
34% to US$1,290 million. Group operating profit
has increased by over 100% to US$237 million for
the year, compared to US$115 million in 2003. At the
year end our earnings per share was 23.3 US cents
(compared to 24.5 US cents based on Underlying
Profit), based on 286 million Ordinary Shares in issue.
We have continued to make progress on improving
output, productivity and cost reductions in all of 
our operations, which was made difficult by the
headwind of shipping and energy costs. The Indian
rupee was less volatile than many other currencies,
with the average rate moving from INR48.5 to
INR45.9 to the US dollar.
We raised US$825 million net of expenses when
we listed, in support of a US$2 billion capital
programme, of which approximately US$300 million
has been invested so far. The balance is to be spread
over the next three years, principally at Korba and
Orissa. At the year end net cash was US$422 million.
The capital raised, combined with the cash flow
generated within the Group, will maintain our debt
within prudent levels while enabling us to carry out
all of our plans.
One aim of our strategy has been to simplify the
Group structure and enhance shareholder return by
increasing our ownership of the underlying assets
and reducing minorities. Since Listing we have made
two purchases of Sterlite shares and this has taken
our effective interest to 68.1% to date. We recently
reported a rights issue at Sterlite and we will take 
up any rights not taken by other shareholders. This
should increase our holding further and will put cash
into the subsidiaries for their development plans.
Minorities’ share of earnings is similar to last year 
at 58%. This is partly due to the success of the Zinc
Business where minority interests are high. This
number is likely to reduce moving forward, and was
already running at 54% in the second half of the
year, reflecting the actions that we have taken. 
In January 2004 the Government of India reduced
tariffs across all of our commodity products. The
tariffs were reduced by 5% on copper and zinc and a
special tariff of 4% was permanently removed across
all product groups including inputs of imported
materials, such as imported coal. This has left tariffs
of 15% on aluminium and 20% on lead, zinc and
copper. The net impact on our EBITDA and operating
profit was a reduction of around US$10 million over
a period of some three months. We believe that
tariffs in India will continue to decline, though we
cannot predict when any reduction will take place. 
Our aim is to reduce our costs of production, to
ensure that we remain competitive. Expansion 
will help reduce costs and continued liberalisation
will lead to a more open economy and stronger
economic growth. This is obviously beneficial for the
sale of our products and it is a change and challenge
that we welcome.
Exceptional demand from China and recovery in
several western economies has driven metal prices
up to high levels. The level of metal prices does, of
course, have a direct impact on our business. Our
volume, however, is based on levels of demand
within India and is less dependent on the global
scene. India has enjoyed a period of strong economic
growth and this is also reflected in our results.
Zinc and Lead
The zinc market was buoyant last year with average
prices on the London Metal Exchange of 40.8 US
cents per lb compared to 35.2 US cents per lb in
2003. We are a fully integrated producer and this
means we benefit fully from any strengthening in
the metal price. Global demand rose fast at around
3% in 2003, but this was modest compared to an
increase in India of some 9%. Nearly 75% of zinc 
in India is used in galvanising and substantial
investment in infrastructure is driving the demand. 
Our share of the Indian zinc market rose significantly
from 62% to 75% during the year. This was achieved
by increasing production and by tolling around
36,000 tpa of excess contained zinc in concentrate.
We currently have surplus mining capacity, but as 
our own new smelting capacity is commissioned at
Chanderiya this tolled zinc will be moved through 
our smelters at higher margin.

The output of zinc concentrate rose to 615,000 tpa
(2003: 486,000 tpa) and 74,000 tpa of lead (2003:
56,000 tpa). Production of finished zinc metal
increased from 207,000 tpa to 221,000 tpa. Several
initiatives were taken to reduce costs, through better
energy use, purchasing systems and productivity
rates. This reduced the unit cost of production
from 30.1 US cents per lb to 25.9 US cents per lb.
This was particularly pleasing given the increase
in metallurgical coal costs. We believe that further
work can be done, particularly in reducing power
costs and making further operational improvements. 
We continue to make good progress with the
implementation of our growth plans in the Zinc
Business. Over the course of this financial year 
we are building a new power plant and smelter 
at Chanderiya which will take production there 
from 100,000 tpa to 270,000 tpa. This should be
commissioned by June 2005. Over the same period
we are increasing the output at the Rampura Agucha
mine by 1.3 million tpa to 3.3 million tpa, which 
will feed the smelter and is due to commence in
December 2004. A captive power plant of 154MW is
being installed which should play a significant role in
reducing costs. These expansion plans will lift our zinc
capacity from a total of 210,000 tpa to 380,000 tpa.
The Indian lead market has a demand supply gap 
of around 100,000 tonnes. We have consequently
decided to more than double our refined lead
production capacity at Chanderiya from 34,000
tonnes to 85,000 tonnes. The facility is expected 
to be commissioned by July 2005.
Copper
Vedanta is primarily a refiner of copper and the copper
market was challenging for us over the year. Global
demand grew at around 2.6%, nearly twice the level
of supply. This was largely due to increased demand
from China for refined metal and some unplanned
shutdowns at substantial mines, all leading to a 
very tight global market. Stocks of copper reduced
significantly over the year and copper prices reached 
a nine year high of 136 US cents per lb. 
Due to the tight copper market, combined 
treatment and refined charges (“TC/RC”) during
2004 averaged around 8 US cents per lb against 
the average of 13 US cents per lb during 2003. 
We source a part of our concentrate requirements
through our own mines and we continue to increase
our contracts in the TC/RC market and thereby
reduce our exposure to the spot market.
It seems likely that the market will continue to be
tight, though supply is slowly starting to recover and
some global smelting capacity has been withdrawn
as a consequence of the low refining charges.
As our production numbers show, in spite of the
tight market, we were able to source copper and
even increased production, with a focus on higher
value areas. Cathode production increased over the
year by 15% to 178,700 tonnes (2003: 155,700
tonnes), production of copper wire rods rose by 
29% to just under 123,000 tonnes. With sufficient
capacity for copper wire rods already in place, 
the additional conversion of cathodes into rods
incurs minimal additional capital, but has produced
some US$20 million of EBITDA, around twice the
previous level.
We continued to make strong progress on cost
reduction, with the unit cost declining from 9.1 US
cents per lb to 7.8 US cents per lb. This was mainly
achieved through reduced consumption of power
and petroleum products and improvement in
recovery rates at the smelter.
Over the year Tuticorin smelter has been undergoing
significant expansion from 180,000 tpa of capacity 
to 300,000 tpa. The smelter and associated plant is
mechanically complete and under commissioning. We
anticipate that when the full benefits of the expansion
come on stream, we should be able to reduce our unit
cost by a further 2.0 US cents to 5.8 US cents per lb.
Chief Executive’s Review continued Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004

Aluminium
The use of aluminium in India remains modest
compared to the rest of the world, but with
significant growth potential. Increased global
demand again put pressure on prices, with average
aluminium prices rising by 10%. Alumina prices (the
raw material for aluminium) remained high being
driven by the demand from China as they increase
aluminium capacity. 
The production of aluminium at Vedanta is divided
between two separate Group subsidiaries, MALCO
and BALCO. Both companies have output close to
operating capacity with combined production of
129,000 tpa (2003: 127,000 tpa). BALCO represents
around 75% of aluminium output. Production has
seen a modest increase, but there was a focus on
improving product mix with higher value added
products, such as rods and rolled products. We
anticipate that the impact of value added products
will increase next year. A new cold rolling facility of
36,000 tpa was commissioned during the year and
will reach full production in 2005.
The unit cost of production at BALCO decreased
from 56.8 US cents per lb to 56.2 US cents per lb,
helped by an improvement in captive power
production, which reduced our need to purchase
more expensive power from the grid. Our costs were
held back by the increase in caustic soda prices and
the US dollar/Indian rupee exchange rate. There was
a significant voluntary retirement scheme, which saw
employee numbers decline by 775 to 4,000. An
exceptional charge of US$13.3 million was incurred
relating to this programme. In carrying out these
programmes we take full account of the welfare of
the individuals, many of whom have worked with
the Group for many years.
Costs at MALCO rose over the year, from 48.9 US
cents per lb to 53.8 US cents per lb, mainly as a
result of rising fuel costs and an additional tax
imposed by the State government on power
generation. MALCO purchased imported coal,
where prices rose faster than the domestic coal used
for power generation at BALCO. 
The Aluminium Business is undergoing significant
change. The major developments at Korba and
Orissa will transform this Business over the next
three years enabling us to both increase production
and significantly reduce our unit cost of production.
A 250,000 tpa smelter is being built at Korba, which
will take our total capacity from 135,000 tpa to
385,000 tpa. A captive power plant, generating
some 540MW, is being built as part of this scheme.
The cost of this project is around US$900 million 
and should be commissioned by March 2006,
though the power plant should be completed some
months before that. Orders for critical and long lead
items have already been placed and work is currently
on schedule. 
During the year, work started on the alumina refinery
with bauxite mining and captive power generation
facility at Lanjigarh in the mineral rich State of Orissa,
India. The project should be completed by March
2007, developing the fourth leg of our business. It
will not only cater for alumina demand at the new
Korba smelter but will also help Vedanta access
export markets. The project is progressing on
schedule with critical orders for refinery and power
plant already having been placed and preliminary 
site civil engineering works having been started.
Corporate Social Responsibility
As a major industrial company and employer 
we have an important role to play in our local
communities. Although there has been much
growth and improvement in India over the years,
there remain substantial parts of the population
whose health and economic welfare is fragile. We
are committed to working in this area and hope that
we can share the benefits of our success and growth
with our local communities.
At all of our sites we make it clear that safety is of 
the upmost importance. We have achieved further
certification for both environmental and health and
safety, which is covered in more detail in the Corporate
Social Responsibility report on pages 22 to 26.

Looking Forward
India remains a country of exceptional opportunities,
with a population of over 1 billion, significant natural
resources and yet one of the lowest levels of metal
consumption in the world. Metal prices may soften
from current high levels, though stocks are low and
the supply-demand balances in several areas suggest
that pricing could remain firm. 
Regardless of the influence of pricing, the outlook for
metal demand in India is strong and we are well placed
to take advantage of this. We should be able to make
further good progress at our zinc operations this year,
increasing volume in line with Indian demand. Tuticorin
is ready to produce from the new furnace and, subject
to receiving the permits, the benefits of this increased
capacity and lower costs should be apparent over the
course of the year. We are operating close to capacity
at our aluminium operations and although we will
always try to push the limits further, the major change
will be felt when the expansion project at Korba comes
on stream in 2006.
There are several opportunities to simplify the
corporate structure and we should be able to report
some positive progress over the year.
In the first quarter we have carried out planned
shutdowns for maintenance at Tuticorin (copper)
and Chanderiya (zinc and lead). Tuticorin had been
through an exceptional period of 24 months
continuous operation, which is a tribute to the
operational management. These shutdowns will lead
to a more modest first quarter, but without affecting
our overall expectations for the year.
The growth pipeline at Vedanta is exceptional, with
expansion projects of US$2 billion over the next four
years trebling our capital base. In the coming year
we expect to make significant progress on all of our
projects, with major commissioning coming in 2005
and 2006.
At all of our operations we strive to be low cost
producers. This is the best protection from low metal
prices that we can give our business and this will
help to ensure that we obtain the best return for
shareholders should circumstances change in 
metal markets.
We will continue to move forwards with our growth
plans and continuing to improve the efficiency of our
operations. We approach the coming year with
confidence and with many opportunities to develop.

Basis of Presentation
Set out on pages 47 to 93 are the Financial
Statements of Vedanta Resources plc, the first since
the Company’s Listing on the London Stock
Exchange on 10 December 2003. 
These Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted
accounting principles (“UK GAAP”) and the
requirements of the Companies Act 1985. Vedanta
presents its accounts in US dollars with subsidiary
companies maintaining accounts in their local
currency and translating to US dollars upon
consolidation.
As described in detail in note 1 to the Financial
Statements, the financial information has been
prepared on the basis that the Group had existed
throughout the two-year period beginning 
1 April 2002. The Directors believe that this
information reflects the ongoing business of the
Group more clearly.
Initial Public Offering on the 
London Stock Exchange
On 10 December 2003, Vedanta Resources plc
became the first major Indian group to achieve a
primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and
on 15 March 2004, the Company was admitted to
the FTSE 250 index. 
The Company issued 130 million Ordinary Shares 
at a price of 390p each, giving net proceeds of
US$825.3 million. These proceeds are being applied
to carry out the strategy which is set out on page 6:
• optimise the performance of the
existing assets;
• finance greenfield growth; 
• consolidate the Group structure; and
• leverage established skills.
Financial Review

Financial Performance
• Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items (“EBITDA”). Our objective is to take advantage of our low cost base
and achieve the best possible margins across the Businesses.
• Earnings per share (“EPS”), stated after exceptional items and the share attributable to minority interests. By producing a rising stream of profits and EPS 
we will be able to pay a progressive dividend to our shareholders.
• Free Cash Flow. T o ensure that the profit generated by our assets is reflected by cash flow in order to fund the future growth and development of the
Company. This is measured after Sustaining Capital Expenditure, tax and interest.
• Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”). The objective is to consistently earn a return (net of tax) above the weighted average cost of capital to ensure that
capital is invested efficiently.

In the Financial Statements, we report our financial
results across our three Businesses; Aluminium,
Copper and Zinc (including Lead). In due course we
will report Alumina as a fourth Business segment.
We intend to provide quarterly production and UK
GAAP information.
Financial Results for the Year Ended 
31 March 2004
Group operating profit was US$237.1 million, an
increase of 107% on the prior year. These excellent
results were underpinned by an outstanding
contribution from the Zinc Business, as well as a
steady increase in profits from the Aluminium
Business whilst operating at close to full capacity.
Copper contributed robust profits despite
challenging TC/RC conditions.

The operating exceptional item was a charge of 
US$13.3 million relating to voluntary retirement
schemes at BALCO and HZL and follows similar
schemes in 2003, also at BALCO and HZL.
The operating profit includes US$14.0 million of
foreign exchange gains on working capital balances
that were largely offset by charges of US$9.9 million
relating to the Reward Plan (see note 22) and against
old debtor balances. The foreign exchange gains were
partly reversed in the first two months after the year
end as a result of the weakening of the Indian rupee.
The share of loss in associate is attributable to the
Group’s interest in India Foils Limited. India Foils
Limited management are implementing a
turnaround strategy to return the business
to profitability.
Foreign Exchange and Net Interest
The Group had a net interest expense for the year of
US$1.3 million, including US$14.1 million of foreign 
exchange gains on foreign currency funds held by
the Group. These gains were partly reversed
subsequent to year end. If these gains are excluded,
the Group had a net interest expense of US$15.4
million, a reduction of US$19.6 million on the 2003
charge. This is due to a combination of factors,
including the interest earned on the Listing
proceeds, and lower interest rates arising from
successfully re-negotiating debt facilities to take
advantage of lower Indian interest rates.
Taxation
The Group’s effective taxation rate has risen to
32.6% (2003: 26.1%). The reasons for this increase
are two-fold. Firstly, change in profit mix and lower
tax shelters increased the effective rate of tax, and
secondly, there were two significant unusual tax
items in the year. Of the unusual items, the Group
has foregone a tax deduction of US$1.5 million
for the cost of shares awarded to employees in
recognition of their contribution to the Group’s
development and growth over the period leading 
up to the Listing. In addition, a tax charge of US$5.4
million arose on the purchase of 4.98% of Sterlite
from the Sterlite Employee Welfare Trust (“SEWT”).
The Group has incurred this tax charge but
the profit relating to the charge was eliminated
upon consolidation.
If these two items are excluded, the Group’s effective
tax rate would be 29.6%. 
The cash tax rate of the Group was 24.6% (2003:
32.5%). The future cash tax rate is expected to remain
around this level, benefiting from capital investments. 
Minority Interests
The minority interest charge for the year was 
57.7% of post tax profits. In the first six months 
of the year the charge was 63.3% and this fell to
53.5% in the last six months.
The improvement in the second half of the year arose
from acquiring an additional 18.92% of HZL and the
increased ownership of Sterlite (see pages 19 and 20).
However, full year minority interests of US$90.8
million (2003: US$33.4 million) reflects the significant
improvement in the profitability of HZL, which is
subject to a large effective minority interest (57.3% 
at 31 March 2004).
Profit for the Year
The profit for the year was US$66.6 million against
US$24.5 million in 2003, an increase of 172%
reflecting higher commodity prices, lower costs 
of production and success in simplifying the 
Group structure.

The EPS based on profit for the year was 23.3 US
cents, against 8.6 US cents in 2003. The EPS based
on Underlying Profit rose 106% to 24.5 US cents
in 2004.
To provide a meaningful comparison, the EPS for
both years has been calculated using the total
number of shares in issue immediately after Listing
(286.0 million). Any issue of shares after Listing has
been included in calculating the weighted average
number of shares for 2004. There is no difference
between basic and diluted EPS (see note 10 to the
Financial Statements).
As set out in the Listing Particulars, the Group will
pursue a progressive dividend policy to reflect the
Group’s growth prospects whilst still ensuring an
appropriate level of dividend cover is maintained.
The Board has proposed a dividend of 5.5 US cents
per Ordinary Share in respect of the year ended
31 March 2004, being approximately one third of
the dividend that would have been proposed had
the Group been in existence for the full year (being
16.5 US cents per Ordinary Share).
Future dividends will be paid in August and January,
in approximate proportions of one third and two
thirds of the annual dividend respectively. 
Cash Flow
There was a net cash inflow to the Group of
US$753.4 million as a result of the Listing proceeds
of US$825.3 million.

The higher commodity prices and increased sales
volumes, offset by extended credit given to certain
customers at HZL, have resulted in debtor and stock
cash outflows of US$93.3 million. These outflows were
mostly offset by a higher level of creditors, but when
including the increased level of extended trade credit,
to take advantage of competitive financing, there was
a working capital inflow of US$169.8 million. 
After Sustaining Capital Expenditure of US$64.5million
(2003: US$35.7 million), the Group’ s Free Cash Flow
was US$367.7 million (2003: US$144.2 million). In 
the year ended 31 March 2004, the Group purchased
a new head office in Mumbai (US$13.0 million) and
spent US$15.5 million on a new boiler for the captive
power plant at BALCO. Both of these items are
included in Sustaining Capital Expenditure. The 
Free Cash Flow before the extended credit terms 
for customers and suppliers referred to above was
US$192.5 million.
The acquisitions expenditure includes US$70.5
million to exercise a call option to acquire an
additional holding in HZL and deferred consideration
of US$10.6 million for the acquisition of 20% 
of SOVL in 2003.

of US$2.0 billion, which will deliver a significant
increase in capacity and future earnings.

Expenditure to date on these projects totalled
US$294.3 million with a further US$1.9 billion
outstanding, of which two thirds has been
committed and 80% is to be spent over the 
next two years.
A substantial portion of the estimated project cost
has funding in place and financial initiatives are
ongoing to ensure the completion of all funding
requirements in the near future.
Balance Sheet
Capital Employed 
Capital Employed increased from US$841.3 million
to US$1,000.9 million as a result of the expansion
projects, with partial offset from improved working
capital management.
Benefiting from higher profits, the Group’s ROCE
(net of tax) increased to 16.8% in 2004 against
14.4% last year, comfortably above the Group’s cost
of capital. These continuing strong returns underline
the earnings potential in the Group. In the short
term the major expansion projects at Orissa and
Korba are expected to reduce the Group’s ROCE.
This reduction will be offset to an extent by the
completion of Tuticorin this year and Chanderiya 
and Rampura Agucha next year.

Non-Core Assets
Following the Listing of the Company, the Directors
have identified a number of assets which are
regarded as non-core to the Group’s Businesses.
These assets have a carrying value of approximately
US$65.0 million in aggregate. These are being
actively marketed for disposal and are expected to
realise their book value. The disposal programme is
being closely monitored to maximise realisation.
Minority Interests and Simplification of the 
Group Structure
The minority shareholders’ interests rose modestly to
US$437.1 million. The current year profit attributable
to minority interests of US$90.8 million plus foreign
exchange movements (US$39.4 million) were offset 
by the effect of higher ownership of subsidiary
companies. As shown on page 6, a central pillar of the
Group’ s strategy is to simplify the ownership structure
so as to maximise earnings potential. In the second half
of the year this strategy has progressed as follows:
• Hindustan Zinc Limited (18.92%)
On 12 November 2003, the Group acquired an
additional 18.92% holding in HZL for US$70.5
million, by exercising a call option on the
Government, taking direct ownership to 64.9%
(effective ownership at 31 March 2004 is 42.7%). 
• Sterlite Industries (India) Limited (4.98%)
In January 2004, the Group acquired an additional
4.98% holding in Sterlite from the SEWT (a quasi-
subsidiary) for a consideration of US$58.0 million

with the funds being retained within the Group. 
This increased the Group’ s effective interest in Sterlite 
to 65.8%. 
In April 2004, the Group acquired a further 2.4% 
of Sterlite from the SEWT for a consideration of
US$21.4 million, taking the Group’ s effective holding
to 68.1%.
• Sterlite Industries (India) Limited Rights Issue 
In December 2003 Sterlite initiated a rights issue
that received clearance from SEBI in June 2004. The
terms of this offer were altered to a one-for-two
offer to take account of market developments 
and this has been re-submitted to SEBI for final
approval. The Group has fully underwritten the
issue in support of the strategy to fund expansion
and simplify the Group structure. Completion is
expected in the second half of 2004.
Net Cash/(Debt) and Gearing 
The receipt of the Listing proceeds resulted in the
Group holding net cash of US$422.3 million at 
31 March 2004, compared to US$331.1 million of
net debt in 2003. Therefore, the Group was not
geared at 31 March 2004 (2003: Gearing 39.4%). 
In the medium term, the Gearing ratio is expected 
to peak below 40% in 2006-07 as we invest in the
expansion projects.
The level of gross debt has risen to US$818.9 million
(2003: US$478.0 million) due to the draw down of
new facilities in HZL and BALCO ahead of project
requirements, in line with Indian banking practice.
The debt is largely held by Sterlite, HZL and BALCO,
US$354.2 million, US$132.8 million and US$251.8
million respectively.
The Group had US$1,188.5 million of current asset
investments at 31 March 2004 (2003: US$81.7
million) which is due to holding the Listing proceeds
until they are passed down to subsidiaries, plus the
increased cash balances as a result of the draw down
of facilities as described earlier. These funds will be
progressively utilised to finance investment.

Total shareholders’ funds increased to US$986.1

Critical Accounting Policies 
The Group’s accounting policies are set out in note 2
to the Financial Statements on pages 51 to 56. The
Financial Statements have areas in which a degree 
of judgement and assumption is necessary. The
Directors believe that the following are the critical
accounting policies where judgements and
assumptions may impact the Financial Statements
significantly.
Mining Properties and Leases
Included in mining properties and leases are the
costs of acquiring and developing mining properties
and mineral rights. These are capitalised as tangible
fixed assets in the year in which they are incurred.
Mining properties also include excess purchase
consideration created upon acquisition and allocated
to tangible fixed assets (to the extent that it is
supported by discounted future cash flows). The
excess purchase consideration allocated is the gross
amount with a corresponding credit to minority
interests. These properties are depreciated on a unit
of production basis.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues derived from product sales are recognised
when all significant risks and rewards of ownership
are transferred to the buyer. This generally occurs
when the goods are shipped to customers in
satisfaction of orders.
The Group believes that allowances for doubtful
accounts on product sales are not required as
substantially all of its sales involve payment in cash 
or with bank letters of credit.
Pensions
The Group’s pension schemes are largely defined
contribution schemes, reducing exposure to funding
shortages. The Group has only modest exposures.
Financial Review continued Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004
21
The Group operates a number of pension schemes,
the assets of which are (where funded) held in
separately administered funds. The pension schemes
are generally funded by payments from employees
and the relevant Group companies, taking account
of the recommendations of independent qualified
actuaries. The Group accounts for pension liabilities
under SSAP 24 “Accounting for Pension Costs” , and
provides full transitional disclosure of FRS 17
“Retirement Benefits”.
Restoration, Rehabilitation and 
Environmental Costs
As with all extractive industry entities, the Group’s
operations may cause environmental disturbance
through the development or ongoing production of
a mine or plant. Costs arising from the installation of
plant and other site preparation work, discounted to
net present value, are provided for and capitalised at
the start of each project, as soon as the obligation 
to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged 
to the profit and loss account over the life of the
operation through the depreciation of the asset and
the unwinding of the discount on the provision.
The Group’s Indian mining operations are largely
exempt from restoration costs under Indian
legislation. The Group does not currently provide 
for restoration costs over and above the statutory
requirement. The legal requirements for the
Australian mines have been met and appropriate
provision has been made.
Risk Management Policies 
The Group has risk management policies in place to
assess and manage foreign exchange risk, interest
rate risk and commodity price risk. Of the gross
foreign exchange exposure of US$1,025 million at
31 March 2004 on trade, committed capital
expenditure and financial transactions, a significant
portion was hedged primarily through forward
contracts. The foreign currency exposure on liabilities
was mitigated by significant foreign currency assets
held at the year end. As at 31 March 2004, 53% of
the drawn Indian rupee debt was at fixed interest
rates. Interest rate risk is also evaluated and
mitigated through appropriate financial products. 
On the portion of the Copper Business which does
not benefit from a natural hedge, the Group has in
place a hedging programme primarily through the
use of forward sales and put options. The Group
intends to put in place similar hedging programmes
for Zinc and Aluminium Businesses in 2004-05.
Liquidity
As at 31 March 2004, the Group had current asset
investments of US$1,188.5 million. These are
primarily invested in mutual funds and money
market funds with the highest ratings. The current
asset investments are in Indian rupees, US dollars
and UK pounds sterling and, in line with the
conservative investment policy aimed at complete
capital protection, the pre tax yield per annum in
each of the above currencies is 5.8%, 0.9% and
3.5% respectively.
International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”)
The European Union’s legislative requirement to
report under IFRS, as published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), comes into
effect for accounting periods beginning on, or after,
1 January 2005. The Group will adopt IFRS in full,
and with effect from 1 January 2005.

As one of the largest metals and mining groups
in India and with two mines in Australia, the
Group is committed to managing its business in a
socially responsible manner. The management of
environmental, employee, health and safety and

The Group’s Health, Safety and Environment
(“HSE”) Management Framework
The Board has overall responsibility for the safe,
healthy and environmentally sound management of
the Group’s operations. Each of the sites within the
three Businesses have teams of specialist HSE
managers who, along with site management teams,
focus on HSE risk management and performance
improvement. Each of the Businesses have HSE
policies and management systems. The Group is
making around US$2 billion of capital investment in
new projects at the Tuticorin smelter, Orissa and
Korba, which are supporting improvements in HSE
standards across the Group. 
Environment
The Company aims to reduce the impact of its activities
on the environment wherever feasible. The majority of
sites within the Group are certified to the international
environmental management systems standard
ISO14001 or have planned certification within the
next year (as indicated in the panel below). ISO14001
includes the requirement that environmental impacts
are identified and that there are ongoing programmes
for improvement across key impact areas.
The sites in India work within a regulatory framework
established through the system of environmental
permits and limits set by the Indian State Pollution
Control Board. These require regular reporting on the
monitoring and analysis of various environmental
impacts. Legislative compliance is a minimum
expectation for all sites. 
Significant business drivers such as cost savings,
particularly in energy which is a significant
operational cost, and water usage, especially within
regions susceptible to water shortages, encourage
good environmental performance. Examples of water
saving activities at HZL and energy saving activities
within Sterlite are provided in the top panel on page
24. Several sites, including HZL sites in Rajasthan and
the Group’ s largest copper smelter at Tuticorin, have
policies of zero wastewater discharge from the sites. 
Secure landfill sites designed to high standards have
been developed at these sites. Initiatives are under
way to recycle waste where possible. For example,
HZL has undertaken a pilot study to use smelter slag in
cement production, Sterlite sells gypsum and smelter

during their processes to the cement industry. 
Environmental management training and awareness
is provided through annual environmental awareness
weeks or days for all employees and specialist
environmental training for relevant individuals. 
Health and Safety 
The management of health and safety (“H&S”) is a
core activity for the Group. By its nature, the metal
and mining industry brings with it H&S risks and 
the Group ensures that these risks are monitored
and mitigated through a variety of programmes 
and training within each of the Businesses. H&S
performance is reported and discussed during Board
meetings of the three Businesses. Each site has H&S
managers and committees. H&S is also reported at
meetings of the Executive Committee and the Board. 
Many sites have achieved certification to the
international occupational H&S management system
OHSAS18001, or are planning certification (please
refer to the panel on page 23). This standard requires
H&S risk assessments to be undertaken and action
programmes to be developed. Maintaining the
certifications requires frequent independent
monitoring through compliance audits.
Regular safety reviews are undertaken both internally
and by external advisers, as a result of which action
programmes are developed. Safety awards won by
the Group are highlighted in the panel on page 25. 
All Group Businesses have occupational health
programmes including medical examinations for all
new recruits and regular ongoing medical examinations
for those working in the mines and smelters.
The Group ensures that contractors also comply with
H&S regulations and obliges them to ensure that their
employees are provided with safe working
environmental and safety equipment.
Employees
Employee Consultation and Communication
A number of employee engagement mechanisms are
in place including:
• regular communication meetings with employees at
all levels of the organisation;
• internet sites for Sterlite and HZL launched during
2003, which include facilities feedback;
• structured approaches in several businesses such as
Total Quality Management and T otal Productive
Maintenance which include proactive engagement
with a cross section of employees;
• specific consultation and involvement regarding
major changes to business operations; and
• change management workshops throughout 
the Business.
Unions are not present in all of the Group’ s
Businesses, although all employees have the right to
join a union. Where unions do exist, regular meetings
take place between management and union
representatives.
Corporate Social Responsibility continued
Charter on Corporate Responsibility for Environment Protection (“CREP”)
for Zinc Industries
During 2003 HZL, along with others in the zinc industry, committed to an
environmental charter with the Indian Central Pollution Control Board and the
Ministry of Environment and Forests, establishing levels of environmental
performance beyond legal compliance. Some of the major actions under CREP are:
• halving sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 2006; 
• achieving zero wastewater treatment discharge through 100% recycling by
December 2004 (already achieved by HZL sites); 
• recycling of intermediate and waste materials;
• reducing fugitive dust emissions from vehicles; and 
• developing greenbelt areas around the plant and accommodation areas.
HZL has prepared action plans requiring an investment of Indian rupees 380 million
(US$8.7 million) over the next two to three years to meet the charter commitments.
Preservation of Energy Award for Sterlite
The Confederation of Indian Industry (“CII”) has given Sterlite the National Award for
Excellence in Energy Management for three consecutive years; 2001, 2002 and 2003.
Energy efficiencies have been achieved through a number of technology improvements
such as generating power from steam from the waste heat recovery boilers, installing
sensors on feed conveyors to minimise usage and upgrading of motors.
HZL and the Drive to Minimise Water Use
Rajasthan is a State with scarce water supplies.
With water being a key input to HZL’s
operations, its consumption is a vital element of
HZL’s environmental management programme.
Improvements in water containment, treatment
and recovery have led to reduced water usage at
all HZL sites. The Chanderiya zinc-lead smelter
has achieved over 20% reduction in water use
per million tonnes of zinc produced between
2001 and 2004, whilst the Rampura Agucha
mine has reduced water consumption by over
25% per million tonnes of ore treated in the
same period. All HZL sites in Rajasthan have a
zero discharge of wastewater from their sites.
Water reduction programmes are ongoing. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004

Business Ethics
An ethics policy covering issues such as harassment,
bribery, personal integrity, protection of intellectual
property rights and competition has been circulated
throughout the Group. A training programme
concerning ethics and employee behaviour is in place.
All prospective employees are issued with terms of
employment prior to joining the organisation. These
terms incorporate a code of conduct for employees
which include the prohibition of bribery.
Employee Training
Training is managed at both the Group and Business
level. The Group has recently recruited a Head of
Learning and Development who will be developing
Group-wide training programmes. Each of the
Businesses have a process of identifying and
providing for training needs. Training centres exist
within the Businesses such as the BALCO Learning
Centre and HZL’ s T echnology Institute. 
Equal Opportunities 
There has been a conscious effort to increase the
numbers of women and minority groups that we
employ. This approach has been implemented across
the Group through change management workshops
and a proactive recruitment process. Equal
opportunities and diversity form part of the Group
recruitment policy. 
As part of the Group’ s approach to equal
opportunities, applications from disabled persons are
always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes
of the applicant concerned. The training, career
development and promotion of disabled persons is
expected, as far as possible, to be identical with that
of other employees. In the event of an employee
becoming disabled every effort is made to ensure 
that employment within the Group continues and
that appropriate training is arranged.
Contractors
Contractors working for the Group’ s Businesses are
protected under the Indian Contract Labour Act,
which covers issues such as minimum wages, health
benefits, health and safety and working hours.
Support to Employees’ Families
Many of the employees’ families are supported
through the provision of housing, schools, medical
and recreational facilities in the areas in which the
Group operates. In addition, these facilities provided
for employees and their families are made available
for use by others in the local communities. 
Community
Working with Communities
Working with the communities in which the Group
operates is critical to the ongoing success of its
operations and an important element of the Group’ s
philosophy and culture. 
The Sterlite Foundation is financially supported 
by the Group. The Sterlite Foundation helps
underprivileged young people by providing them
with computer training. The Foundation has set up
230 computer training institutes nationwide. IT
training is also provided to inmates at more than 20
prisons in India. The Foundation is also engaged in
other social improvement programmes.
Group operations bring employment opportunities,
both through direct employment and indirectly
through supporting activities in the local and regional
economies. The Group has a policy of recruiting local
people where possible. 
In addition to the numerous informal routes 
for understanding local community concerns or
needs, Group employees regularly meet with elected
representatives of the local communities. The Group
takes an active role in supporting local needs of
which the following are examples:
HZL
• Contributed Indian rupees 51 million (US$1.1
million) for drought relief work in Rajasthan, 
which included supply of drinking water and the
deepening of wells for surrounding villages, cattle
camps to provide much needed fodder, water and
veterinary services;
• Provided 30% of the funds of around Indian rupees
180 million (US$4.1 million) required for the Mansi
Wakal Project, the
construction of a dam
to supply water for that
region, which will be
completed during 2005; 
Corporate Social Responsibility continued
Safety Awards
In March 2002 Sterlite’s copper smelter at Tuticorin received the British Safety
Council five star award, the first copper smelter in the world to achieve such 
a rating. This builds on a background of safety awards with the Tamil Nadu
Government issuing State level safety awards for the years 1999 and 2000, 
and again in 2003 for the longest accident free period and highest reduction 
in accident rate. 
In September 2003 the National Safety Award was presented to HZL’s Debari
zinc smelter by the Indian Ministry of Labour for outstanding performance in
industrial safety during the year in achieving the longest accident free period. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004
26
• Contributed Indian rupees 63 million (US$1.4
million) for the construction of the HZL Cardiology
Centre in Udaipur. It was inaugurated in April 2003
and is now operated by the Government of
Rajasthan; and
• Contributed Indian rupees 5 million (US$0.1
million) for the construction of a cultural centre in
eastern India.
Sterlite
• Organised mobile health clinics, seven health camps
for families below the poverty line (in which more
than 2,000 people were given free medical care)
and a mega eye camp in association with the
Arvind Eye Hospital in which 120 cataract
operations were performed; and
• Organised self help groups for rural women to
develop skills networks and provide support for 
self-employment. 
BALCO
• Various health initiatives for the local communities
including the donation of Indian rupees 1.4 million
(US$32,000) for construction of a telemedical
centre to provide medical services for 20
surrounding villages, and the provision of free
medical consultation and primary medicines to
8,500 patients across four villages during the year.
This included regular visits by doctors employed by
the Business and the running of a free eye camp in
association with district health authorities, during
which 202 cases of eye diseases were attended
upon and 39 cataract operations carried out; and
• Contributed Indian rupees 10 million (US$0.2
million) to a municipal school project and
construction of a cultural centre in eastern India.
MALCO
• Provision of support for a number of medical 
and health related activities including support to
Gonnur Village maternity ward, a free health camp
at the MALCO township, an AIDS awareness
campaign organised on World AIDS Awareness 
Day and support to the Government with the 
Pulse Polio Programme for local villages; and
• Runs a large school of 2,900 pupils in Mettur
having provided the land and buildings, financial
support and IT equipment.
New Mine Developments and Closures
The Group acknowledges that new mining
developments can be controversial. In establishing 
a mining operation there is frequently a requirement
to purchase land. Any new development including
extensions to existing abstraction or operating 
licences undergoes an impact assessment, which
includes a review of environmental and social impacts. 
Liaison with the elected local community
representative is a critical part of the process of
opening new mines. The Group makes compensation
for any loss of land. This includes the provision of
replacement land paid for by the Group for relocated
families, the building of new villages or infrastructure
such as water provision, healthcare facilities or roads
and the opportunity for employment with the Group
for a member of each family impacted. 
Remediation measures are taken by the Businesses 
on the closure of mines including, as appropriate,
backfilling and replanting. Many of the actions taken
by the Businesses in the past are reflected in new
laws introduced by the Indian Ministry of Mines 
in 2003. The laws require the development and
implementation of mine closure plans. 
Future Plans
Significant improvements in HSE performance have
been made in recent years. However the Group
acknowledges that performance improvement is a
continuing challenge. In particular the Board is keen
to ensure that its performance in the area of
corporate responsibility is of a standard consistent
with international benchmarks set by other leading
mining companies.
HSE management will be further enhanced in the
coming year through the Group Health, Safety and
Environment Committee (the “Committee”) which
was initially chaired by Sir David Gore-Booth and
includes Mr Kaura, the Chief Operating Officer.
Following his appointment to the Board on 14 June
2004, Mr Rodier has agreed to replace Sir David as
Chairman of the Committee. Additionally, two
external specialists are currently being identified to 
sit on the Committee to bring valuable technical
expertise to this Committee. The Committee met for
the first time in June 2004 to review its membership
and to consider its terms of reference for approval by
the Board. This Committee will focus on ensuring
common HSE standards across the Group and that
HSE performance continues to improve. As part of
its proposed terms of reference, the Committee is 
to report to the Board on a quarterly basis and to
undertake regular operational reviews at each of 
the key Businesses. A Group HSE Manager has been
appointed to drive and facilitate the coordination 
of HSE performance across the Group. 
Our objective will be to expand the information
about HSE published within our disclosures on
Corporate Social Responsibility in future years.

Corporate Governance Philosophy
The Company and its quoted subsidiaries believe in conducting their affairs in a fair and transparent manner
and in maintaining the highest ethical standards in their dealings with all their constituents. The Board is
committed to following good corporate governance practices and regularly reviews its systems and
procedures to achieve higher standards in corporate governance.
Compliance Statement
The Company issued a statement on compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of “The Combined
Code Principles of Good Corporate Governance and Code of Best Practice” issued by the Financial Services
Authority (the “Previous Code”) at the time of its Listing in December 2003. As part of that disclosure it also
reported on its intended compliance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the
Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 (the “Revised Code”) which largely incorporates the
recommendations of the Higgs Report and will apply to the Company in respect of the period commencing
on 1 April 2004. This report sets out the Company’s position in relation to compliance with the Previous Code
and indicates the steps that have been taken, or which it is intended be taken during 2004 to achieve
compliance with the Revised Code. 
During the period prior to Listing, the Group underwent an intensive period of preparation in order to become
compliant with the provisions of the Previous Code. Consequently, with the exception of the appointment of
a Senior Independent Director which has since been made, during the period from the Company’s admission
to trading on the London Stock Exchange on 10 December 2003 to 31 March 2004, the Board considers that
the Group has complied with the provisions set out in the Previous Code.
Directors
Board of Directors
The Board is responsible for providing entrepreneurial leadership, setting the Group’s strategic objectives and
key policies, ensuring that appropriate resources are in place to enable the Group to meet its objectives and
overseeing the Group’s internal control systems. The Board has an agreed schedule of matters reserved to it
and has instructed its Businesses that decisions on these matters may not be taken without the approval of
the Board. The Chief Executive and Finance Director, supported by the Executive Committee, which consists
of the senior executives who head up the Group’s principal operations and functions in India, have overall
responsibility for the executive management of the Group. The biographies of the Directors and members
of the Executive Committee appear on pages 27 and 28.
The Board consists of a Non-executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and four Non-executive Directors.
Since Listing two new Non-executive Directors have been appointed and Mr Chidambaram, a Non-executive
Director appointed prior to Listing, has resigned following his appointment as Finance Minister in the new
Government of India. Procedures have been established to allow the Directors to obtain independent
professional advice in pursuance of their duties as Directors of the Company. 
Prior to Listing, the Board established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nominations
Committee. The terms of reference of these committees comply with the provisions of the Previous Code, but
are being reviewed by the applicable committee to ensure that they reflect the recommendations of the
Revised Code where appropriate. The revised terms of reference will be submitted to the Board for approval in
the second half of 2004. After their approval by the Board, the terms of reference of the committees of the
Board will be available on the Company’s website. 
The Company has recently established a Health, Safety and Environment Committee (“HSE Committee”)
which met for the first time in June 2004. It is now chaired by Mr Rodier and includes the Chief Operating
Officer, Mr Kaura. External HSE specialists will be appointed to the HSE Committee in due course. The Board
has requested that the HSE Committee prepare terms of reference for itself for the Board to approve by
31 December 2004.
Chairman, Senior Independent Director and Chief Executive
Separate individuals have been appointed to the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive. Mr Gilbertson
was appointed Chairman of the Company on 4 December 2003 and Mr Agarwal became the Chief Executive
of the Company on 27 November 2003. 
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the working of the Board, and sets the agenda and timing of
meetings in consultation with the Chief Executive and Company Secretary. The Chairman also liaises with the
Chief Executive on the Group’s international development outside India. The Chief Executive is responsible for
the running of the business and for implementing Board strategy and policy, with particular focus on delivery
of the Group’s major expansion projects in India within the approved budget and timescale. 
In compliance with the requirements of the Previous Code and the Revised Code, Mr Fowle has been
appointed as Senior Independent Director with effect from 14 June 2004. As such, his primary duty is to
ensure that the views of each Non-executive Director are given due consideration in Board discussions. Other
responsibilities of the post include the authority to call a meeting of the Non-executive Directors in the
absence of the Chairman and to conduct periodic performance appraisals of the Chairman. 
Corporate Governance Report Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004

Board Balance
At the time of Listing, the Board consisted of a Non-executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and three
independent Non-executive Directors, thus fulfiling the recommendations of the Previous Code that at least
one third of the Board should be Non-executive Directors, the majority of whom should be independent of
management and free from relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect,
their independent judgement. 
Prior to Listing, the Board recruited Non-executive Directors with a breadth of skills and experience to support the
Executive Directors in implementing the Group’ s strategy of developing and consolidating its position both in the
Indian market and further afield. In particular, the Board sought specialist knowledge on the Indian economy and
international expertise in mining and the political environment. The Board has continued this approach by the
appointments of Mr Naresh Chandra and Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier both of whom bring considerable international
experience to the Board, whilst also strengthening its independence. The Board considers that all of the Non-
executive Directors are independent of the Company as defined by the Revised Code. 
In addition to his appointment as a Non-executive Director, Mr Rodier has been appointed to the Audit
Committee (to replace Mr Gilbertson who has subsequently stepped down from that Committee).
Furthermore, Messrs Rodier, Fowle and Chandra have been appointed to the Nominations Committee to
ensure that the majority of the members of this Committee are independent of the Company. Mr Chandra has
also joined the Remuneration Committee. As a result of these appointments, the Company complies with the
Revised Code in relation to the constitution of the Board and the committees of the Board. 
On 5 December 2003, Volcan Investments Limited and the Company entered into an agreement (the
“Relationship Agreement”) to regulate the ongoing relationship between them. The principal purpose of the
Relationship Agreement was to ensure that the Group is capable of carrying on its business independently of
Volcan, the Agarwal Family and their associates. Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement, the Board and
Nominations Committee will at all times comprise a majority of Directors who are independent of Volcan and
the Agarwal Family and the Remuneration and Audit Committees shall at all times consist only of Non-
executive Directors. Volcan is entitled to nominate for appointment as Director such number of persons as is
one less than the number of Directors who are independent of Volcan, the Agarwal Family and their associates.
Volcan has not exercised that right. Although this method of appointment, if implemented, would not comply
with the requirements of the Revised Code, the Relationship Agreement specifies that it is intended that the
composition of the Board and committees of the Board should comply with the Revised Code. 
The Company has issued a code relating to dealing in its shares, which is based on, and is no less exacting than,
the Model Code published in the Listing Rules. The code has been applied to the Directors and relevant
employees of the Group.
Supply of Information
The Board has met five times since Listing, with the meeting at the end of February 2004 being held at
the offices of HZL in India. The Board is scheduled to meet seven times a year on average, with additional
meetings being called if required. Given that the majority of the Group’s activities are undertaken in India,
the Board plans to hold two meetings a year in India and the remainder in the UK.
In the period since Listing, the Board has approved policies and procedures to ensure that the Directors receive
information at least four working days prior to a meeting of the Board to allow sufficient time for Directors
to be fully briefed. The Board has also approved an agreed format for the content of papers prepared for the
Board, to ensure the Directors receive relevant but sufficiently detailed information to enable them to obtain
a thorough understanding of the matters to be discussed by the Board. Since Listing, the Board has also
approved policies and procedures relating to financial reporting, capital expenditure, treasury and investor
relations such that the Board receives regular reports on these matters from the Executive Committee.
All of the Directors have access to management, in particular to the Company Secretary, and to such
information as they may require to fulfil their duties and responsibilities fully and effectively. The Company
Secretary is also responsible for ensuring the Directors receive timely and relevant information on matters
arising between meetings of the Board.
Each of the Group’s principal subsidiaries have management committees appointed by the board of directors
of the relevant company, which meet on a monthly basis. At least one member from each of these
management committees is also a member of the Executive Committee to ensure that the Executive
Committee and the Board are properly informed about the Group’s performance. 
Appointments to the Board, Training and Evaluation
The Nominations Committee is responsible for regularly reviewing the size and composition of the Board
generally and, in particular, the balance between Executive and Non-executive Directors. The Nominations
Committee is also responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the membership of committees
of the Board. Under its terms of reference, the Nominations Committee will recommend the appointment or
re-appointment of Directors to the Board. 
Corporate Governance Report continued Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004
31
Through the process of appointing the two new Non-executive Directors since Listing, the Nominations
Committee has established a precedent process for Board appointments which it considers to be formal,
rigorous and transparent. This process includes a review of the skills, experience and knowledge of the
existing Non-executive Directors, and assessing which of the potential candidates identified on an agreed
shortlist would most benefit the balance of the Board. The Nominations Committee met the two recently
appointed Non-executive Directors prior to their appointments and it was unanimous in its recommendations
to the Board concerning their appointments.
The Executive Directors’ service agreements and terms of appointment for the Non-executive Directors are
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
When the Directors attend Board meetings in India, a visit to a major operation of the Group is also arranged
which provides them with the opportunity to view the Group’s assets and to meet with employees. During the
Board visit in February 2004, the Directors also visited the BALCO operation at Korba in order to review the
expansion of the aluminium smelter and to meet employees responsible for that project. 
The Board is currently assessing the most appropriate procedures for providing formal induction and training
for the two new Non-executive Directors that will take into account their existing qualifications and
experience. These procedures will include, as a minimum, visits to the Group’s significant operations and
meetings with senior members of management and the Company’s brokers and auditors. The Company is
also arranging a suitable training programme for the Non-executive Directors which will cover the legal and
regulatory aspects of being a director of a UK listed company. The Board will agree its approach to
performance evaluation and succession planning for Directors during the second half of 2004.
Re-appointment 
The Company’ s articles of association require Directors appointed by the Board during the year to offer
themselves for re-appointment at the first AGM following their appointment. Consequently, Messrs Chandra
and Rodier, having been appointed Directors since Listing, will offer themselves for election at the AGM of the
Company due to be held on 29 July 2004 at the City Conference Centre, 80 Coleman Street, London EC2R 5BJ
at 12 noon. Biographical information about the Directors is set out on page 27. Mr Gilbertson’ s initial
appointment as Chairman of the Company will expire at the AGM. 
There is also a process of rotation which ensures that no Director holds office for more then three years without
being re-appointed. Accordingly, at least one-third of all Directors are required to retire and seek re-appointment
at each subsequent AGM. Accordingly, Mr Agarwal and Sir David Gore-Booth will retire by rotation at the
forthcoming AGM and offer themselves for re-appointment. No Director will serve for more than three years
without being proposed for re-appointment at an AGM 
Remuneration
The Remuneration Report, providing a statement on the Company’ s policy on Directors’ and senior managers’
remuneration, benefits, share scheme entitlements and pension arrangements is set out on pages 34 to 40.
Aresolution to approve the Remuneration Report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
The Remuneration Report sets out the status of the Company’ s compliance with the requirements of both the
Previous Code and the Revised Code with regard to remuneration matters.
Accountability and Audit
Financial Reporting and Going Concern
In presenting the annual and interim financial information and similar significant publications, the Board aims
to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’ s position and prospects. Such assessment
is provided in the Chairman’ s Statement and Chief Executive’ s Review set out on pages 4 to 14, and in the
Financial Review on pages 16 to 21. The respective responsibilities of the Directors and the external auditors are
set out on pages 45 and 46.
The Board has adopted the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements, as the Directors have a
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. This expectation is based on the most recently approved funding plan which reflected the
2004-05 budget and forecasts beyond 31 March 2005, the use of the net proceeds of US$825 million raised at
the time of Listing, and the delivery of the US$2 billion capital expansion programme. The funding plan also
reflected the committed borrowing facilities available to the Group. The Board also took into account potential
contingent liabilities and other risk factors as interpreted by the “Guidance on Going Concern and Financial
Reporting for Directors of Listed Companies registered in the United Kingdom”, published in November 1994.
Corporate Governance Report continued Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004

Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s internal control framework and for reviewing its effectiveness. At the
time of the Listing, the Board received reports on key areas of risk within the Group, both from management
and the Company’s professional advisers who assisted with the Listing. These risks were summarised in the
Listing Particulars dated 5 December 2003. That review embraced the requirements of the Previous Code
relating to internal control as set out in “Internal Control Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code”
produced by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (the “Turnbull Guidance”).
Each of the Group’s principal subsidiaries have in place procedures to ensure that sufficient internal control
is maintained. These procedures include a monthly meeting of the management committee and a quarterly
meeting of the audit committee of that subsidiary. These committees are appointed by the board of directors
of the relevant company.
The Group’s internal audit activity is managed through the Management Assurance department and is an
important element of the overall process by which the Board obtains the assurance it requires that risks are
being properly identified, managed and controlled. It also provides assurance on the effectiveness of relevant
internal controls. The scope of work, authority and resources of the Management Assurance department are
periodically reviewed by the Audit Committee and its work is supported by the services of leading
international accountancy firms, other than the Group’s external auditors. Audit plans have been approved by
the Audit Committee and significant findings of internal audit are reviewed periodically by the Audit
Committee. The Audit Committee has reviewed the level of internal audit resources within the Group and
believes that it is appropriate to the Group’s size. 
The Company is currently undertaking a formal risk management process which involves a formal
comprehensive review to identify and prioritise risks throughout the Group. Existing control strategies are
also being reviewed for each of the identified and prioritised risks.
The principal aim of the system of internal controls is the management of risks that are significant to the
fulfilment of the Group’s business objectives. The internal control systems have been designed to manage
rather than to eliminate risk and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
Since Listing, the Directors have continued to review the system of internal control and are satisfied that up to
the date of approval of this Annual Report, the Group has an ongoing process for identifying, managing and
evaluating risks which meets the Turnbull Guidance.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board recognises that its primary role is to represent and promote the interests of its shareholders and that
it is accountable to shareholders for the performance and activities of the Group.
The interim and annual reports remain the primary means of communicating with the Company’ s shareholders.
At the time of the Listing, the Company launched a website (www.vedantaresources.com) on which press
releases, financial reports and other information are posted. The Company recognises the importance of
electronic communication and is currently redesigning the website to ensure a greater range of information is
made available to shareholders.
The Company recently appointed a Head of Investor Relations, Mr John Smelt, to facilitate effective
communications between the Board and the Company’ s major institutional shareholders. The Board is briefed
on the Company’ s relationship with its institutional shareholders on a regular basis.
A series of roadshow presentations were made to analysts and major shareholders prior to, and after, Listing.
The principal objectives behind these presentations were to illustrate the strength of the existing assets within
the Group and to explain the core strategy underpinning the Listing. An analysts’ trip was organised in April
2004 which involved visits to some of the Group’ s key operations in India and meetings with senior members of
management.
The Company will announce its results on a quarterly basis and analysts presentations will be made following
the release of the interim and year end results. The Chief Executive and Finance Director are available to meet
with shareholders during the year. The Chairman and, if appropriate, the Senior Independent Director are
available to discuss issues and concerns of major shareholders. Contact with the Chairman and/or the Senior
Independent Director may be made directly or through the Head of Investor Relations.
Corporate Governance Report continued Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004

Shareholders are also provided with the opportunity to ask questions of the Board, including the chairmen of
the various committees, and to present their views at the forthcoming AGM. Separate resolutions will be
proposed on each substantially separate issue put before the meeting. A presentation will be given on the
performance of the Group prior to the formal business of that meeting.
Board Committees
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr Fowle, whose financial experience is described in the biographical
details set out on page 27. Its other members are Mr Rodier and Sir David Gore-Booth. Mr Rodier replaced
Mr Gilbertson as a member of the Audit Committee on 14 June 2004. The Audit Committee, which is
scheduled to meet at least four times a year, has met three times since Listing. Provision is made for
representatives from both the internal and external auditors to attend meetings of the Audit Committee, and
to discuss issues with Audit Committee members without any executive management present.
The Audit Committee has responsibility for the review of the Group’s interim and annual reports, prior to their
submission to the Board for approval. The Audit Committee also reviews the Group’s internal and external
audit activities and monitors compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for financial reporting.
The Audit Committee also receives regular assurance reports from internal and external audit on the
operational effectiveness of matters related to risk management and internal control, and reviews the
timeliness and the effectiveness of corrective action taken by management.
Audit committees exist in each of the Group’s principal subsidiaries which meet on a quarterly basis and
comprise a majority of independent non-executive directors as required by Indian corporate governance
requirements. The external and internal auditors attend these audit committees. The Group’s Audit
Committee is currently establishing procedures to ensure that issues considered by the audit committees of
the Group’s quoted subsidiary companies in India are escalated to the Group’s Audit Committee on a timely
and relevant basis.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee was chaired by Mr Chidambaram until his resignation as a Director on 22 May
2004. Since that date the Remuneration Committee has been chaired by Sir David Gore-Booth and its other
members are Messrs Chandra and Fowle. Mr Chandra was appointed to the Committee on 14 June 2004.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and Head of Human Resources attend Remuneration Committee meetings at
the invitation of the Committee chairman. The Remuneration Committee has met three times since Listing.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the Group’s
policy on remuneration of Executive Directors and senior managers and for the determination, within agreed
terms of reference, of specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors. Further information
on the activities of the Remuneration Committee is set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 40.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is chaired by Mr Gilbertson and its other members are Messrs Agarwal, Chandra,
Fowle and Rodier. Mr Chidambaram was a member of the Nominations Committee until his resignation as a
Director on 22 May 2004, and Messrs Chandra, Fowle and Rodier were appointed to the Committee on 14
June 2004. The Nominations Committee has responsibility for nominating candidates to fill Board vacancies
and making recommendations to the Board on Board composition and balance. It has met once since Listing
to consider the shortlist and appointment of new Non-executive Directors.
Health, Safety and Environment Committee
The Company has recently established a Health, Safety and Environment Committee (‘‘HSE Committee’’).
The HSE Committee is chaired by Mr Rodier and the Chief Operating Officer, Mr Kaura, is also a member. The
Company is currently seeking two external specialists to sit on the HSE Committee who will bring valuable
technical expertise to this Committee. HSE representatives from each of the Group’ s principal subsidiaries
attend Committee meetings at the invitation of the HSE Committee chairman. The HSE Committee will meet
not less than four times a year and have responsibility for formulating and recommending to the Board the
Group’ s policy for HSE issues as they affect the Group’ s operations. The HSE Committee will focus particularly
on compliance with national and international standards and legislation to ensure that an effective system of
HSE standards, procedures and practices is in place at each of the Group’ s operations. The HSE Committee also
has responsibility for investigating any incidents or accidents that might occur in order to assess whether policy
improvements are required. The ultimate responsibility for establishing HSE policy will remain with the Board.
Executive Committee 
The Executive Committee comprises such Executive Directors and senior management of the Group as the
Chief Executive recommends and the Board approves. The Committee meets on a monthly basis and is chaired
by Mr Anil Agarwal. Its other members are Messrs Sydney-Smith, Navin Agarwal, Jain, Kaura and Palani Kumar.
The respective roles of the members of the Executive Committee are described in the biographical details set
out on pages 27 and 28.

Introduction 
The Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policies and practices adopted by the Company since its
Listing in December 2003 in respect of the Executive Directors, the key operational and functional heads
within the Group whose remuneration falls within the remit of the Remuneration Committee (the “Senior
Management Group”) and the Non-executive Directors. Since Listing, the Company has complied with the
relevant provisions of the Previous Code and has taken steps to ensure that its policy and practices in relation
to Directors’ remuneration are compliant with the Revised Code, which has applied to the Company since
1 April 2004.
The Group’s operations, primarily located in India, have grown through acquisition so that today the Group
employs over 12,500 people. This number will increase further as the Group continues with its US$2 billion
investment programme. The Group has progressively sought to develop the capability of its senior
management team over the past few years. Consequently, the Committee regards the recruitment, retention
and incentivisation of the Senior Management Group as a whole, most of whom are located in India, as
critical to ensuring the successful management of the Group’s activities and implementation of the Group’s
strategic priorities. 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the
“Regulations”). Part II of this report contains the information on which the auditors are required to report to
the Company’s members. 
PART I
Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”)
The Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for recommending remuneration policy to the Board
and setting the remuneration packages for the Senior Management Group. The Committee’s role is to set
levels of remuneration to attract and retain Executive Directors, other members of the Senior Management
Group and the Chairman. The Committee’s aim is to ensure that the Executive Directors and members of the
Senior Management Group are rewarded for their contribution to the Group and are motivated to enhance
the return to shareholders. 
The Committee was formed on 11 November 2003 shortly before Listing and its members at that time were
Mr Chidambaram (Chairman) and Sir David Gore-Booth. Mr Fowle joined the Committee upon his appointment
to the Board on 14 November 2003. Messrs Gilbertson and Agarwal, in their respective capacities of Chairman
and Chief Executive, attend the meetings by invitation. On 22 May 2004 Mr Chidambaram resigned as a
Director. Sir David Gore-Booth was appointed Chairman of the Committee in place of Mr Chidambaram and
Mr Chandra was appointed to the Committee on 14 June 2004.
No Director plays a part in any discussions about his own remuneration.
The Committee has a responsibility to monitor trends in executive pay throughout the Group and, therefore,
it has involved Mr Venkatesh (Head of Human Resources) and Mr Agarwal in determining the remuneration
and benefits offered to the Senior Management Group in general during the period. 
In addition, independent advice on executive remuneration and share schemes was received from
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP following their appointment by the Committee and who provided no other
services to the Company in the UK during the year. The Indian associate firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers
provided internal assurance services to the Group during the year. The Australian associate firm of
PricewaterhouseCoopers are the external auditors to one of the Group’s operating companies in Australia,
Thalanga Copper Mines Pty Limited.
The Committee’s terms of reference, along with the terms of reference of the other Board committees, are
currently being reviewed to ensure that they reflect the recommendations of the Revised Code. Upon
completion of this review, the terms of reference of all the Board committees will be available on the
Company’s website.
Remuneration Policy 
The policy of the Committee is to reward the Senior Management Group competitively, enabling the Group to
recruit, motivate and retain executives of high calibre, whilst avoiding paying excess remuneration. The
Committee is particularly concerned to ensure that the members of the Senior Management Group are
motivated and incentivised to continue to perform at high levels. To this end, the Group strives to recruit
senior managers with strong track records in multinational companies, both in India and the UK, and to
remunerate them appropriately. In setting the remuneration policy for the Senior Management Group, the 
Remuneration Report Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004
35
Committee takes into account:
• the levels of remuneration throughout the Group;
• the market practices prevailing in the countries in which the senior managers work; and
• the market practices in the Indian mining and industrial sectors (in respect of operational management) and
in all sectors (in respect of corporate and supporting functions). 
The Committee attempts to align the interests of the Senior Management Group with those of the
shareholders, by linking share and cash incentives to corporate performance. Therefore, the remuneration
packages of the Senior Management Group comprise:
• a basic salary for day-to-day performance of duties;
• an annual bonus as an incentive to meet short term goals;
• awards under the long term incentive plan referred to below in order to incentivise long-term and strategic
performance; and 
• benefits in kind in accordance with local market practice.
In addition, certain members of the Senior Management Group (excluding the Executive Directors) received
awards under the Reward Plan, which was used solely to provide awards on Listing as a reward for employees
who had significantly contributed to the Company’s development and growth over the period leading up
to Listing.
Basic Salaries, Pensions and Other Benefits
Basic Salaries
Basic salaries for the Executive Directors are established by reference to those prevailing in the employment
market for company directors in the mining sector and for companies in the FTSE 250 Index. In India salaries
for members of the Senior Management Group are set by reference to those positions of comparable status,
skills and responsibility in the metals and mining industries, and in the manufacturing and engineering
industries more generally. Salaries for members of the Senior Management Group utilising specialist
professional knowledge are set by reference to the prevailing levels of pay for executives in similar roles in
companies of similar size, scope of activities and geographical location.
Salaries are reviewed on an annual basis and changes will generally be implemented with effect from 1 April
each year taking into account the period of service during the year. In view of the weak share price since
Listing, the Chief Executive has waived any salary increase for the year ending 31 March 2005, as well as any
bonus entitlement in respect of the year ended 31 March 2004. The Finance Director received an increase to
his basic salary effective from 1 April 2004 taking his basic salary to £250,000 per annum.
Pensions
The Company does not currently provide pension benefits to the Executive Directors or any of the UK-based
employees and this is reflected in the determination of the overall remuneration packages for those members
of the Senior Management Group. The members of the Senior Management Group based in India are entitled
to membership of the Central Provident Fund and Superannuation Scheme which provide pension benefits
consistent with local market practice.
Benefits in Kind
Benefits in kind provided to the Executive Directors and UK-based employees are private medical insurance,
permanent health insurance and life assurance cover. Similar benefits are provided to other members of the
Senior Management Group based in India in line with local market practice. The Chief Executive is also
provided with a car and a driver for business use and the exclusive use of a Company-owned house on his
frequent business visits to India.
Annual Bonus 
The Company operates an annual bonus scheme providing the Senior Management Group with an
opportunity to earn a cash amount based on the achievement of demanding annual performance targets and
will be set by the Committee prior to the commencement of the financial year over which performance will be
measured. The annual bonus is non-pensionable.
The maximum bonus payable to the Chief Executive and Finance Director is 100% of salary. As noted above,
the Chief Executive has waived any bonus entitlement for the reporting period. The bonus payable to the
Finance Director was £20,000, which equated to 33% of basic salary earned in the period from Listing to
31 March 2004. The bonus was discretionary in nature as pre-defined bonus criteria had not been set in place
at the time of Listing. The bonus payable reflected the contribution made by the Finance Director leading up
to and after the Listing, as judged by the Committee.
Remuneration Report continued Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004
36
In addition, the Finance Director was contractually entitled to a retention bonus of £30,000 in recognition of
his services prior to Listing. This bonus was included in the terms of his service contract.
With effect from 1 April 2004, the payment of the annual bonus is dependent on the achievement of a
combination of individual and corporate objectives, which closely correlate to the responsibilities of the
Director and the Group budget for the following year.
Employee Share Schemes
The Group aims to provide superior rewards for outstanding performance and a high proportion of “at risk”
remuneration for Executive Directors and senior employees. Consequently, on Listing, the Company
introduced three employee share schemes. 
The Vedanta Resources Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The Committee intends that the LTIP will be the primary arrangement under which share-based incentives will
be provided to Executive Directors and senior management. Awards were made under the LTIP on 26 February
2004 and further awards are expected be made on an annual basis following the announcement of the
Group’s results.
The maximum value of shares that can be conditionally awarded to an Executive Director in a year is 100% of
annual basic salary. The maximum value of shares that can be awarded to members of the Senior
Management Group (other than the Executive Directors) is calculated by reference to the balance of basic
salary and share-based remuneration consistent with local market practice.
The performance condition attaching to outstanding awards under the LTIP is that the Company’s
performance, measured in terms of Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) (being the movement in a company’s
share price plus reinvested dividends), is compared over a three-year period with the performance of the
companies constituting the FTSE Worldwide Mining Index (excluding precious metals) from the date of grant.
The extent to which an award vests will depend on the Company’s TSR rank against the comparator group at
the end of the three-year performance period. The vesting schedule is shown in the table below, with straight-
line vesting in between the points shown and rounding down to the nearest whole share.
Vedanta’s TSR Performance against Index % of Award Vesting
Below median 0
At median 40
At or above upper quartile 100
The performance condition will be measured by taking the Company’s TSR over the four weeks immediately
preceding the date of grant and over the four weeks immediately preceding the end of the three-year
performance period and comparing its performance with that of the comparator group described above. The
calculation will be carried out on behalf of the Committee by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . The Committee
considers that this performance condition, which requires that the Company’s total return has out-performed
the mining sector, provides a reasonable alignment of the interests of the Senior Management Group with
those of the shareholders. 
No awards will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Company’s TSR performance reasonably reflects
the Company’s underlying financial performance. 
Details of the awards held by the Executive Directors at 31 March 2004 are shown in the table of “Directors’
Long Term Incentive Awards” on page 40. There were no outstanding options or share awards over Company
shares under pre-Listing arrangements held by Executive Directors or other members of the Senior
Management Group at the time of Listing in December 2003.
The Vedanta Resources Share Reward Plan (the “Reward Plan”)
The Reward Plan was adopted for the purpose of rewarding 43 employees (none of whom are Executive
Directors) of the Group who had contributed to the Company’s development and growth over the period
leading up to Listing. It was used solely to provide awards on Listing and no further awards will be granted
under the Reward Plan.
Under the Reward Plan, awards were made in respect of 776,000 shares on 26 February 2004 and vest in two
installments: half of the award vested immediately and the shares were receivable upon the payment of their
nominal price of the shares within one month of the date of award and the other half will vest on the first
anniversary of the date of award (subject generally to the employees’ continued employment at that date)
and the relevant shares will be receivable on payment of the nominal value of the shares within one month
of that date. Awards made under the Reward Plan are not subject to performance conditions as these are
considered to be rewards for past service rather than incentives for future performance.
Remuneration Report continued Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004
37
The Vedanta Resources Share Option Plan (the “Share Option Plan”)
The Share Option Plan was adopted to provide maximum flexibility in the design of incentive arrangements
over the long term. However, at this stage, it is not intended that share options will be granted in the
foreseeable future.
Total Shareholder Return Performance Graph 
The graph below shows the TSR performance of the Company in comparison with that of the FTSE 250 Index
and the FTSE Worldwide Mining Index (excluding precious metals) for the period from 10 December 2003 (the
date of Listing) to 31 March 2004. The FTSE 250 Index has been chosen as a suitable comparator index
because it comprises UK listed companies of similar size and complexity to the Company. The FTSE Worldwide
Mining Index (excluding precious metals) is also presented as it is the comparator group for the LTIP . To provide
more detail the graph is based on a daily moving average rather than on year end dates as required by the
Regulations. The period covered by the graph is short and is not necessarily representative of the Group’s
underlying financial performance over the period since Listing.
Relative Importance of Fixed and Variable Pay
A significant proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors is performance-
linked. Assuming the Executive Directors receive the maximum bonus entitlement and full
vesting of the maximum LTIP awards, the chart to the right demonstrates the balance of
fixed and variable pay in these circumstances for the Executive Directors.
Executive Directors’ Service Contracts 
The Executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with the Company
which took effect from Listing and which in the case of Mr Agarwal may be terminated by
not more than 12 months’ notice. Mr Sydney-Smith’s initial contract of employment was
for a fixed term of 12 months from Listing and would have automatically been renewed
for a further period of 12 months unless terminated by either party giving three months
notice to the other at any time during the Employment as defined therein. Mr Sydney-
Smith’s contract of employment has subsequently been amended so that it may be
terminated by not more than 12 months’ notice.
Both Executive Directors have provision in their contracts for payment to be made in lieu of notice equal to 
(i) in the event of the Chief Executive’s departure, basic salary and costs to the Company for providing certain
benefits during the notice period or part thereof; and (ii) in the event of the Finance Director’s departure, basic
salary and bonus during the notice period or part thereof. There are no other provisions for compensation to
be paid on early termination of either contract.
Non-executive Directors’ fees
In setting the fees of Non-executive Directors, the Board has taken into account the complexity of the
Company, the significant travel and time commitment required for attending Board and other meetings in
India and the unusual risk profile of an Indian company listed in the UK. The Board reviews Non-executive
Directors’ fees annually.

Non-executive Directors’ fees are made up of three elements:
Base fee £50,000
Committee membership fee Up to £5,000 (depending on the scope of the Committee)
Committee chairmanship fee Up to £20,000 (depending on the scope of the Committee)
Chairman’s Fees
The Chairman’ s fees are approved by the Board (without the Chairman being present) on the recommendation
of the Committee and the Chief Executive, who take advice on market fee levels in comparable companies.
Mr Gilbertson is entitled to a fee of £350,000 per annum. The Company has agreed to reimburse Mr Gilbertson
for up to half his costs of retaining executive office accommodation other than at the Company’ s offices and
secretarial assistance for the period of his tenure and three months thereafter, although no such costs have
been claimed or paid during the year ended 31 March 2004. The Company also paid £15,000 of costs for 
Mr Gilbertson’ s professional advice in connection with the terms of his appointment.
Non-executive Directors’ Letters of Appointment 
The Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment which may be terminated by either party giving three
months’ notice. All Directors who have been appointed by the Board during the period since Listing will have
their appointments confirmed at the AGM and one-third of the other Directors will retire and be put forward
for re-appointment at the AGM. The articles of association require one-third of the Directors to retire and be
put forward for re-appointment at each subsequent annual general meeting. Consequently, no Director may
serve for more than three years without being re-appointed. 
There are no provisions in the letters of appointment of the Non-executive Directors or the Chairman for
compensation to be paid in the event of early termination.
Mr Gilbertson has been appointed for a fixed term commencing on Listing and terminating at the Company’s
2004 AGM.

External Appointments
The Board’s policy on external appointments is that an Executive Director may accept one appointment (other
than any Group appointment) as non-executive director of a publicly listed company anywhere and that the
fees for any such appointment may be retained by the individual. Currently, neither of the Executive Directors
holds any such outside appointments, other then Mr Agarwal’s directorships of the Group’s quoted Indian

The dilution limits set out in the rules of the employee share schemes adopted in December 2003 allow up to
an aggregate of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital to be issued or issuable pursuant to awards under
any of the Company’s employee share schemes over a period of ten years. Up to 5% of the Company’s issued
share capital may be used for the Company’s discretionary schemes over a ten-year period. As anticipated in
the Company’s Listing Particulars, shares issued or issuable pursuant to awards made under the Reward Plan
are not counted for these purposes. Currently 0.71% of the Company’s issued share capital is issuable in
respect of outstanding awards under these schemes (including the Reward Plan).

fees and medical and personal insurance in accordance with the rules of Sterlite or as may be agreed to by the

basic salary to compensate Sterlite for this cost.
Sterlite paid a fixed contribution to a service company, Hill Street Services Company Limited, for Mr Agarwal’s
use of office facilities in London. Mr Agarwal was also entitled to the reimbursement of expenses related to
this office by Sterlite.

• the Copper Business, comprising mining, smelting and refining operations; and
• the Zinc Business, comprising zinc-lead mining and smelting operations.

Business Review and Future Developments
The Chairman’s Statement on pages 4 to 5, the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 8 to 14 and the Financial

Financial Results
The audited Financial Statements are presented on pages 47 to 93.
Dividend
In the Listing Particulars of the Company published in December 2003 the Board stated that, in the absence of
unforeseen circumstances, the Directors intended to pay a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2004 of
5.5 US cents per Ordinary Share in August 2004. Given that the financial results for the year are in line with
the Directors’ expectations at the time of Listing, the Directors recommend a final dividend for the year ended
31 March 2004 of 5.5 US cents per Ordinary Share. Subject to the approval of shareholders, the dividend will
be paid on 20 August 2004 to shareholders on the register of members as at 23 July 2004.
Change in the Name of Company
The Company was incorporated on 22 April 2003 as Angelchange Limited. On 26 June 2003, the Company
changed its name to Vedanta Resources Limited. In preparation for Listing, the Company was re-registered as
a public company and changed its name to Vedanta Resources plc on 20 November 2003.
Share Capital
The Company’s authorised share capital on incorporation was £1,000 divided into 1,000 ordinary shares
of £1 each, one of which was issued to the subscriber of the memorandum of association. On 16 May 2003,
the subscriber share was transferred to Volcan, a company which is 100% owned and controlled by the
Agarwal family.
In preparation for re-registration as a public company, the authorised share capital of the Company was
increased to £50,000 by a written resolution of the Company’s members on 13 November 2003 and on 
that date 48,999 shares were allotted and issued to Volcan and 1,000 shares were allotted and issued to
Mr DP Agarwal (the father of Mr Anil Agarwal), each of these ordinary shares being paid up as to one-quarter
of their nominal value.
At an extraordinary general meeting of the Company held on 4 December 2003, the 50,000 ordinary shares
of £1 each in the Company then in issue were redesignated as 50,000 deferred shares of £1 each (“Deferred
Shares”). Concurrently, the authorised share capital of the Company was increased to US$40,000,000
Ordinary Shares and £50,000 Deferred Shares by the creation of 400,000,000 Ordinary Shares. The rights and
restrictions relating to the Ordinary Shares and Deferred Shares are set out in the Company’s articles of
association.
In accordance with an agreement dated 5 December 2003, 156,000,000 Ordinary Shares fully paid were
issued to Volcan on 10 December 2003, the date of Listing, as consideration for the transfer of the entire
issued share capital of Twin Star from Volcan to the Company. On 10 December 2003, 130,000,000 Ordinary
Shares were also issued to public shareholders fully paid under the terms of the Listing.

Annual Report 2004

On 31 March 2004, 388,000 Ordinary Shares were issued as fully paid and allotted to 43 senior executives
within the Group following the exercise of awards under the Reward Plan. Further details of the Reward Plan
can be found on page 36 of the Remuneration Report.
The Company’s authorised share capital as at 31 March 2004 was US$40,000,000 and £50,000, comprising
400,000,000 Ordinary Shares and 50,000 Deferred Shares, respectively. The Company’s issued share capital as
at that date was 50,000 Deferred Shares, one of which has been fully paid and 49,999 of which have been
paid up as to one-quarter of their nominal value; and 286,388,000 Ordinary Shares each credited as fully paid. 
As at the date of this report, there had been no other change to the authorised and issued share capital since
31 March 2004.
The authorised and issued share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2004 is also set out in note 22 to the
Financial Statements.
Reorganisation of the Group
In preparation for Listing, Twin Star, the holding company of the predecessor group, divested a number of
subsidiaries and associated undertakings carrying on businesses which were considered to be non-core to the
Group. These interests, together with certain amounts receivable from such interests and from Mr DP Agarwal,
were transferred to Twin Star International Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Volcan, under an agreement
dated 1 December 2003. Twin Star International Limited is not part of the Group and no transactions have
occurred since the date of Listing between the Group and this company. 
Until 1 December 2003, Vedanta Resources Holdings Limited was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Volcan and
had an issued share capital of £1. On 1 December 2003 the issued share capital of Vedanta Resources
Holdings Limited was transferred by Volcan to the Company for a consideration of £1. On 10 December 2003,
the entire issued share capital of Twin Star was transferred by Volcan to the Company in exchange for the
issue to Volcan of 156,000,000 Ordinary Shares in the Company. Thereafter, the entire issued share capital of
Twin Star was transferred by the Company to Vedanta Resources Holdings Limited in exchange for the issue to
the Company of 10,000 ordinary shares of £1 each in Vedanta Resources Holdings Limited.
Under the terms of the Company’s offer of shares last year, 130,000,000 Ordinary Shares were issued at
£3.90 each. The issue of these shares at £3.90 per share less the nominal value of 10 US cents per share
resulted in the Company crediting US$863.7 million to its share premium account as at 10 December 2003.
Being a newly incorporated company, the Company had no existing distributable reserves. In order to create
distributable reserves, the Company passed a resolution to reduce the share premium account of the
Company by an amount equal to the share premium arising on Listing less an amount of US$70.0 million.
This reduction was sanctioned by the High Court on 10 December 2003 and thus distributable reserves of
US$793.7 million were created. 
After deduction of share issue costs of US$51.4 million which were directly associated with the offering of
shares, the share premium account was US$18.6 million as at 31 March 2004. 
Directors and Directors’ Interests
The names, specific responsibilities and biographical details of the current Board of Directors are shown on
page 27. Under the Company’s articles of association, any Director appointed by the Board must retire at the
annual general meeting following his or her appointment. As the AGM is being held on 29 July 2004,
Directors appointed by the Board since Listing are being put forward for re-appointment. In addition, the
articles of association require that at least one-third of the remaining Directors retire by rotation and seek re-
appointment. Accordingly Mr Agarwal and Sir David Gore-Booth will retire at the forthcoming AGM and offer
themselves for re-appointment to the Board.
The following Directors held office during the year ended 31 March 2004:

Substantial Shareholdings
As at 18 June 2004, the Company has been notified, in accordance with sections 198 to 208 of the
Companies Act 1985, of the following interests in the Ordinary Shares of the Company:
Notification received from No. of Ordinary Shares % of Issued Share Capital
Volcan Investments Limited

154,157,911 53.83%
Ospraie Portfolio Limited 10,163,124 3.55%
Deutsche Bank AG 8,618,982 3.01%

The Company has also been notified that Agnivesh Agarwal and DP Agarwal are indirectly interested in 154,157,911 Ordinary Shares (representing
53.83% of the Company’s issued share capital) by virtue of their beneficial interest in shares in Volcan.
Supplier Payment Policy
The Group does not follow any specific external code or standard on payment terms. Instead, responsibility 
for determining payment terms is delegated to the individual businesses within the Group which take into
account local market and industry practice. As a Group, the policy for determining payment terms is either 
to agree terms of payment at the start of a binding contract or to ensure that the supplier is aware of the
individual business’ usual payment terms. Payment is made in accordance with contractual and other legal
obligations, and reflects local market practices. 
The Company is a holding company and, as such, has few suppliers. Trade creditor days of the Company at
31 March 2004 were 14.5 days. 
Post-Balance Sheet Events
As disclosed in note 34 to the Financial Statements, on 2 April 2004, the Group acquired a 2.4% interest in
Sterlite which was acquired from the Sterlite Employees Welfare Trust for an aggregate consideration of
US$21.4 million. After completing this acquisition, the Company’s direct and effective interests in Sterlite
increased to 62.5% and 68.1%, respectively.
In June 2004, SEBI approved a three-for-ten rights issue by Sterlite. This has subsequently been amended to a
one-for-two rights issue and re-submitted to SEBI for approval. Completion is expected in the second half of
2004, with expected proceeds of US$440 million, net of all costs. The Company has fully underwritten the
rights issue.
Value of Land
Land is carried in the balance sheet at historic cost. It is not practical to estimate the market value of land and
mineral reserves and resources at any one point in time, since the market values depend on commodity prices
which fluctuate on a day-to-day basis.

Directors’ Report continued Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004

United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the
financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements,
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy
at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for the system of internal control,
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004

the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses, the reconciliation of movements in equity
shareholders’ funds and the related notes 1 to 41. These Financial Statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the part of the Remuneration
Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’ s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’ s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, for the report, or the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As described in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Company’s Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards. They are also responsible for the preparation of the other information contained in the Annual
Report including the Remuneration Report. Our responsibility is to audit the Financial Statements and the part
of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom
legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Financial Statements give a true and fair view and whether
the Financial Statements and the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion,
the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the Financial Statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Directors’ Remuneration and transactions with the Company and
other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven
provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Directors’ Report and the other information contained in the Annual Report for the above year as
described in the contents section including the unaudited part of the Remuneration Report and consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the Financial Statements.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the Financial Statements and the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been
audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in
the preparation of the Financial Statements and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
circumstances of the Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
Financial Statements and the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Financial Statements and the part of
the Remuneration Report described as having been audited.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and
the Group as at 31 March 2004 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended, and the Financial
Statements and the part of the Remuneration Report described as having been audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Basis of Preparation
Vedanta Resources plc (“Vedanta” or the “Company”) was incorporated on 22 April 2003 and its Ordinary
Shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange on 10 December 2003 (the “Listing”) having become the
new parent company of the Twin Star Holdings Group, after the group reorganisation of Volcan Investments
Limited (“Volcan”), Vedanta, Vedanta Resources Holdings Limited (“VRHL”) and Twin Star Holdings Limited
(“Twin Star”).
Prior to the Listing the Twin Star Holdings Group comprised Twin Star, a company incorporated and resident in
Mauritius, and its principal operating subsidiaries were Sterlite Industries (India) Limited (“Sterlite”), Bharat
Aluminium Company Limited (“BALCO”), Madras Aluminium Company Limited (“MALCO”) and Hindustan Zinc
Limited (“HZL”). The Twin Star Holdings Group was a wholly owned subsidiary of Volcan. After the Group
reconstruction on 10 December 2003, Twin Star became an intermediate holding company in the Group, with its
underlying investments remaining unchanged, and its immediate parent becoming VRHL, which in turn became
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vedanta. Subsequent to the Listing, Vedanta was 53.9% owned by Volcan.
The accountants’ report for the Twin Star Holdings Group as presented in the Listing Particulars was prepared
on the basis that the disposal of certain assets (being Sterlite Optical Technologies Limited, Sterlite Optical
Technologies Inc, Allumo AG ZUG, Manjiri Finvest Pvt Ltd and Sterlite Gold Limited, together with certain
amounts receivable from these entities and from Mr DP Agarwal) to Twin Star International Limited had taken
effect prior to 1 April 2000.
To provide information which is meaningful to the Company’ s shareholders, the Directors believe that it is
necessary to prepare the accounts on the basis that the Group, excluding the assets sold to Twin Star
International Limited, had existed throughout the two-year period beginning 1 April 2002. The Directors
believe that this information reflects the ongoing operations of the Group more clearly. Vedanta and VRHL’ s
combination with the Twin Star Holdings Group has been accounted for as a group reconstruction under the
provisions of FRS 6 (“Mergers and Acquisitions”) and is presented as if the Company and VRHL had been the
holding company and intermediate holding company, respectively, of the Twin Star Holdings Group for each
year presented. 
Certain balances within the profit and loss comparatives before Group operating profit for the year ended 
31 March 2003 have been reclassified to ensure a consistent presentation in the Group’ s Financial Statements.
Where reclassifications have occurred, these are disclosed in the relevant notes.
As Vedanta was only incorporated on 22 April 2003, the Company balance sheet is presented at 31 March
2004 only and no comparatives are presented.
The consolidated financial information for the Group has been prepared under the historical cost convention
and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
2. Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial information incorporates the Financial Statements of the Company and all its
subsidiaries, being the companies that it controls. This control is normally evidenced when the Group is able to
govern a company’s financial and operating policies so as to benefit from its activities or where the Group
owns, either directly or indirectly, the majority of a company’s equity voting rights.
The principal subsidiaries included in the consolidation are set out in note 40. The abbreviations used
throughout these Financial Statements, in respect of these subsidiaries, are detailed in note 40.
Acquisitions
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from, or to, 
the date on which control passed. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Excess purchase consideration, being the difference between the fair value of the consideration given and 
the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an asset on the balance sheet.
To the extent that such excess purchase consideration relates to the acquisition of mining properties and
leases, that amount is capitalised within tangible fixed assets as mining properties and leases. Other excess
purchase consideration relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised as goodwill within intangible
fixed assets and is amortised over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years. Provision is made for
any impairment. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004
52
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
2. Accounting Policies continued
Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate. The unamortised balance
is reviewed for impairment on a regular basis.
Negative goodwill is similarly included in the balance sheet and is credited to the profit and loss account in 
the periods in which the acquired non-monetary assets are recovered through depreciation or disposal.
Negative goodwill in excess of the fair value of the non-monetary assets acquired is credited to the profit and
loss account through amortisation over the periods expected to benefit.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first post-
acquisition financial statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any
adjustments required to those provisional fair values, and the corresponding adjustments to purchased
goodwill, are incorporated in the financial statements for the first full financial year following the acquisition.
Investments in Associates
In the consolidated Financial Statements, investments in associates, being investments over which the Group
exercises significant influence and normally owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity, are accounted
for using the equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Group’s share of associates’ profits less losses, whilst the
Group’s share of the net assets of the associates is shown in the consolidated balance sheet, based upon the
most recent audited financial statements or unaudited interim financial information.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in associates.
Other Investments
Fixed asset investments, other than investments in subsidiaries and associates, are recorded at cost less
provision for impairment.
Current asset investments primarily comprise bank term deposits, short term unit trusts, liquidity funds and
fixed and floating rate debt securities. These are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Tangible Fixed Assets – Mining Properties and Leases
The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining
properties and mineral rights, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets in the year in which they are incurred. 
When a decision is taken that a mining property is viable for commercial production, all further pre-production
expenditure is capitalised until the mining property is capable of commercial production. From that point,
capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised on a unit of production basis over the total estimated
remaining commercial reserves of each property or group of properties. 
In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are
written off in the period.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable reserves. Changes in the commercial reserves affecting unit of
production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.
Other Tangible Fixed Assets
The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and
non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition
and location for its intended use. Expenditure incurred after the fixed assets have been put into operation,
such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, are normally charged to the profit and loss account in
the period in which the costs are incurred.
Assets in the Course of Construction
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the capital work-in-progress account. Upon completion,
the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of tangible fixed assets. Costs associated
with the commissioning of an asset are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of
operating at normal levels until a period of commissioning has been completed.
Interest payable on borrowings and foreign exchange gains or losses from hedging activities related to
construction or development projects are capitalised until substantially all of the activities that are necessary to
bring the asset into productive use have been completed. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004
53
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
2. Accounting Policies continued
Depreciation
Mining properties and other assets in the course of development or construction, and freehold land, are not
depreciated. Capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised once commercial production
commences, as described in “Tangible Fixed Assets – Mining Properties and Leases”. Leasehold land and
buildings are depreciated over the period of the lease.
Other buildings, plant and equipment, office equipment and fixtures, and motor vehicles are stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated
to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected
useful life, as follows:
Buildings: Operations 30 years
Administration 50 years
Plant and equipment 10 – 20 years
Office equipment and fixtures 3 – 20 years
Motor vehicles 9 – 11 years
Impairment
The carrying amounts of tangible fixed assets, investments in associates, other investments and goodwill are
reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable. If there are indicators of impairment, an assessment is made to determine whether the
asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. Whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its
recoverable amount, an impairment loss is charged to the profit and loss account.
For mining properties and leases, investments in associates, other investments and goodwill, the recoverable
amount of an asset is determined on the basis of its value in use, being the present value of estimated future
cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful
life, discounted using a market-based, risk-adjusted, discount rate.
For other tangible fixed assets, the recoverable amount of an asset is also considered on the basis of its net
realisable value, where it is possible to assess the amount that could be obtained from the sale of an asset in
an arm’s length transaction, less the cost of disposal.
Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the relevant 
cash-generating unit.
Research and Exploration Expenditure
Research and exploration expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred unless a decision is taken
that a mining property becomes viable for commercial production.
Government Grants
Government grants relating to tangible fixed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the profit
and loss account over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. Other grants are credited to the profit
and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
Stocks
Stocks and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less any provision for
obsolescence.
Cost is determined on the following bases: 
• raw materials (including ore and concentrates) and consumables are recorded at cost on a first-in, 
first-out (“FIFO”) basis, except for stores and spare parts which are carried at weighted average cost;
• coal and furnace oil used in the Aluminium Business, and metal and coke stocks are valued at weighted
average cost;
• finished products are valued at raw material cost plus costs of conversion, comprising labour costs and an
attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity; and
• by-products and scrap are valued at net realisable value. 
Net realisable value is determined based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred
to completion and disposal. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004
54
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
2. Accounting Policies continued
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but have not reversed, at
the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future,
or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are
differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements that arise
from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are
recognised in the Financial Statements.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the
periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from
which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to
the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement
to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Pensions
The Group operates a number of pension schemes, the assets of which are (where funded) held in separately
administered funds. The pension schemes are generally funded by payments from employees and the relevant
Group companies, taking account of the recommendations of independent qualified actuaries.
For defined benefit schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs
and other post-retirement benefits is the estimated regular cost of providing the benefits accrued in the year,
adjusted to reflect variations from that cost. The regular cost is calculated so that it represents a substantially
level percentage of current and future payroll. Variations from regular cost are charged or credited to the
profit and loss account as a constant percentage of payroll over the estimated average remaining working life
of scheme members. Differences between amounts charged to the profit and loss account and amounts
funded are shown as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension
costs and other post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments
in the balance sheet.
Details of the pension schemes are provided in note 29. 
Employee Share Awards
The estimated cost of employee share awards made by the Group is charged to the profit and loss account
over the relevant performance period. Where shares are held by an employee benefit trust, the carrying value
of these shares is included within other fixed asset investments, less amounts charged to the profit and loss
account relating to those shares. The estimated cost of awards is the market value of shares awarded or the
intrinsic value of the awards (being the difference between the exercise price of the award and the market
price at the date of grant) adjusted to reflect any applicable performance conditions.
Provisions for Liabilities and Charges
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, as a result of past events, and it is probable
that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation. Provisions
are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Restoration, Rehabilitation and Environmental Costs
An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental
disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mine. Costs arising from the installation
of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to net present value, are provided for and capitalised at
the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the
profit and loss account over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding
of the discount on the provision. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004
55
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
2. Accounting Policies continued
Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is caused on an ongoing basis during production are
provided for at their net present values and charged to the profit and loss account as extraction progresses.
Where the costs of site restoration are not anticipated to be material, they are expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition
Turnover represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties after deducting sales
taxes and duties, and is recognised when all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are
transferred. Dividends are recognised when paid.
Leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments
are not made on such a basis.
Foreign Currency Translation
In the financial statements of individual group companies, transactions in currencies other than the local
functional currency are translated into local currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction or,
where forward exchange contracts are in place, at contractual rates. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in other currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into local currency at year end
exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
For the purposes of consolidation, the results of those entities for whom the US dollar is not the reporting
currency are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange during the period. The related balance
sheets are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation
of the opening net assets and results of such operations, and on foreign currency borrowings to the extent
that they hedge the Group’s investment in such operations, are reported in the consolidated statement of
total recognised gains and losses. All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
The exchange rates applied for the translation of the Group’ s financial information are set out below:
As at As at
US$ Currency rates 31 March 2004 Average 2003/2004 31 March 2003
Indian rupee (INR) 43.39 45.92 47.65
Euro 0.817 0.853 0.926
Australian dollar (A$) 1.312 1.445 1.663
UK pounds sterling (GBP) 0.545 0.591 0.635
Capital Instruments
Ordinary Shares are included in shareholders’ funds. Other instruments are classified as liabilities if they
contain an obligation to transfer economic benefit and, if not, they are included in shareholders’ funds.
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs. The finance cost
recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of capital instruments, other than equity shares, is
allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying value. The carrying
amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in
the period. Convertible debt is reported as a liability unless conversion actually occurs. No gain or loss is
recognised on conversion.
Derivative Financial Instruments
In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters
into forward, option, swap contracts and other derivative financial instruments. The Group does not hold nor
issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group uses the derivative financial instruments described above to reduce exposure to foreign exchange,
interest rate and commodity price risks. The Group considers that its derivative instruments qualify for hedge
accounting when the following criteria are met:
• the instrument is related to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics
have been identified;
• it involves the same currency as the hedged item; and 
• it reduces the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on operations. Vedanta Resources plc
Annual Report 2004
56
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
2. Accounting Policies continued
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and are recognised in the profit and loss account, or as
adjustments to the carrying amount of fixed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in
the Financial Statements. The rates applicable to such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities
or a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a fixed rate to a
variable rate or vice versa. Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest
payable over the period of the contract.
Where commodity option contracts hedge anticipated future production or purchases, the option premiums
paid are amortised over the life of the option and any realised gains and losses on exercise, in the period in
which the hedged production is sold or commodity purchases are made, are recognised.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position
is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss is recognised at that time.

9. Tax on Profit on Ordinary Activities continued
(a) Analysis of Charge for the Year continued
Overview of the Indian Direct Tax Regime
The following is an overview of the salient features of the Indian direct tax regime relevant to the taxation of
the Group:
• Companies are subject to Indian income tax on a stand-alone basis. There is no concept of tax
consolidation or group relief in India.
• Companies are charged tax on profits of assessment years which run from 1 April to 31 March. For each
assessment year, a company’s profits will be subject to either regular income tax or Minimum alternate tax
(“MAT”), whichever is the greater.
• Regular income tax is charged on book profits (prepared under Indian GAAP) adjusted in accordance with
the provisions of the Indian Income T ax Act. T ypically the required adjustments generate significant timing
differences in respect of the depreciation of fixed assets, relief for provisions and accruals, the use of tax
losses brought forward and pension costs. Regular income tax is charged at 35% (plus a surcharge).
• MAT is charged on book profits (prepared under Indian GAAP) but typically with a limited number of
adjustments. MAT is charged at 7.5% (plus a surcharge).
• There are various tax exemptions or tax holidays available to companies in India. The most important to the
Group are:
– The export exemption. For the five years to 31 March 2004, profits earned from export activities can be
exempt. In the year to 31 March 2000, the extent of the exemption was 100% reducing each year to
30% in the final year to 31 March 2004.
– The industrial undertakings’ exemption. Profits of newly constructed industrial undertakings located in
designated areas of India can benefit from a tax holiday. A typical tax holiday would exempt 100% of
the plant’s profits for five years, and 30% for the next five years.
– The power plants’ exemption. Profits on newly constructed power plants can benefit from a tax holiday.
A typical holiday would exempt 100% of profits in ten consecutive years within the first 15 years of the
power plants’ operation. The start of the ten-year period can be chosen by a company.
• Tax is payable in the assessment year to which it relates. 
• Tax returns submitted by companies are regularly subjected to a comprehensive review and aggressive
challenge by the tax authorities. There are appeals procedures available to both the tax authorities and
taxpayers and it is not uncommon for significant or complex matters in dispute to remain outstanding for
several years before they are finally resolved in the High Court or the Supreme Court. Vedanta Resources plc

Minimum alternate tax 0.7 2.8
Adjustments in respect of prior years (4.9) 0.7
Current tax charge for the year 68.8 24.1
The majority of the Group’s profits are earned and taxed in India. During the period the effective tax rate has
been significantly less than the applicable Indian corporate rate of income tax. This is primarily as a result of
the significant tax exemptions (export exemptions, industrial undertakings and tax holidays) which have been
available to shelter profits of Sterlite and HZL from regular income tax. The beneficial effect of these
exemptions on the Group’s rate has been tempered to some extent by the impact of losses in Australia and
IFL, which are not available to shelter profits from tax and disallowed expenditure.
(c) Factors that may Affect Future Tax Charges
The effective tax rate of the Group in future periods is likely to be influenced most significantly by the
following factors:
• the availability of exemptions and tax holidays to shelter profits from regular Indian income tax;
• the potential utilisation of accumulated tax losses of CMT and IFL, the potential benefit of which has 
not been fully recognised as a deferred tax asset; and
• incremental tax costs, if any, of distributing earnings to shareholders through the Group structure. Vedanta Resources plc

The earnings per share (“EPS”) calculation, has assumed that the number of Ordinary Shares in issue immediately
after Listing (being 286,000,000) had been in issue from 1 April 2002. The only other issue of shares subsequent
to the Listing were 388,000 Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the first tranche of awards under
the Vedanta Resources Reward Plan (the “Reward Plan”) on 31 March 2004, and the issue of these shares has
been used in determining the 2004 weighted average number of shares. The Directors believe that this pro-
forma EPS provides a more meaningful comparison of the Group’ s ongoing business than using the statutory EPS
which would only reflect shares issued at the date of Listing. 
The second tranche of awards under the Reward Plan and the oustanding awards under the Vedanta Resources
Long T erm Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) are reflected in the diluted EPS figure through an increased number of
weighted average shares.

The ability of the Group to realise the net book value of mining properties in the future is dependent upon 
the commercial viability of mineral reserves. The Directors are satisfied that the Group’s estimate of the
discounted future net revenues to be derived from such remaining reserves is greater than the net book value
of the mining properties both individually and in aggregate.
As part of the process for the Listing of the Company in December 2003, Steffen Robertson and Kirsten (UK)
Limited, an international engineering consultancy company, undertook an independent review of the
procedures used by the Company to estimate the resources and reserves as at 31 March 2003 according to the
internationally recognised JORC Code (see page 95). The results of their review can be found in Section 10 of
the Company’s Listing Particulars. Vedanta Resources plc

IFL’s debt includes a loan of US$22.6 million with ICICI Bank. There is an option to convert this debt to equity
shares at par value at any time up to the maturity of the loan in 2012. If this option were exercised, MALCO’s
holding in IFL would reduce from 38.8% to 8.7%. As this option has not been exercised, the Group’s interest
in IFL has been accounted for using 38.8%.
During the year ended 31 March 2004, IFL issued preference shares to the value of US$6.3 million to Sterlite
(US$5.5 million) and MALCO (US$0.8 million) for non-cash consideration in full settlement of its liabilities to
these companies at that time.

The Group has accrued significant amounts of deferred tax. The majority of the deferred tax liability represents
accelerated tax relief for the depreciation of capital expenditure, net of losses carried forward by MALCO and
CMT. No benefit has been recognised for excess losses of CMT, TCM and IFL on the grounds that their
successful application against future profits is not probable in the foreseeable future.

amounts paid on such shares after repayment to the holders of Ordinary Shares of the nominal amount paid
up on the Ordinary Shares plus the payment of £100,000 per Ordinary Share.
Initial Public Offering
On Listing, 156,000,000 Ordinary Shares in the Company were issued to Volcan in exchange for its
investment in the Twin Star Holdings Group (as defined in note 1), and 130,000,000 Ordinary Shares were
issued to public shareholders at £3.90.

During the year, the Company repaid share application funds of US$26.2 million that were pending allotment
in SOVL, a subsidiary company. See note 30 for further details.
The investment in Twin Star had a carrying value of US$20.0 million in the accounts of Volcan. As the Company
was not incorporated as at 31 March 2003, and the comparatives are prepared on a pro-forma basis (as disclosed
in note 1), the issued share capital and share premium account of Twin Star have been included in the profit and
loss account reserves as at 31 March 2003. As required by the Companies Act 1985, Section 132, upon issue of
156,000,000 Ordinary Shares to Volcan, Twin Star’ s issued share capital and share premium account have been
eliminated and a merger reserve of US$4.4 million arose, being the difference between the carrying value of the
investment in Twin Star in Volcan’ s accounts and the nominal value of the shares issued to Volcan.
As required by the Companies Act and FRS 4 “Capital Instruments”, the Company wrote off US$51.4 million
of costs incurred as a direct result of the Company’s Listing.
Being a newly incorporated company, Vedanta had no distributable reserves. On 10 December 2003, the High
Court in London sanctioned a capital reduction, under which the share premium account was reduced by
US$793.7 million in order to create distributable reserves. Vedanta Resources plc

23. Consolidated Reconciliation of Movement in Equity Shareholders’ Funds continued
As at 31 March 2004, other reserves comprise the general reserves established in the statutory accounts of the
Group’s Indian subsidiaries. Under Indian law, a general reserve is created through a year on year transfer from
the profit and loss account. The amount transferred is 5% of the profits for the year for each Indian company
as stated in Indian GAAP . The purpose of these transfers is to ensure that distributions in a year are less than
the total distributable results for that year. This general reserve becomes fully distributable in future periods.

26. Acquisitions
(a) Hindustan Zinc Limited
On 12 November 2003 SOVL completed the acquisition of an additional 18.92% of the ordinary share capital
of HZL by exercising a call option available under the original share purchase agreement. Following this
transaction, SOVL’s holding in HZL increased to 64.9% giving the Group an effective holding of 42.7% at
31 March 2004. The consideration for this transaction was US$70.5 million, and resulted in a reduction in
Group minority interests of US$82.4 million (see note 21).
(b) Sterlite Employee’s Welfare Trust 
On 2 January 2004 the Group purchased 4.98% of Sterlite’s issued share capital from the SEWT for a cash
consideration of US$58.0 million, being the open market price at that date. However, as this acquisition is an
intra-group transaction, this cash consideration eliminates on consolidation and is thus not included as an
acquisition cash flow in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. Following this acquisition the Group’s
effective holding in Sterlite increased to 65.8%.
This acquisition led to a reduction in Group minority interests of US$15.9 million (see note 21). There was no
cash effect on the Group as the SEWT is consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary.
(c) Transaction with Sterlite Optical Technologies Limited 
During the year ended 31 March 2004 the Group paid deferred consideration of US$10.6 million to SOTL
relating to the acquisition of 20% of SOVL from SOTL in January 2003. Vedanta Resources plc

27. Operating Lease Commitments
The Group does not have any material operating lease commitments. 
28. Financial Instruments
The Group’s accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 2. The Group does
not trade in financial instruments. As permitted by FRS 13 “Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments:
Disclosure”, short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than the
currency disclosures.
Derivatives, Financial Instruments and Risk Management
The Group uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
interest rates and commodity prices. The use of derivatives can give rise to credit and market risk. The Group
controls credit risk by only entering into contracts with banks and institutions with the highest national or
international standing. The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits, authorities and regular monitoring
by appropriate levels of management. The limits, authorities and monitoring systems are periodically reviewed 
by management and the Board. The market risk on derivatives is mitigated by changes in the valuation of the
underlying assets, liabilities or transactions, as derivatives are used only for risk management.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group uses forward exchange contracts, currency swaps, options and other derivatives to hedge the
effects of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The sources of
foreign exchange risk are outstanding amounts payable for imported raw materials, capital goods and other
supplies as well as financing transactions, loans and current asset investments denominated in foreign
currencies. The Group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk on its exports. Most of these transactions are
denominated in US dollars. The policy of the Group is to determine on a regular basis what portion of the
foreign exchange risk on financing transactions, loans and current asset investments are to be hedged
through forward exchange contracts and other instruments. There are systems in place for the period in
review of open (i.e. unhedged) exposure limits and stop-loss levels by management.
Interest Rate Risk
The short term debt of the Group is principally denominated in Indian rupees with fixed rates of interest.
While no significant interest rate risk arises on this portion of the debt the Group utilises interest rate swap
products to optimise the interest liability. On foreign currency denominated debt the Group has a policy of
selectively using interest rate swap and option contracts to hedge its exposure to interest rate movements.
Most of the foreign currency debt is on floating rates of interest linked to six-month US dollar LIBOR. These
exposures are reviewed by appropriate levels of management on a monthly basis.
Counterparty and Concentration of Credit Risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of debtors, current asset investments and derivative financial
instruments. There is no concentration of credit risk among the debtors of the Group given the large number
of debtors and the business diversity. Credit risk on debtors is very limited as almost all credit sales are against
letters of credit of banks of national standing. In respect of current asset investments, counter party limits are
in place to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. For derivative and financial
instruments, the credit risk is limited as the Group only deals with banks and institutions with the highest
national or international standing. These exposures are further reduced by having standard ISDA Master
agreements including set-off provisions with each counterparty.
Commodity Price Risk
Aluminium
The raw material is mined in India with sales in the domestic market being linked to the average LME price
prior to the month of despatch. Currently no hedging is undertaken in this commodity.
Copper
A large portion of the copper turnover benefits from a natural hedge created by matching quotational periods for
concentrate purchases with the timing of finished metal sales. The balance, the “free metal” (being the difference
between payable metal and the recovery) and the precious metal content are hedged through forward sales or
options.
Presently, approximately 13,000 tonnes of copper is considered as iron stock and no hedging is undertaken.
Depending on opportunities offered by the market, put/call options are taken against free metal available.
Zinc
The raw material is mined in India with sales in the domestic market being linked to the average LME price for
the fortnight prior to the fortnight of despatch. Currently no hedging is undertaken in this commodity. Vedanta Resources plc

(d) Net Foreign Currency Monetary Assets and Liabilities
The main currencies of the Group include the US dollar, UK pounds sterling, Indian rupee and Australian
dollar. The analysis of the net monetary assets and liabilities indicates the Group’s exposures in various
operating companies that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company.
These exposures represent the transactional exposures that may give rise to net currency gains and losses
recognised in the profit and loss account. These exposures are net of the forward contracts and derivative
products used to manage currency exposures.

(e) Hedging
As described in note 2, the Group’s policy is to hedge the following exposures:
• interest rate exposures by using interest rate swaps; and
• structural and transactional currency exposures, and currency exposures on future expected sales by using
currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged
is itself recognised. The carrying value of financial derivatives are thus held on the Financial Statements at their
original cost of nil.

29. Pensions
The Group operates pension schemes for the majority of its employees in both India and Australia.
(a) Defined Contribution Schemes
Central Provident Fund
The Central Provident Fund relates to all full time Indian employees of the Group. The amount contributed by
the Group is a designated percentage of 12% of basic salary, together with an additional contribution of 12%
of salary made by the employee.
The benefit is paid to the employee on their retirement or resignation from the Group.
Superannuation
Superannuation, another pension scheme applicable throughout India, is applicable only to senior executives.
Each relevant company holds a policy with the Life Insurance Corporation of India (“LIC”), to which each
company contributes a fixed amount relating to superannuation, and the pension annuity is met by LIC as
required, taking into consideration the number of years of service of the executive, and the contributions
made. Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined contribution basis and contributions are
charged directly to the profit and loss account.
Pension Fund
The Pension Fund was established in 1998 and is managed by the Government. The employee makes no
contribution to this fund but the employer makes a contribution of 8.33% of salary each month. This must be
provided for every permanent employee on the payroll.
At the age of 60 (the statutory retirement age for all non-professional employees), contributions cease and
the individual receives a monthly payment based on the level of contribution through the years and on their
salary scale at the time they retire, subject to a maximum ceiling of salary level. The Government funds these
payments, and thus the Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of
whether the central fund is in surplus or deficit.
It is not possible to assess the Group’s own level of assets or liabilities within the fund as it is effectively a 
multi-employer scheme. On this basis it is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme. No information
regarding the overall level of surplus or deficit in the fund is publicly available.
Australian Pension Schemes
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes in Australia. The contribution of a proportion
of an employee’s salary into a superannuation fund is a compulsory legal requirement in Australia. 
The employer contributes at least 9% of the employee’s gross remuneration into the employee’s fund of
choice and the employee has the option to make additional voluntary contributions.
(b) Defined Benefit Schemes
The defined benefit schemes operate in India. 
Gratuity
Gratuity is a defined benefit scheme which is open to all Group employees in India who have a minimum of
five years of service with their employing company. This scheme is funded by the Group, either through cash
contributions or provisions each year, based on actuarial valuations. Under this scheme, benefits are provided
based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate fund and a full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out
on an annual basis.
(c) Pension Schemes existing within Group Companies
Sterlite
Sterlite holds a policy with the LIC under which the company contributes a pre-determined premium, such
that the LIC will meet the payments, when required, to the individual employee concerned in accordance with
an actuarial valuation. In this situation, the exposure is limited to the amount of the contribution each year
and is not affected by valuation deficits. The insurance is pooled with other employers and it is therefore not
possible to assess the Group’s own level of assets or liabilities within the scheme. Accordingly, with respect to
Sterlite, the scheme has been accounted for on a defined contribution basis and contributions are charged
directly to the profit and loss account. Vedanta Resources plc

(c) Pension Schemes existing within Group Companies continued
MALCO
MALCO does not contribute to the LIC. MALCO’s Gratuity scheme is therefore accounted for on a defined
benefit basis. The latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2004 using the projected unit
actuarial method. At that date the fund was in deficit. The main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation
were a discount rate of 8% per annum and an annual salary increase of 5%.
BALCO
At BALCO, all employees who are scheduled to retire on or before 31 March 2005 are covered by the LIC and
therefore their remaining contributions are accounted for on a defined contribution basis. However, the
scheme is accounted for as a defined benefit scheme for all employees scheduled to retire after 31 March 2005,
who are not covered by the LIC. The latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2004 using the
projected unit actuarial method. At that date the fund was in deficit. The main assumptions used in the
actuarial valuation were a discount rate of 7.5% per annum and an annual salary increase of 5%.
HZL
HZL contributes to the LIC but the policy does not cover the full deficit of the Gratuity scheme. HZL’s Gratuity
scheme is therefore accounted for on a defined benefit basis. The latest actuarial valuation was performed as
at 31 March 2004 using the projected unit actuarial method. At that date the fund was in deficit. The main
assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were a discount rate of 7.5% per annum and an annual salary
increase of 4.5%.
As at 31 March 2004 membership across MALCO, BALCO and HZL stood at 10,735 employees (31 March
2003: 11,943). The deficits and other aspects of these schemes are disclosed in further detail in notes (d) and
(e) below.
(d) SSAP 24 – Accounting for Pension Costs
The Group accounts for pension costs in accordance with “Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 –
Accounting for Pension Costs”.
The retirement benefit charge for the year was as follows: 
Year ended Year ended
31 March 2004 31 March 2003
US$ million US$ million
Defined contribution pension schemes 4.2 5.6
Defined benefit pension schemes 3.9 5.6
8.1 11.2
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions for either the defined contribution or the defined benefit
schemes as at 31 March 2004 or 31 March 2003.
The latest full actuarial valuations of the Gratuity schemes for MALCO, BALCO and HZL as at 31 March 2004,
were carried out by R. Krishnawamy, Watson Wyatt India Pvt Ltd and Charan Gupta Consultants Pvt Ltd,
consulting actuaries to MALCO, BALCO and HZL, respectively.
The results of these valuations have been used as the basis for assessing pension costs for the two years ended
31 March 2004.
(e) FRS 17 – Retirement Benefits – Transitional Disclosures
The results for the year ended 31 March 2004 continue to include a pension charge calculated under the
principles of SSAP 24. Transitional arrangements for the adoption of FRS 17 require the disclosures set 
out below. The disclosures relate to the second year of the transitional provisions. The United Kingdom
Accounting Standards Board has deferred the date for full adoption of FRS 17. 
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations of the
MALCO, BALCO and HZL Gratuity schemes. Scheme assets are stated at their market value as at the relevant
period end date. Vedanta Resources plc

Guarantees to Banks
The Group has given corporate guarantees to certain banks and financial institutions in relation to IFL, an
associate of the Group. The value of these guarantees was US$19.6 million at 31 March 2004 against an
outstanding balance of US$13.1 million.
32. Contingencies
The Group has the following contingencies. With regard to the claims against Group companies included
below, no provision has been made in the Financial Statements as the Directors believe that it is more likely
than not that the claims will not give rise to a material liability.
MALCO Claims
Under the terms of a financial aid package, MALCO was entitled to benefit from reduced tariff electricity for
the period from 1995 to 1999. In 1997 MALCO became profitable, and in 1999 the Tamil Nadu Electricity
Board (“TNEB”) made a claim against MALCO for the difference in value between full price and reduced tariff
electricity for the period from 1997 to 1999. The value of this claim was US$72.1 million. The case was heard
in November 1999 and the Court found in MALCO’s favour. TNEB has appealed the decision and this appeal
has not yet been heard.
TNEB is also claiming US$23.6 million from MALCO for an electricity self-generation levy. This claim has arisen
since the opening of MALCO’s captive power plant in 1999. MALCO has applied for an exemption from the
levy and a decision is pending.
In February 1999, MALCO entered into an agreement with TECHMO Car SpA (“TECHMO”) to modernise the
smelter pot rooms at Mettur Dam. In February 2003, this contract was terminated by TECHMO following disputes
over the project. In March 2003, MALCO issued a claim against TECHMO to recover expenditure incurred on the
project, citing non-performance by TECHMO. The value of this claim is US$6.3 million. The District Court had
ordered TECHMO to provide the full amount of the claim to MALCO as security, which was subsequently stayed by
the Madras High Court. MALCO has since filed a petition with the Supreme Court of India.
MALCO has cashed a bank guarantee, provided by TECHMO for the project, amounting to US$0.7 million.
In June 2003, TECHMO moved for arbitration claiming a total of US$2.8 million being the unpaid portion of
the contract. Arbitration proceedings under ICC rules are ongoing.
Sterlite Disputed Tax Liability
In December 1999, the Indian tax authorities carried out a search at Sterlite’s locations, as well as at the
residential premises of its directors and senior officials. Following this search the tax department alleged that,
inter alia, Sterlite had claimed tax relief for unsupported purchases of fixed assets and required Sterlite to
make a return of undisclosed income for the block assessment period from 1 April 1989 to 8 December 1999.
Sterlite made a return and paid US$3.9 million of additional tax in respect of the block assessment period. Based
on their findings, the tax authorities then issued a block assessment, claiming total tax of US$6.4 million. Sterlite
lodged an appeal against the US$2.5 million additional tax charged by the authorities, but also allocated a tax
overpayment against this contested liability pending the appeal. The appeal was decided in Sterlite’s favour
reducing the tax claim to US$4.1 million, which is covered by the amount previously paid by Sterlite. The
appeal ruling stated that there were no unsupported purchases of fixed assets. The tax authorities are
expected to initiate a further appeal to the tax tribunal. Sterlite intends to launch an appeal over certain
aspects of the ruling in the first appeal. The balance sheet at 31 March 2004 includes a provision of US$1.9
million against this tax overpayment receivable balance.
Excise Duty Disputes – Sterlite, HZL and BALCO
The Indian excise authorities have made claims against Sterlite for additional excise duties on the grounds that
they dispute the assessable value of finished goods applied by Sterlite in its returns. The amount of the duties
in dispute is US$9.3 million. At 31 March 2004, the balance sheet includes a provision of US$6.6 million in
respect of this claim.
The authorities are also claiming additional duties of US$3.1 million from BALCO, the majority of which
relates to materials used for the construction of BALCO’s cold rolling mill. The balance sheet at 31 March 2004
includes a provision of US$0.5 million in respect of outstanding duties. Vedanta Resources plc

32. Contingencies continued
In addition, HZL has received demands for US$8.7 million in relation to excise duties. There is a related
provision of US$4.5 million in the balance sheet at 31 March 2004.
All claims are being vigorously contested by management. 
Central Bank of India Claim – BALCO
The Central Bank of India is claiming US$2.2 million from BALCO in relation to its Bidhanbagh unit. This claim
relates to loan facilities provided between 1974 and 1978 to Aluminium Corporation of India Limited (now
part of BALCO). The BALCO management continues to contest the claim.
HZL Sales Tax Declaration Forms
In order to benefit from a refund rate of sales tax (4% instead of 12%) on zinc product sales, certain States
require the completion of specific documentation. At 31 March 2004, documentation relating to claims for
benefits of US$4.0 million had not been submitted. The balance sheet at 31 March 2004 includes a provision
of US$1.4 million against benefits which would be lost if appropriate documents cannot be filed.
HZL Sales Tax Demands
HZL has received demands for US$1.9 million of additional sales taxes relating primarily to the transfer of
goods to sales offices. HZL is appealing against the demand and expects to pay US$0.2 million of additional
tax. A provision for this amount is included in the balance sheet at 31 March 2004.
Chanderiya Lead and Zinc Smelter Claim – HZL
Prior to privatisation, HZL purchased land adjacent to the Chanderiya site in order to facilitate the expansion of
operations. The land was purchased by the Government at the open market price. Subsequently the previous
owner has issued a claim against HZL stating that the consideration was below the fair value. There is no
reliable estimate of the potential liability. The HZL management believe that the claim is unlikely to succeed.
33. Share transactions
Call and Put Options – HZL
With effect from 11 April 2007, SOVL has the right to purchase all of the Government’s remaining shares in
HZL at fair market value.
If the Government’s holding in HZL is greater than 26% at 11 October 2004, it has the right to exercise a put
option requiring SOVL to buy sufficient shares to reduce the Government’s holding to 26%. The exercise price
will be the higher of the open market price and INR 40.50 per share. The option is open for the six months
from 11 October 2004 to 10 April 2005. As at 31 March 2004, the Government’s holding in HZL was 35.1%.
Call Option – BALCO
Sterlite purchased a 51% holding in BALCO from the Government on 2 March 2001. Under the terms of this
purchase agreement for BALCO, Sterlite has a call option that allows it to purchase any remaining
Government holding in BALCO at any point from 2 March 2004. The purchase price per share under this
option would be the higher of fair market value and INR 49.01 (plus 14% interest per annum).
HZL Share Allotment from Open Offer
SOVL purchased its initial holding in HZL in two stages, 26% in April 2002 and a further 20% under an open
offer in June 2002. Under Securities Exchange Board of India rules, where an open offer is used, a SEBI
approved bank must be responsible for the allotment of shares to ensure that the smaller shareholders are
protected.
It has been deemed by SEBI that the allotment by SOVL and SBI Capital (SOVL’s bankers) was not equitable in
nature and SEBI are to rule on the issue.
RBI Approval Relating to Non-resident Indians – SOVL
Under Indian law, non-resident Indians (“NRI’s”) must apply to SEBI to sell any shares. During the acquisition
of HZL in 2002, SOVL entered a combined application for NRI’s. The approval of nine shareholders’
applications was delayed resulting in payments not being made within the 30 day limit.
SEBI is claiming interest totalling US$0.1 million as a result of the delay but management believe this will fail as the
delay was not attributable to SOVL, since the application was made on behalf of others and no financial gain was
made, as the monies were held in escrow. The matter is awaiting hearing by the Securities Appellate Tribunal.
As at 31 March 2004, and at the date of this report, 9,512,801 shares (being 2.2% of HZL’s issued share
capital) out of the 274,315,331 shares held in HZL by SOVL, are held in an escrow account pending
completion of formalities with SEBI. Vedanta Resources plc

Convertible Debt – IFL
IFL has a loan of US$22.6 million with ICICI Bank. ICICI has an option to convert this debt to equity shares at
par value at any time up to maturity of the loan in 2012. If this option is exercised, MALCO’s holding in IFL will
reduce from 38.8% to 8.7%.
34. Subsequent Events
Purchase of 2.4% of Sterlite from the SEWT
On 2 April 2004, the Group purchased an additional 2.4% (being 1,695,794 shares) of Sterlite’s issued share
capital from the SEWT at an open market price of US$21.4 million. This acquisition increased the Group’s
effective holding in Sterlite to 68.1%.
Sterlite rights issue
In December 2003, Sterlite initiated a rights issue, which was fully underwritten by the Group. In June 2004,
Sterlite obtained SEBI approval for a three-for-ten rights issue which has been altered to a one-for-two, and
re-submitted for approval. Completion of the issue is expected in the second half of 2004, with expected
proceeds of US$440 million, net of all costs.
BALCO dispute with National Thermal Power Corporation (“NTPC”)
Subsequent to 31 March 2004, BALCO has been in dispute with NTPC over the rates at which water and coal
are being supplied to the BALCO captive power plant (which BALCO took over from NTPC). One of the key
points in the dispute is the assertion of non co-operation by NTPC, which has prevented BALCO from setting
up its own coal handling and water pipeline facilities.
The matter was taken to arbitration, where BALCO was successful. However, NTPC appealed to the High
Court in Delhi, where NTPC gained an interim order raising the coal and water pipeline charges by around ten
times the original level. BALCO is appealing this ruling and the hearing is expected in July 2004.

Resources are additional to the reserves
Source of Information
The resources and reserves information for the year ended 31 March 2003 has been extracted from the
Company’s Listing Particulars without material change. The information for the year ended 31 March 2004
has been derived from 2003 information as adjusted for subsequent production during the year.
Basis of Preparation
Ore reserves and mineral resources reported herein comply with the “Australasian Code for Reporting of
Identified Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves”. This Code is subtitled “Report of the Joint Ore Reserves
Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists, and
Minerals Council of Australia”, and is commonly referred to as the “JORC Code”. The edition of the JORC
Code in force as at the date of this Annual Report is dated September 1999. The JORC Code recognises a
fundamental distinction between resources and reserves.
Mineral resources are based on mineral occurrences quantified on the basis of geological data and an
assumed cut-off grade, and are divided into measured, indicated and inferred categories reflecting decreasing
confidence in geological and/or grade continuity. No allowances are included for dilution and losses during
mining, but the reporting of resource estimates carries the implication that there are reasonable prospects for
eventual economic exploitation. Resources may therefore be viewed as the estimation stage prior to the
application of more stringent economic criteria for reserve definition, such as a rigorously defined cut-off
grade and mine design outlines, along with allowances for dilution and losses during mining.
Ore reserves, as defined by the JORC Code, are designated as proved and probable, and are derived from the
corresponding measured and indicated resource estimates by including allowances for dilution and losses during
mining. It is an explicitly stated further requirement that other modifying economic, mining, metallurgical,
marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors must also be taken into account.
References to resources and reserves are to total resources and reserves respectively. Total resources and
reserves means that part of the resource and reserve from a mine in which subsidiaries of the Group have an
economic interest. The Group does not wholly own certain of its subsidiaries and therefore total resources and
total reserves include resources and reserves attributable to third party interests in controlled subsidiaries.
References to production are to total production. Total production means that part of production at mines and
operations in which subsidiaries of the Group have an economic interest. The Group does not wholly own
certain of its subsidiaries and therefore total production includes production attributable to third party
interests in controlled subsidiaries. Vedanta Resources plc

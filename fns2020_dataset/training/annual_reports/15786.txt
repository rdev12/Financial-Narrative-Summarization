 Chairman’s statement 
 
 
In the 18 months since the beginning of Toledo’s 2011 financial year, our management has worked 
tirelessly to extract greater value from our nickel investments located in the Philippines. 
 
It was very pleasing therefore to be able to announce in April that sales contracts had been 
secured to finance the reopening of the Berong mine, which duly occurred in May. 
 
The intention is now to produce 450,000 wet metric tonnes (wmt) of nickel ore this calendar year 
rising to 750,000 wmt annually thereafter. The expected net revenue generated from ore sales will 
be more than sufficient at current nickel prices for the joint owners of Berong to fund an exploration 
programme of the area around Berong and undertake engineering studies to improve ship loading 
capability and determine the optimal technology for local processing of ore. 
 
At the Ipilan project, on the eastern and opposite side of Palawan Island to Berong, significant 
progress has been made towards being able to mine the deposit. Last December, we announced 
that statutory licencing obligations had been progressed to the point where only a mine feasibility 
plan and related documents required official sign off before mining operations could begin. The 
feasibility plan has been submitted to the Minerals and Geosciences Bureau, and it is understood 
that their initial review has drawn no negative feedback. 
 
At the beginning of our financial year, we had just commenced an exploration programme on the 
Moorsom prospect, lying within a 14 kilometre radius of the Berong mine. The stated aim was to 
prove up sufficient ore capable of supporting a processing operation producing 20,000 tonnes per 
annum of contained nickel. 
 
Although the initial results were encouraging, the programme was curtailed when it became 
apparent that whilst the requisite tonnage undoubtedly exists, the nickel grade is less than hoped. 
In-house analysis of the assay data indicates a total resource of 43 million tonnes grading just over 
0.8% nickel using a 0% cut-off grade. Further work is required to determine whether any part of 
this huge resource has the potential of commercial development. 
 
As mentioned in my half yearly statement, the area long believed to offer significant exploration 
potential is the coastal portion of the Long Point prospect, located some 20 kilometres to the north 
east of the Berong mine. This area, which lies within an Environmental Critical Area Network 
(ECAN), is presently off limits to exploration. However, we remain hopeful that with the support of 
the local council, which has petitioned for the ECAN map to be redrawn, we will be granted 
permission to explore  
 
Palawan is a particularly environmentally sensitive island within which to operate. Often described 
as the Philippines last ecological frontier it has been accorded special status under the 
Constitution. It is not surprising therefore that obtaining permits to explore and mine on Palawan 
requires extensive review and cooperation with local authorities. Management of both Berong and 
Ipilan has ensured that very careful attention to community, social and environmental issues has 
enabled the restart of the Berong mine and successful ratification of the environmental plans for 
the development of Ipilan. 
 
More detailed operational information on both Berong and Ipilan is contained in the Chief 
Executive’s review. 
 
For the financial year to 31 March 2011 Toledo reported a pre-tax loss of £4.4 million as compared 
to a loss of £2.0 million in the 2010 financial year. Of the £2.4 million increase in pre-tax losses, 
£1.6 million is due to non-cash provisions with respect to the early settlement by Atlas 
Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation (Atlas) of a loan from Toledo to Atlas, a partner 
in Berong, and a reduction in the carrying value of our investment in Ipilan. A further £0.21 million 
was due to foreign exchange losses on US$ denominated loans to Philippine partners. Associated  4 
 
company losses rose by £0.36 million and administrative expenses were £0.46 million higher, 
principally as a result of negotiations with the Jinchuan Group during the financial year. 
 
With no income during 2010 and for most of this year, Toledo has relied on the loyal support of 
shareholders. Last December, the company placed 8.307 million shares to raise £1.9 million net of 
expenses. As a result of the issue, Toledo now has 49,845,333 fully paid ordinary shares in issue 
of which Daintree Limited (whose major shareholder, Jason Cheng, sits on the Toledo board) holds 
22% and Fevamotinico SARL (a company related to Kostyantin Zhevago) holds 20%. The issue 
also saw Mr. Jason Cropper increase his equity holding to 6.7%, since when, through on market 
purchases, his holding has risen to 16%. Meanwhile, Toledo’s once most significant shareholder, 
European Nickel plc, now has just a little over 5% equity holding, although it still retains its 18.7% 
voting interest in Berong Nickel Corporation. 
 
Presently financial matters look a lot better for both Toledo and its shareholders. The Berong mine 
should now be self-financing for the foreseeable future. Whilst Toledo still has a commitment to 
fund (on a recoverable basis) Ipilan up to mine development, your company is well funded as a 
result of the early settlement of the Atlas loan referred to earlier and which will add US$4.5 million 
to Toledo’s cash holdings.   
 
It is quite natural that strong commodity prices draws the attention of mineral rich countries to the 
wealth beneath their feet and heightens the debate as to how best these resources be developed 
for the benefit of the country concerned.  
 
The Philippines, with its exceptional endowment of mineral resources, is no exception to such 
debate, the current focus being on the pros and cons of limiting ore exports in preference to 
domestic processing and on whether to tighten or relax the legislation limiting foreign ownership of 
mineral properties. Toledo welcomes clarification and resolution on both these issues. 
 
Meanwhile, your company considers it wise to recognise Philippine nationals’ desire to process 
minerals within the country and, accordingly, to plan for a more restrictive environment on ore 
exports. We do not see such an outcome as necessarily financially damaging for Toledo. Equally, 
we believe that any change to the legislation on foreign ownership will recognise the important 
contribution foreign investment makes to the Philippine economy. 
 
As Toledo became more confident that developments in the nickel market and in particular the 
explosive growth in demand for nickel ore, primarily from China but also elsewhere, would support 
a reopening of the Berong mine and accelerate value added ambitions, we moved to strengthen 
our management capabilities.  
 
In January 2011, we welcomed Victor Kolesnikov to the Toledo board. In March we appointed him 
Chief Executive Officer. Victor is a metallurgist with over 22 years’ experience in mining and sales 
in the non-ferrous metals industry, including eight years with Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest 
nickel producer. In the short time since his appointment as CEO, Victor has made a very positive 
impact on our business including overseeing the commencement of operations at Berong. 
 
In May 2011, we appointed Pierre Charlent, Chief Operating Officer based in the Philippines. 
Pierre replaces Ken Stein, who returned to Australia for personal reasons. As a geologist and 
mining engineer, Pierre not only complements Victor’s metallurgical expertise, but also comes to 
Toledo with over 25 years’ experience in the mining industry, including 14 years in nickel laterite 
exploration, mining and development in New Caledonia. 
 
We are very fortunate to have been able to recruit two such high calibre and experienced 
individuals. 
 
With the commitment of the staff of the Manila-based management company of Berong and Ipilan 
and the employees at the respective sites, we have significantly advanced the reactivation of 
Berong and made substantial progress in the permitting at Ipilan. The Toledo board owes all of 
them a huge debt of gratitude.  5 
 
 
I would also like to thank Felix Pole who stood down from the Toledo board at the end of June. 
Felix was my companion in guiding Toledo through some very challenging times. Fortunately, 
although Felix resigned from the board because of the heavy demands of his business interests, 
he remains available should we need to tap his wise counsel. 
 
Finally, I would like to extend my thanks to our shareholders for their continued support. We have 
made much positive progress this year and I look forward to updating you as we continue to realise 
further goals over the coming year.

Chief Executive Officer’s review 
 
The Berong nickel mine, in which Toledo has a 56.1% economic interest, successfully 
recommenced operations in May 2011.This became possible due to favourable market conditions 
for high grade saprolite nickel ores and strong nickel prices which have stayed above 
US$20,000/tonne since August 2010. Prior to reopening the Berong mine, Toledo developed a 
new strategy with its JV partners in Berong Nickel Corporation (BNC) to target production of nickel 
ore containing 1.8% nickel, which is currently being implemented.  
 
The 1.8% plan was developed consistent with growing market demands for this ore type.  The 
recent significant changes in market demand for high grade saprolite nickel ore have opened up 
sound prospects for our deposits. Historically, the development of exports of high grade saprolite 
nickel ore began from New Caledonia during the 1950's by Japanese ferronickel producers. Later, 
they extended their ore source market to Indonesia and the Philippines. The requirement for nickel 
content in the ore in 2001 was very high at 2.45%, which is why only a few nickel ore producers in 
the Philippines could compete in this market. 
 
From 2003, the European manufacturers of ferronickel also started using high grade saprolite ore 
from Asia in their Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) production, thereby competing with Japanese 
consumers. By the end of 2006, the typical nickel content of high grade saprolite ores exported 
from New Caledonia, Indonesia and the Philippines had fallen to 2.2% nickel due to a general 
decline in the grade of existing deposits and also due to the increased demand for ore. The most 
significant changes in the market began in 2006, when China began to use nickel ore for the 
production of nickel pig iron (NPI) in blast furnaces, which were previously used for iron production.  
 
As the technology for production of pig iron in blast furnaces requires high iron content in raw 
materials, the Chinese manufacturers mainly used limonitic nickel ores with high iron content (45-
55%) and low nickel content (0.9-1%). The proportion of high grade saprolitic ore in the blast 
furnaces' production of NPI was relatively small. At the time of the crash in nickel prices at the end 
of 2008, China did not yet have substantial numbers of EAF plants for ferronickel production, and 
had not yet created competition in the market for high grade ores. However, it rapidly became clear 
to the Chinese ferronickel and NPI producers that the use of EAF for ferronickel production using 
high grade ores was much more competitive compared to NPI production in blast furnaces. 
  
By early 2011, China had already built significant numbers of EAF plants for the production of 
ferronickel. This dramatically increased the demand for high grade saprolitic ore, resulting in a 
decrease in the average available grade from 2.2% to 1.8% nickel content. All of this has led to the 
Berong deposit, with its substantial reserves of 1.8% nickel ore grade, becoming very competitive 
against the previous market leaders in high grade ore production from New Caledonia, Indonesia 
and the Philippines. 
 
The restart of the Berong mine by BNC was facilitated by the sale of the existing stockpile of low 
grade ore, produced in 2008, the proceeds of which are being used as working capital to support 
mining operations. Currently, 103,530 wet metric tonnes (wmt) of nickel ore with an average grade 
of 1.54% nickel has been shipped from the existing stockpile, yielding a revenue of US$2.57 million 
to BNC. 
 
To date, a further 160,569 wmt of ore with a nickel content of 1.8% has been mined and delivered 
to the stockpile. We anticipate producing a total of 450,000 wmt of ore containing 1.8% nickel by 
the end of this year, from which we expect to ship 200,000-250,000 wmt in this shipping season. 
Because Berong uses barges to load ships offshore, sea conditions typically limit shipments to 
between March and October.  It is planned that shipments will be resumed at the beginning of 
March 2012, when sea conditions again become conducive to barge ship loading. We have revised 
our projected shipping target for BNC, as announced on 27 May 2011, downwards by 50,000 
tonnes.  
  
The Berong mine is targeting production of 750,000 wmt of 1.8% nickel ore during 2012. To 
address the constraints of the limited shipping window, BNC has recently engaged an engineering  7 
 
company to look into the possibility of increasing the shipping period, the successful outcome of 
which would increase the capacity of the Berong port to 1,000,000 wmt per year. Among the range 
of possible measures being considered in the engineering study are the extension of the pier to 
accommodate bigger barges and the construction of a protective sea wall. 
 
The JORC-compliant resource for Berong was prepared by Snowden Mining Industry Consultants 
in June 2007. The total resource over the area drilled was stated at 9.92 million dry tonnes 
averaging 1.55 % Ni at a 1% cut-off grade. This resource included a subset of high grade resource 
of 4.88 million dry tonnes grading 1.88% Ni at a 1.5% cut-off grade. 
 
Currently, following the 2006 to 2008 direct shipping ore operation, the balance of this high grade 
resource is approximately 4.68 million dry tonnes (equivalent to approximately 6.98 million wet 
tonnes of ore) which will support a 9-year life of mine at the present rate of production of 750,000 
wmt of 1.8% nickel grade per annum. For every tonne of high-grade ore produced, approximately 
two tonnes of low grade ore with nickel content averaging 1.3% will be produced alongside. This 
will be stored at the mine site area in anticipation of future value added processing operations or 
for sale should favourable market conditions prevail. 
 
A Mining Project Feasibility Study for Ipilan, in which Toledo holds a 52% economic interest, was 
carried out in August 2010 and the relevant documents were compiled and submitted to the Mines 
and Geosciences Bureau for review and approval in November 2010. These included a 
Declaration of Project Mining Feasibility (DMF), Environmental Protection and Enhancement 
Program, Final Mine Rehabilitation and Decommissioning Plan, Social Development and 
Management Plan and a Health and Safety plan. Clearance of the all-important Strategic 
Environmental Plan (SEP) has been received from the Palawan Council for Sustainable 
Development (PCSD). 
 
A comprehensive sintering test has been undertaken on Ipilan’s ore, which has highlighted an 
opportunity to upgrade the ore, especially its limonitic part. This study has opened up the possibility 
of upgrading the iron and nickel content of Ipilan’s limonitic ore to make it more suitable for NPI 
blast furnace production. As Berong’s ore is similar to Ipilan’s, the results of the study could also be 
extended to Berong’s low grade limonitic ore. Capital and operating costs of the process are being 
evaluated. Mine experience gained in the development and operation of Berong will be applied to 
Ipilan once full permitting for mine development has been secured. 
 
Past works have confirmed the possibility of using all the available leaching technologies such as 
high pressure acid leaching (HPAL), atmospheric leaching (AL) and heap leaching (HL) for 
processing the ores of our deposits. We continue to assess the viability of these technologies in 
line with changing market conditions. We are also expanding our study on pyro-metallurgical 
technologies, such as looking into regional EAF production of ferronickel to evaluate which is the 
most viable and sustainable value added process for our ore.  
 
Berong continues to set the benchmark in best practice for its environmental work within the 
community. The mine rehabilitation area is now home to 4.5 hectares of rubber trees, which should 
provide the community with a sustainable source of income for years to come.  Alongside this, 
Toledo is dedicated to preserving its relationships with the local government units (LGUs) and 
schools in support of the National Greening Project to deliver our commitment to plant 50 new 
trees for every one tree cut.  In this regard, numerous species of value added trees, fruit trees and 
grasses continue to be planted. 
 
Funds from royalty payments made to the indigenous peoples continue to provide essential 
services to the community as well as establishing livelihood projects, which aim to empower the 
local community in generating its own income.  We are consistently investing more time and 
money into Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects than is our obligation, as mandated by 
law, and continue to strive to contribute positively to the local environment and communities 
amongst which we operate.   
  8 
 
Finally, it would not have been possible to resume operations at Berong at such short notice, or 
indeed at all, without the continued  support and hard work of all of our stakeholders including the 
local community, the LGUs, the Provincial and National Government and of course our staff and 
management both locally in the Philippines and in the UK. I would like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate them all and look ahead to continued success in the months and years to come.

In the community 
 
Toledo is very mindful of its duty to manage the environmental and social impact of its mining 
operations in a responsible and sensitive manner. All businesses are part of the wider society, and 
we believe they have both the responsibility and the capability to make a positive contribution to 
the communities in which they operate.  
 
Berong Nickel Corporation (BNC) recognises that the efficient operation of its business depends on 
the support of the local authorities and of the community as a whole, and seeks to provide 
significant and sustainable benefits through its presence. BNC’s Community Relations Officer, Joy 
Asignacion, ensures that everyone within the local community has a say in identifying and 
participating in projects backed by the company. There are currently two main focus areas for 
these projects – the Social Development and Management Programme and Community 
Programmes. 
 
BNC’s Social Development and Management Programme (SDMP) was launched in 2007, following 
extensive consultation with the community and local government to ensure that the programme 
would be fully aligned with their interests and aspirations. Since then, the SDMP has funded a 
number of very successful initiatives, including a scholarship scheme, a para-teachers programme, 
improved medical services, and a potable water system. 
 
The Community Programmes are wide ranging, and are selected and run with the active 
involvement of members of the community. Recent programmes include: 
• Livelihood 
Backyard gardening scheme; Tilapia Festival; manufacture of coco-based products; buying 
station for recyclable materials. 
• Education 
Read-along scheme; Berong Elementary Extension School; Science Month Celebration at 
Berong National High School.  
• Health  
Cooking contest; supplemental feeding; personal hygiene demonstration; community garden 
and beautification; “Dumi mo, Linis mo” (construction of comfort rooms); new mothers’ classes; 
school garden. 
 
Adopt-a-Mountain 
BNC devised its Adopt-a-Mountain programme as a proactive and imaginative response to a 
directive issued by the Environmental Management Bureau of the Philippine Department of 
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) relating to the rehabilitation by mining operators of 
denuded forests or mountains outside of currently approved mining areas. Along with restoration 
and conservation, the programme also aims to provide livelihoods to local people by planting tree 
species that can generate sustainable income in the future. 
 
The Barangay (district) of Berong is home to indigenous peoples called “Tagbanua” and migrants 
from the Visayan Islands. The Tagbanua are the aborigines of Quezon and have inhabited the land 
for centuries. Slash and burn farming (known locally as “kaingin”) and fishing are the main sources 
of livelihood of the nomadic Tagbanua, and this has had a detrimental effect on the environment 
within the district. 
 
BNC’s community relations team faced a real challenge in finding denuded areas to adopt, since 
most of them are still being used as “kaingin” by the Tagbanua who understandably do not want to 
leave unless they can sell the land at a very high price to BNC. However, following a series of 
negotiations conducted with the helpful guidance of the DENR, the first tree planting event under 
the Adopt-a-Mountain programme was able to take place on 11 September 2010. Hundreds of 
people from the community, including schoolchildren along with their teachers and mothers, 
government officials and local civic groups, converged and planted around 6,000 seedlings.  
  10 
 
The Adopt-a-Mountain initiative is not only helping to rehabilitate the local environment, but also to 
promote better understanding and relationships throughout the community. BNC will continue to 
fund and extend this initiative, and the Barangay of Berong has declared that 11 September will 
from now on be designated Adopt-a-Mountain Day.

Report of the directors 
For the year ended 31 March 2011 
 
The directors present their report with the audited Group financial statements for the year ended 31 
March 2011. 
 
Principal activities and review of business 
 
The principal activity of the Group is investment directly and indirectly in, and operation of, mining 
exploration and development projects. The Group is comprised of the Toledo Mining Corporation 
plc (“the Company”), its subsidiaries and associated undertakings. 
 
During the year, the Group’s main undertaking was the continuing development of the Berong 
nickel project, in which the Company has a 56.1% economic interest and the Ipilan nickel project, 
in which the Company has a 52% economic interest. 
 
Loss before taxation for the year was £4,377,343 (2010:  £1,982,823) and basic loss per share 
including share of associated results was 10.16 pence (2010: 4.74 pence). 
 
During the year, the Company incurred a large foreign exchange translation loss, principally arising 
on the re-translation of loan investments and receivables held at the balance sheet date. The loan 
investments are denominated in US Dollars and the exchange loss arose on the unfavourable 
movement of the US Dollar to the British Pound. The total foreign exchange translation loss for the 
year was £905,973 (2010: loss £693,255).  
 
The Company has continued to advance its pro-rata share of funds as required to meet the 
ongoing development costs at Berong. The loan to Berong Nickel Corporation (BNC) has been 
advanced as an interest-free, unsecured loan and has no fixed terms of repayment. 
 
Under the terms of loan agreements entered into with Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development 
Corporation (ACMDC) and Brooks Nickel Ventures Inc (Brooks) to fund their shares of required 
ongoing development costs respectively at Berong and Ipilan, the Company advanced 
US$177,369  to ACMDC (2010: nil) and US$1,140,000 to Brooks (2010: US$845,146) during the 
year. On 4 July 2011 the Company and ACMDC reached an agreement for ACMDC to repay by 30 
September 2011 the amount of US$4,449,880 in full and final settlement of ACMDC loan, resulting 
in a charge of $1,197,893 (£746,767) included in the loss before taxation for the year.  
 
Details of these loan agreements and the ACMDC settlement are contained in note 13 to the 
financial statements.  
 
The Berong mine remained on care and maintenance throughout the year. No shipments were 
made to year end. In May 2011, the mine was returned to production and direct ore shipments 
resumed. 
 
The Company continued legal action on behalf of BNC against Queensland Nickel Pty arising from 
the attempted cancellation of ore shipments and failure to meet the contractual minimum 300,000 
wmt annual offtake through to 2012. 
 
On 24 December 2010, the Company raised £1.9 million after costs from the placing of 8,307,000 
ordinary shares at £0.23 each. By dilution, European Nickel PLC reduced its equity interest in the 
Company from 7.7% to 6.4%, while maintaining its 18.7 % direct interest in BNC, owner of the 
Berong nickel mine and project. Immediately following the placing, Daintree’s holding was 
decreased by dilution to 22.01%. Fevamotinico SARL increased their holding to 20.18%, and Mr J 
Cropper increased his holding to 6.67%. 
 
Further details of the Company’s activities for the year are set out in the Chairman’s statement and 
in the Chief Executive Officer’s review.

Future developments 
The directors anticipate the Company’s major future developments will revolve around further 
investment in and development of the Berong and Ipilan nickel projects. In particular, the Company 
is executing an exploration programme at Berong to prove up resources sufficient to support value-
adding processing projects. The mining at Berong will continue along with the direct ore shipping, 
which recommenced in May 2011, being supplied from the existing JORC delineated reserves. At 
the same time, we continue to evaluate and progress strategic value-added processing 
opportunities for the entire resource managed by the Company. 
 
Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group 
The principal risks faced by the Group are as follows: 
• The Company’s ability to raise sufficient funds through the issue of equity or debt in order to 
continue to fund its share of the Group’s planned exploration costs and other operating 
expenditure. 
• The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves significant risks, which even a 
combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. There can be 
no guarantee that the estimates of quantities and grades of minerals disclosed will be available 
to extract.  With all mining operations there is uncertainty and, therefore, risk associated with 
operating parameters and costs resulting from the scaling up of extraction methods tested in 
pilot conditions. 
• Non-repayment of significant loans advanced and recovery of interest accrued. 
• The operations of the Group may be disrupted by a variety of risks and hazards which are 
beyond the control of the Group. These may include geological, geotechnical and seismic 
factors, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, occupational and health hazards, technical 
failures, labour disputes, unusual or unexpected rock formations, flooding and extended 
interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions, explosions and other acts.  
These risks and hazards could also result in damage to, or destruction of, production facilities, 
personal injury, environmental damage, business interruption, monetary losses and possible 
legal liability. 
• The Group’s future success is substantially dependent on the continued services and 
performance of its key personnel.  Their loss or the inability to recruit personnel of the 
appropriate calibre could have a significant adverse effect on the business of the Group. 
• The selling price of the nickel ore produced by the Group’s operations varies in line with 
movements of the price of nickel as quoted on the London Metal Exchange. 
                   
  15 
 
• Some or all of the operating and exploration licences issued in respect of the projects may be 
subject to conditions which, if not satisfied, may lead to the revocation of such licences. 
• The Group may have minority interests in the companies, partnerships and ventures in which it 
invests and may be unable to exercise control over the operations of such companies. 
• The operations of the Group are located in the Philippines where there may be a number of 
associated risks over which it will have no control.  These may include economic, social or 
political instability or change, terrorism, hyperinflation, currency non-convertibility or instability, 
changes of laws affecting foreign ownership, government participation, taxation, working 
conditions, rates of exchange, exchange control, and exploration licensing. 
• The Group’s total return and net assets can be significantly affected by currency movements.

Corporate governance 
As Toledo Mining Corporation plc is not a fully listed company, it is not required to comply with the 
Code of Best Practice published by the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate 
Governance (“the Combined Code”). However, the directors do place a high degree of importance 
on ensuring that high standards of corporate governance are maintained. As a result, most of the 
relevant principles set out in the Combined Code have been adopted during the period and these 
are summarised below. 
 
Directors 
The Company supports the concept of an effective Board leading and controlling the Company.  
The Board is responsible for approving the Company’s policies and strategies. It meets frequently 
and receives and reviews, on a timely basis, financial and operating information appropriate to 
being able to discharge its duties. Directors are free to seek any further information they consider 
necessary. All directors submit themselves for re-election every three years by rotation in 
accordance with the Articles of Association. All new appointments to the Board are subject to 
resolution of the shareholders at the following Annual General Meeting. 
 
Relations with shareholders 
The Company values the views of its shareholders and recognises their interest in the Company’s 
strategy and performance. The Board is available to discuss current events with its institutional and 
private shareholders and positively encourages attendance at General Meetings. 
 
Audit Committee 
The Company has established an audit committee comprised of the non-executive directors.  It is 
responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of auditors and the 
audit fee. It is also responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Company is 
properly monitored and reported on, and receives and reviews reports from management and the 
auditors relating to the interim report, the annual report and accounts, and the internal control 
systems of the Company. 
 
Nomination Committee 
This committee was responsible for overseeing the selection and appointment of directors. The 
committee makes recommendations to the Board on the appropriate skill mix, personal qualities, 
expertise and diversity of each position. With effect from 1 July 2011, the function of the 
Nomination Committee has been incorporated into the scope of the Remuneration Committee. 
 
Remuneration Committee 
The Company has established a remuneration committee comprised of the non-executive 
directors. It is responsible for the review and recommendation of the scale and structure of 
remuneration for key management personnel, including any bonus arrangements or the award of 
share options. Details of the directors’ emoluments are set out in the financial statements.  
However, there is no separate Report of the Remuneration Committee. It is the Company’s policy 
that the remuneration of directors should be commensurate with services provided by them to the 
Company. 
 
Internal financial control and risk management 
The directors are responsible for the Company’s system of internal financial control and also for 
identifying the major business risks faced by the Company.  The system of internal financial control 
is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. In fulfilling these responsibilities, the Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of 
internal financial control. The directors have established procedures for planning, budgeting and for 
monitoring, on a regular basis, the performance of the Company and for determining the 
appropriate course of action to manage any major business risks. The Board has considered the 
need for an internal audit function but has decided the size of the Company does not justify it at 
present. This decision will be reviewed annually. 
 
 
  18 
 
Supplier payment policy 
It is the Company’s policy to agree terms of payment with all suppliers at the time of the 
transaction, and to pay suppliers as and when they fall due for payment or alternatively to agree 
revised terms of payment. No distinction is made between different classes of suppliers. At the 
year end, trade payables amounted to 21 days (2010: 18 days). 
 
Political and charitable donations 
No political or charitable donations were made during the year. 
 
Indemnity provision 
Directors and Officers insurance is in place to indemnify the directors against liabilities arising from 
the discharge of their duties as directors of the Company. 
 
Auditors 
Length of service of audit assignment partner 
W K Sawin has been the audit assignment partner for six years. Under APB Ethical Standard 3, 
the audit partner should be rotated after five years but may continue for a sixth year in cases where 
changes and developments within the company make a change of audit partner inadvisable at that 
time. The audit committee fully endorsed the one-year extension on the understanding that a 
rotation of audit partner takes place before the next annual audit. 
 
Reappointment of auditors 
Sawin & Edwards have indicated their willingness to continue in office.  A resolution to reappoint as 
auditors Sawin & Edwards for the ensuing year will be proposed at the 2011 Annual General 
Meeting.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
For the year ended 31 March 2011 
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law, the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards and applicable law. The financial statements are 
required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors 
are required to: 
a) select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently 
b) make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent 
c) state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements 
 
 
d) prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Company and Group will continue in business.  
 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and of the Group and to 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.  They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company website.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
 
 
The directors confirm that so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as 
defined by section 418(3) of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware. They have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors 
are aware of that information.

Independent auditors’ report 
To the shareholders of Toledo Mining Corporation plc 
 
 
We have audited the financial statements of Toledo Mining Corporation plc for the year ended 31 
March 2011 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and 
Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow 
Statements and the related notes numbered 1 to 31. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and as regards the parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility Statement set out on page 19, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. 
 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors 
 
Scope of the audit 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition we read all the financial information and non-financial information in the Annual Report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited Financial Statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
  
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the parent 
Company's affairs as at 31 March 2011 and of the Group’s  loss for the year then ended;  
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union;  
• the parent Company financial statements have  been properly prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
         
  21 
 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Company’s financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all of the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the financial statements 
For the year ended 31 March 2011 
 
1. General information 
 
Toledo Mining Corporation plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the 
Companies Act 1985. The Company’s registered office is Ground Floor, 11 Albemarle Street, 
London, W1S 4HH. The registration number of the Company is 5055833. 
 
The principal activity of the Group is the investment in and exploration and development of 
mining projects, specifically in the Philippines. 
 
The Group’s principal activity is carried out in US dollars. The financial statements are 
presented in pounds sterling as this is the currency of the country (the UK) where the 
Company is incorporated and its ordinary shares are admitted for trading. 
 
The Board of directors has authorised the issue of these financial statements on the date of 
the statement as set out on page 18. 
 
2. Accounting policies 
 
 Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs). 
 
 The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except that certain 
financial instruments are accounted for at fair values. The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out below. 
  
 New standards applied 
The Group has applied the following relevant standards which are effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2010. 
 
IFRS 2 (revised)   Share-based payment vesting conditions and 
cancellations      
IFRS 3 (revised)   Business combinations 
IFRS 7   Financial instruments - disclosures 
IFRS 8   Operating segments                                                                  
IAS 1 (revised and amended)   Presentation of financial statements                           
IAS 7 (amended)   Statement of cash flows 
IAS 16 (amended)   Property, plant and equipment 
IAS 19 (amended)   Employee benefits 
IAS 23 (revised and amended)   Borrowing costs                                                                           
IAS 27 (amended)   Consolidated and separate financial statements 
IAS 28 (amended)   Investments in associates 
IAS 32 (amended)   Financial instruments - presentation 
IAS 36 (amended)   Impairment of assets 
IAS 38 (amended)   Intangible assets 
IAS 39 (amended)   Financial instruments- recognition and measurement  33 
 
The adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the Group and 
Company’s financial position or performance. IAS 1 (revised) resulted in a change in the 
manner in which the statements are presented. 
 
New standards not applied 
The IASB has issued the following relevant standards which are not yet effective and 
have not been adopted early for these financial statements: 
 
IFRS 3 (amended)  Business combinations, effective date 1 July 2010 
IFRS 7 (amended)  Disclosures, effective date 1 January 2011 
IFRS 9  Financial Instruments, effective date 1 January 
2013 
IAS 1 (amended)  Presentation of financial statements, effective date 
1 January 2011 
IAS 24 (revised)  Related party disclosure, effective date 1 January 
2011 
IAS 27 (amended)  Consolidated and separate financial statements, 
effective date 1 July 2010 
IAS 34 (amended)  Interim financial reporting, effective date 1 January 
2011 
  
The directors do not anticipate that adoption of these standards will have a material impact on 
the Group and Company’s financial position or performance. 
 
 Going concern 
 The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates 
continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 The Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial report on a going concern 
basis as they are confident that the Company will be able to raise additional funds through 
further debt or equity raisings when required. The Directors are of the opinion that the 
proposed debt or equity raising measures and the existing cash resources will provide 
sufficient funds to enable the Company to continue its operations for at least the next 12 
months. 
 
 Basis of consolidation 
 The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company 
and all Group undertakings. Control is achieved when the Company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its 
activities. 
 
 On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured 
at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.  
 
 Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair value of the identifiable net assets 
acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the period of 
acquisition. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the 
fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to the 
minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the 
parent.  34 
 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the 
consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date 
of disposal, as appropriate. 
 
 Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring 
the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. 
 
 All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
  
 Investments in associates 
 An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, 
but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee. 
 
 The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial 
statements using the equity method of accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the 
balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of 
the associates in excess of the Group’s interest in those associates are not recognised. 
 
 Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, unrealised profits and 
losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant associate. Losses 
may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate 
provision is made for impairment. 
 
 The Group and its associated undertakings have complied with the requirements of IFRS 6 
Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources.  
 
 Upon commencement of commercial production operation of a mining property, the investment 
in the associate company relating to that property is amortised on the basis of ore body 
extracted as a proportion of the ore body estimate of that property. 
 
 Revenue recognition 
Revenue and other operating income represent the provision of consultancy, management 
and office services for the year. 
 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the 
effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
 
Losses on current asset investments represent realised and unrealised losses. 
 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange 
prevailing on the dates of the individual transactions. For practical reasons, a rate that 
approximates to the actual rate at the date of the transaction is often used. At each balance 
sheet date, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are 
included in net profit or loss for the period. 
  35 
 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to 
the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as 
expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of. 
 
The following rates of exchange have been applied: 
 2011 2010 
1 US Dollar to 1 British  Pound   
Closing rate 0.6234 0.6637 
Average rate 0.6433 0.6276 
1 Philippine Peso to 1 British Pound   
Closing rate 0.0144 0.0147 
Average rate 0.0144 0.0135 
 
 Taxation 
The income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.  
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net 
profit as reported in the income statement, because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
  
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax 
bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable 
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the original 
recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor 
the accounting profit.  
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available 
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the 
liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
 
No recognition has been made for the deferred tax asset arising in respect of current losses as 
the directors are of the opinion that this may not be realisable in the foreseeable future. 
  36 
 
 Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
 
 Non-current intangible assets 
Non-current intangible assets are shown at cost less any provisions made in respect of 
impairment.  
 
 Asset impairments 
Assets are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date or if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review is 
conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of 
expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit or disposal value, if higher. 
 
If an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated 
recoverable amount. 
 
 Non-current asset investments 
Loan investments are shown at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value. 
Loan investments are recognised as an asset when sums are advanced. 
 
Property, plant and equipment 
Office equipment and furniture are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
recognised impairment loss. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over 
their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method on the following basis: 
 
Office furniture and fittings  33% - 50% 
Computer and office equipment 33% - 100% 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held at bank and on short term deposits. 
 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 
 
Trade receivables  
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced 
by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
 
Investments 
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an 
investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the 
timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including 
transaction costs.  
 
Investments are classified as held-for-trading and are measured at subsequent reporting dates 
at fair value. Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period. 
 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received except 
where those proceeds appear to be less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued, in 
which case the equity instruments are recorded at fair value. The difference between the 
proceeds received and the fair value is reflected in the share based payments reserve. 
 
The costs of issuing new equity are charged against the share premium account. 
  37 
 
 Operating leases 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line 
basis over the term of the lease. Where an incentive to sign the lease has been taken, the 
incentive is spread on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
 
Pension costs 
The Company makes defined contributions to the independent pension scheme of its 
employees. 
 
Share-based payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments. 
 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to directors, staff and certain 
professional advisors of the Group. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
 
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has 
been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. 
 
       Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty  
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies above, management necessarily 
makes judgments and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the financial statements. Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in 
a significant impact to the financial statements. The most critical of these accounting judgment 
and estimation areas are as follows: 
 
 Impairment of assets   
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of assets as at each balance sheet date, or if events 
or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the 
asset’s recoverable amount or value in use is estimated. Determining the value in use requires 
the determination of future cash flows expected to be generated from the continued use and 
ultimate disposal of the asset. This requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions 
that can materially affect the financial statements. Any resulting impairment loss could have a 
material adverse impact on the Group’s financial position and results of operations.

9. Loss per share 
  
 Including share of associates’ results 
Loss per share has been calculated by dividing the loss for the year after taxation including 
share of associates’ losses of £1,225,830 (2010: £863,997) attributable to the equity holders of 
the parent company of £4,388,197 (2010:  £1,772,838) by the weighted average number of 
shares in issue at the year end of 43,176,974 (2010: 37,439,972). 
 
Diluted loss per share has been calculated using the weighted average number of shares in 
issue at the year end, diluted for the effect of share options in existence at the year end of 
665,000 (2010: 790,000). 
 
Excluding share of associates’ results 
Loss per share has been calculated by dividing the loss for the year after taxation excluding 
share of associates losses of £1,225,830 (2010: £863,997) attributable to the equity holders of 
the parent company of £3,162,367 (2010: £908,841) by the weighted average number of

In April 2006, the Company subscribed for up to US$5 million in a three-year Loan Note in 
Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation (ACMDC), secured over ACMDC’s 
share of the Berong nickel project. The Note bears interest at the rate of 10% cumulative per 
annum and was repayable three years from each drawdown; it  is repayable out of ACMDC’s 
share of the Berong nickel project cash flow or is convertible into ACMDC shares or repayable 
in US$ cash (at the election of the Company). 
 
The principal amount advanced at 31 March 2011 was US$4,967,676 (2010 US$4,803,616). 
On 7 July 2010, the agreement was amended to extend repayments to four years from each 
drawdown. On 4 July 2011 the Company accepted an offer to settle the Loan Note in the 
amount of US$4,499,880 to be paid by ACMDC in three equal instalments at the ends of July, 
August and September 2011. The first instalment of US$1,500,000 was received on 29 July 
2011. The balance at 31 March 2011 of US$5,693,464 was written down to US$4,499,880, 
resulting in an impairment charge for the year of US$1,193,584 (£746,767).     
   
In 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to make a loan facility available to Brooks 
Nickel Ventures Inc. (Brooks) of up to US$2.5 million, secured over Brooks’ share of the Ipilan 
nickel project. This facility was subsequently increased in 2007 and in 2010 to US$10 million 
and terms extended from three to four years from each drawdown, to meet continuing pre-
operational exploration and working capital requirements. The loan bears interest at 10% 
cumulative per annum and is repayable out of Brooks’ share of the Ipilan nickel project 
operating cash flow. The principal amount advanced at 31 March 2011 was US$9,314,930 
(2010: US$8,174,930). At 31 March 2011, amounts totalling US$3,206,602 made up of 
principal drawn of US$2,137,421 and accrued interest of US$1,069,181 were due to be repaid. 
The Company is in discussions with Brooks in respect of addressing the repayments falling 
due.  
 
 Company and Group 
As repayments are linked to successful commercial exploitation of the Berong and Ipilan nickel 
projects respectively, the directors are of the opinion that it would be impractical to predict 
when these repayments might occur. The receivables are therefore shown at historical cost. 
 
Under the Celestial joint venture agreement, the Company has the option to take a 40% 
holding in Celestial Nickel Mining and Exploration Corporation (CNMEC). In August 2007, the 
board agreed to an advance of US$900,000 against the option exercise amount. If the 
Company decides not to exercise the option to purchase, or is prevented by any cause from 
exercising the option to purchase, then the borrowers are required to reimburse the advance. 
The advances are interest-free and guaranteed by CNMEC but are otherwise unsecured. Due 
to the uncertainty as to when, or if, the Company will exercise this option, the receivable has 
been shown at historical cost. 
 
Under the Berong venture agreement, the Company has advanced funds to Berong Nickel 
Corporation (BNC) to meet ongoing mine development costs. The total amount advanced at 
31 March 2011 was US$7,953,005 (2010: US$5,554,181). The loan amounts advanced are 
interest-free, unsecured and have no fixed terms of repayment.  As repayments are linked to 
successful commercial exploitation of the Berong nickel project, the directors are of the opinion 
that it would be impractical to predict when this receivable will be repaid and it is therefore 
shown at historical cost.  45

In April 2006, the Company subscribed for up to US$5 million in a three-year Loan Note in 
Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation (ACMDC), secured over ACMDC’s 
share of the Berong nickel project. The Note bears interest at the rate of 10% cumulative per 
annum and was repayable three years from each drawdown; it  is repayable out of ACMDC’s 
share of the Berong nickel project cash flow or is convertible into ACMDC shares or repayable 
in US$ cash (at the election of the Company). The principal amount advanced at 31 March 
2011 was US$4,967,676 (2010 US$4,803,616). On 7 July 2010, the agreement was amended 
to extend repayments to four years from each drawdown. On 4 July 2011, the Company 
accepted an offer to settle the Loan Note in the amount of US$4,499,880 to be paid by 
ACMDC in three equal instalments at the ends of July, August and September 2011. The first 
instalment of US$1,500,000 was received on 29 July 2011.

and terms extended from three to four years from each drawdown, to meet continuing pre-
operational exploration and working capital requirements. The loan bears interest at 10% 
cumulative per annum and is repayable out of Brooks’ share of the Ipilan nickel project 
operating cash flow. The principal amount advanced at 31 March 2011 was US$9,314,930 
(2010: US$8,174,930). 
 
Under the Celestial Venture Agreement, the Company has the option to take a 40% holding in

29.  Financial assets and liabilities 
 
 The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, loan investments and 
financial assets and various items such as trade receivables, trade payables, accruals and 
prepayments that arise directly from its operations. 
 
 The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. 
 
 The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing the level of risk arising from the 
Group’s financial instruments.  These are summarised below: 
 
   53 
 
Credit risk 
 Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations 
resulting in financial loss to the Company and Group, and arises principally from the 
consolidated entity’s loan receivables which are considered by the directors to be recoverable.  
 
 The carrying amounts of the financial assets recognised in the balance sheet best represents 
the Company and Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date. In respect of 
certain of the loans receivable the amounts are repayable from the borrower’s share of cash 
flows from the related mining projects (see note 13). No other collateral or security is held by 
the Company or Group in respect of these assets. The credit quality of all financial assets that 
are neither past due nor impaired is appropriate and is consistently monitored in order to 
identify any potential adverse changes in credit quality. There are no financial assets that have 
had renegotiated terms that would otherwise, without that renegotiation, have been past due 
or impaired at the balance sheet date. 
 
 Liquidity risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company and Group will not be able to meet its financial 
obligations as they fall due.  
 
 The Company and Group’s policy throughout the year has been to ensure that it has adequate 
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due by careful management of its working capital.

Market risk 
 Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as commodity prices, foreign    
exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Company’s and Group’s income 
or the value of its holdings in financial instruments. 
 
 Commodity price risk 
 The principal activity of the Company and the Group is the development of nickel mining 
properties in the Philippines and the principal market risk facing the Group is an adverse 
movement in the commodity price of nickel. 
 
 Any long-term adverse movement in this price would affect the commercial viability of the 
mining properties and hence the value of investments by the Company and the Group as a 
whole. 
 
 
 
   55 
 
 Foreign currency risk 
 The Group undertakes transactions principally in Sterling and US Dollars. While the Group 
continually monitors its exposure to movements in currency rates, it does not utilise hedging 
instruments to protect against currency risks. The main currency exposure risk to the 
Company is in relation to the US Dollar loan investments which are repayable in US Dollars. 
 
 Interest rate risk 
 The Group utilises cash deposits at variable rates of interest for a variety of short-term periods, 
depending on cash requirements. The rates are reviewed regularly and the best rate obtained 
in the context of the Group’s needs.  
 
 Extent and nature of financial instruments 
 The financial assets and liabilities held by the Company and Group at the period end are 
shown below together with their fair values. Fair values have been arrived at after due and 
careful consideration by the Company’s directors.

 Capital management 
 The Company’s capital consists wholly of ordinary shares. There are no other categories of 
shares in issue and the Company does not use any other financial instruments as capital 
substitutes or quasi capital. The Company manages its issued capital by considering future 
capital requirements of the Group which are largely dictated by the exploration and 
development of the mining properties in the Philippines and the head office overhead costs of 
the Company in London. The Company’s board of directors as a whole manages the capital by 
considering the need to raise further capital to meet the above costs on a rolling 12 month 
basis so as to enable the accounts to be prepared on a going concern basis but without 
unnecessary dilution of existing shareholder interests. The Board always places a priority on 
maximising the return to existing shareholders before raising further capital. 
 
 There are no externally imposed capital requirements on the Company. 
 
 Details of the ordinary share capital are set out in note 20.

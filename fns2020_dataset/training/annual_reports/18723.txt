The Hunters difference
STRATEGIC REPORT
Established  
brand
Established brand with strong 
reputation
Since the Company’s inception in 1992, 
Hunters has been recognised three 
times in the Sunday Times Best Small 
Companies to Work For survey; won the 
“Best Agent” in the Home Sale Network 
(now the Relocation Agent Network) 
twice; and secured Investors in People 
accreditation at Head Office level. This, 
alongside its strong reputation for good 
customer service and national marketing 
activity, has added stature to the brand.
 
Experienced  
team
An experienced management 
team with a long track record
The Group’s executive management has a 
long track record of operating both sales 
and lettings estate agencies, as owners and 
in developing estate agency franchises. This 
provides in-depth understanding of the 
skills required to manage an estate agency 
business and the challenges that their 
franchisees may encounter.  
Sales and lettings 
combined
Strength in both sales  
and lettings 
Senior management has considerable 
experience running both sales and 
lettings and we believe this puts the 
Group at the forefront for independent 
businesses looking to expand their 
business or develop additional  
revenue streams.
 
Positioned for 
growth
Proven track record of organic 
and acquisitive growth
Having opened its first franchising 
branch in 2006, the Group completed its 
acquisition of the former franchising arm of 
Countrywide plc in 2011. 
Hunters has driven growth organically, 
opening 63 branches in two years to 
December 2015 on top of its acquisition 
of the Country Properties franchised 
network. Network Income increased 
between 2008 and 2015 by a compound 
annual growth rate of 27% (2014: 24%).  
Nationwide 
footprint
A nationwide footprint 
throughout England
The Group has built a nationwide 
footprint over much of England. The 
Group is therefore not over-exposed 
to the performance of any one local 
property market. 
 
Robust model
Proven franchise business model
Start-up costs are borne by franchisees but 
the model makes use of investment made 
by Hunters. This generates scalable growth 
without committing significant capital. The 
franchise agreement(s) contains minimum 
monthly fee(s) due to the Group, regardless 
of the branch’s revenue, guaranteeing a 
minimum level of revenue. 
The Group benefits from having owned 
branches through which it can trial and 
adapt new concepts before rolling them 
out across the network.
The Group implements a rigorous 
Franchisee selection process so as to 
ensure, as far as is possible, that new 
Franchisees are committed to the Group’s 
high standards. Underperforming branches 
can often be reinvigorated through either 
extended training or, if applicable, the sale 
of a franchise to a new team or individual.
The Directors believe that the Group has a number of key strengths underpinning 
past success and promoting strong prospects for growth.

“2015 – Network Income 
has grown by 42%”
Having added 63 branches organically 
in the two years to 2015, we see an 
attractive opportunity to expand 
further our network with new 
franchised branches. As one of the 
largest estate agency and lettings 
networks in the UK, the Group has 
developed sufficient infrastructure and 
support functions to manage a larger 
business. The Directors believe that 
a significant increase in the franchise 
network would require a materially 
smaller increase in central management 
resource whilst providing enhanced 
operational leverage.
“We aim to add up to  
25 agency businesses to  
the network each year. ”
As well as growth of the Group’s network, 
the Directors target an average of 10% 
annual revenue growth from franchisees. 
Strategies for increasing revenue at branch 
level include introducing sales services to 
branches with strong lettings businesses 
and vice versa; the improvement of 
operating practices; and on-going training 
of staff. The average revenue per branch 
increased in this year by 5.6% to £178,000 
(2014: £168,000). The top 25 highest 
revenue branches grew by 12% averaging 
£427,000 (2014: £382,000). 
Our acquisition strategy is designed 
to complement the Group’s network 
and reinforce our geographical and 
strategic reach. Notable acquisitions 
include Countrywide’s former franchise 
operation (acquired in 2011), Hunters 
in the West Midlands (2014) and 
Country Properties, in and around 
Hertfordshire (2015).
The drive for market consolidation 
is covered by both organic growth 
conversions and the opportunity 
for acquisition.
Our objective is to become the UK’s favourite estate agency.
To achieve this goal we plan to pursue organic growth by adding franchise branches to our network and by increasing average 
performance of existing branches through a focus on customer and staff satisfaction, resulting in high levels of retention and 
recommendation. We will complement our organic growth initiatives by seeking targeted acquisitions.

REVENUE
Group revenue for the financial year ended  
31 December 2015 increased by 31% to  
£12.0 million (2014: £9.2 million). This was  
driven by the following factors:
•  First full-year contribution of Hunters Group 
Limited, since they joined the Group in July 
2014. This added £1.8 million of revenue to the 
Group in 2015
•  The acquisition of Country Properties,  
a 23 branch network in and around 
Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and 
Cambridgeshire in May 2015, adding  
£0.2 million of management service fee  
(“MSF”) revenue in 2015
•  MSF from franchised branches, excluding 
Country Properties acquisition, increased by  
29% following the opening of a further 32 new 
branches in 2015. These new branches were a 
mixture of new cold start branches and existing 
branches converting to the Hunters brand
ADJUSTED EBITDA (earnings before 
interest, tax, one off costs and 
depreciation/amortisation) 
Adjusted EBITDA provides a key measure of 
progress made. Adjusted EBITDA for the year to 
December 2015 was £1.57 million, an increase  
of 46% on the same period last year  
(2014: £1.08 million). 
Administrative expenses increased by £2.4 million 
during the year. Higher costs in 2015 were in part 
due to the additional running costs associated with 
being a publically quoted company and also the 
first full year of costs for Hunters Group Limited.
ADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX 
(adjusted to exclude amortisation, 
amortised finance costs, acquisition 
costs, one off costs and finance income)
Adjusted profit before tax was £1.42 million,  
an increase of 59% over the prior period  
(2014: £0.89 million). 
Amortisation and acquisition costs increased 
significantly during the period, as the Group 
continued to execute its strategy of growth 
through acquisition.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share for the year ended  
31 December 2015 was 2.76p (2014: 1.78p) based 
on a weighted average of 26,317,492 shares  
(2014: 21,292,330) in issue during the year. 
ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Adjusted earnings per share, excluding 
amortisation and acquisition costs, finance timing 
and investment income and using standard tax 
rates for the year to December 2015, was 4.74p 
(2014: 3.63p).
DIVIDENDS
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 1.00p 
per share for 2015, which subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM on the 17 June 2016, will be 
paid to shareholders by 23 June 2016 based on 
the register of shareholders as at 13 May 2016. 
Taking this together with the interim dividend of 
0.5p paid to shareholders on 28 October 2015, 
this equates to a total dividend for the year of 
1.50p. The Company intends to pay a progressive 
dividend going forwards.
 
LIQUIDITY
The Group had cash balances of £1.2 million  
at 31 December 2015 (2014: £1.1 million). 
Since the year end the Group has secured 
further debt funding of £1.2 million to support 
the ongoing expansion of its franchising activities. 
The facility is repayable in full in April 2020, with 
repayments to be made in monthly instalments 
from 13 months after the first drawdown. 
Total bank facilities available to the Group are 
£2.9 million of which £1.7 million is drawn.
FINANCIAL POSITION
The Group has generated strong cashflow from 
operations which is expected to continue in 2016. 
These cashflows, together with undrawn facilities 
available, ensure the Group is in a strong financial 
position from which to carry out its strategy to 
grow the franchise business both organically and 
through acquisition in the coming year.

Our goal is to grow the brand to become the

by expanding our network through organic  
growth and acquisition, we look forward to 
achieving this objective.

When Kevin Hollinrake and John Waterhouse 
established Hunters in 1992, their vision was to 
develop the brand to become the largest estate 
agency group in the UK. 24 years later, they and 
their founding vision remain active within the 
Company and instrumental to its success.
Hunters grew organically, offering sales and 
lettings through 10 owned branches. 2005 
saw the beginning of a new phase with the 
development of its franchising expansion which, 
together with strategic acquisition, has seen the 
network grow to its current size. 
The services offered cover residential sales; 
lettings; buy-to-let and investment; residential 
block management; land and new homes; 
franchising and other property related services. 
Hunters has won more than 30 awards; 
maintained Investor in People certification for 
more than a decade; twice been voted Best UK 
Estate Agent by the Home Sale Network (now 
the Relocation Agent Network) and featured in 
the Sunday Times Best 100 Companies. STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OVERVIEW
Following our admission to the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange in July 
2015, we are delighted to report our maiden full-year results as a public company. 
2015 saw a step forward in pursuit of the Group’s 
clear ambition to become the nation’s favourite 
estate agent. We secured additional capital, 
added 32 new branches to the network including 
23 independent businesses and added another 
23 branches through the purchase of a highly 
successful home-counties franchised estate agency 
chain, Country Properties. At the end of the year 
the network had reached 170 branches. Having 
opened 63 branches in the last two years through 
organic growth, we are without doubt the fastest 
growing listed business in our sector.
Income across the network from sales and lettings 
("Network Income") reached £30.2 million in 
2015 (2014: £21.2 million), a 42% increase on the 
previous year. Our average branch revenue rose 
by 5.6% to £178,000 (2014: £168,000). This was a 
tremendous achievement against the background 
of a more subdued market with national activity 
reported as having reduced by 3.4% for the year
1
.
Our adjusted EBITDA reached £1.57 million  
(2014: £1.08 million), an increase of 46% on the 
previous year. Adjusted EPS grew 31% to 4.74p 
(2014: 3.63p).
Independent agents that converted to the Hunters 
brand, for whom 2015 was their first full year 
as part of the network, increased revenue per 
branch by 29%; a clear illustration that our quality, 
well known national brand and good reputation 
has delivered improved income for our network 
partners, as well as significantly reducing the 
cost of key repeat purchases, such as portal 
subscriptions, through our economies of scale  
and purchasing power. 
We continue to invest in our people, IT, marketing 
and networks. We retain Investors in People 
status for our Group owned activities and our 
national training courses include accreditations 
from The Institute of Leadership and Management 
and City & Guilds. Our market-leading software, 
designed specifically for our business by an in-
house team of former agents, continues to move 
forward. We have invested over £500,000 in its 
development and we are able now to reinvest 
profits generated from licence fees payable by the 
network to accelerate and enhance its features 
and improve our online functionality and customer 
experience. The inaugural launch of our national 
TV advertising campaign took place in January 
2015. Website traffic for 2015 rose by over 23%. 
1 Source: 2016 Market Trend Data, Land Registry 30 March 2016
The 'Here to get you there’ marketing campaign 
has proved successful and will continue to be our 
message in the year ahead.
The Hunters (West Midlands) business acquired 
in 2014 continues to exceed our expectations, 
winning Best Medium-Sized Agent in the Midlands 
for the fourth year in a row. Business levels and 
financial results are in line with expectations.
Customer satisfaction will always be a key measure 
and I am delighted to confirm that we achieved a 
96% customer satisfaction rating for the year.  
Our success in the area has been increasing year-
on-year since 2012 and is significantly higher than 
the industry average of 73%
2
. There is a universal 
commitment within the network to deliver for 
our customers, which underpins our belief that 
business owners will work harder and deliver 
better results than a network consisting principally 
of employees or self-employed operatives on 
short term contracts. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank everyone in the network 
who has worked so hard to deliver these amazing 
results, and our customer service team for going 
well beyond the call of duty to contact our clients 
and listen to their experiences. 
OUTLOOK
Reports show that market activity levels so far 
this year are 14.1% higher compared to the same 
period last year
3
. The first quarter has started 
well, with seven new branches opened, revenue 
ahead of Q1 2015 and having grown by more 
than general market activity. Our pipeline of new 
outlets is running significantly ahead of 2015. I look 
forward to updating you as the year progresses.
The Company is committed to 
a progressive dividend policy 
and proposes therefore a final 
dividend of 1.00p per share, 
making 1.50p for 2015 in total.

Hunters has driven growth organically, 
opening 63 branches in two years to 
December 2015 on top of its acquisition 
of the Country Properties franchised 
network. Network Income increased 
between 2008 and 2015 by a compound 
annual growth rate of 27% (2014: 24%).  
Nationwide 
footprint
A nationwide footprint 
throughout England
The Group has built a nationwide 
footprint over much of England. The 
Group is therefore not over-exposed 
to the performance of any one local 
property market. 
 
Robust model
Proven franchise business model
Start-up costs are borne by franchisees but 
the model makes use of investment made 
by Hunters. This generates scalable growth 
without committing significant capital. The 
franchise agreement(s) contains minimum 
monthly fee(s) due to the Group, regardless 
of the branch’s revenue, guaranteeing a 
minimum level of revenue. 
The Group benefits from having owned 
branches through which it can trial and 
adapt new concepts before rolling them 
out across the network.
The Group implements a rigorous 
Franchisee selection process so as to 
ensure, as far as is possible, that new 
Franchisees are committed to the Group’s 
high standards. Underperforming branches 
can often be reinvigorated through either 
extended training or, if applicable, the sale 
of a franchise to a new team or individual.
The Directors believe that the Group has a number of key strengths underpinning 
past success and promoting strong prospects for growth.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE
Individual franchisees and independent 
businesses benefit from centralised support 
services and improved buying rates, for 
example for portals, as compared to 
individual branch costs resulting in  
significant savings.
TRAINING
The Hunters Training Academy was 
established in 2006 and provides a 
combination of classroom training, 
E-Learning courses and video-based training. 
The courses have been written and designed 
by estate agents for estate agents, are 
suitable for first entrants in to the world 
of estate agency and progress through to 
specialised skills for career progression, 
including a suite of management training 
programmes. The classroom-based courses 
are interactive and designed for experienced 
and non-experienced staff alike and become 
a forum for interaction between staff from 
different branches nationwide, helping to 
create the team culture for which Hunters 
is renowned.
 
72 class room training courses took place in 
2015, covering over 500 delegates together 
with 2,280 E-Learning courses. In the year 
91% of attendees gave the courses 100% 
satisfaction with the maximum 6 points. 
LEGISLATION
There are 145 pieces of legislation that 
lettings agents must comply with ranging 
from the Deregulation Act (1 October 
2015) and Consumer Protection Act to  
the Anti Money Laundering and Right to 
Rent Act (1 February 2016)

. Being part of 
the Hunters network ensures compliance 
whilst alleviating the increasing strain of 
investigation and research that independent 
agents face in order to be compliant. 
REVENUE GROWTH
Independent agents that converted to

“2015 – Network Income 
has grown by 42%”
Having added 63 branches organically 
in the two years to 2015, we see an 
attractive opportunity to expand 
further our network with new 
franchised branches. As one of the 
largest estate agency and lettings 
networks in the UK, the Group has 
developed sufficient infrastructure and 
support functions to manage a larger 
business. The Directors believe that 
a significant increase in the franchise 
network would require a materially 
smaller increase in central management 
resource whilst providing enhanced 
operational leverage.
“We aim to add up to  
25 agency businesses to  
the network each year. ”
As well as growth of the Group’s network, 
the Directors target an average of 10% 
annual revenue growth from franchisees. 
Strategies for increasing revenue at branch 
level include introducing sales services to 
branches with strong lettings businesses 
and vice versa; the improvement of 
operating practices; and on-going training 
of staff. The average revenue per branch 
increased in this year by 5.6% to £178,000 
(2014: £168,000). The top 25 highest 
revenue branches grew by 12% averaging 
£427,000 (2014: £382,000). 
Our acquisition strategy is designed 
to complement the Group’s network 
and reinforce our geographical and 
strategic reach. Notable acquisitions 
include Countrywide’s former franchise 
operation (acquired in 2011), Hunters 
in the West Midlands (2014) and 
Country Properties, in and around 
Hertfordshire (2015).
The drive for market consolidation 
is covered by both organic growth 
conversions and the opportunity 
for acquisition.
Our objective is to become the UK’s favourite estate agency.
To achieve this goal we plan to pursue organic growth by adding franchise branches to our network and by increasing average 
performance of existing branches through a focus on customer and staff satisfaction, resulting in high levels of retention and 
recommendation. We will complement our organic growth initiatives by seeking targeted acquisitions.

STRATEGIC REPORT
As we reported in our January trading update, the United Kingdom property 
market experienced various challenges during 2015, with the principal issues 
being consumer uncertainty in advance of the May General Election and a 
shortage of homes to sell or let afterwards.
Major stamp duty increases on the purchase 
of more expensive homes adversely affected 
demand, particularly for properties over  
£2 million, but this has had little impact on the 
Group as we have limited exposure to prime 
Central London. 
Despite these tougher market conditions the 
Group has, aided by the additional branches 
added to the network throughout the year, 
performed very well and increased the Company's 
market share of homes sold and let, resulting 
in material increases in both turnover and  
pre-tax profitability. 
Activity in 2016, despite an 
ongoing shortage of property for 
sale or to let, the uncertainty of 
the EU Referendum and ever-
increasing levels of competition 
between traditional and online-
only agents, looks promising.
We entered the year with a substantially increased 
pipeline, with good ongoing buyer and tenant 
demand and a Government that is openly very 
supportive of accelerated new home-building and 
ownership. We are therefore well set to deliver 
another successful year.
Delivering outstanding customer service is at the 
heart of our operation. At exchange of a property 
or at the let of a property a vendor or landlord is 
contacted by a member of our customer service 
team. In 2015, 3,121 customers provided feedback 
resulting in a 96% customer satisfaction rating.
Maintaining the quality of the network is key to 
our success. We started the year with 126 branch 
locations. We received 244 enquiries resulting in 
32 new openings under the Hunters brand. These 
openings consisted of 23 conversions of existing 
independent estate agency businesses and nine 
new “cold start” locations, of which four were 
current franchisees expanding into new markets. 
The Group implements a rigorous franchisee 
selection process. This ensures, as far as is 
possible, that new franchisees are committed 
to the Group’s high standards. Approximately 
80% are rejected at an early stage. Additionally, 
underperforming branches can be reinvigorated 
through training and support or alternatively the 
sale of a franchise to a new team or individual. 
With the addition of 23 Country Properties 
franchise locations, Hunters Property Plc finished 
the year with a total network of 170 branches.
Expansion was inevitably linked to our ability 
as a network to respond to developing market 
conditions. For this reason the Group also 
established relationships with experts in both

and now have offerings for both services

Franchise prospects for 2016 have started well, 
with a proceeding pipeline of 21 new branches 
being processed and enquiry levels on target 
to exceed those of 2015. Investment has been 
made to improve the general branding of Hunters 
Franchising. A full marketing plan is in place, 
heavily focused on direct marketing to suitable 
independent businesses, increased online presence 
and existing franchisee expansion.
It is expected that 2016 will see continued 
network growth, both through conversions of 
existing businesses and cold starts. Hunters’ 
market leading conversion package is designed to 
allow independent agencies to join with minimal 
cost, whilst benefiting from a full estate agency 
package which provides an average revenue 
growth of 29% in the first full year. Conversions 
are expected to account for a significant portion 
of branch growth. 
Our excellent results could not have been 
achieved without sterling efforts from our 
employees and franchise colleagues. We believe 
that we have some truly outstanding industry 
professionals associated with the business and are 
grateful to them for their dedication to Hunters.

REVENUE
Group revenue for the financial year ended  
31 December 2015 increased by 31% to  
£12.0 million (2014: £9.2 million). This was  
driven by the following factors:
•  First full-year contribution of Hunters Group 
Limited, since they joined the Group in July 
2014. This added £1.8 million of revenue to the 
Group in 2015
•  The acquisition of Country Properties,  
a 23 branch network in and around 
Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and 
Cambridgeshire in May 2015, adding  
£0.2 million of management service fee  
(“MSF”) revenue in 2015
•  MSF from franchised branches, excluding 
Country Properties acquisition, increased by  
29% following the opening of a further 32 new 
branches in 2015. These new branches were a 
mixture of new cold start branches and existing 
branches converting to the Hunters brand
ADJUSTED EBITDA (earnings before 
interest, tax, one off costs and 
depreciation/amortisation) 
Adjusted EBITDA provides a key measure of 
progress made. Adjusted EBITDA for the year to 
December 2015 was £1.57 million, an increase  
of 46% on the same period last year  
(2014: £1.08 million). 
Administrative expenses increased by £2.4 million 
during the year. Higher costs in 2015 were in part 
due to the additional running costs associated with 
being a publically quoted company and also the 
first full year of costs for Hunters Group Limited.
ADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX 
(adjusted to exclude amortisation, 
amortised finance costs, acquisition 
costs, one off costs and finance income)
Adjusted profit before tax was £1.42 million,  
an increase of 59% over the prior period  
(2014: £0.89 million). 
Amortisation and acquisition costs increased 
significantly during the period, as the Group 
continued to execute its strategy of growth 
through acquisition.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share for the year ended  
31 December 2015 was 2.76p (2014: 1.78p) based 
on a weighted average of 26,317,492 shares  
(2014: 21,292,330) in issue during the year. 
ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Adjusted earnings per share, excluding 
amortisation and acquisition costs, finance timing 
and investment income and using standard tax 
rates for the year to December 2015, was 4.74p 
(2014: 3.63p).
DIVIDENDS
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 1.00p 
per share for 2015, which subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM on the 17 June 2016, will be 
paid to shareholders by 23 June 2016 based on 
the register of shareholders as at 13 May 2016. 
Taking this together with the interim dividend of 
0.5p paid to shareholders on 28 October 2015, 
this equates to a total dividend for the year of 
1.50p. The Company intends to pay a progressive 
dividend going forwards.
 
LIQUIDITY
The Group had cash balances of £1.2 million  
at 31 December 2015 (2014: £1.1 million). 
Since the year end the Group has secured 
further debt funding of £1.2 million to support 
the ongoing expansion of its franchising activities. 
The facility is repayable in full in April 2020, with 
repayments to be made in monthly instalments 
from 13 months after the first drawdown. 
Total bank facilities available to the Group are 
£2.9 million of which £1.7 million is drawn.
FINANCIAL POSITION
The Group has generated strong cashflow from 
operations which is expected to continue in 2016. 
These cashflows, together with undrawn facilities 
available, ensure the Group is in a strong financial 
position from which to carry out its strategy to 
grow the franchise business both organically and 
through acquisition in the coming year.

Principal risks
STRATEGIC REPORT
THE HOUSING MARKET
The Group is exposed to material 
fluctuations in the housing market. In a falling 
or low-volume market, there is a reduction 
in the number of transactions resulting in 
increased competition which puts additional 
pressure on fees, leading to lower revenues 
on a smaller number of transactions. The 
Group mitigates these effects by:
• Retaining both sales and lettings disciplines 
across its network
• Growing the number of branches in the network
• Improving the performance of branches 
across the network
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL 
ENVIRONMENT
General economic conditions, including 
movements in interest and inflation rates in 
the Group’s markets may have an adverse 
effect on the Group’s activities. The Group 
may be exposed to risks such as unexpected 
changes in regulatory requirements, longer 
payment cycles, problems in collecting debts, 
fluctuations in currency rates and potentially 
adverse tax consequences. The Group’s 
operations, business and profitability could be 
affected by these factors, which are beyond 
the control of the Group, and the property 
market as a whole may also be subject to 
political uncertainties. The Group employs 
the same strategies in relation to the market 
whilst focussing on a market leading customer 
service proposition. 
ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN 
SKILLED FRANCHISEES
The ability of the Group to attract new 
Franchisees with the appropriate expertise 
and skills, in available and suitable locations, 
cannot be guaranteed. The Group retains a 
robust selection process to reduce the risk of 
failure. The Company conducts checks on the 
suitability of its prospective Franchisees and 
maintains ongoing training and monitoring. 
The Group may experience difficulties in 
finding appropriate Franchisees and the 
failure to do so may have a detrimental effect 
upon trading performance.
REPUTATION
The Group takes extremely seriously the 
protection of its reputation and its brand. 
One of the ways it seeks to protect both is 
through the continuous audit programme it 
operates, which tests the financial probity of 
its Franchisees and periodically audits other 
aspects of the franchise system. However it 
is possible that a Franchisee may from time 
to time behave in a way that potentially 
damages the Group, for example, by retaining 
tenants’ deposits outside the government-
endorsed tenancy deposit protection scheme. 
The Directors believe that the provisions of 
the Company’s franchise agreement ensure 
the Company can control its Franchisees’ 
activities sufficiently to protect its brand and 
to take swift action against such practices but 
there can be no guarantee that it will always 
succeed in taking preventative action.
The Company conducts extensive checks on 
the suitability of its prospective Franchisees 
but it cannot be entirely certain that a 
Franchisee does not have some potentially 
embarrassing adverse history which may 
come to light and which risks damaging the 
reputation of the brand. 
The Group’s business and its success is highly 
dependent on both the service it and its 
Franchisees provide. Failure by either the 
Group of its Franchisees to meet the required 
levels of service or any diminution in client 
satisfaction and loyalty and/or regulatory 
breaches or alleged breaches, criticisms of its 
services or litigation may damage the Group’s 
reputation and may have a material adverse 
impact on the Group’s business, operations 
and financial performance.

  Remuneration Committee
Experienced 
management team
The Group’s executive management has a long track record of operating both sales 
and lettings estate agencies, as owners and in developing estate agency franchises. 
This provides in-depth understanding of the skills required to manage an estate 
agency business and the challenges that their franchisees may encounter. 
The Group’s founders have over 20 years’ experience in the UK estate  
agency market and remain involved in the business, providing insight  
and management expertise. 
Harry Hill, who was appointed Chief Executive 
of the Group in March 2015, has extensive 
experience in the estate agency sector, having 
been the Chief Executive and Chairman of 
Countrywide plc from 1986 to 2009, taking it 
through its listing on the London Stock Exchange 
and its £1billion sale to private equity house, 
Apollo Global Management, in 2007. The Group’s 
other senior managers have a diverse range of 
experience drawn from previous roles in the 
UK estate agency market, financial services, and 
global business. The Board believes that this 
combination of skills provides the Group with 
excellent thought leadership and the drive to 
achieve its strategic goals.
Brief biographical details of the Directors and 
senior managers are set out below. STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
25 26 HUNTERS PROPERTY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance and comply 
with the QCA Corporate Governance Code to the extent appropriate for a 
company of its size. The QCA Corporate Governance Code has been devised by 
the Quoted Companies Alliance and sets out for smaller quoted companies and, in 
particular, AIM companies how they can apply the principles of good governance 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code to their own circumstances. 
An alternative code was proposed because the 
QCA considers the UK Corporate Governance 
Code to be inappropriate to many AIM 
companies, having been written principally 
for larger listed companies. The QCA Code 
states that: “The objective of good corporate 
governance is to deliver growth in long-term 
shareholder value by maintaining a flexible, 
efficient and effective management framework 
within an entrepreneurial environment.”
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Currently the Board consists of five Directors 
(including the Chairman). The performance of the 
Directors is evaluated on an ongoing basis.
The Board meets at least ten times a year 
and has full and timely access to all relevant 
information to enable it to carry out its duties. 
The Board regularly reviews and oversees the 
Group’s progress towards its goals. The Board 
monitors the implementation of its strategy whilst 
delegating the day-to-day operations to Executive 
Directors and management.
Processes are in place to ensure the Board has the 
access it requires to advisors and the Company 
Secretary to keep up to date with corporate 
governance matters and that applicable rules and 
regulations are followed.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities 
to the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
The Board considers that all the members of 
each committee have the appropriate experience 
required of them without having conflicts 
of interest.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee comprises Dean Fielding 
(Chairman) and Harry Hill. The Audit Committee 
meets at least twice a year and is responsible for 
ensuring that the financial performance of the 
Company is properly reported on and monitored, 
including reviews of the annual and interim 
accounts, results announcements, internal control 
systems and procedures and accounting policies.
The Audit Committee also has responsibility for 
recommending the appointment of the external 
auditor. In carrying out this responsibility the 
Audit Committee reviews the cost-effectiveness, 
independence and objectivity of the current 
proposed auditors. During the period, the Audit 
Committee appointed Mazars LLP as the new 
auditors for the Group. Mazars LLP have not 
provided any non-audit services to the Group 
save for their role before appointment as 
Independent Reporting Accountant regarding  
the Admission to AIM.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by 
Dean Fielding and its other members are Kevin 
Hollinrake and Harry Hill. The Remuneration 
Committee meet at least twice a year. The 
Remuneration Committee has responsibility for 
determining, within agreed terms of reference, 
the Group’s policy on the remuneration of 
senior executives and specific remuneration 
packages for the Executive Directors. It is also 
responsible for making recommendations as to 
the adoption of share options schemes and long-
term incentive plans for senior executives and for 
grants under such schemes or plans to individual 
senior executives.
Details of the Directors’ remuneration are 
disclosed in the notes to the accounts.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for ensuring there 
is an adequate system of internal control and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system 
is designed to mitigate risk to an acceptable 
level rather than eliminate internal control 
risks completely. These internal controls 
include controls over financial, operational and 
compliance risk factors. The Board is satisfied that 
the current level of internal control meets the 
needs of the Group and reduces its exposure to 
risk to an appropriate level.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
Clear financial reporting procedures have been 
established which ensure the Board have access 
to reliable and timely financial reports on a weekly 
and monthly basis. Financial reporting includes 
monitoring performance against budget and prior 
year results as well as cashflow forecasts.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Employees – the Group believes in equal 
opportunities and people’s development. The 
Group appoints based entirely on merit regardless 
of gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, 
religion, nationality, ethnicity or disability. Where 
employees become disabled, the Group looks 
where possible to adjust the environment to 
accommodate the same. 
Communication – the Group sees 
communication as key with its customers and that 
philosophy extends from the way we deal with 
both employees and our franchise network. We 
hold regular meetings and conferences, provide 
regular updates through our intranet underpinning 
developments and encourage the sharing of 
information and help. 
Anti-bribery policy – the Group operates a 
zero tolerance towards bribery.
Legislative Compliance – the Group 
conforms with all relevant legislation and codes of 
and best practice and this is monitored regularly 
by the Board. The Group appreciates the social 
and environmental impact its decisions can make 
and considers these as part of its decision making 
process. The Group takes the overall impact that 
it has long-term very seriously.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company maintains open communications 
with its Shareholders and provides up to date 
information through market announcements 
and website postings. Copies of all results and 
announcements are available online on the 
Company website, www.hunters.com/investor-

Board of Directors. The AGM is set for 10:00am 
17 June 2016 at our Head Office, Apollo House,

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and the 
Group and Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
Group and Parent Company financial statements 
for each financial year. As required by the 
AIM rules of the London Stock Exchange they 
are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the Parent Company financial statements 
on the same basis. 
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company 
and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
•  select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently; 
•  make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
•  state whether IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements;
•  provide additional disclosures when compliance 
with specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient 
to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to 
presume that the Group and Parent Company 
will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the Group’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the Group and the Company to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate and 
financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
AUDITORS
Mazars LLP were appointed auditors of the 
Company during the financial year. In accordance 
with S489 of the Companies Act 2006, a proposal 
for reappointment of the auditors will be put 
forward at the Company’s AGM.
STATEMENT OF DISCLOSURE TO 
AUDITORS
So far as each person who was a Director at 
the date of approving this report is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware. Additionally, the 
Directors individually have taken all the necessary 
steps that they ought to have taken as Directors 
in order to make themselves aware of all relevant 
audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

1.  On 27 March 2015 the Group enacted a share-for-share exchange to include Hunters Property Plc as the Parent, as disclosed further 
in note 1.2. This resulted in a share capital being issued and the Company owning an investment.
2.  Included within costs of issue of new shares were costs of £200,000 which were themselves settled by way of the issue of shares  
at a premium.
Company Statement of Cash Flows
The Company has not held any cash or cash-equivalents during the year or as at 31 December 2015. During the year it has entered 
into a number of equity transactions which are set out in the above but which are enacted via intercompany accounts for the Company. 
Accordingly, the Directors have not presented a Company Statement of Cash Flows.
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Company information
Hunters Property Plc (“the Company”) is a public limited company domiciled and incorporated in England and Wales. The registered  
office is Apollo House, Eboracum Way, York, North Yorkshire, YO31 7RE. The consolidated financial information (or “financial 
statements”) incorporate the financial information of the Company and entities (its subsidiaries) controlled by the Company (collectively 
comprising the “Group”).
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of property services to consumers and businesses which include sales, lettings, 
franchising and related services.
1.1 Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union, and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the Parent Company. Monetary amounts in these 
financial statements are rounded to the nearest £’000s.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments at fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
As permitted by s408 Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income statement and related notes. The Company’s 
profit for the year was £201,684.
1.2 Basis of consolidation
The Group financial information consolidates those of the Parent Company and the subsidiaries that the Parent has control of. Control is 
established when the Parent is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary.
Where a subsidiary is acquired/disposed of during the year, the consolidated profits or losses are recognised from/until the effective date  
of the acquisition/disposal.
All inter-company balances and transactions between Group companies have been eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial information of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group.
Non-controlling interests, presented as part of equity, represent the portion of a subsidiary’s profit or loss and net assets that are not  
held by the Group. The Group attributes total comprehensive income or loss of subsidiaries between the owners of the Parent and the 
non-controlling interest based on their respective ownership interests.
The Group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations enacted after the date of creation of the Group 
following incorporation of Hunters Property Plc, as detailed further below. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control 
of a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair value of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group  
to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
The Group recognises identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination regardless of whether they have been 
previously recognised in the acquired subsidiary’s financial information prior to the acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are 
measured at their acquisition-date fair values.
Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of identifiable intangible assets. It is calculated as the excess of the fair value of consideration 
transferred, over the Group’s share of the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net assets. If the fair values of identifiable net assets 
exceed the sum calculated above, the excess amount (i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other 
components of equity while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value. STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2015
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The Group has applied the principles of merger accounting in consolidating the results, as control was only acquired by Hunters Property 
Plc via a share-for-share exchange on 27 March 2015. Merger accounting requires that the results of the Group are presented as if the 
Group has always been in its present form, and does not require a re-evaluation of fair values as at the point of acquisition. Accordingly, for 
the Group’s comparative statement of financial position as at 31 December 2014, a merger reserve has been created which represents the 
difference between the net assets of the Group as at that date, and the retained profits recognised by the Group as at that date.
1.3 Going concern
As at the year end the Group has net current liabilities, but net assets overall. The nature of the Group’s trade is that there exist significant 
intangibles which generate strong cashflows, and are expected to continue doing so. Since the year end the Group has also secured further 
medium-term debt funding of £1.2million; including this the Directors have further considered 12 month cashflow forecasts from the date 
of approval of the financial statements, and do not foresee any cashflow issues arising.
Taking these factors into account, as at the time of approving the financial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus the Directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
1.4 Revenue
Revenue represents the amount receivable for the provision of services and the sale of goods during the year, excluding VAT and trade 
discounts. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be 
measured reliably.
Revenue from residential, commercial and land sales is recognised on the basis of exchange of contract. Financial services revenue is 
recognised at the later of the policy inception date or confirmation of entitlement to the commission.
Revenue from commission earned as letting agents is recognised in the month in which the income is received and when there is fulfilment 
of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions.
At inception of a franchisee contract, revenue is recognised upfront which matches to the estimated cost of time and knowledge to create 
the franchiser-franchisee contractual arrangement. No amounts are deferred as the Directors are of the opinion that virtually all inception 
costs are incurred at the outset, and hence although contracts run for several years this policy is considered to be the fairest presentation 
to comply with the matching and accruals concepts.
Revenue from franchisee management service fees are recognised monthly in arrears, calculated by reference to the terms of the contract 
and the value of sales attributable to each franchisee.
Deferred income arises where services are invoiced in advance of performance. The amount is released to the profit or loss in subsequent 
periods in reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date.
1.5 Intangible fixed assets – goodwill
Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually 
identifiable and separately recognised. See Note 15 for information on how goodwill is initially determined during the period. After initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. See Note 1.9 for a description of impairment testing procedures.
1.6 Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. Where intangible assets are acquired as part of a business combination, cost is determined 
by reference to a fair value estimation technique as disclosed further in note 15. After initial recognition, intangible assets are recognised  
at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The depreciable amount of an intangible asset with a finite useful life is allocated on a systematic basis over its useful life. Amortisation 
begins when the asset is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life is reviewed each financial year-end.  
If the expected useful life of the asset is different from previous estimates, the amortisation period is changed accordingly.
Research expenditure is written off against profits in the year in which it is incurred. Identifiable development expenditure is capitalised  
to the extent that the technical, commercial and financial feasibility can be demonstrated.
Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives on the  
following bases:
Software 3 years or over the life of the license 
Franchise development costs Over the life of the franchise contract (typically 10–15 years)  
Brands 10 years 
Customer lists 2–12 years
1.7 Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are recognised as an asset only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item  
will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
An item of property, plant and equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset is measured at its cost. Cost of an item of property, 
plant and equipment comprises the purchase price, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
After recognition, all property, plant and equipment are carried at costs less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of assets, less estimated residual value, over their expected useful  
lives on the following basis: 
Leasehold land and buildings Straight line over the life of the lease 
Plant and machinery 25% Reducing balance 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 25% Reducing balance or 10%–33% straight line 
Computer equipment 33% Straight line  
Motor vehicles 25% Straight line 
The residual value and the useful life of an asset are reviewed at least at each financial year-end and if expectations differ from previous 
estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors.
Gains or losses arising on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds 
and the carrying value of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss.
1.8 Non-current investments
Investments in equity instruments that have a quoted market price in an active market and other equity instruments whose fair value can 
be reliably measured are measured at fair value; otherwise investments in equity instruments are measured at cost.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as 
to obtain benefits from its activities.
1.9 Impairment of non-current assets
For impairment assessment purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash flows. As a 
result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those 
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and represent the lowest level within 
the Group at which management monitors goodwill.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually. All other individual assets or 
cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not 
be recoverable.
An asset or cash-generating unit is impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
measured as the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. The value in use is calculated as being net projected cash flows 
based on financial forecasts discounted back to present value.
The impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the asset, first against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to 
the cash-generating unit, and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no 
longer exist. An impairment loss is reversed if the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount. STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
1.10 Financial instruments 
Loans and receivables
Financial assets are recognised in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
All financial assets excluding investments are classified as loans and receivables; these comprise trade and other receivables and cash and 
cash equivalents. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Discounting is omitted 
where the effect of discounting is immaterial.
If there is objective evidence that there is an impairment loss on loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original 
effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced either 
directly or through use of an allowance account.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset 
and all substantial risks and rewards are transferred.
Financial assets held for trading
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial 
recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling 
in the near term. This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging 
instruments in hedge relationships as defined by IAS 39. The Company has not designated any financial assets upon initial recognition as at 
fair value through profit or loss.
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective  
hedging instruments.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in 
finance revenue or finance expense in the income statement.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial 
asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.
Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities include borrowings and trade and other payables.
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised in the statement of financial position when, and 
only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for any directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with the effective interest 
recognised as an expense in finance costs.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled, or expires.
1.11 Equity instruments
Share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued. Share premium represents the excess consideration received 
over share capital upon the sale of shares, less any incidental costs of issue.
Retained earnings include all current and prior period retained profits.
The non-controlling interest reserve is the portion of equity ownership in subsidiaries which is not attributable to the owners of the  
Parent Company.
The merger reserves has arisen as described in note 1.2.
1.12 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and 
their tax bases.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised, unless the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit 
nor taxable profit (tax loss). However, for deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries a deferred tax asset 
is recognised when the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
1.13 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting 
end date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation is recognised at 
present value. When a provision in measured at present value the unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss 
in the period it arises.
1.14 Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are required to be recognised as 
part of the cost of stock or non-current assets.
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee’s services are received.
Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the Company is demonstrably committed to terminate the 
employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.
1.15 Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

1.16 Share-based payments
The fair value of equity-settled share based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of shares or options that will eventually vest. Full disclosure of the calculation 
models is given in note 25.
1.17 Leases
The economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee if the lessee bears substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the leased asset. Where the Group is a lessee in this type of arrangement, the related asset is recognised at the inception of the lease 
at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the lease payments plus incidental payments, if any. A corresponding 
amount is recognised as a finance lease liability.
This liability is reduced by lease payments net of finance charges. The interest element of lease payments represents a constant proportion 
of the outstanding capital balance and is charged to profit or loss, as finance costs over the period of the lease.
Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term 
of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits 
from the lease asset are consumed.

2 JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the 
results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Critical judgements
The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the 
financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Group was formed on 27 March 2015 when Hunters Property Plc acquired shares in its subsidiaries through a share-for-share 
exchange. This type of common control transaction falls outside the scope of IFRS 3 and therefore UK GAAP has been referred to for  
best practice guidance. The result is that the Group has adopted merger accounting as a basis for the Group consolidation.
Franchisee revenue
Franchisee sign up fees are recognised upfront at the inception of a franchisee contract, which in the Directors’ opinion matches to the 
estimated cost of time and knowledge to create the franchiser-franchisee contractual arrangement.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
are as follows.
Provisions
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting 
date. Each period the Directors assess the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation and review the discount rates applied when 
calculating the present value. When reviewing the discount rates the Directors refer to the Group weighted average cost of capital. Further 
details on the assumptions made for specific provisions are disclosed in note 22.
Business combinations and goodwill
The Group has made several acquisitions during the year. Judgements and estimations are made in respect of the measurement of the 
provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and the consideration transferred. Furthermore estimation techniques have been 
used to value the brand and other intangibles acquired.
The Directors test annually for impairment of the Group's intangible assets and goodwill, details of which are given in note 12.

3 SEGMENTAL REPORTING
IFRS 8, Operating Segments, requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports of the Group that are regularly 
reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker of the Group is considered to be the Board  
of Directors.
The Group has operating segments: Residential Sales, Lettings, and Franchising. Due to the specific nature of the Group’s market, each 
component of revenue naturally falls within one of these segments. The operating segments are monitored by the Group’s chief operating 
decision maker and strategic decisions are made on the basis of adjusted segment operating results. All assets, liabilities and revenues are 
located in, or derived in, the United Kingdom.
The Group does not have any major customers which account for 10% or more of revenues.

Franchise Development Grants (FDG’s”) and rebrand costs are externally incurred expenses at the inception of certain contracts with 
franchisees in order to assist with the transition to using the Hunters brand name. The amounts invested are amortised over the minimum 
life of the underlying franchise contract, typically 10 to 15 years.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be 
impaired. Goodwill is assessed for impairment by comparing the carrying values with the value-in-use calculation, which is determined by 
calculating the net present value (NPV) of future cash flows arising from the original acquired business.
The NPV of future cash flows is based on budgets and forecasts for the next 5 years to 2020, using growth rates of 3%–6% based on  
past experience and outlook. Thereafter growth is assumed to be 3% in perpetuity based on long term housing sector growth rates.  
A discount rate of 10% has been used based on the Group’s estimated cost of capital.
The key sensitivities in assessing the value in use of goodwill are forecast cashflows and the discount rate applied.
• A 1% reduction in forecast growth rate in perpetuity would have no impact on carrying values;
• A 1% increase in the discount applied would have no impact on carrying values.
The carrying amounts of goodwill have been assigned to the following cash generating units:

15 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Acquisition of Greenrose Network (Franchise) Limited
In May 2015 the Group acquired 100% of the voting shares of Greenrose Network (Franchise) Limited (“Greenrose”). Greenrose is an 
unlisted company based in England and specialising in the UK property market. The consideration paid totalled £1,200,000, being settled 
by cash of £1,000,000 payable at the point of sale to the vendors, and the issue of 333,333 4p shares in Hunters Property Plc at a premium 
of 56p per share, with the total value of the issue being £200,000. In addition there were directly attributable costs of £39,399 inclusive of 
stamp duty payable on the shares.
As part of the acquisition, the Directors have identified intangible assets included within the premium paid for the acquisition, being 
customer lists in place with value of £951,514 and the Greenrose brand with value of £168,123. Historical data and forecasts have been 
used, together with a 10% discount rate (estimated by reference to a typical market participant) and an assumption of a useful life of 10 
years for the brand, to estimate the notional fair value of these intangibles.
As the acquisition gave immediate access to an enhanced franchising network, which represents a key part of the Group’s business model, 
an additional premium was paid over these notional fair values. The Directors have not quantified any other elements of this goodwill and 
do not believe there to be any further fair value adjustments.

Acquisition of Realcube Technology Limited & Realcube Limited
In June 2015 the Group acquired the remaining 80.2% of RealCube Technology Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiary RealCube Limited 
(together, “RealCube”). The Group had previously owned the 19.8% minority interest of RealCube. Both are unlisted companies based in 
England and have developed specialist software which is used by the Group to maintain its networks and provide services to franchisees. 
The Directors have identified a software intangible unrecognised by RealCube with fair value at acquisition of £507,108. The consideration 
paid totalled £240,095, being £95 of existing minority share capital, the issue of 122,533 4p shares in the Group at a premium of 56p per 
share and the issue of 277,467 4p shares in the Group at a premium of 56p per share in exchange for the waiving of loans made by existing 
shareholders to RealCube. In addition there were directly attributable costs of £8,435 inclusive of stamp duty payable on the shares.

21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Market and liquidity risks
The Group trades entirely within the UK property market, and accordingly there is a risk relating to the underlying performance of that 
market; this creates an exposure to the risk of large-scale failure in the property trading market which would have a corresponding impact 
on the results of the Group. The Directors monitor this risk closely with the intention to foresee downturns in trade.
Within the Group there exists a sizeable lettings division which generates a fixed percentage income based on the letting and management 
of properties owned by third parties, and the Directors consider this to be a more secure income stream and a suitable diversification 
of the trade and corresponding risk, based on historic performance whereby a downturn in the property trading market creates more 
buoyancy within the lettings market, and vice versa. As such, the Directors believe that the Group maintains sufficient liquidity and 
flexibility to continue trading through a potential downturn in the UK property market.
The Company has a number of interest-bearing loans upon which interest is charged at a variable rate. The outstanding value of these 
bank loans at the year end are £1,705,295 (2014- £1,706,430), on which interest is charged at between 2.75% and 3.75% over the Bank of 
England base rate. The Directors do not consider that the Group is exposed to a material risk from fluctuations in these interest rates; had 
the base rate been 2.0% higher throughout the increased interest costs would have been approximately £31,000 (2014: £34,000).
The Group makes use of structured loans to finance its acquisitions and ongoing trading activities as an alternative to overdraft financing, due 
to the certainty of repayment timings and predictable lower interest rates which attract to this. Accordingly, the Directors consider that the 
market risks arising from these interest-bearing loans are acceptable and minimal on a risk-reward profile compared to overdraft finance.
Similarly, fixed rate finance lease agreements are used to acquire property, plant and equipment; this ensures that the Group maintains its 
existing working capital and ensures certainty of costs at the point of acquisition of those assets.
The Group does not trade in overseas markets and has no financial instruments denominated in non-Sterling currencies, and accordingly it 
has no exposure to currency risks.
Credit risk
The Group does not make sales under the traditional credit term agreement model, with cash typically being recognised at the completion 
date of property or upon receipt of regular rent from tenants; credit is, however, granted to franchisees, financial services partners and 
survey & valuation partners.
The Group closely monitors the performance of its franchisees, on a frequent and ongoing basis. Operationally the Group are actively 
involved in the running of the franchising businesses, including frequent exchange of financial and key performance data, and are able 
to manage their own credit risk by using this knowledge to minimise exposure to potential bad debt. Additionally, franchisees are 
encouraged to remit via Direct Debit arrangements, which helps to maintain the Group’s working capital whilst mitigating against long-
term credit risk exposure.
Only reputable and accredited partners are used, and ledger balances are carefully monitored to minimise exposure to material credit risk.
Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and other stakeholders. The Group manages the capital structure and makes changes in light of changes in 
economic conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust its borrowings and investment decisions.

The contingent acquisition costs relate to amounts provided in respect of contingent payments due arising from the acquisition of Hunters 
Group Limited during the year to 31 December 2014. The provision is discounted to present value, with £20,000 undiscounted (£18,918 
discounted) falling contingently payable during the year to 31 December 2016, and £20,000 (£17,430 discounted) falling contingently 
payable thereafter.
The office dilapidations provision has been created in respect of restoration costs anticipated for an office leased by the Group. The 
provision is anticipated to result in an ultimate cash outflow of £75,000 by the end of 2019.

During the period, shares were issued at a premium of £3,336,640. Against this, costs of issue of shares of £757,904, net of taxation relief, 
have been set against the balance reflected in the financial statements.
28 PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT
During 2015 management became aware of a likely irrecoverable VAT debit dating back to prior periods. The impact of the adjustment  
has been to increase other creditors by £141,000, increase the deferred tax asset by £28,000, and decrease the opening prior period 
reserves by £113,000.
Further, management have reclassified its doubtful debt provision regarding its previous loan investment in RealCube as a trading 
impairment which the Directors consider better reflects the substance of the arrangement. The impact of the restatement is to increase 
administrative expenses in 2014 by £80,000, with no net impact on profit.
29 GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
At 31 December 2015, the Group had no contingent liabilities.
At 31 December 2015 the Group held client monies in approved bank accounts amounting to £3,496,720 (2014: £3,125,000). Neither the 
cash asset nor any corresponding obligation has been recognised by the Group.
30 OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS
Lessee
Operating leases relating to land and buildings are on normal commercial terms with no rent-free periods or other incentives, and include 
requirements to restore sites at the end of the agreements for which amounts have been provided for. Other agreements relate to motor 
vehicles on terms of one to three years, with no lease incentives.
At the reporting end date the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating 
leases, which fall due as follows:

31 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING DATE
Acquisitions
On 4 January 2016 the Group acquired a lettings book of properties under management by another estate agent for total consideration of 
£190,000, of which £175,000 was payable up front and the remaining £15,000 was payable by 5 April 2016. No new financing was entered 
into to facilitate the transaction, and no assets were acquired other than the lettings book.
As at the date of approval of the financial statements, the Directors are still assessing the fair values acquired and accordingly have not 
presented further information in respect of the acquisition.
Share options
On 28 January 2016 awards were made under the Hunters Property Senior Executive Share Option Scheme (the “Share Scheme”) to 
certain Executive Directors. Chief Executive, Harry Hill was separately granted share options as described below.
The Share Scheme has been introduced in order to incentivise and retain key members of the executive management team, and to drive 
shareholder value creation. Share options granted over ordinary shares of 4p each in the Company (“Ordinary Shares”) under the Share 
Scheme (“Share Options”) vest, subject to the achievement of certain earnings per share performance conditions, as to one third following 
the end of each of the Company’s current and two subsequent financial years. The exercise price of the Share Options is 4 pence per 
Ordinary Share. Share Options which have vested are exercisable following the preliminary announcement of the Company’s results for the 
second financial year after the Company’s current financial year. Subject to the rules of the Scheme, Share Options lapse 10 years after the 
date of grant.
The following awards were made to Executive Directors in accordance with the rules of the Share Scheme:
Director
Number of 
options granted 
under the  
share scheme
% of the  
existing issued 
share capital
Kevin Hollinrake 100,000 0.35%
Glynis Frew 150,000 0.53%
Ed Jones 150,000 0.53%
Options award to Chief Executive
On 28 January 2016 Harry Hill was granted an option over 150,000 Ordinary shares, exerciseable at a price of 4 pence per Ordinary 
share, which vests upon the fulfilment of certain strategic performance conditions. The option may be exerciseable in whole or in part 
(in tranches of not less than 25,000 Ordinary shares) at any time after it has vested. Subject to the provisions of the option agreement 
between the Company and Harry Hill, the option lapses 10 years after the date of grant.

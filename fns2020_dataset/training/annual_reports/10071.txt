Strategic Report Market overview
Businesses within the Melrose Group operate in diverse 
markets around the world. In this section, current market 
trends and external factors affecting the growth of each 
Melrose business are considered, together with individual 
business responses to these trends and factors.

metering products and solutions.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report Elster Gas
Elster Gas is a world leader in the 
design and manufacture of gas 
measurement, process heat control 
and gas safety control equipment, 
supplying a global customer base  
in more than 130 countries. It has  
one of the most extensively installed 
utility measurement bases in the 
world with more than 75 million gas 
metering devices deployed globally. 
Its complete range of end-to-end 
solutions enables customers to 
efficiently manage and control 
natural gas resources.
Current market trends
Global energy consumption continues  
to increase, with a growing share for 
natural gas (away from coal and oil)  
that is forecast to continue in the long 
term. This share growth reflects the 
environmental advantages of gas  
when compared with other fossil  
fuels. However, in addition, supply  
side growth (particularly from new 
sources of gas such as shale gas  
in the US), and some demand side 
weakness from the global economy,  
are helping to reduce the price of  
natural gas, further enhancing its 
attractiveness within the energy mix.
External factors:  
competition and regulation
In Europe, the EU 20/20/20 mandatory 
environmental targets remain in force, 
targeting an improvement in the following 
areas: 20% improvement in energy efficiency 
against 1990 levels; 20% reduction in carbon 
emissions; 20% of energy to be from 
renewable sources. In addition to the 
environmental drivers, the global economic 
situation is increasing competition and 
pricing pressure and changing buying 
behaviour within key markets. 
Recent international tensions are also 
increasing concerns over energy security, 
prompting changes to infrastructure 
investment strategies. 
China accounts for almost 50% of global steel 
production, and there is international pressure 
for China to adopt ISO global standards in 
terms of safety and environmental efficiency.
Business response
The effect of these factors is being seen  
in the six strategic market sectors in which 
Elster Gas operates, as set out below.
The European gas meter market, driven  
by EU environmental legislation, is in the 
process of replacing existing standard gas 
meters with Smart meters. Elster is actively 
involved in major residential pilot projects  
in several countries, each with its own 
technical requirements. 
The Integrated Gas Metering Station market 
is driven by increasing gas consumption, 
creating a demand to expand the gas 
pipelines and infrastructure to connect the 
gas reserves with the ultimate consumers. 
This fuels investment in infrastructure 
associated with extraction, production, grid 
injection and transmission of shale gas and 
biogas, including Liquefied Natural Gas 
(“LNG”) terminals and grid injection plants. 
Elster supplies the full scope of energy 
measurement solutions, including ultrasonic 
meters, flow computers, and gas quality 
measurement devices. 
These solutions are deployed worldwide, 
with a strong focus on Asia, the Middle 
East and the US, together with a growing 
biogas sector in Northern Europe. 
The US Residential and Commercial 
Metering Market is driven by new housing, 
meter replacement programmes, and 
Smart Grid deployments. The downstream 
distribution market surged with 
government-funded projects focused on 
infrastructure improvement and integrity 
management. Elster’s ability to provide  
a “main to meter” solution has generated 
strong demand which is anticipated to  
last for the next three to five years.
The Midstream, Pipeline, and Power 
Markets are driven by the transition from 
coal-burning power plants to natural gas, 
and by the rapid growth of shale gas with  
its associated infrastructure for export as 
LNG. Increased investment in the US high 
pressure transmission network is also 
expected to drive growth. Accordingly,  
Elster has invested resources in high 
pressure metering and energy measurement 
(gas chromatograph) systems to capitalise 
on the expected growth.
The Residential Heating Market is 
dominated by targets set by the EU  
for the use of energy in home heating.  
It will be mandatory from 2015 to install 
condensing boilers with high efficiency  
for a 10%–15% energy saving. Elster 
supplies solutions for heat generation 
(Safety Combustion Technology) and 
heat management (Comfort Controls)  
to the European heating market.
The Process Heat Market depends  
heavily on global capacity levels in the 
steel, aluminium and non-ferrous metal 
industries. Elster Kromschröder has 
developed specific solutions for Process 
Heat and Heating applications. Sales and 
application skills of the engineering team 
are key factors for high level products and 
solutions, and their “added value thinking” 
is an important market differentiator.

 reduction continues to drive the 
adoption of polymer-bodied water meters  
in both developed and developing markets. 
Utilities are also seeking water meters with 
extended accuracy ranges in order to 
maximise water measurement and help 
detect leaks.
“ Smart metering is driving 
growth in electronic water 
meters equipped with 
standard communication 
interfaces for connection  
to Smart networks.”
Elster Electricity
Elster Electricity is one of the  
largest international Smart metering 
solutions providers for residential, 
commercial, industrial, transmission 
and distribution markets.
Current market trends
Elster Electricity’s primary markets  
are the EU, US, South America, the 
Middle East and Africa. In the EU,  
Elster Electricity saw several gains of 
major customers and continued growth 
is expected. Following calls for the 
European-wide roll out of Smart meter 
solutions by 2022, further significant 
growth is anticipated. Good growth  
has also been seen in the Middle East, 
which is expected to continue over the 
coming years. In South America, there  
is a controlled change from standard 
metering towards Smart metering.
External factors:  
competition and regulation
The global market will continue to see  
a shift from “traditional” metering to 
Smart meter solutions. While the North 
American markets are expected to 
remain relatively constant at existing  
sales volumes, other markets are 
expected to see growth. In Latin America, 
Europe and the Middle East, further 
projects are starting and a significant 
level of tender activity is anticipated.
Business response
New metering and software solutions 
products and technologies have been 
developed and successfully launched.  
The new evolution of Meter Data 
Collection has been released recently 
and during 2015 further investment  
will be made to secure further world  
class partnerships with Smart Grid 
application providers.
Elster Water
Elster Water is recognised globally as  
a leading supplier of water meters with 
sales revenue derived from more than 
100 countries.
Current market trends
The global water industry continues to seek 
innovative metering solutions to support  
the objectives of water providers, including 
water conservation, customer service and 
resource efficiency. In developed markets, 
revenue growth is driven by a continued 
increase in the adoption of communicating 
meters for Smart metering projects, 
particularly in Europe, the Middle East  
and North America. 
This Smart metering trend is also driving 
growth in electronic water meters equipped 
with standard communication interfaces for 
connection to Smart networks. These solid 
state, electronic meters, often called “static” 
meters, allow extended meter life in harsh 
water quality conditions.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report External factors:  
competition and regulation
Regulations governing water meter 
specifications are both regional and 
national with most markets adopting 
international standards into their regulatory 
environment, usually with some adaptation 
to suit local needs. The competitive 
environment in Elster Water’s main 
markets comprises a few large suppliers 
based in Europe and North America, 
together with many regional companies. 
The trends in Smart water metering are 
attracting new software providers to 
support advanced metering infrastructure 
projects including those from the IT sector. 
It is expected that there will be increasing 
numbers of projects requiring partners 
working together to deliver these Smart 
water services to utilities. 
Business response
In response to the above trends, Elster 
Water remains focused on the delivery  
of innovative, value added products in 
market segments that are responsive  
to higher performing metering products 
and solutions. Recent innovations by 
Elster include extending the range of 
award winning polymer-bodied residential 
meters, the launch of the H5000 
commercial and industrial meter and the 
integration and connectivity of leading 
Smart communication technologies.
Elster Water continues to work with key 
water industry partners in several regions  
to address local requirements. Strong 
customer relationships remain important, 
helping to ensure that Elster Water 
continues to develop water metering 
products and solutions tailored to 
customer needs. 
“ Brush’s product development of very 
large air-cooled generators will position 
the business well in future years.”
Energy
Brush Turbogenerators is the world’s 
largest independent manufacturer of 
electricity generating equipment for  
the power generation, industrial, oil  
& gas and offshore sectors. 
Current market trends
Slow growth in the global economy is 
driving a modest market growth in power 
generation. Advances in technology are 
resulting in the development of larger  
more efficient turbines, in excess of sizes 
traditionally supplied by Brush.
Exceptionally low oil & gas prices have  
had a negative impact on oil & gas 
investment projects, predominantly  
in the upstream sector of the industry,  
to which Brush has exposure. 
External factors:  
competition and regulation
Some Brush businesses have strong UK 
revenue streams, principally Transformers 
and Switchgear, customers of which are 
regulated by OFGEM (Office of Gas and 
Electricity Markets).
In China, the “Energy Action Plan” was 
released in November 2014 by the new 
Chinese Government which endorsed 
the distributed energy installation targets 
set out in the 12th ‘5 Year Plan’. This  
will underpin the switch from coal fired 
generation to gas fired generation which 
will require generators such as those  
to be manufactured by Brush China.
Business response
In 2014, Brush started to supply 
generators to its Chinese customers  
from its European factories. The newly-
constructed factory in China is expected 
to deliver its first generator in the first 
quarter of 2016. 
Brush’s product development of very 
large air-cooled generators will position 
the business well in future years.

Strategic Report Chairman’s statement
Christopher Miller
Chairman
I am pleased to report our 12th 
set of annual results since 
flotation in 2003.
2014 has been another successful 
year. Elster, our gas, electricity 
and water metering company 
acquired in 2012, continues to 
demonstrate the benefits of our 
management model.
In November 2014 we sold Bridon, our 
wire rope maker principally for the mining 
and oil & gas sectors, for an enterprise 
value of £365 million. In line with our 
strategy we have announced a capital 
repayment of £200 million which will be 
paid on 16 March 2015. With only Brush 
remaining from our FKI acquisition in  
2008, this nearly completes that 
acquisition cycle. 
Since making our first investment in 2005, 
Melrose has achieved an annual return on 
equity investment of 23% and an increase 
in operating margins of 5 to 7 percentage 
points across each of the businesses we 
have owned. Total shareholder return  
over the same period has been 421%, 
compared to 104% for the FTSE 350.
By implementing our strategy, following  
the Return of Capital, we will have created 
approximately £2,782 million of shareholder 
value with a net shareholder investment  
of £170 million.
As ever, I would like to thank all our 
employees for their efforts in helping  
to produce this outstanding performance.
Results for the Group
Revenue from continuing businesses  
for the year was £1,377.5 million  
(2013: £1,466.4 million) and headline  
profit before tax (before exceptional  
costs, exceptional income and intangible 
asset amortisation) was £212.5 million 
(2013: £191.5 million). 
Further details of these results are 
contained in the Finance Director’s review 
on pages 42 to 49.
Trading
Elster continues to perform strongly  
in all three divisions with orders and  
sales in Gas, the largest division, in 
particular, showing pleasing increases  
in constant currency terms. Whilst the  
bulk of restructuring and product 
rationalisation is behind us there is 
nevertheless an ongoing programme  
of efficiency gains which we expect  
will add to the substantial improvements 
already achieved in operating margins. 
Investment in all divisions continues and 
the purchase of Eclipse on 31 October 
2014 for US $158 million is an exciting 
addition to Elster Gas which will make  
a good contribution in its first full year.
In our Energy division, Brush continues  
to experience difficult end markets with its 
OEM business. While it is pleasing to note 
that independent market research shows 
Brush has more than maintained its market 
share, nevertheless the forces at play 
holding down OEM demand do not appear 
to be dissipating in the near term. In the 
medium and long term, however, we have 
full confidence that this market will recover. 
In the meantime, the Aftermarket and 
Switchgear divisions are performing well.

Annual Report 2014
Strategic Report “ Our strategy is working: for a net shareholder 
investment of £170 million, and with a current 
market capitalisation of £3.0 billion, we have 
created £2.8 billion of shareholder value.”
We encountered foreign exchange 
headwinds in 2014 and while these have 
abated somewhat in recent months as 
regards the US Dollar, the further 
weakness in the Euro and the Rouble 
suggest a further 5% headwind in 2015 
based on current exchange rates.
Further discussion of trading appears  
in the Chief Executive’s review on page 14.
Dividend
The Board proposes to pay a final dividend 
of 5.3p per share (2013: 5.0p). This will be 
paid on 18 May 2015 to those shareholders 
on the register at 17 April 2015, subject to 
approval at the AGM on 14 May 2015. This 
gives a total for the year of 8.1p per share 
(2013: 7.75p).
We continue to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy.
Strategy
Since Melrose’s flotation in 2003, and the 
introduction of our “buy, improve, sell” 
strategy, we have seen many changes in 
economic and stock market conditions. 
Nevertheless, through all this, returns to 
shareholders have been extremely good 
and we see no reason to diverge from  
our proven strategy. We continue to see 
situations which are candidates for our 
management and investment methods  
and we are confident we will identify  
a suitable opportunity in due course.  
In the meantime, we will continue to  
improve our existing businesses, and will 
make disposals at the appropriate time.
Outlook
The world economy continues to be 
geographically patchy. Strength in the  
USA is mirrored by weakness in most  
of Continental and Central Europe – a 
situation which seems unlikely to change  
in the near future. Adjusting for currency 
effects, our Group is trading in line with 
management expectations for 2015 
despite the expected downturn in the 
performance at Brush. In our Elster 
businesses, we see the potential for  
good demand and growth prospects,  
as indeed we have seen in the second half  
of 2014. This, together with the opportunity 
for further margin enhancement, and the 
possibility of a value creating acquisition, 
gives us confidence for the balance of 
2015 and beyond.

Simon Peckham
Chief Executive
Acquiring good quality 
manufacturing businesses, 
making operational 
improvements, realising 
shareholder value at the 
appropriate time and then 
returning this value to 
shareholders continue to 
be the components of the 
“buy, improve, sell” business 
strategy that Melrose has 
followed since being founded  
in 2003. 
The Group now consists of Brush, the  
last remaining business from the FKI 
acquisition, and the businesses which 
comprise Elster. Continued improvement  
of all these businesses is, as ever, a key 
objective for 2015. 
Acquisitions and disposals during  
the year
2014 has been another highly successful 
year for Melrose. In October 2014, Elster 
Gas completed the acquisition of Eclipse,  
a US-based manufacturer of gas 
combustion components and systems for 
industrial heating and drying applications. 
Combining this with our existing Elster Gas 
business gives us a great opportunity to 
create significant shareholder value. In the  
following month, Melrose completed the 
disposal of Bridon for a total enterprise  
value of £365 million, representing the  
latest step in realising value from the FKI 
businesses acquired by Melrose in 2008.
Outlook
Overall market conditions remain 
challenging but we have in Elster a 
business that is well positioned for growth  
in 2015. At current exchange rates we face 
further currency headwinds this year and 
the order intake pattern suggests a more 
pronounced weighting of results to the 
second half of the year. As said previously, 
we believe we will see further progress in 
our Elster businesses but end market 
conditions mean that Brush will have a 
more difficult 2015. Overall, adjusting for 
the adverse currency movements which 
are outside our control, we believe that the 
Group will be in line with management 
expectations for 2015.

Our strategy
Melrose buys good manufacturing businesses with 
strong fundamentals, whose performance can be 
improved. Melrose finances its acquisitions using a low 
level of leverage, improves the businesses by a mixture  
of investment and changed management focus, sells  
them and returns the proceeds to shareholders.
•  Good manufacturing 
businesses whose  
performance can be improved
•  Use low (public market) 
leverage
Progress
The acquisition of Eclipse, a US-based 
specialist in the complementary field of 
low-temperature combustion technology, 
has created an opportunity to strengthen 
the Elster Gas business and enhance 
shareholder value.   
The business is already performing 
ahead of expectations.
Priorities 
To identify and acquire strong 
manufacturing businesses whose 
performance can be improved,  
using low (public market) leverage.
Key risks
Global economic and financial conditions 
may impact the timing of acquisitions. 
Assets may underperform or require  
more investment and resources than 
originally anticipated.
Progress
The year on year operating margins  
of the continuing Group businesses have 
increased from 16.4% to 17.9%, with the 
Elster Group increasing operating 
margins from 17 .4% to 19.6%. Operational 
improvement projects are returning 
efficiency gains in each Elster business.
Priorities 
To drive operational improvements,  
invest in businesses and focus on  
cash generation.
Key risks
The Group may not succeed in driving 
strategic operational improvements to 
generate value post acquisition in the 
acquired business.

Strategic Report Creating value  
in the sale of Bridon
Highlights
In November 2014, Melrose 
completed the disposal of  
the Bridon business for an 
enterprise value of £365 
million. The Board used  
part of the net proceeds  
to return £200 million in  
cash to shareholders,  
using the balance to  
pay down borrowings. 
“Bridon is an excellent 
example of the Melrose  
‘buy, improve, sell’ model  
at work. It demonstrates our 
ability to create substantial 
value for shareholders by 
investing heavily in our 
businesses and improving 
operational performance. 
Since the acquisition of FKI  
in 2008, we have successfully 
grown and developed the 
Bridon business into a  
premier supplier of critical 
high-performance ropes  
for energy, mining and 
industrial applications.”

Performance
As each business uses its own Health

when compared to 2013 will vary. Further 
information in relation to the various health  
and safety initiatives undertaken by the  
Group’s businesses during 2014 can  
be found within the Corporate Social 
Responsibility report on pages 50 to 57.
Method of calculation
Environmental KPIs used within the Group and 
their method of calculation vary by business  
unit and depend on the specific nature of the 
operation. A range of environmental measures 
are used, including energy consumption,  
CO

 emissions, water consumption, water 
contamination and waste disposal.
Strategic objective
Each of the Group’s businesses is committed to 
ensuring that their operations have a minimum 
possible adverse effect on the environment. 
Particular relevance has been placed on the 
control of energy consumption.
Performance
Investment was provided by the Group for 
several environmental improvement initiatives 
during 2014. The Group is required to disclose 
greenhouse gas emissions data in relation to 
the 2014 financial year. Further information  
can be found within the Corporate Social 
Responsibility report on pages 50 to 57. 
Due to the diverse nature of the Group,  
each business uses a range of its own  
specific non-financial KPIs, which are used  
to drive business performance and assist  
in managing risk. This helps to ensure that  
the KPIs used are relevant to each business 
and take into account specific operational  
and reporting requirements. Such KPIs  
cover operational, quality, commercial and 
human resource measures. Further information 
regarding some of the Group’s recent initiatives 
can be found within the Corporate Social 
Responsibility report on pages 50 to 57  
and the Directors’ report on pages 64 to 67.

Key strengths
With proven excellence in 
engineering, sales and operational 
capability and a “Best in Class” 
approach to everything it does, 
Elster Gas is well positioned to 
exploit growth opportunities and 
to succeed as technology shifts 
towards Smart meter solutions. In 
parallel, Elster Gas is expanding 
its global service network, winning 
customer loyalty across the world.
Elster Gas is a world leader 
in gas measurement and gas 
safety control equipment, 
supplying a global customer 
base in more than 130 
countries. With one of the 
most extensive installed utility 
measurement bases in the 
world and more than 75 million 
gas metering devices deployed 
globally, Elster Gas products 
enable customers to efficiently 
measure, manage and control 
natural gas resources across  
the complete gas value chain.
From its four lead plants in Europe  
and the USA, coupled with sizeable 
subsidiary operations in China, Malaysia, 
Russia and Mexico, Elster Gas designs 
and manufactures gas meters and related 
products for residential, commercial and 
industrial customers. In 2014, five million  
gas meters were manufactured in Elster’s 
major factories. 
Global revenues increased by 6% in  
2014. Operating profit increased by  
13% compared to 2013, driven by sales 
growth and management’s strategy of 
strong operational control coupled with 
rationalisation of the business footprint. 
During the year, there were significant 
performance improvements in both North 
America and Germany. Overall, there was  
a continued improvement in gross margin 
and when coupled with a further reduction 
in fixed costs, there was an encouraging 
1.5% improvement this year in the return  
on sales. 
In October 2014, Elster Gas completed  
the acquisition of Eclipse, a US-based 
manufacturer of gas combustion 
components and systems for industrial 
heating and drying applications. Eclipse  
will be merged with the Elster Gas control 
equipment business (sold under the 
Kromschröder brand) to create a market 
leading global Thermal Solutions division, 
which will offer industrial customers a 
comprehensive range of gas combustion 
and safety control systems. This business 
is now approximately a third of the sales  
of Elster Gas and a good contribution is 
expected from Eclipse during 2015.
Elster are also involved in both residential 
Smart gas meter programmes and 
commercial and industrial Smart meter 
rollouts in Europe. While overall progress

2. North America  31%
3. Asia  14%

(2013: £688.9m)

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Performance Review on the former is slow, due to delays by  
the relevant authorities in their mass rollout  
of Smart meters, volumes are slowly 
increasing in the foundation phase.  
In 2014, Elster Gas sold 29,000 Smart 
residential gas meters. By contrast, good 
progress has been made in the Smart 
commercial and industrial sector.  
In addition to the 24,000 Smart commercial 
and industrial gas meters sold in 2014, 
Elster Gas announced that British Gas 
Business, the UK’s largest non-residential 
gas supplier, has selected Elster to supply 
up to 100,000 Smart commercial and 
industrial gas meters over the next three 
years to a significant proportion of its  
UK customer base.
In May 2014, Elster Gas announced  
major changes in the global footprint  
of its Integrated Metering Solutions (IMS) 
business which builds gas metering 
stations for the upstream production and 
shipment of gas. Production will move  
from Western Europe to Saudi Arabia and 
Malaysia, with the latter becoming the 
centre of excellence for these products. 
This shift moves production closer to the 
major gas metering station markets, with 
completion planned for the end of 2015. 
Outlook
The main Elster Gas end markets remain 
healthy and order input in 2014 was 
higher than in 2013. We expect the  
recent decline in the oil price to have  
an effect on the timing of some gas 
metering station projects throughout 
2015; however, the high demand 
projected in the Elster conventional  
gas meter markets will more than 
compensate for any weakness in  
this area.
When coupled with further planned 
operational improvements and the 
integration of Eclipse into the existing 
business, Elster Gas should enjoy another 
strong performance in 2015. Whilst still 
very early in the year, order books going 
into 2015 give us encouragement for  
the next 12 months.

Market overview 
 
Global energy consumption continues 
to increase, with a growing share for 
natural gas that is forecast to continue 
in the long term. In addition, supply  
side growth and some demand side 
weakness are helping to reduce the 
price of natural gas, enhancing its 
attractiveness within the energy mix.
External factors 
In the EU, mandatory environmental 
targets remain in force, targeting 
improvements in energy efficiency, 
reductions in carbon emissions and 
increased use of energy from renewable 
sources. The global economic situation  
is increasing competition and pricing 
pressure and changing buying 
behaviour within key markets. 
Business response 
Elster Gas is actively involved in projects 
driven by EU environmental legislation 
and the demands of the US Residential 
and Commercial Metering Market. 
Elster supplies the full scope of energy 
measurement solutions required for gas 
pipelines and infrastructure connecting 
gas reserves with the end-user.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Performance Review Operating profit improved as a result  
of consolidation activities and process 
improvement actions taken in previous 
years. The move of production in North 
America to San Luis Potosi in Mexico has 
now been completed and supply chain 
and assembly for a part of the European 
operation has now been consolidated in 
Timisoara in Romania. Focus on solutions 
selling and subsequent service revenue 
also contributed to the overall profit 
improvement. The supply chain, both in 
North America and Europe, has been 
consolidated around tier 1 OEM suppliers 
resulting in improved quality. 2014 saw 
another focus on VAVE (Value Added  
Value Engineering) across all product  
lines resulting in improved margins.
In 2015, a key focus will be on introducing 
the new enhanced open software offering, 
Connexo, starting in North America 
followed by Europe. New product features 
will be launched reflecting the market 
demand for new communication protocols 
and data encryption features. A move to  
a new facility in Timisoara in Romania is 
planned for the fourth quarter.
Outlook
Following last year’s tender activities for 
Smart metering in Europe and the Middle 
East, a number of projects have been 
secured that will see pilot projects in 2015 
and subsequent mass roll out in the years 
to follow. In South America, including 
Mexico, utilities are expected to continue 
the focus on reducing wastage of electricity 
through accelerated roll out of integrated 
metering solutions. These developments 
mean that Elster Electricity is well positioned 
for an exciting future, although the precise 
timing of Smart meter roll out remains 
unpredictable.

Elster Water designs, 
manufactures and provides a 
comprehensive range of water 
metering solutions including 
high accuracy mechanical 
meters, fully electronic meters 
and Smart metering solutions  
for residential, commercial  
and industrial sectors.
Headline operating profits continued to 
improve in 2014, following the restructuring 
activity in 2012 and 2013. Restructuring 
operations during this period led to the 
cessation of manufacture of mechanical 
meters for the North American market  
and rationalisation of product lines, which 
resulted in the closure of sites in Europe  
to consolidate production. Operating 
margins have improved compared with 
2013 due to the impact of improved 
operating efficiency, well-controlled raw 
material costs and a continued focus  
on overhead control. Working capital 
controls also improved with a year-on-year 
reduction ensuring strong cash conversion.
Revenues in 2014 were approximately 12% 
lower compared with 2013, largely due to 
the remaining effect of the exit from low 
margin business in North America and in 
Germany. This action has led to an overall 
improvement in the quality of earnings, 
delivering a return on sales of nearly 16% 
in the year (2013: 12.8%). Revenue in the 
Middle East was lower than expected due 
to the level of customer activity; however, 
this was offset by strong growth in Africa. 
Sales in the rest of Europe were lower than 
in 2013, reflecting our strategy of exiting 
lower margin products.

Brush provides energy 
solutions for the global 
power industry, focusing 
on outstanding product 
performance and 
manufacturing excellence.
Brush Turbogenerators 
(“Turbogenerators”) is the 
world’s largest independent 
manufacturer of electricity 
generating equipment for the 
power generation, industrial,  
oil & gas and offshore sectors. 
From its four plants in the UK, Czech 
Republic, Netherlands and US (and  
with a newly-built China generator plant 
coming into production in 2015) Brush 
designs, manufactures and services 
turbogenerators, principally in the 10  
MVA to 300 MVA range, for both gas  
and steam turbine applications, and 
supplies a globally diverse customer base.
In addition, Brush designs and manufactures 
systems and power transformers under  
the brand name Brush Transformers 
(“Transformers”) and also produces a  
wide range of indoor and outdoor medium 
voltage AC/DC switchgear under the  
Hawker Siddeley Switchgear (“HSS”)  
brand name. Brush also has a strong 
presence in power control systems. 
Harrington Generators International (“HGI”)  
is a specialist UK-based small generator 
manufacturer supplying the construction, 
military, telecoms and rail sectors.
During 2014, Brush experienced a 
challenging market again, particularly in  
new build generators. This was mitigated  
by another strong year from aftermarket 
sales and HSS. Significant investment  
was made in the year to fund new product 
development, new routes to market, and 
the China project, and thus future growth. 
The performance was supported by 
operational efficiency gains, and the 
benefits from capital investments. 
201 4 saw the commencement of the 
construction of the Brush greenfield generator 
manufacturing plant near Shanghai, China. 
This £30 million capital investment will produce 
generators primarily for the China market and 
is in support of several of Brush’s international 
turbine customers. Factory construction  
is nearly complete and manufacturing 
equipment is now being installed and 
commissioned, with the factory expected to 
deliver its first generator in January 2016. The 
first orders have now been received for this 
factory as it moves towards being operational. 
Brush has already been supplying generators 
in 2014 from Europe against the six year 
long-term purchase agreement with Huadian 
GE Aero Gas T urbine Equipment Co. Ltd 
(“HDGE”), which will continue until the new 
factory is operational.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Performance Review The separation of the aftermarket business 
into one unit in 2013 has helped it to grow 
strongly in 2014. Late 2014 saw the launch 
of the “VF” range, an initiative to provide 
premium replacement rotors in seven 
weeks, and selected complete generators 
in 10 weeks, industry leading timescales. 
This gives end users a critically important 
replacement service as an alternative to 
repair, and significantly widens the available 
market to Brush, for both Brush and 
non-Brush legacy machine replacement. 
During 2015 this offer will be extended  
to third party, non-Brush manufactured 
generators as well as 4 pole generators.
The aftermarket business in the USA had 
another strong growth year. Investment has 
commenced on a new large rotor balancing 
facility in Pittsburgh, which will significantly 
enhance its capabilities and lead to further 
growth. The new global structure of service 
engineers resulted in Brush Aftermarket 
being able to manage the power outage 
spike in demand in the USA utilising its  
own engineers, rather than subcontractors. 
Overall Aftermarket sales were well ahead 
of a strong 2013. 
The Transformer business had a slow  
sales year in 2014 as a result of it being  
the last year of the current five year OFGEM 
(the UK Government’s Office of Gas and 
Electricity Markets) cycle. Orders have  
now improved into 2015 as the period has 
ended. The capital expenditure programme 
to reorganise the Transformers production 
process and value engineer the product 
was completed, and resulted in significant 
margin improvement.
The HSS business had a satisfactory year. 
Whilst sales were 8% behind the previous 
year (mainly due to project delays), as a 
result of efficiency savings profit was 3% 
ahead. During the year investment in R&D 
significantly increased, which positions the 
business well for the future with a pipeline  
of unique products.

Market overview 
 
Slow growth in the global economy is 
driving a modest market growth in power 
generation. Advances in technology are 
resulting in the development of larger 
more efficient turbines, often in excess  
of sizes traditionally supplied by Brush.
External factors 
Some of Brush businesses have  
strong UK revenue streams, principally 
Transformers and Switchgear, which 
are regulated by OFGEM.
In China, the “Energy Action Plan”  
will underpin the switch from coal  
fired generation to gas fired generation. 
Business response 
The newly-constructed factory in China 
is expected to deliver its first generator 
in the first quarter of 2016. 
Brush’s product development of very 
large air-cooled generators will position 
the business well in future years.
Products 
Outlook
The medium and long-term growth in 
power and in particular the aero-derivative 
gas turbine market, where Brush has such 
a strong position, remain positive, and with 
the additional growth from China, a strong 
new product development pipeline across 
all business units coupled with continued 
operational improvements, means the 
business is well positioned for the future. 
However, the overall market dynamics 
remain difficult in the short term. Profits  
are expected to decline significantly  
in 2015 despite the efforts of Brush’s 
management and continued improvements  
in its Aftermarket, Transformers and 
Switchgear businesses.

Risk management
Melrose operates in a variety of sectors and countries and  
is exposed to a wide range of risks and uncertainties from a 
strategic, operational, compliance and financial perspective.
Risk management framework
The objectives of the Directors and senior 
management are to safeguard and increase 
the value of the business and assets of the 
Group. Achievement of these objectives 
requires the development of policies and 
appropriate internal control frameworks to 
ensure the Group’s resources are managed 
properly and any key risks are identified  
and mitigated, where possible.
The Board recognises that it is ultimately 
responsible for determining the nature and 
extent of the principal risks it is willing to take 
in achieving its strategic objectives. It also 
recognises the need to maintain sound risk 
management and internal control systems.
The Audit Committee monitors the 
effectiveness of the internal control processes 
implemented across the Group, through  
a review of the key findings presented by  
the external and internal auditors and 
discussions with senior management.  
The Board is responsible for considering  
Audit Committee recommendations and 
ensuring implementation by management  
of those recommendations it deems 
appropriate for the business.
The Group operates on a de-centralised 
basis and the Board has established an 
organisational structure with clear reporting 
procedures, lines of responsibility and 
delegated authority, as depicted in the 
diagram opposite.
A summary of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that could impact on the 
Group’s performance is shown on pages 
38 to 41. Further information detailing  
the internal control and risk management 
policies and procedures operated within  
the Group is shown on page 71 of the 
Corporate Governance report.
2014 Risk management review
In 2014, the Board initiated a root and 
branch audit and review of the risk 
management framework and underlying 
processes in operation in every business 
across the Melrose Group. The exercise 
was led by the Company Secretary and 
supported by risk consultants, BDO LLP . 
Audit meetings were conducted by  
the Company Secretary with senior 
management from each business unit.  
The review focused on the degree to  
which risk management arrangements  
are guided by strategic direction and the 
extent to which appropriate processes  
are in place for the identification, 
evaluation, prioritisation, recording, 
monitoring and reporting of risk within  
the businesses. The results of this audit 
exercise were presented to the Board  
and an action plan detailing the key risk 
management priorities was agreed.

Risk management priorities  
for 2015
The Board recognises that operating in a 
dynamic and rapidly evolving commercial 
environment requires a pragmatic, flexible 
and responsive risk management framework 
that changes with the business and provides 
management with a comprehensive view  
of the Group’s risk profile at any given time. 
Following the 2014 risk management audit, 
BDO LLP have been engaged to support 
the Board in developing an enhanced  
risk management framework and in 
implementing a programme to promote 
and embed a more risk-aware culture 
across the organisation. Specific  
priorities for the Group in 2015 include:
• Reviewing the Board’s risk appetite and, 
where appropriate, updating the Melrose 
Risk Policy and Strategy;
• Developing and implementing an 
enhanced and more consistent risk 
management governance framework 
across the Group. This will define the 
Melrose principles for risk management 
and set the standards for the 
identification, evaluation, prioritisation, 
recording, review and reporting of risks 
and their management or mitigation 
throughout the organisation;
• Rolling out a Group-wide education  
and training programme designed to  
instill and embed a culture of effective  
risk management against a consistently 
applied framework; 
• Embedding the risk management 
programme through a series of risk 
workshops. These will be attended by 
risk champions from each business  
unit and will provide a forum for sharing 
learning and refining risk tools and 
processes; and 
• Reviewing and improving our processes 
around the assessment of principal risks 
and the monitoring and reporting of the 
Group’s risk management performance. 
Invariably, this may require slight revisions 
to the priorities attached to the principal 
risks already identified in this report.

Strategic risk
Acquisition of new 
businesses and  
improvement strategies
As per the Group’s strategy to buy and improve good underperforming manufacturing businesses, 
there is a risk that the Group will not succeed in driving strategic operational improvements to 
generate value post acquisition. In making acquisitions, there is a risk of unforeseen liabilities being 
discovered which are not known at the time of the due diligence process but which arose in  
the business before it was acquired. The success of the Group’s acquisition strategy depends  
on identifying targets, obtaining authorisations and having the necessary financing. Even if an 
acquisition is completed, the acquired products and technologies may not be successful or may 
require significantly greater resources and investment than anticipated. If anticipated benefits  
are not realised or trading by acquired businesses falls below expectations, it may be necessary  
to impair the carrying value of these assets. The Group’s return on capital employed may fall if 
acquisition hurdle rates are not met. The Group’s financial performance may suffer from goodwill  
or other acquisition-related impairment charges, or from the identification of additional liabilities  
not known at the time of the acquisition.
• Structured and focused due diligence undertaken.
• Focus on acquisition targets that have strong headline 
fundamentals – high quality products, leading market  
share but are underperforming their potential and ability  
to generate sustainable cash flows and profit growth.
• Hands-on role taken by Directors and other senior 
employees of the Group. Development of strategic  
plans, restructuring opportunities, capital expenditure  
and working capital management.

Timing of disposals In line with our strategy and depending where the Group is within the buy, improve and sell 
strategic cycle, the expected timing of disposal of companies is considered as a principal risk which 
could have a material impact on the Group strategy. Further, due to the Group’s global operations, 
there may be a significant impact on timing of disposal due to political and macroeconomic factors. 
Depending on the timings of disposals and nature of companies’ operations there may be long-term 
liabilities which could be retained by the Group. Insufficient allowance for retained liabilities may also 
affect the Group’s financial position.
• Directors are experienced in judging and regularly reviewing  
the appropriate time in a business cycle for disposal to realise 
maximum value for shareholders.
• Each disposal is assessed on its merits, with a key focus on  
a clean disposal.

The Group operates, through manufacturing and/or sales facilities, in over 50 countries and  
is affected by global economic conditions particularly in the US and Europe. Businesses are  
also affected by government spending priorities and the willingness of governments to commit 
substantial resources. Current global economic and financial market conditions and the potential 
for a significant and prolonged global recession may materially and adversely affect the Group’s 
operational performance, financial condition and could have significant impact on timing of 
acquisitions and disposals. 
A recession may also materially affect customers, suppliers and other parties with which the 
Group does business. Adverse economic and financial market conditions may cause customers 
to terminate existing orders, to reduce their purchases from the Group, or to be unable to meet 
their obligations to pay outstanding debts to the Group. These market conditions may also cause 
our suppliers to be unable to meet their commitments to the Group or to change the credit terms 
they extend to Group businesses.
• Diverse range of companies operating within the Group, within  
a variety of different industries and countries, which reduces 
macro-economic and political risks.
• Regular monitoring of order books and other leading indicators, 
to ensure the Group and each of its businesses can respond 
quickly to any adverse trading conditions. This includes the 
identification of cost reduction and efficiency measures.

Loss of key management The success of the Group is built upon strong management teams. As a result, the loss of key 
personnel can have a significant impact on performance, at least for a time. The loss of key 
personnel or the failure to plan adequately for succession or develop new talent may impact  
the reputation of the Group, or lead to a disruption in the leadership of the business. Competition  
for personnel is intense and the Group may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified 
personnel, particularly engineering professionals. The loss of key employees, the Group’s 
inability to attract new and adequately trained employees, or a delay in hiring key personnel, 
could seriously harm the Group’s business. Over time, the Group’s competitive advantage is 
defined by the quality of its people; should the Group fail to attract, develop and retain key talent, 
in time the competitive advantage will erode, leading to weaker growth potential or returns in 
particular with significant restructuring activities undertaken to improve the acquired businesses.
• Succession planning within the Group and its various businesses 
is co-ordinated via the Nomination Committee in conjunction  
with the Board and includes all Directors and senior employees.
• The Company recognises that, as with most businesses, 
particularly those operating within a technical field, it is 
dependent on Directors and employees with particular 
managerial, engineering or technical skills. Appropriate 
remuneration packages and long-term incentive arrangements  
are offered in an effort to retain such individuals.

Strategic risk
Acquisition of new 
businesses and  
improvement strategies
As per the Group’s strategy to buy and improve good underperforming manufacturing businesses, 
there is a risk that the Group will not succeed in driving strategic operational improvements to 
generate value post acquisition. In making acquisitions, there is a risk of unforeseen liabilities being 
discovered which are not known at the time of the due diligence process but which arose in  
the business before it was acquired. The success of the Group’s acquisition strategy depends  
on identifying targets, obtaining authorisations and having the necessary financing. Even if an 
acquisition is completed, the acquired products and technologies may not be successful or may 
require significantly greater resources and investment than anticipated. If anticipated benefits  
are not realised or trading by acquired businesses falls below expectations, it may be necessary  
to impair the carrying value of these assets. The Group’s return on capital employed may fall if 
acquisition hurdle rates are not met. The Group’s financial performance may suffer from goodwill  
or other acquisition-related impairment charges, or from the identification of additional liabilities  
not known at the time of the acquisition.
• Structured and focused due diligence undertaken.
• Focus on acquisition targets that have strong headline 
fundamentals – high quality products, leading market  
share but are underperforming their potential and ability  
to generate sustainable cash flows and profit growth.
• Hands-on role taken by Directors and other senior 
employees of the Group. Development of strategic  
plans, restructuring opportunities, capital expenditure  
and working capital management.

Performance Review
Performance Review Finance Director’s review
Geoffrey Martin
Group Finance Director
The year to 31 December 2014 included the 
disposal of Bridon, the remaining business 
in the Lifting division, which in the prior year 
contributed 15% towards continuing Group 
revenue and 12% to continuing Group headline 
operating profit. Consequently, in accordance 
with IFRS 5, the trading results of Bridon up 
to the date of disposal have been shown as 
discontinued in both years. 
The remaining continuing operations consist of the three Elster 
businesses, Gas, Electricity and Water, and the only remaining  
FKI business, Brush, which is shown within the Energy division. 
The discontinued operations in 2013 also include the results,  
up until the date of their disposal, of the Marelli business, 
previously shown within the Energy division, the Crosby and  
Acco businesses, previously shown within the Lifting division,  
and the Truth and Harris businesses, previously shown within  
the Other Industrial division. 
Group trading results - continuing operations
To help understand the results of the continuing operations the 
term ‘headline’ has been used. This refers to results calculated 
before exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible  
asset amortisation as this is considered by the Melrose Board  
to be the best measure of performance.
For the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group achieved 
revenue from continuing operations of £1,377.5 million (2013: 
£1,466.4 million), flat at constant currency, and headline operating 
profit of £246.0 million (2013: £240.0 million), an increase of 11%  
at constant currency. The Group results have been adversely 
impacted by movements in foreign exchange rates due to the 
strengthening of Sterling compared to many foreign currencies.  
At actual exchange rates Group revenue was down 6% whilst 
Group headline operating profit was up 3%. The Group headline 
operating profit margin (defined as the percentage of headline 
operating profit to revenue) increased from 16.4% in 2013  
to 17.9% in 2014. 
After exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible  
asset amortisation, Group operating profit was £162.4 million 
(2013: £192.5 million) and profit before tax was £128.9 million 
(2013: £144.0 million).

(1) Long Term Incentive Plans.
The performance of each of the trading divisions is discussed  
in detail in the Chief Executive’s review.
Central costs comprise £13.9 million (2013: £14.3 million) of 
Melrose corporate costs and a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) 
accrual of £11.0 million (2013: £13.0 million). The LTIP accrual 
includes an amount of £4.0 million in respect of the Melrose 
share-based Incentive Plan (2013: £4.0 million), and a charge  
of £7.0 million (2013: £9.0 million) for the cash-based divisional 
management incentive plans. The disposals of Crosby, late in 
2013, and Bridon in 2014, contributed to the reduced divisional 
LTIP charge in the year.
Return of Capital
Consistent with the Group strategy of returning to shareholders  
a large part of any proceeds from the disposal of businesses, 
£595.3 million was returned to shareholders on 28 February 2014 
following the sale of Crosby a few months earlier. This return  
was made via a redeemable share scheme alongside a share 
consolidation which reduced the number of Ordinary Shares by  
a factor of 11 for 13, or 15%, from 1,266.6 million to 1,071.8 million.
In addition, Melrose announced on 3 February 2015 a further 
Return of Capital of £200.4 million following the disposal of 
Bridon. This was subsequently approved by shareholders on  
20 February 2015. This return will be made on 16 March 2015  
via a redeemable share scheme alongside a share consolidation 
which will reduce the number of shares by a factor of 13 for 14,  
or 7%, from 1,071.8 million to 995.2 million.

“ Since acquiring FKI for just under £1 billion in  
2008 the FKI businesses have generated £2 billion  
of cash from trading and disposal proceeds.  
Brush, the largest of the FKI businesses, is still  
owned by the Melrose Group.”
Finance costs and income
The net finance cost in 2014 was £33.5 million (2013: £48.5 million).
Prior to the Return of Capital made on 28 February 2014 and 
following the disposal of Bridon on 12 November 2014, the 
Group’s net debt and bank leverage were lower than usual levels. 
This, along with the renegotiation of the Group’s financing facilities 
on 11 July 2014 (discussed later in this review), contributed to net 
interest on external bank loans, overdrafts and cash balances 
being lower in the year at £20.3 million (2013: £34.3 million). In 
2014 the Group had a blended interest rate of 2.4% (2013: 3.1%).
Melrose uses interest rate swaps to fix the majority of the interest 
rate exposure on its debt. More detail on these swaps is given  
in the finance cost risk management section of this review. 
Also included in net finance cost is a £4.0 million (2013: £4.7 
million) amortisation charge relating to the arrangement costs  
of raising the bank facility, a net interest cost on net pension 
liabilities of £7.8 million (2013: £8.9 million) and a charge for the 
unwinding of discounts on long-term provisions of £1.4 million 
(2013: £0.6 million). 
Tax
The headline Income Statement tax rate was 27.0% (2013: 26.4%). 
The headline tax rate for the Group is lower than the weighted 
blend of the statutory tax rates around the world because of the 
recognition of deferred tax assets that were not previously thought 
to be recoverable. There is also a small benefit from the release  
of provisions previously held against potential overseas tax audits 
which have been successfully resolved.
The tax rate after exceptional items and intangible asset 
amortisation is 32.4% (2013: 28.9%). The main reason for this 
being higher than the headline rate is the £3.9 million (2013:  
£8.1 million) exceptional tax charge on Group reorganisations.
The cash tax rate on headline continuing operations of 16.5% 
(2013: 22.5%) is below the headline Income Statement rate  
due to the utilisation of pre-existing Melrose Group tax losses  
and other deferred tax assets. 
The deferred tax liability in respect of intangible assets,  
of £259.8 million (2013: £287.4 million), is not expected to 
represent a future cash tax payment and will unwind as the 
customer relationship, brand name and intellectual property 
intangible assets are amortised.

Performance Review
Performance Review Finance Director’s review continued
The total amount of tax losses in the Group has decreased during 
the year due to their utilisation against taxable profits and also as a 
result of some utilisation against tax audits in respect of prior years.

Exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets
In the year ended 31 December 2014 the continuing Group 
incurred exceptional costs of £34.3 million (2013: £19.3 million). 
These included £30.6 million (2013: £18.8 million) of restructuring 
costs which mainly relate to the Elster businesses, notably in Gas 
where the most significant proportion of restructuring cost relates  
to the closure of the Essen plant in Belgium and relocation of its 
Integrated Metering Solutions business, which builds gas metering 
stations, to Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. This decision was taken  
so as to move production closer to the major gas metering station 
markets and it is also expected to deliver cost savings in the future 
as a result. Additionally, restructuring projects were undertaken in 
the Gas business in Mainz, to move research and development and 
the production of ultrasonic meters to the German plant in the year. 
Also within the Gas business, following the acquisition of Eclipse, 
Inc. (“Eclipse”) late in 2014, immediate severance programmes 
were announced in the US business as part of  
the planned synergies. 
The restructuring costs incurred in 2013 were proportionally 
weighted to the Elster Electricity and Water businesses. Some 
restructuring costs have been incurred within these businesses  
in 2014 within the European operations following the large 
restructure programmes performed in the North America 
businesses in 2012 and 2013.
In addition, £3.7 million (2013: £0.5 million) of acquisition and 
disposal costs were incurred, mostly relating to the acquisition  
of Eclipse. 
The Group benefited from exceptional income of £5.4 million 
(2013: £28.9 million) as a result of the release of a surplus 
provision following the successful resolution of a property  
lease dispute. The exceptional income in 2013 related to the 
successful resolution of a number of warranty issues, inherited  
with the acquisition of Elster, for less expense than expected. 
In addition, intangible asset amortisation of £54.7 million  
(2013: £57.1 million) was charged. A net tax credit on these 
exceptional costs, exceptional income and intangible asset 
amortisation, of £19.5 million (2013: £17.0 million), and an 
exceptional tax charge of £3.9 million (2013: £8.1 million)  
has been taken in the year.
Overall, the net exceptional items and intangible asset 
amortisation, after tax, shows a net expense of £68.0 million 
(2013: £38.6 million).
Earnings per share (“EPS”) 
The Melrose Board considers that headline diluted EPS, 
calculated using the headline continuing profit attributable  
to shareholders and the number of shares in issue following  
the Return of Capital in March 2015, best demonstrates  
the performance in 2014 because it matches the size of  
the continuing Group with the ongoing number of shares.  
On this basis the EPS in 2014 was 15.3p.
In accordance with IAS 33, two sets of basic and diluted EPS 
numbers are disclosed on the face of the Income Statement,  
one for continuing operations and one that also includes 
discontinued operations. In the year ended 31 December 2014  
the diluted EPS for continuing operations was 7 .8p (2013: 7 .8p).  
For continuing and discontinued operations the diluted EPS for 
2014 was 17.5p (2013: 43.7p).
Acquisition during the year
On 31 October 2014 Elster Gas acquired Eclipse, a manufacturer 
of gas combustion components and systems for industrial heating 
and drying applications, headquartered in Rockford, Illinois (USA), 
for cash consideration of £97 .6 million. The acquisition was funded 
through the existing Group debt facilities and in the two months  
of ownership Eclipse has contributed £12.2 million to revenue and 
£1.4 million to headline operating profit.
Disposal during the year
On 12 November 2014 the disposal of Bridon was completed for  
a gross cash consideration of £374.8 million less £9.9 million of 
costs. The profit on disposal of this business was £96.9 million. 
Bridon was acquired with FKI in July 2008 and contributed  
£208.0 million of revenue and £22.6 million of headline operating 
profit up to the date it was disposed in 2014, and is shown within 
discontinued operations. 
Since acquiring FKI for just under £1 billion in 2008 the FKI 
businesses have generated £2 billion of cash from trading and 
disposal proceeds. Brush, the largest of the FKI businesses,  
is still owned by the Melrose Group.

The conversion of headline operating profit (before depreciation 
and amortisation) into cash was 90% in 2014 (2013: 96%). Within 
this strong level of cash generation Elster achieved 94% and 
Brush 83%.

The Balance Sheet leverage (calculated as net debt divided  
by continuing headline operating profit before depreciation and 
amortisation) was 1.8x at 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: 
0.4x). Net debt will increase in March 2015 following the recently 
approved Return of Capital of £200.4 million. Allowing for this, the 
proforma leverage at 31 December 2014 would have been 2.5x, 
which is considered to be a better reflection of the ongoing 
leverage level for the Group.
Capital expenditure
By business, the net capital expenditure and depreciation  
in the year was as follows:
Elster Energy Central Total
Net capital expenditure £m 28.1 30.0 0.2 58.3
Depreciation £m 24.6 6.3 0.9 31.8
Net capital expenditure to 
depreciation ratio (full year) 1.1x 4.8x 0.2x 1.8x
Melrose 10 year (2005–2014) 
average annual multiple 1.3x
The net capital spend to depreciation ratio was 1.8x in 2014 (2013: 
1.1x). Within this, the ratio in the Brush business was 4.8x (2013: 
2.8x) which included the continuation of the significant investment 
in a new factory in the Shanghai area of China. The net capital 
spend to depreciation ratio in Elster was 1.1x (2013: 0.7x). Elster  
is inherently a less capital intensive business than Energy.

Provisions
Total provisions at 31 December 2014 were £177.0 million  
(31 December 2013: £177.8 million). In total, £49.6 million  
of cash was spent on the utilisation of provisions, of which  
£38.7 million related to restructuring and warranty. The

The net charge to headline operating profit in the year was £15.0 
million which included the £7.0 million divisional LTIP charge along 
with £7.8 million of normal net warranty expenses in the year. 
The net charge to exceptional items of £26.2 million included 
£31.6 million relating to restructuring projects, most of which is 
expected to be spent in 2015. This amount has been partly offset 
by the exceptional income release of £5.4 million relating to the 
successful resolution of a historical property lease dispute. 
The other movements on provisions in the period relate to the net 
effect of the unwind of discounting on long-term provisions and 
the relevant foreign exchange impact.
Finance Director’s review continued
Pensions
The Group has a number of defined benefit and defined 
contribution pension plans.
At 31 December 2014 the FKI UK Pension Plans, which comprise 
two separate independent plans, the FKI UK Pension Plan and the 
Brush Group (2013) Pension Plan, are significant in size and had  
a combined net deficit at 31 December 2014 of £82.7 million  
(31 December 2013: £100.2 million). Plan assets were £695.6 
million (31 December 2013: £619.5 million) and plan liabilities  
were £778.3 million (31 December 2013: £719.7 million). 
The other UK defined benefit pension plan of significant size in  
the Group is the McKechnie UK Pension Plan with an accounting 
surplus at 31 December 2014 of £1.6 million (31 December 2013: 
deficit of £0.5 million). The plan assets at 31 December 2014 were 
£209.9 million (31 December 2013: £182.5 million) and liabilities 
were £208.3 million (31 December 2013: £183.0 million). 
These three UK plans are closed both to new members and 
current members’ future service. 
A US defined benefit plan for FKI also exists. At 31 December 
2014 the FKI US plan had assets of £176.5 million (31 December 
2013: £177.6 million), liabilities of £195.2 million (31 December 
2013: £183.0 million) and consequently a net deficit of £18.7 
million (31 December 2013: £5.4 million). This plan is closed to 
new members and to current members’ future service.
During the year a decision was made to offer lump sums to 
terminated vested participants of the FKI US Plan whose benefit 
had a current lump sum of US $65,000 or less. Approximately 
60% of those offered accepted, resulting in a reduction in gross 
liabilities of £23 million, and a benefit of £3.5 million to the overall 
pension charge for the year, shown within central costs.
The Elster businesses also operate a number of defined benefit 
plans, most of which are unfunded, with a net accounting deficit 
at 31 December 2014 of £118.7 million (31 December 2013: 
£101.5 million). Within this, 79%, or £94.3 million (31 December 
2013: 82%), related to unfunded German defined benefit plans 
and early retirement programmes.
During the year the Group terminated certain Elster US unfunded 
retiree medical and welfare plans, reducing gross liabilities by  
£4.3 million, which benefited the overall pension charge in the  
year within the Gas division.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Performance Review A summary of key assumptions used for all of the UK plans is 
shown below:
2014 Assumptions  
%
2013 Assumptions  
%
Discount rate 3.50 4.40
Inflation 2.10 3.40
For the most significant plans (the FKI UK Pension Plans),  
a male aged 65 in 2014 is expected to live for a further 21.9 years 
(31 December 2013: 21.9 years) whilst a woman aged 65 would  
live for a further 24.2 years (31 December 2013: 24.1 years).  
This is assumed to increase by 1.3 years (6%) for a male and  
1.5 years (6%) for a female aged 65 in 2034.
It is noted that a 0.1 percentage point decrease in the discount 
rate would increase the pension liabilities on the UK pension  
plans by £15.6 million, or 2%, and a 0.1 percentage point increase 
to inflation would increase the liabilities on these plans by  
£11.1 million, or 1%. Furthermore, an increase by one year in  
the expected life of a 65 year old member would increase the  
pension liabilities on these plans by £36.2 million, or 4%.
The long-term strategy for the UK plans is to concentrate on the 
cash flows required to fund the liabilities as they fall due, whether 
that is within the timescales of Melrose ownership or beyond.  
The pension plan cash flows extend many years into the future 
and the ultimate objective is that the total pool of assets derived 
from future Company contributions and the investment strategy 
allow each cash payment to members to be made when due.  
In 2014 the Melrose Group made annual contributions of £18.5 
million in total (2013: £18.5 million) to the two remaining UK plans 
within the FKI businesses and £5.2 million (2013: £5.2 million) to 
the McKechnie UK Pension Plan. In addition, £8.1 million was  
paid into the disposed Bridon Group (2013) Pension Plan.
In 2015 the Group expects to contribute £20.0 million to the FKI 
UK Plans and £5.2 million to the McKechnie UK Pension Plan.
The Melrose Board recognises that pension plan liabilities need  
to exit the Group as businesses are sold. However, this can be 
done at a time which is commercially sensible.
Risk management
The financial risks the Group faces have been considered and 
policies have been implemented to best deal with each risk.  
The most significant financial risks are considered to be liquidity 
risk, finance cost risk, exchange rate risk, contract and warranty 
risk and commodity cost risk. These are discussed in turn below.
Liquidity risk management
The Group’s net debt position at 31 December 2014 was £501.3 
million compared to £140.8 million a year earlier. The level of net 
debt and leverage at both year ends was lower than the normal 
level because disposals had been completed during the year but 
the associated returns to shareholders did not occur until after  
the year end. 
On 11 July 2014 the Group’s financing facilities were renegotiated 
to improve the existing terms and to extend the maturity date from 
29 June 2017 to 11 July 2019.
The Group previously had a committed term loan held in two 
tranches of £180 million and US $290 million. As part of the 
renegotiation the US $290 million term loan tranche was 
converted into a revolving credit facility and now exists along  
with the £741.5 million and €300 million revolving credit facilities 
that were already in place. The remaining Sterling term loan is 
subject to mandatory 5% repayments on 11 July 2017 , 11 July 
2018 and 11 January 2019.
The banking facility continues to have two financial covenants,  
a net debt to headline EBITDA covenant (debt cover covenant) 
and an interest cover covenant, both of which are tested half 
yearly at June and December and both of which afforded 
comfortable headroom at 31 December 2014. 
The first of these covenants, which calculates net debt at average 
rates during the year, is set at 3.5x leverage or lower for each of 
the half yearly measurement dates for the remainder of the term. 
At 31 December 2014 it was 1.7x (31 December 2013: 0.5x), but  
it would have been 2.5x on a proforma basis when allowing for  
the Return of Capital that will occur in March 2015.
The interest cover covenant is unchanged, at 4.0x or higher 
throughout the life of the facility. At 31 December 2014 it was 
15.3x (31 December 2013: 11.8x).
The drawdown of the facilities are made in the core currencies  
of the Group, being US Dollar, Euro and Sterling and in 
proportions to protect the Group as efficiently as possible  
from currency fluctuations on net assets and profit.
In addition, there are a number of uncommitted overdraft, 
guarantee and borrowing facilities made available to the Group. 
These uncommitted facilities are lightly used.
Cash, deposits and marketable securities amounted to £70.5 
million at 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: £200.4 million) 
and are offset against gross debt of £571.8 million (31 December 
2013: £341.2 million) to arrive at the net debt position of £501.3 
million (31 December 2013: £140.8 million). The combination of 
this cash and the size of the debt facilities allows the Directors  
to consider that the Group has sufficient access to liquidity for  
its current needs.
The Board considers carefully its counterparty risk with banks 
when deciding where to place the cash on deposit held within  
the Melrose Group.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Performance Review
Performance Review Finance cost risk management
The Group remained in a net debt position at 31 December 2014. 
Drawdowns under the amended facilities bear interest at 
interbank rates of interest plus a margin. The margin ranges 
between 0.75% and 1.90% (previously 1.40% to 2.65%), 
determined by reference to the Group’s debt cover ratio. 
At the beginning of 2014 the Group protected just under 80%  
of gross borrowings from exposure to changes in interest rates  
by holding a number of interest rate swaps to fix the cost on  
US $246.8 million, £336.8 million and €200.0 million of debt. 
During the year, following the disposal of Bridon, a €50.0 million 
interest rate swap arrangement was closed out. This left swap 
arrangements in place fixing the interest rate cost on US $246.8 
million, £336.8 million and €150.0 million of gross borrowings at  
31 December 2014.
Subsequent to the Balance Sheet date, to ensure that the Group 
protected between 70% and 80% of gross borrowings from 
exposure to changes in interest rates following the Return of 
Capital in March 2015, further swap arrangements have been 
closed out and new arrangements placed. The new swap 
arrangements provide protection through to July 2019 and require 
the Group to pay, annually in arrears, a weighted blended fixed 
finance cost of 0.92% (31 December 2013: 0.70%) for US Dollar 
swaps, 0.06% (31 December 2013: 0.72%) on Euro swaps and 
1.05% (31 December 2013: 0.91%) on Sterling swaps, plus the 
relevant bank margin which is currently 1.30% (31 December 
2013: 2.25%). 
Exchange rate risk management
The Group trades in various countries around the world and is 
exposed to many different foreign currencies. The Group therefore 
carries an exchange rate risk that can be categorised into three 
types as described below. The Board policy is designed to protect 
against the majority of the cash risks but not the non-cash risks. 
The most common cash risk is the transaction risk the Group 
takes when it invoices a sale in a different currency to the one  
in which its cost of sale is incurred. This is addressed by taking 
out forward cover against approximately 60% to 80% of the 
anticipated cash flows over the following 12 months, placed on  
a rolling quarterly basis and for 100% of each material contract. 
This does not eliminate the cash risk but does bring some 
certainty to it.

The effect on the key headline numbers in 2014 for the continuing 
Group due to the translation movement of exchange rates from 
2013 to 2014 is shown below. The table illustrates the translation 
movement in revenue and headline operating profit if the 2013 
average exchange rates had been used to calculate the 2014 
results rather than the 2014 average exchange rates. In particular, 
the table illustrates an 8% headwind to headline operating profit  
in the year from the movement in foreign exchange rates.
The translation difference in 2014 £m
Revenue decrease 90.4
Headline operating profit decrease 19.5
Given the Group’s largest exchange rate exposure is to the Euro, 
which makes up 40% of Group profits in 2014, current exchange 
rates, including the recent weakness of the Euro, mean there is  
a 5% headwind from currency into 2015.
For reference in respect of the enlarged Group, an indication  
of the short-term exchange rate risk, which shows both translation 
exchange risk and unhedged transaction exchange rate risk,  
is as follows:
Sensitivity of profit to translation  
and unhedged transaction exchange risk
Increase in headline 
operating profit  
£m
For every 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar 
against Sterling 6.2
For every 10 cent strengthening of the Euro 
against Sterling 8.1
The long-term exchange rate risk, which ignores any hedging 
instruments, is as follows:
Sensitivity of profit to translation  
and full transaction exchange rate risk
Increase in headline 
operating profit  
£m
For every 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar 
against Sterling 8.4
For every 10 cent strengthening of the Euro 
against Sterling 4.3
Finance Director’s review continued
48
 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Performance Review No specific exchange instruments are used to protect against  
the translation risk because it is a non-cash risk to the Group. 
However, when the Group has net debt, the hedge of having  
a multi-currency debt facility funding these foreign currency 
trading units protects against some of the Balance Sheet and 
banking covenant translation risk.
Lastly, potentially the most significant exchange risk that the 
Group has arises when a business that is predominantly based  
in a foreign currency is sold. The proceeds for those businesses 
may be received in a foreign currency and therefore an exchange 
risk might arise if foreign currency proceeds are converted  
back to Sterling, for instance to pay a dividend to shareholders. 
Protection against this risk is considered on a case-by-case basis. 
Contract and warranty risk management
The financial risks connected with contracts and warranties, 
which include the consideration of warranty terms, duration and 
any other commercial or legal terms, are considered carefully by 
Melrose before being entered into.
Commodity cost risk management
As Melrose owns engineering businesses across various  
sectors the cumulative expenditure on commodities is important.  
The Group addresses the risk of base commodity costs 
increasing by, wherever possible, passing on the cost increases  
to customers or by having suitable purchase agreements with  
its suppliers which sometimes fix the price over some months  
into the future. These risks are minimised through sourcing 
policies (including the use of multiple sources, where possible) 
and procurement contracts where prices are agreed for up to  
one year to limit exposure to price volatility.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely  
to affect its future development, performance and position, are  
set out in the Strategic Report and Performance Review sections  
of the Annual Report. In addition, the consolidated financial 
statements, and in particular notes 19 and 24, include details of 
the Group’s borrowing facilities and hedging activities along with 
the processes for managing its exposures to credit risk, capital 
risk, liquidity risk, interest risk, foreign currency risk and 
commodity cost risk. 
The Group has considerable financial resources and a breadth  
of end markets, both by sector and geographically, giving  
some balance to the various market and economic cycle risks. 
Furthermore, the Group has a consistent cash generation record, 
and as a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is  
well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite  
the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue  
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.

1. Employment policies
The Group recognises its responsibilities  
for the fair treatment of all its current and 
potential employees in accordance with 
legislation applicable to the territories  
within which it operates, together with 
relevant guidance on good practice where 
appropriate. Due to the diverse nature of the 
Group’s activities, businesses are required  
to manage their employment matters on a 
decentralised basis; therefore, responsibility 
for the adoption of employment policies and 
practices sits at a local business unit level. 
This position ensures that rigorous and 
targeted policies and procedures are 
implemented that meet both site and local 
regulatory requirements, taking into account 
the size and nature of the businesses.
As part of this decentralised approach, 
each business is responsible for setting  
and measuring its own employment and 
employee-related KPIs and, as such, these 
vary throughout the Group. However,  
such measurements will generally include 
absenteeism, punctuality, headcount and 
employee relations issues.
Any concerns or adverse trends are 
responded to in a timely manner. 
Furthermore, as a Group-wide policy  
and so far as particular disabilities permit, 
the Company and each of its businesses 
will, where practicable, give employees 
disabled during their period of employment 
continued employment in the same job,  
or a suitable alternative job, together with 
appropriate training and/or re-training.
Equal opportunities for appropriate 
training, career development and 
promotion are also available to all 
employees within the Group regardless  
of any physical disability, gender, religion, 
race, nationality, sexual orientation or age.
Applications for employment by disabled 
persons are always fully and fairly 
considered by the Group and are 
considered on merit, with regard only  
to the job-specific requirements and the 
relevant applicant’s aptitude and ability  
to carry out the role. Where reasonable  
to do so, arrangements wll be made to 
enable disabled persons to carry out a 
specific role. It is the policy of the Group 
that in recruitment, training, career 
development and promotion, the treatment 
of disabled persons should, as far as 
possible, be identical to that of other 
employees. Melrose is proud to be a 
member of the Business Disability Forum,  
a not-for-profit member organisation that 
works with the business community to 
understand the changes required in the 
workplace in order that disabled people  
are treated fairly so that they can 
contribute to business success, to  
society and to economic growth.
The Group regards employee training and 
advancement as an essential element of 
industrial relations. 
2. Employee involvement,  
consultation and development 
The Group attaches great importance  
to good labour relations, employee 
engagement and employee development. 
The diverse nature of the Group’s  
activities places the responsibility for  
the implementation and management  
of employment practices with local 
management, in a manner appropriate  
to each business.
A culture of clear communication and 
employee consultation and engagement  
is inherent in the Group’s businesses. 
Employee briefing sessions with employee 
representatives are held on a regular basis 
to communicate strategy, key changes, 
financial results, achievements and other 
important issues to employees, and 
receive feedback from them on these 
issues. Regular appraisals, employee 
surveys, notice boards, team meetings, 
suggestion boxes and newsletters are  
World class manufacturing 
facilities and engineering.
also used to communicate and engage 
with employees, and to solicit their 
feedback on issues of concern to them  
as employees.
Extensive training is available to all staff 
and is actively encouraged to ensure  
that a high standard of skill is maintained 
across the Group. Cross-training 
programmes are also in place at a number  
of the Group’s businesses. The importance 
of training extends beyond on-the-job 
training and also focuses on enhancing 
personal development. Apprenticeship 
programmes are in place, which help  
to assist with succession planning in 
locations where there is an ageing 
workforce. Employees are encouraged  
to think in an innovative manner across  
the Group and have regard for both 
financial and economic factors affecting  
the Group.

Performance Review • In 2014, Brush UK launched a new 
Graduate Scheme, illustrating its 
commitment to recruiting bright minds  
and fresh talent for the future. The two-year 
graduate programme includes an  
overseas placement so that the graduates 
gain international experience within the 
organisation preparing them for a 
successful future with Brush. To ensure  
the success of this programme, Brush 
representatives attended a number of  
job fairs to promote the programme  
and discuss it with potential graduates. 
This included the Graduate Engineer  
and Science Show in London. Brush has  
also been active in the local community, 
attending careers fairs at local schools 
encouraging young people to consider 
engineering and manufacturing as a  
career choice. Such events also promote 
the employer branding of Brush in a wider 
sphere as an employer of choice.
• Brush continues to value the contribution 
that apprentices bring to the organisation 
and another 10 apprentices joined Brush 
UK in 2014 bringing the total current 
number of apprentices to 56 at various 
stages of their four year apprenticeship. 
The apprentice scheme is continually 
developing and evolving to bring together 
a blend of technical training, academic 
learning and personal development to 
create a future talent pipeline for Brush.
• Brush takes the health and well-being  
of its employees very seriously and has 
continued to develop and enhance its 
Occupational Health Service, which is 
available to employees five days a week. 
The service can make referrals to 
doctors, physiotherapists or counselling 
services as required to ensure that the 
business supports its employees through 
any periods of absence or illness. Health 
promotion is a key feature of the service 
that is continually developing through 
awareness campaigns, which in turn has 
a positive impact on both the employee 
and the business.
• Elster Electricity introduced new internal 
communication initiatives in 2014; a further 
step in fostering a culture of clear and 
open communication. In September 2014, 
the first global webcast (Electricity*LIVE*) 
took place, hosted by the global 
management team. The first global 
newsletter, Electricity*CurrentAffairs*, 
containing contributions from employees 
worldwide, was distributed in December 
2014. Specialised newsletters are also 
issued bi-monthly, providing employees 
with important business facts and news  
regarding the software business.
• Elster Electricity’s 2014 Global Leadership 
Development Programme involved  
two strategy workshops, two training 
sessions on change management and  
a four-day training session on leadership 
for 42 employees.
• Two Elster Gas leadership conferences 
were held in 2014. These were attended 
by senior management, managing 
directors and other executives from  
across the Elster Gas businesses.  
The conferences involved knowledge 
sharing and discussions on business 
priorities and strategic targets.
• Elster Gas conducted their first international 
employee engagement survey in 2014 
covering the major parts of the business. 
Teams were set up to work on the analysis 
and evaluation of the survey results and  
the development of action plans, in order  
to improve employee engagement.
• Elster Water launched an improved 
performance management system in 
2014 to ensure that all employees are 
aware of the business objectives and  
how they individually contribute to the 
success of the business.
3. Employee initiatives
During 2014, the Group’s businesses 
implemented a range of employee-related 
initiatives. Some of these are listed below:
• Recognising that leadership is critical to 
the success of its business, Brush UK 
has developed and implemented a 
Leadership Development Programme 
which has external accreditation to the 
Institute of Leadership & Management.  
It is structured to allow talent to develop 
and grow within the business. The 
programme has been designed to  
reflect the development needs of the 
organisation and through the Problem 
Solving Module participants identify a 
business improvement opportunity which 
creates a return on investment in the 
company. Participants present their 
opportunities to the Brush Executive  
to underline how they have applied their 
learning in the operational environment.
• The Brush Group launched a Customer 
Connection Programme in 2014 
supporting its global vision statement 
‘The Vital Few’. The objective of the 
programme is to develop the employees’ 
ability to exceed the expectations of both 
the internal and external customers and 
maximise these relationships. During  
the programme, employees identify a 
Customer Innovation Project which 
delivers a return on investment in the 
company and is presented to the Brush 
Executive at the end of the programme.

5. Health and safety
The Directors of the Company are 
committed to minimising the health and 
safety risks that each of the Group’s 
employees are exposed to by promoting 
the effective use and management of 
business specific policies and procedures.
The Group has a policy to ensure that the 
Directors are made aware of any serious 
health and safety incidents, wherever they 
occur in the world, without delay, to ensure 
that suitable investigations and corrective 
action can be organised. Current events and 
issues relating to health and safety matters 
are also discussed within the Group at 
quarterly Board meetings of the Company.
Each business is responsible for setting  
its own detailed arrangements concerning 
health and safety policies and procedures, 
in accordance with local health and safety 
legislation. As a general rule, businesses 
strive to achieve best practice, in terms of 
what is suitable and practical for the size 
and nature of their operations. Defined and 
business specific health and safety key 
performance indicators are also used 
within the Group’s businesses.
Reports detailing business unit 
performances in relation to three  
health and safety KPIs (Major Accident 
Frequency Rate; Accident Frequency  
Rate; and Accident Severity Rate) are 
presented to the Board and reviewed  
at each quarterly Board meeting.  
There were no issues or concerns 
identified by the Melrose Board during 
2014. While no corrective measures were 
deemed necessary, the Board as always 
encourages business unit management  
to remain vigilant where employee and  
third party safety is concerned.
Many manufacturing locations within the 
Group hold ISO 18001 certification, the 
internationally recognised assessment 
standard for occupational health and 
safety management systems. 
Divisional managers within each business 
unit have responsibility to ensure that 
health and safety remains a key focus  
and to ensure that active procedures  
and monitoring systems are in place. 
Detailed health and safety plans are set  
by businesses each year to determine 
annual targets and improvement initiatives.
All businesses have Health and Safety 
Committees (“H&S Committees”), which 
meet on a regular basis and are made up  
of representatives from both management 
and shop floor level personnel. Each of  
the H&S Committees has wide-ranging 
responsibilities which vary from business to 
business and include the review of reported 
incidents and the monitoring of incident 
trends. These H&S Committees are also 
responsible for ensuring that corrective 
measures are implemented when accidents 
occur and that all incidents, whether or not 
they are deemed reportable under local 
legislation, are given due attention.
Health, safety and 
sustainability are integral 
to our business.

6. Health and safety initiatives
During 2014, many of the Group’s 
businesses implemented a range of  
health and safety initiatives. Some of  
these are listed below:
• During 2014, Brush UK implemented  
a behavioural safety programme to 
continue to evolve the very strong  
health and safety culture within the 
business. The programme focuses  
on developing a proactive approach 
among Brush employees so that they 
increase their responsibility and 
accountability for their own and their 
working group’s actions while ensuring 
they intervene at the earliest opportunity 
to stop an unsafe act or correct an 
unsafe condition.
• The business has recognised the 
following benefits:
 – A 100% reduction in reportable 
accidents to the Health and Safety 
Executive;
 – An engaged workforce in matters 
relating to health and safety; 
 – A clear demonstration of the Brush 
management’s intentions to 
continually improve the standard  
of health and safety within the 
business; and
 – A recognition that a strong health  
and safety culture can have a positive 
impact on the growth and brand 
value of the business. 
• Elster Electricity carried out numerous 
health and safety initiatives in various 
countries in 2014. This included an 
initiative at Elster Electricity UK which 
provided training and awareness in key 
areas including fire marshalling, first aid,  
manual handling, safety management 
and risk control. 
• In Brazil, personal safety procedures for 
risk areas were implemented and weekly 
five minute health and safety talks were 
held with all production employees at 
Elster Electricity’s Mexican site. In the  
US, safety audits were conducted by  
an external third party to provide a safer 
working environment for all employees. 
• Following the highly successful 
implementation and external audit  
of the OHSAS 18001 system in  
Romania in October 2014, and to 
support Elster Electricity’s increased 
commitment to Occupational Health  
and Safety (OHS), OHSAS 18001 will  
be further implemented within EMEA 
and externally audited throughout 2015. 
This initiative demonstrates Elster 
Electricity’s continued commitment  
to employee well-being. 
• It is a policy of Elster Gas that all major 
manufacturing plants are certified to 
OHSAS 18001 to promote world class 
health and safety practices. Several  
major plants are now accident free. 
• During the year, the Accident Frequency 
Rate for the global Elster Gas business 
was reduced by 30% when compared 
with 2013. At the same time, the 
Accident Severity Rate saw a 50% 
reduction. The improvement in both 
metrics demonstrates the leadership’s 
commitment to improving the welfare  
of all Elster Gas employees worldwide. 
• Elster Water’s 2013 comprehensive OHS 
review and improvement initiative was 
completed in H1 2014. Elster Water sites 
with assembly and/or test processes 
were re-audited after completion of 
minor improvements and confirmed 
compliant to national and international 
OHS standards.
• All operational processes are subject  
to continuous review by senior site 
management to confirm compliance to 
OHS standards. Elster Water applies a 
“no-risk” tolerance in order to provide a 
safe and clean work environment for all 
its employees.
One of the key responsibilities for these 
H&S Committees is to carry out regular 
tours of the premises in which they work, 
in order to ensure compliance with local 
policies and procedures. These tours  
also identify potential hazards, for which 
counter-measures can be identified to 
prevent accidents from happening.  
Each H&S Committee recommendation  
is followed up at the next divisional Board 
meeting to ensure that issues are resolved. 
Additionally, operations are audited by  
the H&S Committee at least annually and 
reports of performance and recommended 
improvements are prepared and circulated 
to the divisional senior management 
teams. Divisional managers are provided 
with detailed health and safety reports on  
a frequent basis to ensure that such 
matters are given high visibility and that 
improvements are authorised and 
implemented quickly.
“ Divisional managers are 
provided with detailed 
health and safety reports 
on a frequent basis.”

Performance Review 8. Environmental initiatives
During 2014, many of the Group’s 
businesses implemented a range of 
environmental improvement initiatives. 
Some of these are listed below:
• Brush UK focused on making further 
energy savings. Savings were  
made in gas consumption (19% saving 
from 2013) and electricity consumption 
(0.5% saving from 2013). Lighting initiatives 
across the Loughborough site have 
generated savings in certain working 
facilities of between 47% and 72%.
• To increase awareness of environmental 
management and to complement the 
existing ISO 14001 certifications at the 
operations in Romania, the UK, and 
Russia, standardised processes are 
being implemented across Elster 
Electricity. To ensure best practice and 
transparency, these new processes will 
continue to be aligned with ISO 14001 
and will be externally audited. 
• Elster Electricity constantly increases 
product features while optimising its power 
consumption, having a positive impact  
on energy saving, energy distribution  
costs and energy management features.  
Elster EnergyICT, a unit within Elster 
Electricity, offers utility-grade energy 
management software solutions.  
These help to reduce their clients’  
energy consumption by up to 30%. 
• At Elster Electricity in Mexico, a “tree day” 
was held in 2014 which involved the 
donation of trees for reforestation.
• It is a policy of Elster Gas that all major 
manufacturing plants are certified to 
OHSAS 14001 to promote world class 
environmental behaviour. In several 
countries the 2013 certifications were 
renewed following audit approvals. In  
the first quarter of 2014, both facilities  
in Germany were certified.
• A comprehensive environmental 
measurement and reporting system was 
introduced for all Elster Gas manufacturing 
operations which tracks six key KPIs as 
part of the monthly operations review. The 
KPIs measure electricity consumption, gas 
consumption (and hence together CO
2
), 
water consumption, solid waste generation 
(and % recycled), liquid waste generation 
and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) 
emissions. Performance against these 
KPIs improved in 2014. 
• Elster Water meters and radio equipment 
contain lithium batteries. These batteries 
are defined as dangerous goods under 
the ‘UN Recommendations on the 
Transport of Dangerous Goods’. Elster 
Water, together with its logistics partners, 
have implemented appropriate processes 
to ensure compliance with these  
UN Recommendations.
7. The environment
The Melrose Board fully understands the 
importance of the Group’s environmental 
responsibilities. Each of the Company’s 
businesses is committed to ensuring that 
their operations have a minimum possible 
adverse effect on the environment.
Although there are no standardised 
environmental KPIs currently used within 
the Group, each business understands  
the importance of monitoring the impact  
of its operations on the environment.  
A range of KPIs are used as environmental 
measures, including energy consumption, 
CO
2 
emissions, water consumption,  
water contamination, waste disposal,  
solid and liquid waste generation,  
recycling and volatile organic compound 
emissions. Environmental performance  
is measured using KPIs in order that  
each of the businesses can plan for 
ongoing reductions.
During the year, the Company continued to 
comply with the ongoing annual reporting 
requirements of the UK’s Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme.

(2) Excluding Bridon emissions.
(3)  The emissions associated with overseas electricity are presented in tonnes carbon dioxide only as per the DEFRA guidance.
All material emissions from within the 
organisational and operational scope and 
boundaries of the Group are reported.  
The emissions from owned vehicle 
transport (i.e. Group owned cars and  
vans, lorries and fork lift trucks) and the 
emissions associated with refrigeration 
have been excluded from the report on  
a de minimis basis. The GHG emissions 
from these sources have been estimated  
to account for less than 1% of the total 
Melrose emissions reported on an 
individual basis and as a combined total  
to account for less than 2% of the total 
Melrose GHG emissions reported.
The financial reporting year of 2013  
was the first year in which the Company 
had been required to disclose its GHG 
emissions data within the Annual Report 
and represents the baseline against which 
the subsequent emission data sets will  
be based. The main change in the data 
compared to the baseline data, as 
presented in the table above, is due to  
the divestment of the Bridon business  
unit in 2014; the Bridon group represented 
approximately 45% of the total GHG 
emissions reported in 2013. Other, smaller 
changes have resulted from the closure 
and relocation of activities from some  
sites and general efficiency savings and 
improvements at a number of other sites.
Given that the Melrose business model  
is to acquire and divest businesses over  
a 3-5 year timeframe, there may be 
significant year on year changes in the 
reported emissions data which may not 
reflect the underlying GHG performance  
of the Group’s businesses.
10. Energy Savings  
Opportunity Scheme
The Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme 
(“ESOS”) Regulations 2014, which 
transpose Article 8 of EU Directive 
2012/27/EU on energy efficiency and  
came into force on 17 July 2014, are 
intended to help deliver part of the EU’s 
20% improvement in energy efficiency.  
The ESOS Regulations require qualifying 
organisations to measure energy 
consumption, evaluate energy efficiency, 
identify management opportunities, store 
data and notify the Environment Agency  
by 5 December 2015 that an ESOS 
compliance audit has been completed.
Melrose is working with environmental  
and energy efficiency specialists, CMR 
Consultants, to ensure that the Group 
meets its ESOS compliance obligations. 
9. Greenhouse gas emissions
This greenhouse gas (GHG) report has  
been prepared for the reporting period  
of 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014. 
The data has been prepared in 
accordance with the principles and 
requirements of the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol, Revised Edition, ISO 14064  
Part 1 and DEFRA (Department for 
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) 
guidance on how to measure and report  
on greenhouse gas emissions 2013.
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 43 (see Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013 paragraph 18).
These sources fall within our consolidated 
statement. We do not have responsibility 
for any emission sources that are not 
included in our consolidated statement. 
We have used the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition), data gathered  
in accordance with our GHG reporting 
procedure and emission factors from  
UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2014.
The reported emissions cover all entities 
over which the organisation had financial 
control for a period of at least one year as of 
31 December 2014. Emissions from entities 
acquired or disposed of during the reporting 
period (i.e. disposed of before 31 December 
2014 or acquired after 1 January 2014) are 
not accounted for in the report. Therefore, 
the data from the Bridon business unit has 
not been included within the reported GHG 
data, as this business was divested during 
2014. One business was acquired during 
the reporting period, Eclipse, and the 
emissions from this business unit will  
be included in the 2015 report.

11. Supply chain assurance
Owing to the geographical and operational 
diversity of the Group’s businesses, and 
therefore its supplier base, there is no single 
over-arching Group policy currently in use  
in relation to suppliers. However, the security, 
assurance and ethical compliance of 
business supply chains is very important  
to Melrose. Responsibility for the 
implementation and management of all 
supplier-related policies rests with local 
management in each business. Such 
policies are used in a manner appropriate  
to the size and complexity of each business 
and also take into account the nature and 
geographical representation of key suppliers. 
A supplier approval process exists within the 
businesses, which is linked to specific and 
tailored supplier assessments and due 
diligence requirements.
12. Human rights and ethical 
standards
As is stated within the employee policies 
and supply chain assurance sections 
above, the decentralised nature of the 
Group means there is no single over-
arching policy currently in place with  
regard to human rights. However, sound 
business ethics and integrity are core to  
the Group’s values and each business 
places a high importance on its dealings 
with all employees, customers, suppliers 
and other stakeholders and is committed 
to good practice in respect of human 
rights. Employees within each Group 
business are required, at all times, to 
exhibit the highest Ievels of integrity and  
to maintain the highest ethical standards  
in business affairs.
Each of the Group’s businesses will  
have their own code of ethics dealing  
with matters such as human rights.  
All employee policies are also prepared  
locally within each business in order to 
ensure compliance with local laws and 
standards as a minimum. Responsibility  
for the communication and implementation 
of such policies rests with the relevant 
senior divisional managers.
The Brush Group has been involved  
in high class engineering and 
manufacturing for more than 125 years.

Governance overview
Introduction  
from the Chairman 
previously dated September 2012 and was 
updated by the FRC in September 2014. 
Although the updated version of the UK 
Code only applies to financial periods 
beginning on or after 1 October 2014, 
Melrose welcomes the changes to the UK 
Code and therefore will be seeking to comply 
with them earlier than formally expected.
In support of this commitment, the Board 
carried out a number of actions during 2014 
designed to ensure that Melrose remains 
compliant with the provisions of the UK 
Code and also to enable continuous 
improvement in line with best practice 
corporate governance guidelines.
Risk management 
In 2014, the Board initiated a root and 
branch audit of the risk management 
framework and underlying processes  
in operation in every business in the 
Melrose Group. Following on from this 
audit, external risk consultants BDO LLP 
have been engaged to support the  
Group in developing an enhanced risk 
framework and in implementing a 
programme to promote and embed  
a more risk-aware culture across the 
organisation. As part of this programme,  
the Group’s risk strategy and the  
Board’s risk appetite will be reviewed  
and, if deemed appropriate, refreshed. 
Further details on this can be found on 
pages 36 to 41 of the Annual Report.
Remuneration
The revised UK Code provides that greater 
emphasis should be placed on ensuring 
that remuneration policies are designed 
with the long-term success of the 
Company in mind. This is a belief that  
the Melrose Board has always held.  
Our remuneration philosophy is that 
executive remuneration should be simple 
and transparent, support the delivery  
of the business strategy and pay for 
performance. This belief is reflected in  
our remuneration structure. Base salaries 
are set at the lower end of a competitive 
range, the annual bonus is deliberately 
positioned below the median maximum 
opportunity for comparable companies 
and payments under the single long-term 
Board  
structure

The Board remains committed to 
maintaining the high standards 
of corporate governance 
required to ensure that the 
Company can continue to deliver 
on its strategic goals and to 
achieve long-term success for 
the benefit of its shareholders.
As part of this approach, the Board 
supports, applies and complies with the 
Main Principles, the Supporting Principles 
and the respective related provisions of 
corporate governance contained in the  
UK Corporate Governance Code (the “UK 
Code”) issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council (the “FRC”) and available to view

incentive arrangement are entirely 
dependent upon shareholder value 
generated over a five year period. Rather 
than successive one year LTIP schemes, 
we believe that a five year scheme is 
preferable in that it is closer to a typical 
ownership cycle for an acquired business. 
We believe that this remuneration strategy 
has directly driven Melrose’s historical 
out-performance of the market, supported 
the Company’s success and clearly led  
to increased shareholder value. 
A further change to the UK Code provides 
that companies should put in place 
arrangements that will enable the recovery  
or withholding of variable pay. Malus
(1)
 has 
always applied to the Melrose long-term 
incentive plan and the annual bonus 
scheme. The Company will introduce a 
clawback provision for the annual bonus 
scheme with effect from the 2014 annual 
bonus. In addition, clawback will apply to 
any new long-term incentive arrangements 
awarded to executive Directors of Melrose, 
in line with best practice. 
Main responsibilities of  
the Board: 
effectively manage and control the Company 
via a formal schedule of matters reserved for 
its decision;
determine and review Company strategy  
and policy;
consider acquisitions, disposals and asset 
requests for major capital expenditure;
review trading performance;
ensure that adequate funding and personnel 
are in place;
maintain sound internal control systems;
report to shareholders and give consideration 
to all other significant financial matters;
agree Board succession plans and consider 
the evaluation of the Board’s performance 
over the preceding year;
review the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems; and
agree the Group’s governance framework 
and approve the Standards of Business 
Conduct and other Group policies.

Governance
Governance Directors’ report
The Directors of Melrose Industries PLC 
(the “Company”) present their Annual 
Report and audited financial statements  
of the Group for the year ended  
31 December 2014.
The Corporate Governance report set out on pages 68 to 71,  
the Finance Director’s review on pages 42 to 49 and the Corporate 
and Social Responsibility section of the Performance Review  
on pages 50 to 57 , are each incorporated by reference into this 
Directors’ report. Disclosures elsewhere in the Annual Report  
are cross-referenced where appropriate; taken together, they  
fulfil the combined requirements of the Companies Act 2006  
(the “Act”) and of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (the 
“DTRs”) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.
Details of significant events since the Balance Sheet date are 
contained in note 29 to the financial statements. An indication  
of likely future developments in Group businesses is included 
within the Performance Review.
Directors
The Directors of the Company as at the date of this report, together 
with their biographical details, are given on pages 62 and 63. 
Changes to the Board during the year are set out in the Corporate 
Governance report on pages 68 to 71. Details of Directors’ service 
contracts are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report on 
page 93.
The Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the 
consolidated financial statements is set out on page 96.
Appointment and removal of Directors and their powers
The Company’s articles of association (“Articles”) give the 
Directors the power to appoint and replace other Directors.  
Under the terms of reference of the Nomination Committee,  
any appointment must be recommended by the Nomination 
Committee for approval by the Board. 
With effect from the 2012 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”),  
the Board determined that all Directors of the Company should 
stand for re-election on an annual basis, in compliance with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, and this 
requirement is contained in the Articles. Therefore, all Directors 
will offer themselves for re-election at the AGM to be held on  
14 May 2015. 
The Directors are responsible for managing the business of the 
Company and exercise their powers in accordance with the 
Articles, directions given by special resolution and any relevant 
statutes and regulations. Specific powers relating to the allotment 
and issuance of shares and the ability of the Company to 
purchase its own shares are also included within the Articles  
and such authorities are submitted for approval by the 
shareholders at the AGM each year. 
Pursuant to sections 693 and 701 of the Act and a special 
resolution passed at the AGM in 2014, the Company was 
authorised to purchase its own shares, limited to an aggregate 
maximum number equal to 10% of the issued share capital of  
the Company. The Company did not purchase any Ordinary 
Shares pursuant to this authority. The resolutions being proposed 
at this year’s AGM include a resolution to renew this authority.
Insurance and indemnities
The Directors have the benefit of an indemnity from the Company 
in respect of their liabilities incurred as a result of their office. This 
indemnity is provided under the Company’s Articles and satisfies 
the indemnity provisions of the Act.
The Company has taken out an insurance policy in respect of 
those liabilities for which the Directors may not be indemnified. 
Neither the indemnity nor the insurance provides cover in the 
event that a Director is proved to have acted dishonestly or 
fraudulently. 
AGM
The AGM of the Company will be held at Barber-Surgeons’  
Hall, Monkwell Square, Wood Street, London, EC2Y 5BL at  
11.00 am on 14 May 2015. The notice convening the meeting  
is shown on pages 156 to 161 and includes full details of the 
resolutions to be proposed, together with explanatory notes  
in relation to such resolutions.
Post Balance Sheet events
In November 2014, the Company completed the disposal of  
its Bridon business for an enterprise value of £365 million (see  
note 9 to the financial statements for further details), representing 
the latest step in realising value for the FKI businesses acquired  
by Melrose in 2008. In accordance with its strategy, the Board 
decided to use part of the net proceeds of the disposal to return 
£200 million in cash to shareholders (the “Return of Capital”).  
At the time of such decision, this return was equivalent to 18.7 
pence per existing Ordinary Share of 13/110 pence nominal  
value each in the capital of the Company in issue at that time  
(the “Existing Ordinary Shares”).
The Return of Capital was approved by shareholders at a general 
meeting of the Company held on 20 February 2015, using a 
redeemable share scheme (in this case involving B Shares and/or  
C Shares) and was structured with the objective of enabling 
shareholders, subject to restrictions in respect of certain  
overseas shareholders, to elect to receive their cash proceeds  
of 18.7 pence per Existing Ordinary Share as:
• an income payment (the ‘‘Income Option’’); or
• a capital payment (the ‘‘Capital Option’’), (collectively the  
“Share Alternatives”).
Shareholders were also offered a mix and match facility, such  
that they could choose to receive the cash proceeds through  
a combination of the Share Alternatives.
Only shareholders who were on the register of members at  
5.00 pm on 20 February 2015 (the “B/C Share Record Date”)  
were entitled to participate in the Return of Capital, and the 
deadline for shareholders making their elections in respect  
of the Share Alternatives was 4.30 pm on 27 February 2015.

Income Option Relevant shareholders received one C Share, with a nominal value of 0.00001 pence, for every 
Existing Ordinary Share held at the B/C Share Record Date, and a single C Share dividend  
of 18.7 pence per C Share held. The single C Share dividend became due and payable on  
2 March 2015 and, thereafter, the C Shares were automatically converted into C Deferred 
Shares with a nominal value of 0.00001 pence each. Proceeds in respect of the Income  
Option will be paid to relevant shareholders and the C Deferred Shares will be automatically 
redeemed by the Company on 16 March 2015.
687 ,786,937
Capital Option Relevant shareholders received one B Share, with a nominal value of 18.7 pence, for every 
Existing Ordinary Share held at the B/C Share Record Date, and had such B Share(s) redeemed 
by the Company on 2 March 2015. Proceeds in respect of the Capital Option will be paid to 
relevant shareholders on 16 March 2015.
383,974,411
(1)  The Capital Option was not made available to any shareholders with a registered address in, or who were resident or located in, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of South 
Africa, United States, and any other territory where the invitation to participate in the Return of Capital proposals and any election for the Capital Option in respect of all or some of such 
shareholder’s entitlement to the Return of Capital would violate the laws of that jurisdiction or would require the registration of the B Shares, C Shares and/or C Deferred Shares, and all such 
shareholders were automatically deemed to have elected for the Income Option.
Associated with the Return of Capital, an Ordinary Share capital 
consolidation was approved by shareholders at the general 
meeting of the Company held on 20 February 2015, in the ratio  
of 13 for 14 (the “Share Capital Consolidation”), and the record 
date for the Share Capital Consolidation was 6.00 pm on the 
same day (the “Share Capital Consolidation Record Date”).
The aim of the Share Capital Consolidation was to ensure, so  
far as possible, that the market price of an Ordinary Share 
remained approximately the same before and after the Return  
of Capital and, so far as possible, to maintain comparability of 
historical and future per share data.
The Share Capital Consolidation was effected by the sub-division  
of every Existing Ordinary Share into 13 shares of 1/110 pence 
each in the capital of the Company and, forthwith upon such 
sub-division, the consolidation of every 14 shares of 1/110  
pence each in the capital of the Company resulting from such 
sub-division into one new ordinary share of 7/55 pence in the 
capital of the Company (the “New Ordinary Shares”). 
Details of the structure of the Company’s share capital both 
before and after the Share Capital Consolidation, together with  
the rights attached to each of the share classes in issue as at  
31 December 2013, 31 December 2014 and immediately following 
the Share Capital Consolidation on 20 February 2015, are set  
out within the sections below. Shareholders continued to own 
approximately the same proportion of the Company after the 
Share Capital Consolidation as they did before, subject to 
fractional entitlements.

(1) Fractional entitlements resulting from the Share Capital Consolidation effective on  
10 February 2014 were aggregated and sold in the market on shareholders’ behalf. In order  
to ensure that the aggregate of all fractional entitlements to be sold in the market added up  
to a whole number of New Ordinary Shares, between the B/C Share Record Date and the 
Share Capital Consolidation Record Date, one Ordinary Share was allotted fully paid up for 
cash to Investec Bank plc at a price which was equal to the closing middle-market price of  
an Existing Ordinary Share on 7 February 2014, less 47 pence. This Ordinary Share was  
not entitled to participate in the Return of Capital, but was subject to the Share Capital 
Consolidation in the ratio of 11 for 13 approved by shareholders at the general meeting  
of the Company held on 7 February 2014.
(2)  Fractional entitlements resulting from the Share Capital Consolidation effective on  
23 February 2015 were aggregated and sold in the market. The aggregated proceeds of  
sale, net of commission, were donated to a charity nominated by the Board, the Rainbow 
Trust. In order to ensure that the aggregate of all fractional entitlements to be sold in the 
market added up to a whole number of New Ordinary Shares, Nine Existing Ordinary Shares 
were allotted and issued to Investec Bank plc on 3 February 2015 at 266.8 pence per share, 
being the closing middle-market price of an Existing Ordinary Share on 2 February 2015. 
These Ordinary Shares were subject to the Share Capital Consolidation and were entitled  
to participate in the Return of Capital. 
Only the New Ordinary Shares are traded on the London  
Stock Exchange.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that restrict the transfer of New Ordinary Shares  
or that restrict voting rights attached to the New Ordinary Shares.
Details of the 2012 Incentive Share Plan are set out on pages  
81 to 82 of the Directors’ remuneration report and note 22 to

Shareholders’ voting rights
Only the New Ordinary Shares have voting rights attached. In  
a general meeting of the Company, subject to the provisions of 
the current Articles and to any special rights or restrictions as to 
voting attached to any other class of shares in the Company from 
time to time:
• on a show of hands, every member who is present (in person  
or by proxy) shall have one vote; and
• on a poll, every member who is present (in person or by proxy) 
shall have one vote for every share they hold.
If any call or other sum payable by a holder of New Ordinary 
Shares remains unpaid, they shall not be entitled to vote at a 
general meeting or class meeting in respect of any shares held  
by them. Currently, all New Ordinary Shares are fully paid.
Articles of association
The Company’s Articles were amended pursuant to a special 
resolution approved at the general meeting of the Company  
held on 20 February 2015, in order to reflect the rights and 
restrictions attaching to the B Shares, the C Shares and the  
C Deferred Shares, and certain other changes required in relation 
to the Share Capital Consolidation. The rights and restrictions 
attaching to the New Ordinary Shares following the Share Capital 
Consolidation remained exactly the same as those attaching to 
the Existing Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Share 
Capital Consolidation.

The Directors are pleased to recommend the payment of a final 
dividend of 5.3p per share (2013: 5.0p) on 18 May 2015 to 
Ordinary shareholders on the register of members of the 
Company at the close of business on 17 April 2015. This dividend 
recommendation will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming 
AGM of the Company, to be held on 14 May 2015. Subject to 
shareholder approval being obtained at the AGM for the final 
dividend, this will mean a full year 2014 dividend of 8.1p per share 
(2013: 7.75p).
In November 2014, the Company completed the disposal of  
its Bridon business for an enterprise value of £365 million (see  
note 9 to the financial statements for further details), representing 
the latest step in realising value for the FKI businesses acquired  
by Melrose in 2008. In accordance with its strategy, the Board 
decided to use part of the net proceeds of the disposal to return 
£200 million in cash to shareholders, by way of the Return of 
Capital proposals described earlier in this Directors’ report. The 
Return of Capital was approved by shareholders at the general 
meeting of the Company held on 20 February 2015. This return  
to shareholders is not included in the full year dividend figure 
stated above. 
It is the intention of the Board to continue to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy, where appropriate. 
The Company offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”) which 
gives shareholders the opportunity to use their dividend payments 
to purchase further Ordinary Shares in Melrose Industries PLC. 
Further details about the DRIP and its terms and conditions can 
be found within the Investors section on the Company’s website 
at www.melroseplc.net. To the extent that shareholders chose 
the Income Option in respect of all or some of their entitlement to 
the Return of Capital, the DRIP could not be used in relation to the 
single C Share dividend paid to such shareholders in respect of 
their holdings of such C Shares.
Financial instruments
The disclosures required in relation to the use of financial 
instruments by the Company, including the financial risk 
management objectives and policies of the Company and  
the exposure of the Company to credit risk, liquidity risk, cash  
flow risk, exchange rate risk, contract and warranty risk and 
commodity cost risk, can be found in the Finance Director’s 
review on pages 42 to 49, which is incorporated by reference into 
this Directors’ report, and in note 24 to the financial statements.
Research and development activities
Melrose Group businesses are encouraged to focus on research 
and development and to ensure that new and innovative product 
lines continue to be developed. During 2014, investment 
continued and several new product launches were either realised 
during 2014, or planned for 2015. This Group strategy helps  
to ensure that each business can remain at the forefront of 
technological advances within defined market sectors and be  
able to meet specific customer demands. Some examples of  
the types of new products being launched within the various 
markets are discussed within the business reviews on pages  
28 to 35 of the Performance Review.

The Directors of the Company fully understand the importance of

Disclosures required under Listing Rule 9.8.4R
No information is required to be disclosed by the Company in 
respect of Listing Rules 9.8.4R (1) to (14).
Significant agreements and change of control
With the exception of the Group’s banking facilities, the 2012 
Incentive Plan (including the options over 2012 Incentive Shares) 
and the divisional management long-term incentive plans, there are 
no other agreements that would have a significant effect upon a 
change of control of Melrose Industries PLC as at 4 March 2015.
In June 2012, as part of the process to acquire Elster, the Group 
agreed a £1.5 billion five year multi-currency, committed bank 
facility, which was subsequently amended in July 2014 and 
extended for five years from that date. This states that in the event 
of a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, 
the Company and lenders under this facility are obliged to enter 
into negotiations to determine whether and, if so, how to continue 
with the facility. There is no obligation for the lenders to continue 
to make the facility available for more than 30 days beyond any 
change of control. Failure to reach agreement with parties on 
revised terms could require an acquirer to put in place 
replacement facilities.
In the event of a takeover of the Company, options over the 2012 
Incentive Shares would be exercised and any 2012 Incentive 
Shares resulting from such exercise, or that have previously been 
issued, would convert into Ordinary Shares of 7/55 pence or an 
entitlement to a dividend paid in cash, the rate of conversion being 
based upon the offer price of the Company’s Ordinary Shares as 
calculated on the date of the change of control of the Company.  
If part or the entire offer price is not in cash, the Remuneration 
Committee will determine the value of the non-cash element, 
having been advised by an investment bank of repute that such 
valuation is fair and reasonable.
Auditor
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware and the 
Directors have taken all the steps which they ought to have taken 
as Directors to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information. This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418  
of the Companies Act 2006.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee has reviewed the 
effectiveness, performance, independence and objectivity of  
the existing external auditor, Deloitte LLP, for the year ended  
31 December 2014 and concluded that the external auditor was  
in all respects effective. Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness  
to continue in office as auditor. Accordingly, resolutions will be 
proposed at the AGM of the Company to re-appoint Deloitte LLP 
as auditor of the Company and to authorise the Audit Committee 
to determine their remuneration.

81 and 82 of the Directors’ remuneration report, entitlements  
to executive Directors were awarded in one block, rather than 
phased. The 2012 Incentive Plan was recommended as being  
in the best interests of shareholders as a whole by the Board  
of Directors and was approved by shareholders at a general 
meeting held on 11 April 2012. With regard to all other aspects  
of executive Directors’ remuneration, the Company’s policies  
fully comply with the provisions of Schedule A of the UK Code.
The Audit Committee report, Nomination Committee report and 
Directors’ remuneration report also form part of this Corporate 
Governance report.
Main Principle A: Leadership
The Board
Details of the structure of the Board and its key responsibilities  
are shown on pages 60 and 61.
Board responsibilities are discharged in conjunction with senior 
management, who in turn are responsible for the day-to-day 
conduct of the Group’s operations and for reporting to the Board 
on items of significance and progress against objectives. The 
Board meets regularly during the year as well as on an ad-hoc 
basis as required by time-critical business needs. 
There were four, formally scheduled Board meetings held during 
the year and the attendance of each Director at these meetings  
is shown on page 70. In addition, a number of unscheduled Board 
meetings were held during the year in connection with corporate 
transactions, for example, business acquisitions and divestments 
and, since the year end, the Return of Capital to shareholders and 
associated share capital consolidation.
A pack of briefing papers and an agenda are provided to each 
Director in advance of each Board, Committee or Business Review 
meeting. The Directors are able to seek further clarification and 
information on any matter from any other Director, the Company 
Secretary or any other employee of the Group whenever 
necessary. Decisions are taken by the Board in conjunction with 
the recommendations of its Committees and advice from external 
consultants, advisers and senior management.
The Board has a fully encrypted electronic board portal system, 
enabling Board and Committee papers to be delivered securely  
to Directors. This facilitates a faster and more secure distribution 
of information, accessed using electronic tablets, and reduced 
resource usage.
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising and 
supporting the Chairman and the Board on corporate governance 
matters as well as ensuring a smooth flow of information to enable 
effective decision making. All Directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary and, through him, have 
access to independent professional advice in respect of their 
duties, at the Company’s expense. The Company Secretary acts 
as secretary to the Board, the Audit Committee, the Nomination 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee.
In addition, Business Review meetings are held between 
scheduled Board meetings. These meetings are critical to 
providing the Directors with a comprehensive understanding  
of the current performance and the key issues affecting Group 
businesses, without the formality or rigidity of a Board meeting. 
Chief executives and other senior management from the Melrose 
businesses are periodically invited to attend and present to these 
meetings, providing the Directors with an opportunity to meet  
and engage with existing and emerging talent from across  
the organisation.
In accordance with its Articles and in compliance with the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company has granted a qualifying  
third party indemnity to each Director. The Company also 
maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance.
Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Vice-Chairman are, and will remain, 
separate to that of the Chief Executive of the Company,  
in accordance with best practice and Board policy.
The Chairman, with the assistance of the Vice-Chairman, is 
responsible for leadership of the Board. The Chairman sets  
the Board agenda and ensures that adequate time is given to  
the discussion of issues, particularly those of a strategic nature. 
Responsibility for ensuring effective communications with 
shareholders rests with the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and the  
two other executive Directors. 
During 2014, the non-executive Directors, led by the current 
Senior non-executive Director, Perry Crosthwaite, held meetings 
to discuss and appraise the performance of the Chairman.
The Chief Executive is responsible for strategic direction and 
decisions involving the day-to-day management of the Company.
Main Principle B: Effectiveness
Board composition
As at 4 March 2015, the Board comprised an executive Chairman, 
three other executive Directors and four non-executive Directors,  
all of whom the Board considers to be independent. The Board 
believes that the Directors possess diverse business experience  
in areas complementary to the activities of the Company. 
Biographies of the Directors are shown on pages 62 and 63 and  
on the Company’s corporate website at www.melroseplc.net. 
These biographies identify any other appointments held by the 
non-executive Directors. None of the executive Directors hold 
non-executive positions outside the Company.
Non-executive Director independence
In accordance with the provisions of the UK Code, consideration 
has been given to the independence of all non-executive 
Directors. The Board considers all of the non-executive Directors  
to be independent.
68
 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Governance The Board notes that Perry Crosthwaite, who was appointed  
as a non-executive Director on the Melrose Board in July 2005  
and first elected at the 2006 AGM, will have served three terms 
totalling nine years at the time of the 2015 AGM. However,  
the Board is of the opinion that, due to his invaluable experience  
in financial and other corporate matters, Perry Crosthwaite 
continues to maintain both his effectiveness and his 
independence. The Board will continue to monitor this  
position but feels at the present time that Perry Crosthwaite 
continues to make an important contribution to the Company.
The non-executive Directors are not entitled to any cash bonus  
or shares under the 2012 Incentive Plan.
Board induction, training and support
A full and formal induction programme tailored to the needs  
of individual Directors is provided for new Directors joining  
the Board. The primary aim of the induction programme is  
to introduce new Directors to, and educate new Directors  
about, the Group’s businesses, its operations and its governance 
arrangements. Individual induction requirements are monitored  
by the Chairman and the Company Secretary to ensure that new 
Directors gain sufficient knowledge to enable them to contribute  
to the Board’s deliberations as quickly as possible.
One of the outputs from the 2013 Board evaluation exercise,  
see below, was a desire for the Board as a whole to gain greater 
visibility of and connection with the Group’s business operations. 
Following this feedback, a visit was organised to the Elster Gas 
operations in Germany (see below). 
Board visit
In October 2014, the Board visited Elster Gas in Lotte, near 
Osnabrück, Germany, which in 2012 had received the German 
Global Excellence in Operations award. Meetings were held  
with senior management from across the Elster Gas business  
and a tour of the production facility was complemented by 
presentations covering: 
• the history of Elster Gas, the scope of its operations and the 
global product range;
• the business transformation post-acquisition by Melrose; 
• the future strategy of Elster Gas; and
• human resource management across the business unit.
Board evaluation 
Evaluation approach and process
During 2014, the Chairman held meetings with each of the 
Directors, including the Senior non-executive Director, Perry 
Crosthwaite, to discuss the performance of individual executive 
Directors and the Board as a whole. Following positive feedback 
from Directors over the process adopted for the 2013 evaluation 
exercise, the Board decided once again to engage Lintstock 
Limited to undertake an independent evaluation of Board and 
Board Committee performance and to identify areas where 
performance and procedures might be further improved. 
Lintstock is a specialist corporate governance consultancy  
and, other than supporting the Audit Committee in its assessment  
of the effectiveness of the external auditor, has no commercial 
dealings or other connection with the Melrose Group.
The first stage of the evaluation involved a review by the Board of 
what had been delivered in 2014 against the outputs and actions 
agreed from the 2013 evaluation exercise.
Actions agreed from  
the 2013 evaluation
What we delivered  
in 2014
To incorporate into the Board 
schedule visits to major 
operating businesses and 
periodic sessions with senior 
management from those 
business units.
In October 2014, the Board visited  
the award winning/class leading Elster  
Gas factory in Osnabrück, Germany 
(see above). 
To increase the frequency of 
management presentations  
to the Board.
In addition to a series of presentations 
delivered by the Elster Gas management 
team during the Board’s site visit to 
Osnabrück, the Board also received a 
comprehensive business briefing from  
the leadership team of Elster Electricity. 
To devote further Board 
time to discussions on talent 
management and executive 
and non-executive Director 
succession planning.
Executive and non-executive Director 
succession planning, talent management 
and senior executive career planning were 
considered by the Board at a dedicated 
session held in December 2014. It is 
intended that these issues remain a core  
focus for the Board and that they be 
reviewed on an annual basis.
To further enhance the  
Board’s understanding  
of risk identification and 
management.
At the Board’s instruction, an audit was 
undertaken of the risk management 
processes in operation across the 
Group. Following this audit, a new 
risk management framework is being 
developed and will be implemented 
throughout the Group during 2015 
(see pages 36 to 37). 
The second stage of the 2014 evaluation involved Lintstock 
engaging with the Chairman and the Company Secretary to 
discuss and agree the scope of the proposed evaluation and  
to develop a series of questionnaires tailored to the specific 
circumstances of Melrose. 
The Board was requested to complete online questionnaires 
addressing the composition and performance of the Board and  
its Committees, and the performance of the Chairman and the 
Senior non-executive Director. The anonymity of all respondents 
was ensured throughout the process in order to promote the 
open and frank exchange of views.

Governance Corporate Governance report
continued
Lintstock subsequently produced a report which addressed the 
following areas:
• The composition of the Board, its expertise and dynamics;
• The performance of the Board since the last evaluation exercise; 
• The Board’s time management, the annual cycle of work and the 
support afforded to the Board;
• The performance of the Board Committees and of the Chairman 
and Senior non-executive Director;
• The Board’s oversight of strategy, its understanding of the 
Company’s performance relative to its competitors and the key 
strategic issues facing the Group over the next three to five years;
• The Board’s oversight and management of risk and internal 
control; and
• The succession planning for the executive Directors and for 
senior management at the level below the Board and the Board’s 
visibility of potential successors from within the business.
At a dedicated Board session, a report of the findings of the 
evaluation and its recommendations was discussed and specific 
actions agreed.
Outputs of the evaluation
The Board recognises the benefits of a thorough Board  
and Committee evaluation process. Overall, the evaluation 
demonstrated that the composition and performance of  
the Board and its Committees and the performance of the 
Chairman and the Senior non-executive Director continued  
to be very effective. 
As a result of the review, amongst other things, the Board agreed:
• On the importance of planning for executive Director succession 
and managing the succession of non-executive Directors;
• To continue its focus on risk management and internal control 
and to clearly delineate accountabilities for risk management 
between the Board and the Audit Committee;
• That it should continue with its visits to major operating units  
to ensure that it develops and maintains a sound knowledge of 
the businesses, is visible to the operations and has access to  
a broad group of executives and employees;
• To increase the frequency of management presentations so  
that the Chief Executive of each business reports to the Board 
annually; and
• That the format and content of the management information 
provided to the Board should be reviewed. Increased market 
information and intelligence was also requested. 
In accordance with the provisions of the UK Code, it is anticipated 
that externally facilitated Board evaluations will be carried out 
every three years. In years when an external evaluation is not 
carried out, the Board will continue to complete internal 
performance-based questionnaires, with the process managed 
by the Company Secretary. The scope for each subsequent 
evaluation will be designed to build upon learning gained in the 
previous year to ensure that the recommendations agreed in the 
evaluations are implemented and that year-on-year progress is 
measured and reported upon.
Annual re-election of Directors
In accordance with the provisions of the UK Code, all of the Directors 
stood for re-election at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. The 
Articles of the Company require the Directors to stand for annual 
re-election, thus ensuring continued compliance with the UK Code. 
As such, all Directors will offer themselves for re-election at the 2015 
Annual General Meeting, to be held on 14 May 2015. 
Following the formal performance evaluations of each of the 
Directors and having carefully considered the commitments 
required and the contribution made by each Director, the Chairman  
is of the opinion that each Director’s performance continues to be 
effective and continues to demonstrate commitment to the role.
Attendance of Directors at meetings
The following table shows the attendance of each of the Directors at 
the scheduled meetings of the Board and its Committees held during 
the year. The quorum necessary for the transaction of business by  
the Board and each of its Committees is two. Briefing papers and 
meeting agendas are provided to each Director in advance of each 
meeting. Decisions are taken by the Board in conjunction with the 
recommendations of its Committees and advice from external advisers 
and senior management as appropriate. The representations of any 
Director, who is unable to attend a meeting of the Board or a standing 
Committee, are duly considered by those Directors in attendance.
The table also shows attendance at Business Review meetings 
held between scheduled Board meetings.

Main Principle C: Accountability
Objectives and policy
The objectives of the Directors and senior management are to 
safeguard and increase the value of the business and assets of  
the Group for the benefit of its shareholders. Achievement of their 
objectives requires the development of policies and appropriate internal 
control frameworks to ensure the Group’s resources are managed 
properly and any key risks are identified and mitigated where possible.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the development of the 
Group’s overall risk management policies and system of internal 
control frameworks and for reviewing their respective effectiveness, 
while the role of management is to implement these policies and 
frameworks across the Group’s business operations. The Directors 
recognise that the systems and processes established by the 
Board are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and cannot provide absolute 
assurance against material financial misstatement or loss.
70
 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Governance The Board is committed to satisfying the internal control guidance 
for Directors set out in the revised version of the Turnbull 
Guidance on Internal Control. In accordance with this guidance, 
there is an ongoing process, regularly reviewed by the Directors, 
for identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating (where 
possible) the significant risks faced by the Group. This process  
for reviewing the Group’s internal controls is consistent with prior 
years and has been in place throughout the 2014 financial year 
and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report.
A separate Audit Committee report is set out on pages 72 to 75 
and provides details of the role and activities of the Committee 
and its relationship with the internal and external auditors.
Managing and controlling risk
The Group has policies and internal control frameworks which 
address a number of key business risks, including strategic, 
operational, compliance, ethical and financial risks. A summary  
of the principal risks and uncertainties that could impact upon  
the Group’s performance is set out on pages 38 to 41.
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies are 
also described in the Finance Director’s review on pages 42 to 49. 
The Group operates on a de-centralised basis and the Board  
has established an organisational structure with clear reporting 
procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated authority. 
Divisional senior management, operational managers and financial 
controllers have been delegated responsibility by the Board for  
the establishment and implementation of detailed control systems 
as appropriate for their business. 
An established programme of regular review is in place at  
the businesses and a culture of continuous improvement is 
encouraged by the Board through regular meetings with senior 
management, review of operating performance and progress 
against business plans. The ongoing process of review provides 
assurance that the control environment is operating as intended.
The Audit Committee also monitors the effectiveness of the 
internal control process implemented across the Group through  
a review of the key findings presented by the external and internal 
auditors. Management is responsible for ensuring that the Audit 
Committee’s recommendations in respect of internal controls  
and risk management are implemented.
Internal financial controls and reporting
The Group has a comprehensive system for assessing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, including strategic 
business planning and regular monitoring and reporting of financial 
performance. A detailed annual budget is prepared by senior 
management and thereafter is reviewed and formally adopted by  
the Board. The budget and other targets are regularly updated via  
a rolling forecast process and regular business review meetings are 
held involving senior management to assess performance. The results 
of these reviews are in turn reported to and discussed by the Board  
at each meeting. As discussed in the Audit Committee report on 
pages 72 to 75, BM Howarth is the Group’s internal auditor; they also 
assumed internal audit responsibility for the Elster businesses from 
acquisition in August 2012 onwards. A total of 37 internal audit visits, 
covering 43% of Group turnover, were completed during 2014. 
These visits include 30 Elster reporting units which, combined with 
the visits completed in 2013 and the planned visits for the first quarter 
of 2015, will ensure that 93% of the continuing Elster units will have 
been visited by internal audit since the acquisition. The Directors are 
pleased to report that there were no material deficiencies; the majority 
of the recommendations presented in the internal audit reports have 
now been, or are in the process of being, implemented. Of the 37 
sites visited in 2014, four sites have been chosen for “re-visits” in 2015 
to ensure that the agreed improvements to systems and processes 
have been implemented. During 2014, initial fair value audit visits were 
also completed on all Eclipse sites acquired during the year.
The Board confirms that, from the review of internal controls, it 
has not determined any significant failings or weaknesses that it 
considers require remedial action. The Board also confirms that it 
has not been advised of any material weaknesses in the internal 
control systems that relate to financial reporting.
Whistleblowing, anti-bribery and corruption policies
The Company takes very seriously its responsibilities under the 
Bribery Act 2010 and has in place appropriate measures to 
ensure compliance. Policies in place within each business apply 
to all Directors, employees (whether permanent, fixed-term, or 
temporary), pension trustees, consultants and other business 
advisers, contractors, trainees, volunteers, business agents, 
distributors, joint venture partners, or any other person working for 
or performing a service on behalf of the Company, its subsidiaries 
and associated companies in which it has a majority interest.
During 2014, the Company updated its compliance policies and 
these are now in the process of being implemented across the 
Group. As part of these ongoing improvements, NAVEX Global 
was engaged to provide an externally facilitated whistleblowing 
hotline which is being made available during 2015. 
Main Principle D: Remuneration 
Following changes to the Companies Act 2006 and in line with 
new regulations which came into effect on 1 October 2013, details 
around Directors’ remuneration, both generally and as it relates to 
the UK Code, are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report and 
are now presented in the following three sections:
• the annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, which can be found on pages 78 to 80; 
• the Annual Report on Remuneration, which can be found on 
pages 81 to 88; and
• a summary of the Directors’ remuneration policy, which can be 
found on pages 88 to 95.
Main Principle E: Relations with shareholders
The Company seeks to build on a mutual understanding of 
objectives with its institutional shareholders, via the executive 
Directors, through regular meetings and presentations following 
announcements of its annual and interim results. The non-executive 
Directors are available to meet institutional shareholders should 
there be unresolved matters they wish to bring to their attention. 
The views of key analysts and shareholders generally are fed back 
to the Board directly by individual Directors, or via the Company’s 
brokers. This helps to ensure that all members of the Board 
develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders.
The Board welcomes the attendance of shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting. The results of the voting on each of the 
resolutions proposed will be announced shortly after the Annual 
General Meeting has concluded, via the Melrose corporate 
website at www.melroseplc.net.

their biographies on pages 62 and 63.
Miles Templeman stepped down from the Committee following  
his retirement from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM on  
13 May 2014. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee invites the Group Finance Director, the Head of 
Financial Reporting and senior representatives of the external and 
internal auditors to attend meetings where appropriate to the 
business being considered. The Committee has the right to invite 
any other Directors and/or employees to attend meetings where 
this is considered appropriate. In addition, the Committee meets 
at least once per year with both the external and internal auditors 
without management present.
Summary of meetings in the year
The Committee is expected to meet not less than three times  
a year. In 2014, the Committee met in March, August and 
November. The scheduling of these meetings is designed to be 
aligned with the financial reporting timetable thereby enabling the 
Committee to review the Annual Report and financial statements, 
the interim financial report and the audit plan ahead of the year 
end audit and maintaining a view of the internal controls and 
processes throughout the year. 
The attendance of its members at these meetings is shown above.
Significant issues related to the financial statements
In discharging its duties under its terms of reference, the 
Committee undertook the following recurring activities that receive 
annual scrutiny:
• reviewed the Annual Report and financial statements and interim 
financial report. As part of this review the Committee received a 
report from the external auditor on their audit of the Annual Report 
and the financial statements and review of the interim report;
• considered the processes in place to generate forecasts of  
cash flows and accounting valuation information, including  
the reasonableness and consistent use of assumptions;
• reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and 
disclosures made in the Annual Report and financial statements 
on this matter; 
• considered the Annual Report and financial statements in the 
context of being fair, balanced and understandable and reviewed 
the content of a paper prepared by management with regard to 
this principle in relation to the 2014 Annual Report and financial 
statements. Advised the Board that in its view, the 2014 Annual 
Report and financial statements when taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy; and 
• reviewed and agreed the scope of the audit work to be 
undertaken by the auditor.
Role and responsibilities
The Audit Committee’s (the “Committee”) role and responsibilities are 
set out in its terms of reference. These were updated in August 2014 in 
line with best practice and are available on the Company’s website and 
from the Company Secretary at the Registered Office. In discharging 
its duties, the Committee embraces its role of protecting the interests 
of shareholders with respect to the integrity of financial information 
published by the Company and the effectiveness of the audit. 
Specifically, the Committee is responsible for:
• reviewing and monitoring the integrity of the financial statements 
of the Group, including the Annual Report and interim report;
• keeping under review the effectiveness of the Group’s financial 
reporting, internal audit and controls, risk management systems 
and compliance controls;
• focusing and challenging the consistency of accounting policies, 
methods used to account for significant or unusual transactions 
and compliance with accounting standards;
• reviewing the Group’s arrangements for its employees to raise 
concerns in confidence about possible wrongdoing in financial 
reporting, in accordance with the Company’s whistleblowing policy;
• developing, implementing and monitoring the Group’s policy on 
external audit and for overseeing the objectivity and effectiveness 
of the auditor; and
• reviewing and considering the Annual Report and financial 
statements to ensure that it is fair, balanced and understandable 
and advising the Board that it can state that this is the case.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Governance The Audit Committee’s activities during 2014
Significant issue considered by the Audit Committee How the issue was addressed by the Audit Committee
Provisions for legal and environmental claims and other 
provisions
The level of provisioning for legal and environmental claims and  
other provisions require significant judgement. 
Although provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted  
for management’s best current estimates, the judgemental nature of  
these items means that future amounts settled may be different from  
those provided.
(Refer to notes 3 and 20)
The Committee considered management’s proposed provisioning in 
respect of these legal and environmental claims and other provisions 
including the key judgements made and relevant legal advice.
The external auditor also reported on all material provisions to  
the Committee.
Having considered the matter and sought guidance from the external 
auditor, the Committee concluded that management’s proposed 
provisioning and the associated disclosures in the Annual Report 
were appropriate.
Classification of exceptional items 
The reporting, classification and consistency of exceptional items, 
specifically restructuring, were an area of focus for the Committee.
(Refer to note 6)
The Committee considered the nature, classification and consistency 
of exceptional items. These items were detailed in the external 
auditor’s paper to the Committee. The Committee considered this 
issue and concluded that these exceptional items were appropriately 
captured and disclosed.
Taxation risks and recognition of deferred tax assets
Judgement is required in determining the Group’s provision for income 
taxes including estimating tax provisions where additional current  
tax may become payable in the future following the audit by the tax 
authorities of previously filed tax returns. Judgement is also required  
as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on  
the availability of future taxable profits. 
(Refer to notes 3, 8 and 21)
Management’s taxation judgements, accounting treatment and the 
appropriateness of tax disclosures have been reviewed by the Committee. 
The Committee considered whether, from an accounting perspective, 
an update was required to the tax provisions previously recorded in 
respect of specific exposures identified. In addition, the Committee 
reviewed the tax implications of corporate transactions undertaken 
during the year. The Committee debated whether additional deferred  
tax assets should be brought onto the Balance Sheet as a consequence 
of, for example, the expected timing of future corporate transactions.
Having taken input from the external auditor, the Committee agreed with 
management’s proposed treatment of tax risks and deferred tax assets.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and other fixed assets
The judgements in relation to goodwill impairment testing relate  
to the assumptions applied in calculating the value in use of the 
cash-generating units being tested for impairment. The key  
assumptions applied in the calculation relate to the future  
performance expectations of the cash-generating units. 
The Committee has also considered the related disclosures  
within the financial statements.
(Refer to notes 3 and 12)
Business plans prepared by management supporting future 
performance expectations used in the calculation were approved  
by the Board. The Committee received a detailed report on the 
outcome of the impairment review performed by management.  
The impairment review was also an area of focus for the external 
auditor, who reported their findings to the Committee.
The Committee considered management’s approach, the 
assumptions applied in relation to the impairment of goodwill, 
intangible assets and other fixed assets and related disclosures  
and, having taken input from the external auditor, agreed with 
management’s assessment that there were no indicators of 
impairment for any of the Group’s business units during the year.
External auditor rotation
The Group is required to comply with developing regulatory 
requirements in respect of external auditor rotation.
As noted below, the external auditor is required to rotate the  
audit signing partner every five years. The Group’s current audit  
signing partner is due to be replaced in the financial year ending  
31 December 2015.
The Committee considered papers which highlighted the developing 
regulatory and governance framework and which highlighted the 
expected timeline and relevant impact on the Group. 
During 2014, the Committee considered a number of potential 
candidates for the role of new audit signing partner. A suitable candidate 
was selected and was formally introduced to the Committee. The new 
audit signing partner will take office following the conclusion of the audit 
process in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2014.
Non-audit fees
With effect from the 2017 financial year, the Group will be required to 
comply with new rules governing the level of non-audit services that 
may be awarded to the external auditor. 
The Committee considered papers detailing the new rules and 
highlighting the impact on the Group. A policy on the engagement  
of the external auditor for the supply of non-audit services is in place 
and, in line with best practice, is subject to regular review. The 
Company is committed to complying with the rules and regulations 
governing the payment of non-audit fees. 
In addition to these matters, the Committee considered the following significant issues in relation to the financial statements during the year:

External audit
Appointment, re-appointment and assessment  
of effectiveness
The Committee reviews and makes recommendations with regard 
to the re-appointment of the external auditors. In making these 
recommendations, the Committee considers auditor effectiveness 
and independence, partner rotation and any other factors which 
may impact the external auditor’s re-appointment.
The external auditor is required to rotate the audit signing partner 
every five years. The Group’s audit signing partner changed as 
part of that rotation process in 2010 and therefore partner rotation 
is due in the financial year ending 31 December 2015.
The Committee has reviewed the external auditor’s performance 
and effectiveness. For 2014, the Company engaged the services  
of Lintstock Limited, an independent corporate governance 
specialist, to support the assessment of Deloitte LLP’s 
effectiveness and performance. Lintstock worked with the 
Chairman of the Committee and the Company Secretary to 
develop a series of questions covering the key areas of the  
audit process that the Committee is expected to have an  
opinion over, including:
• the calibre, continuity, experience, resources and technical  
and industry knowledge of the external audit team;
• the planning and execution of the audit process;
• the quality and timeliness of communications from the  
external auditor;
• the support provided to the Committee by the external audit 
partner; and
• the external auditor’s independence and objectivity. 
The Committee, along with relevant members of the management 
team, were requested to complete an online questionnaire 
containing these questions. Lintstock subsequently produced  
a report summarising the responses. Based on this report,  
the Committee concluded that the quality of the external audit 
team remains very high, the external audit process is operating 
effectively and Deloitte LLP continues to prove effective in its  
role as external auditor. As detailed below, the Committee 
regularly monitors the objectivity and independence of the 
external auditor. 
Deloitte LLP was appointed in 2003 when the Company 
commenced trading and the external audit has not been  
formally tendered since then. The Committee is satisfied that the 
effectiveness and independence of the external auditor is not 
impaired in any way. There are no legal or contractual obligations 
that restrict the Group’s capacity to recommend a particular firm 
for appointment as auditor and therefore a resolution proposing 
the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as external auditors will be  
put to the shareholders at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.
Audit tendering
The Committee is mindful of the recommendations of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code that the external audit should be  
put out to tender every 10 years. The Company intends to comply 
with the order issued by the Competition & Markets Authority 
relating to the statutory audit market for FTSE 350 companies, 
which came into effect on 1 January 2015, and will apply to 
financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2015. The 
current audit engagement partner’s rotation is due in the year 
ending 31 December 2015. It is the Committee’s understanding 
that under the EU rules, a formal tender process will be required 
to be held no later than two years from the end of the current 
rotation and that a rotation of external audit firm will be required  
by 2023. This matter will be kept under review.
Non-audit services
Under new EU and Competition Commission rules, effective from 
the 2017 financial year, the level of non-audit services awarded to 
the external auditor will need to be capped at 70% of the average 
audit fee for the previous three years. 
The Company is committed to complying with the rules and 
regulations governing non-audit services. A policy on  
the engagement of the external auditor for the supply of non-audit 
services is in place to ensure that the provision of non-audit 
services does not impair the external auditor’s independence  
or objectivity. In accordance with best practice FRC guidelines, 
the Company policy in relation to non-audit services is kept under 
regular review (it was re-examined during 2014); the policy outlines 
which non-audit services are pre-approved (being those which 
are routine in nature, with a fee that is not significant in the context 
of the audit or audit-related services), which services require the 
prior approval of the Committee and which services the auditor  
is excluded from providing. The general principle is that the audit 
firm should not be requested to carry out non-audit services on 
any activity of the Company where they may, in the future, be 
required to give an audit opinion.
During 2014, the main non-audit services provided by Deloitte 
LLP were in relation to taxation advisory, compliance and  
planning services.
An analysis of the fees earned by the external auditors for audit 
and non-audit services can be found in note 7 to the consolidated 
financial statements.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Governance Auditor objectivity and independence
The Committee carries out regular reviews to ensure that  
auditor objectivity and independence is maintained at all times.  
A different senior partner oversees the taxation audit of the 
Company compared to those working on the non-audit  
taxation services. 
No fees were paid to Deloitte LLP on a contingent basis. Based 
on these strict procedures the Committee remains confident that 
auditor objectivity and independence have been maintained but 
accepts that non-audit work should be controlled to ensure that  
it does not compromise the auditor’s position.
At each year end, Deloitte LLP submits a letter setting out how it 
believes its independence and objectivity have been maintained. 
As noted above, they are also required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group audit every five years and significant 
subsidiary audits every seven years. 
Internal audit
Due to the size and complexity of the Group, it is appropriate for 
an internal audit programme to be used within the business. BM 
Howarth, an external firm, provides internal audit services to the 
Group. A rotation programme is in place, such that every business 
unit will have an internal audit at least once every three years, with 
the largest sites being reviewed at least once every two years.  
The rotation programme allows divisional management’s actions 
and responses to be followed up on a timely basis. The internal 
audit programme of planned visits is discussed and agreed with 
the Committee during the year.
The internal auditor’s remit includes assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control systems, compliance with  
the Group’s Policies and Procedures Manual and a review  
of the businesses’ Balance Sheets. A report of key findings  
and recommendations is presented to the Group Finance  
Director, the Head of Financial Reporting and, where considered 
necessary, the Group Operations Controller, followed by  
a meeting to discuss these key findings and to agree on  
resulting actions.
BM Howarth present their key findings to the Committee twice 
during the year. These presentations include details of the site 
coverage for the previous year and an outline of the planned visits 
for the current year. A review of the internal audit process and 
scope of work covered by the internal auditor is the responsibility  
of the Committee, to ensure their objectives, level of authority  
and resources are appropriate for the nature of the businesses 
under review. The Committee also reviews BM Howarth’s 
performance against the agreed internal audit programme.  
A report of significant findings is presented by the internal  
auditor to the Committee at each meeting and implementation  
of recommendations by the Board is followed up at the 
subsequent Committee meeting.

Committee responsibilities
The Nomination Committee (the “Committee”) discharges these 
responsibilities through: 
• regular review of the size, structure and composition of the Board 
and by providing recommendations to the Board of any 
adjustments that may be necessary from time to time;
• giving full consideration to succession planning in order to ensure 
an optimum balance of executive and non-executive Directors in 
terms of skills, experience and diversity;
• keeping under review the leadership needs of the business; and
• keeping up to date and fully informed about strategic issues and 
commercial changes affecting the Company and the markets in 
which it operates.
The Committee is expected to meet not less than twice a year 
and during 2014 the Committee met twice. The attendance of its 
members at these Committee meetings is shown above.
The Committee’s terms of reference were reviewed and revised  
in August 2014. Full terms of reference are available to view on  
the Company’s website at: www.melroseplc.net/about-us/
governance/nomination-committee
Further details regarding the composition, diversity policy and the 
2014 activities of the Committee are shown below.
Composition
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
majority of the members of the Committee were independent 
non-executive Directors throughout 2014. The Committee was 
chaired by Miles Templeman until his retirement from the Board 
following the conclusion of the 2014 AGM on 13 May 2014. Miles 
Templeman was succeeded as chairman by Liz Hewitt. Perry 
Crosthwaite, John Grant and Justin Dowley also served on the 
Committee throughout the year. Christopher Miller, Executive 
Chairman of the Board, was also a member of the Committee 
throughout the year.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.  
On occasion, the Committee invites the Chief Executive, the 
Vice-Chairman and the Group Finance Director to attend 
discussions where their input is required. 
The Nomination Committee has  
overall responsibility for making 
recommendations to the Board on  
all new appointments to the Board  
and for ensuring that the Board and  
its Committees have the appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, 
independence, diversity and knowledge 
of the Company to enable them to 
discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively.

performance is the key determinant

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Governance Diversity
Melrose is a meritocracy and individual performance is the  
key determinant in any appointment, irrespective of ethnicity, 
gender or other characteristic, trait or orientation. The Board 
recognises the importance of diversity throughout the workforce, 
be it geographical, cultural or market aligned and encompassing 
gender, race, sexual orientation and disability, and it is committed  
to equality of opportunity for all employees. For example, Melrose is 
proud to support the Business Disability Forum, a body committed  
to understanding the changes required in the workplace so that 
disabled people are treated fairly and they can contribute to 
business success, to society and to economic growth. 
The Committee currently takes into account a variety of factors 
before recommending any new appointments to the Board, 
including relevant skills to perform the role, experience, 
knowledge, ethnicity and gender. The most important priority  
of the Committee, however, has been and will continue to be 
ensuring that the best candidate is selected to join the Board  
and this approach will remain in place going forward.
The Committee will endeavour to pursue diversity, including 
gender diversity, throughout the Melrose Group and notes  
the recommendations of Lord Davies’ review, “Women  
on Boards”. However, given the Company’s strategic business 
model and the frequent turnover of businesses, the Committee 
does not think that setting and committing to specific diversity 
targets in relation to the composition of the Board, and the 
workforce in the wider businesses within the Group, is correct  
for Melrose.
What the Committee did in 2014
The principal focus of the Committee during 2014 has been to 
consider the items set out below:
• The Committee considered the composition and balance of  
the Board and the timing of future Board changes and reviewed 
the succession plans in place in respect of key executives  
in conjunction with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code; 
• The existing time commitment of Melrose non-executive 
Directors was reviewed and confirmed as appropriate;
• The Committee membership was reviewed and a 
recommendation made to the Board that no changes should be 
made in 2015;
• The independence of each non-executive Director was reviewed 
and a recommendation made to the Board supporting the 
Board’s determination of non-executive Director independence;
• Consideration was given to the re-appointment of the Directors 
before making a recommendation to the Board regarding each 
Director’s re-election at the 2015 AGM;
• A review of the leadership requirements of Melrose, both 
executive and non-executive, was undertaken and this 
confirmed that the existing management team is appropriate  
for the Group. This review also demonstrated that appropriate 
and effective leadership is in place within the business units  
and that processes are in place to ensure that performance  
is reviewed regularly against operational and financial criteria;
• The Committee examined the career planning and talent 
management programmes in operation across the Group  
and concluded that these were appropriate for the needs  
of the business;
• The Committee reviewed and re-affirmed the principles 
underlying the Company’s diversity policy; and
• The Committee’s terms of reference were revised during the  
year to ensure that these remain in line with best practice.

Governance Directors’ remuneration report
Dear Shareholder, 
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our report on 
Directors’ remuneration, being my first report as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. The Directors’ remuneration report sets 
out the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 31 December 
2014 and the remuneration policy for the Directors of Melrose. 
As with the Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended  
31 December 2013, this report is presented in two sections: the 
Annual Report on Remuneration and the Directors’ remuneration 
policy. The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details on the 
amounts earned in respect of the year ended 31 December 2014 
and how the Directors’ remuneration policy will be applied in 2015; 
the Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory 
vote at the AGM. The Directors’ remuneration policy sets out the 
policy that was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and 
took binding effect from the conclusion of that meeting (in line with 
the regulations on the presentation and disclosure of Directors’ 
remuneration which came into effect from October 2013), except 
that, as noted on page 88, we have not included the “illustrations  
of the application of Remuneration Policy”. The approval of the 
Directors’ remuneration policy is valid for three years (provided the 
Company does not intend to make changes to the policy within 
this period) and therefore shareholder approval of the policy is not 
required at the AGM scheduled for 14 May 2015. A key element of 
the Melrose remuneration framework is the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan, which had already been approved by special resolution of 
shareholders at a general meeting held in April 2012. 
Our remuneration structure for executive Directors
Melrose’s remuneration philosophy is that executive remuneration 
should be simple and transparent, support the delivery of the 
business strategy and pay for performance. This philosophy is 
reflected in our remuneration structure. 
The Remuneration Committee feels strongly that rewards should be 
linked to generation and delivery of real returns to shareholders.
• Base salary: Base salaries are paid at the lower end of a market 
competitive range compared to companies of similar size and 
complexity. Since flotation in 2003 all current executive Directors 
have received the same annual increases to base salary; in the 
last five years these increases have averaged 3%.
• Pension: Pension contributions/salary supplements for executive 
Directors are payable at the level of 15% of base salary, which is 
considered modest for a business of the size and complexity of 
Melrose. No executive Director participates in, or has ever 
participated in, any Melrose defined benefit pension scheme.
“ Melrose’s remuneration philosophy  
is that executive remuneration should  
be simple and transparent, support  
the delivery of the business strategy  
and pay for performance.”
The Board has delegated to the 
Remuneration Committee responsibility 
for overseeing the remuneration of  
the Company’s Directors, Company 
Secretary and other senior employees.

Annual Report 2014
Governance • Annual bonus: The maximum bonus payable is set at 100%  
of base salary. All Directors who participate in the annual bonus 
scheme receive the same percentage bonus. In the last five 
years, the average percentage of base salary payable has been 
81%. The maximum opportunity is deliberately positioned below 
the median maximum opportunity for FTSE 250 companies and  
is a percentage of salaries that are paid at the lower end of a 
market competitive range compared to companies of similar  
size and complexity.
• Long-term incentives: The only long-term incentive 
arrangement in which the executive Directors participate is the 
2012 Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders by 
special resolution in a general meeting held on 11 April 2012  
(the “LTIP”). Entitlements under the 2012 Incentive Plan, details  
of which are provided on page 85, were awarded in April 2012. 
Any payment made will be dependent upon shareholder value 
generated over a five year time period.
Rather than successive one year LTIP arrangements, we believe 
that a five year arrangement is preferable, given that it is closer to 
a typical ownership cycle for an acquired business. By its nature 
this means that any payment under the LTIP is only made once 
every five years and so the payment in that fifth year should not  
be regarded as an annual payment.
The LTIP arrangements are intended to directly align our executive 
Directors’ incentive arrangements with those of shareholders by 
linking remuneration specifically to shareholder value. The LTIP 
structure is designed to ensure that only once shareholders have 
received a compound, annual, cash return in excess of RPI plus 
2% does the LTIP have any value whatsoever. This means that  
the Melrose LTIP has a minimum growth requirement (effectively  
a charge) which requires the initial invested capital to be inflated  
by RPI + 2% per annum. The value payable to management  
under the LTIP comprises 7.5% of value created in excess of  
this minimum. The LTIP is then paid out to participants in pre-
determined proportions, either in Ordinary Shares or (and only  
in certain circumstances which are within the complete control  
of the Remuneration Committee) as a cash dividend, with the total 
being equal in value to 7.5% (reduced from 10% in the equivalent 
2009 plan) of the increase in shareholder value in excess of the 
minimum growth requirement from the date of grant to 31 May 
2017. The formula by which growth is calculated, as set out in  
the Company’s articles of association, takes account of every 
change to the capital structure and dividend payment. In this  
way, the participants will only receive a share of returns over  
and above that adjusted level. Under the 2012 Incentive Plan,  
the initial invested shareholder capital needs to grow by RPI +2% 
per annum before LTIP participants receive anything at all. After 
that return, shareholders will also receive 92.5% of any total value 
gain. We have included on pages 81 to 82 further information in 
relation to the 2012 Incentive Plan, including an illustration of how 
any increase in value would be shared between shareholders and 
participants in the plan. 
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that this simple  
and transparent incentive framework is aligned with the 
Company’s strategy for growth. We believe that this remuneration 
strategy has also directly driven historical out-performance  
when compared with our competitors, supported the Company’s 
success and has clearly led to increased shareholder value.  
In this regard, our remuneration arrangements are tailored to  
the culture and strategy of the Company and provide a strong 
platform for the ongoing long-term success of the Company.
Together with their own purchase of shares, the remuneration 
policy has also enabled the executive Directors to build up  
and retain significant shareholdings in the Company. As at  
31 December 2014, the Chairman and Chief Executive held  
92 and 51 times their base salary respectively in Melrose shares. 
Further detail is given on pages 84 to 85; however, the table  
below shows the number of Ordinary Shares held by the 
executive Directors as at 31 December 2014 and the value of 
each executive Director’s shareholding at that date as a multiple  
of his 2014 base salary.

As noted on page 85, internal Company rules on shareholdings  
are extended to senior Melrose management in addition to the  
executive Directors in order that appropriate remuneration 
principles are applied to senior management on a similar basis  
to executive Directors.

Governance
Governance Our remuneration structure for non-executive Directors
A simple remuneration structure is applied for our non-executive 
Directors. Non-executive Directors are paid fees to reflect market 
conditions and attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and 
expertise. Fees for non-executive Directors are determined by  
the executive Directors; and our non-executive Directors do not 
participate in our pension arrangements, the annual bonus or  
our long-term incentive arrangement. 
2014 key decisions and incentive pay-outs
The Remuneration Committee remains committed to a responsible 
approach to executive pay. As described in the Strategic Report 
and Performance Review sections of this Annual Report, the 
Company delivered strong financial and operational results in 2014. 
The executive Directors’ remuneration rewards that performance. 
Annual bonuses for executive Directors are calculated using  
two elements, 80% being based on diluted earnings per share 
growth and 20% on a strategic element. Having listened to  
our investors and a number of corporate governance advisers,  
and in the interests of transparency, greater levels of detail are 
included on the objectives and deliverables and on how the 
Remuneration Committee determined the level of award under 
the 2014 annual bonus.
In line with increases in previous years, an inflationary increase  
of 3% was made to the executive Directors’ salaries with effect 
from 1 January 2014. This is consistent with the salary rises 
awarded to the wider head office population. Non-executive 
Directors’ basic fees increased by 3% with effect from January 
2014 and with effect from the 2014 AGM the additional fees 
payable to the committee chairmen and Senior non-executive 
Director (which had been unchanged since 2006) were increased 
as disclosed in last year’s Directors’ remuneration report.
Awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan were made in April 2012 and 
are due to crystallise in May 2017; accordingly no executive Director 
received any pay-out under a long-term incentive plan in 2014.
Business unit Long-Term Incentive Plans
Long-term incentive plans are in place for the leadership of the 
Business units with pay-outs based on the performance of their 
respective businesses.
Approach to Directors’ remuneration for 2015
The Directors’ remuneration policy as approved by shareholders 
at the 2014 AGM is set out in the policy report on pages 88 to 95. 
Details of how the policy will be applied in practice for 2015 are set 
out in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 87. Executive 
Directors’ base salaries have been increased by 3% with effect 
from January 2015, the same as for other head office employees 
(other than where other such employees’ salaries have been 
increased on a different basis to reflect individual circumstances 
such as promotions). Non-executive Directors’ basic fees for 2015 
have also been increased by 3%. 
The overall framework for the executive Directors’ annual bonus 
arrangements for 2015 will remain the same as in 2014, with a 
maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of salary, 80% of which  
is based on financial performance metrics and 20% of which is 
based on strategic performance metrics.
Directors’ remuneration report 
continued
The Remuneration Committee has considered the application  
of malus and clawback to the executive Directors’ variable 
remuneration opportunities, taking into account the views of our 
investors and the corporate governance advisory agencies and 
the recent changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
annual bonus arrangement is a discretionary arrangement and, 
therefore, any annual bonus opportunity is, effectively, subject to  
a “malus” provision over the course of the relevant year. Annual 
bonus awards for 2014 and future years will also be subject to a 
clawback arrangement giving the Remuneration Committee the 
ability to require repayment of some or all of any bonus earned  
in the event of: (1) material misstatement of financial results; (2) 
miscalculation of any performance measure on which the bonus 
earned was calculated; and (3) serious misconduct by the relevant 
participant. The Remuneration Committee will have discretion to 
apply clawback at any time up until the Annual General Meeting 
held in the second year following the payment of the bonus –  
for example, clawback may be applied in respect of any bonus 
earned in respect of performance in 2014 at any time up until the 
Annual General Meeting in 2017. The malus provisions applied to 
the 2012 Incentive Plan are referred to on page 82; clawback of 
some form will apply to the new long-term incentive arrangements 
which will replace, in 2017 , the existing LTIP approved by special 
resolution of the shareholders in 2012. 
No other changes have been made to the structure of our 
executive Director remuneration for the coming year. 
Shareholder engagement
We remain committed to maintaining an open and transparent 
engagement with our investors. We believe that a key objective  
of the Directors’ remuneration report is to communicate clearly 
how much our executive Directors are earning and how this is 
clearly linked to performance. Members of the Remuneration 
Committee are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with investors  
in order to understand more fully their views on Melrose’s 
approach to executive remuneration.

Governance as set out in the Company’s articles of association, takes account 
of every change to the capital structure and dividend payment. In 
this way, the participants will only receive a share of returns over 
and above that adjusted level. In the table above, we have shown 
an illustrative calculation of the increase in the value relevant for 
the purposes of the 2012 Incentive Plan, calculated in accordance 
with the principles in the Company’s articles of association, but 
assuming a trigger date of 1 January 2015.
The 2012 Incentive Plan
In the interests of transparency and to illustrate how the 2012 
Incentive Plan may operate, we have set out above an illustration  
of how the growth in value of the Company over the period from  
the start of that plan in March 2012 might translate into value earned  
by participants in that plan. It is important to note that the following 
illustration is theoretical only and the value derived under the 2012 
Incentive Plan will be entirely determined by reference to the value 
that will be delivered to shareholders over the period to crystallisation.
Importantly, and as referred to in the Remuneration Policy on

Annual Report on Remuneration
Introduction
Melrose’s remuneration philosophy is that executive 
remuneration should be simple and transparent, support  
the delivery of the business strategy and pay for performance, 
which is reflected in our remuneration structure:
• fixed elements of remuneration (salary and pension) are 
positioned at the lower end of a market competitive range; 
• annual incentive remuneration (annual bonus) is positioned 
below the median maximum opportunity for FTSE 250 
companies; and
• long-term incentive remuneration (the 2012 Incentive Plan)  
is intended to directly align executive Directors’ remuneration 
with that of shareholders by connecting remuneration 
specifically to shareholder value. 
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that this  
simple and transparent incentive framework is aligned with  
the Company’s strategy for growth and that our remuneration 
arrangements are tailored to the culture and strategy of  
the Company. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out the amounts 
earned by Directors in 2014 as a result of the application of our 
remuneration philosophy and in accordance with the Directors’ 
remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 
AGM, and how that philosophy will be applied in 2015.

The chart below represents how the illustrative calculation of  
the increase in the value relevant for the purposes of the 2012 
Incentive Plan as referred to above is shared between  
participants in the 2012 Incentive Plan and shareholders. 
Based on this illustration, if the entitlements under the 2012 
Incentive Plan were to have been settled in Ordinary Shares of 
13/110 pence each (being the nominal value of Ordinary Shares  
on 1 January 2015), this would have resulted in the issue to the 
participants of 17 ,280,639 Ordinary Shares (i.e. £44,740,439/ 
£2.58905). While it is the Remuneration Committee’s intention  
that entitlements under the 2012 Incentive Plan shall be settled in 
Ordinary Shares, the entitlements can be settled in alternative ways 
as set out in the Company’s articles of association and as referred 
to in the Remuneration Policy on page 90. In any event, the number 
of Ordinary Shares issued to satisfy entitlements under the 2012 
Incentive Plan shall not exceed 5% of the aggregate number of 
shares in issue on 22 March 2012 plus 5% of any additional shares 
issued by the Company after that date, as described in more detail 
in the Remuneration Policy on page 90. 
Malus has applied to awards granted under the 2012 Incentive Plan 
since its inception. The rules of the plan provide for compulsory 
return at nominal value of incentive shares held by bad leavers 
(defined as any person who ceases to be a Director or employee 
other than by reason of death, permanent ill health or disability or  
as a result of a change of control) at the Remuneration Committee’s 
discretion. In addition, the Company’s articles of association 
provide the Remuneration Committee with the discretion to adjust 
the calculation of the amount to which holders of incentive shares 
and options shall be entitled, in certain circumstances.

in respect of the year to 31 December 2013. 
(2)  Of the £240,598 attributable to pension contributions, £159,298 was paid as a supplement to base salary in lieu of pension arrangements. The balance of £81,300 was paid into the individual

(4) Includes £5,000 per annum in recognition of Chairmanship of the Audit Committee.
(5) Liz Hewitt was appointed as a non-executive Director of the Company on 8 October 2013.
Base salary
Salaries are fixed at a level which is at or below the lower end of a market competitive range compared to companies of similar size and 
complexity, to reflect participation in the 2012 Incentive Plan. Each executive Director received an inflationary increase in base salary  
of approximately 3% effective from January 2014. 
Benefits
The range of benefits provided to Directors has not changed since the inception of Melrose and there is no intention to widen the range 
of benefits Directors may receive. All of the executive Directors received taxable benefits during 2014, being a company car allowance, 
private fuel allowance and private medical insurance. Geoffrey Martin also received paid train travel to and from London and 
accommodation whilst working in London. 
Bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity is set below the maximum median annual bonus opportunity for FTSE 250 companies to reflect  
the participation of the executive Directors in the 2012 Incentive Plan. For the year ended 31 December 2014, Simon Peckham’s and 
Geoffrey Martin’s (being the only executive Directors participating in the annual bonus plan) maximum bonus opportunity was equal  
to 100% of base salary and bonuses earned were equal to 58% of base salary.

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests 
(audited information)
As disclosed at the time of the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive 
Share Plan, the executive Directors considered it appropriate  
that they, together with their immediate families, would hold at 
least half of the shares acquired pursuant to that crystallisation 
(after making adequate provision for any tax liability arising in 
connection with that crystallisation) for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has adopted the 
following guidelines in relation to the holding of Ordinary Shares 
by executive Directors who participated in the 2009 Incentive 
Share Plan and who participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan, 
reinforcing the executive Directors’ long-term stewardship of the 
Company and long-term investment in the Company’s shares.  
No executive Director may dispose of any such Ordinary Shares 
without the consent of the Remuneration Committee, which will 
not normally be withheld provided the executive Director holds at 
least the “minimum number of Ordinary Shares” referred to below.

(2) For these purposes, the value of a share is 266.8 pence, being the closing mid-market price 
on 31 December 2014.
As at 31 December 2014, each executive Director held 
significantly more than the minimum number of Ordinary Shares 
and so satisfied the guideline.

Performance graph
The total shareholder return graph below shows the value as at 31 December 2014 of £100 invested in the Company on 31 December 
2008, compared with £100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index, the FTSE 250 Index or the FTSE All Share Index. The Remuneration 
Committee considers the FTSE 100 Index, the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE All Share Index to be appropriate indices for the purposes of 
this comparison because of the comparable size of the companies which comprise the FTSE 100 Index and the FTSE 250 index and the 
broad nature of companies which comprise the FTSE All Share Index. The source data for the graph below assumes that all cash returns 
to shareholders made by the Company during this period are reinvested in Ordinary Shares.
Internal Company rules on shareholdings are extended to senior management in addition to the executive Directors in order that 
appropriate remuneration principles are applied to senior management on a similar basis to executive Directors.

(1)  The Directors’ holdings in Ordinary Shares were adjusted in the share consolidation in February 2015 in the same manner as other shareholders. Accordingly, following the consolidation: Christopher

of section 252 of the Companies Act 2006), David Roper held 7,530,783 Ordinary Shares, Simon Peckham held 7,775,196 Ordinary Shares, Geoffrey Martin held 3,739,054 Ordinary Shares, Perry

(3)  Each of these options is over 2012 Incentive Shares. Although the option can be exercised at any time, the value which may be derived from the shares acquired on exercise will be determined  
at the relevant “trigger date” as discussed on page 90. 2012 Incentive Shares acquired on or before the trigger date may be forfeited in accordance with the Company’s articles of association. 
The option exercise price is £1 per share, which is equal to the nominal value of those shares. 
(4)  Miles Templeman retired from the Board at the close of the Company’s AGM on 13 May 2014. At that date he held 585,828 Ordinary Shares and had no interests in shares under any share schemes.

Chief Executive Officer Remuneration for previous six years
In accordance with the regulations governing the reporting of Directors’ remuneration which came into effect in October 2013, the 
total figure of remuneration set out in the table below includes the value of long-term incentive vesting in respect of the financial year. 
This means that the full value of the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan on 11 April 2012 is shown for the year ending  
31 December 2012 and no value will be reflected in the total figure of remuneration for the 2012 Incentive Plan until the trigger date 
(which will be May 2017 or an earlier trigger date determined in accordance with the arrangements).
The value of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan was earned over a period of approximately five years. Therefore, in the view of the 
Remuneration Committee, inclusion of this value in respect of the year ended 31 December 2012 does not give a fair representation 
of the Chief Executive Officer’s yearly remuneration over each of the previous five years. Therefore, an additional column has been 
added to the table below to show total remuneration excluding the value received on the maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive 
Share Plan. No other long-term incentive plan vested in favour of any executive Director in any of the other years. 
The amount of that value shown in respect of David Roper and Simon Peckham for 2012 reflects the proportion of 2012 for which 
each was the Chief Executive Officer.

(1)  In the year ending 31 December 2012, David Roper was Chief Executive Officer for the period from 1 January 2012 until 9 May 2012 and Simon Peckham was Chief Executive Officer for the 
period from 9 May 2012, onwards. In the table above:
    (i)  the “Total remuneration” figure shows, in respect of David Roper, his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period 1 January 2012 to 9 May 2012 and in respect of Simon Peckham 
his total remuneration in respect of his service in the period from 9 May 2012 to 31 December 2012. Included in this figure for each of David Roper and Simon Peckham is the value of the 
long-term incentives vesting in the year pro-rated to reflect the portion of the year for which he was Chief Executive Officer; and
    (ii)  the “Total remuneration excluding the long-term incentive value” shows in respect of each of David Roper and Simon Peckham total remuneration in respect of the period for which he was 
Chief Executive Officer excluding any value received on the maturity in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Share Plan. 
(2)  On the crystallisation in April 2012 of the 2009 Incentive Shares awarded in 2009, participants in the 2009 Incentive Share Plan as a whole were entitled to 10% of the increase in shareholder 
value from 18 July 2007 to 23 March 2012. Because the value derived on the crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Shares depended upon the shareholder value created over the relevant period,  
it is not possible to express the value derived as a percentage of the maximum opportunity. The crystallisation of the 2009 Incentive Shares was satisfied by the conversion of those shares into 
Ordinary Shares. 
(3)  The value derived in 2012 from the 2009 Incentive Shares represents the Chief Executive’s share, determined in accordance with the terms of those shares, of the shareholder value created over 
a period of circa five years. 
Percentage change in Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration
The table below sets out, in relation to salary, taxable benefits and 
annual bonus, the percentage increase in pay for the Company’s 
Chief Executive Officer compared to the average increase for a 
group consisting of the Company’s senior head office employees, 
Managing Directors and Finance Directors of Group businesses 
and direct senior reports of those Managing Directors and 
Finance Directors. The percentages shown below relate to the 
financial year ended 2014 as a percentage comparison to the 
financial year ended 2013. This group of senior management was 
considered an appropriate comparator group because of their 
level of seniority and the structure of their remuneration package; 
the spread of the Company’s operations across various countries 
and industries means that remuneration policies vary to take 
account of geography and industry such that the Remuneration 
Committee considers that selecting a wider group of employees 
would not provide a meaningful comparison.

Implementation of Directors’ Remuneration Policy for the 
financial year commencing on 1 January 2015
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that its 
remuneration framework is aligned with the Company’s strategy for 
growth and no structural changes to the Directors’ remuneration 
arrangements are proposed for 2015. 
Executive Directors’ salaries have increased by 3% with effect 
from January 2015, the same as for other head office employees 
(other than where other such employees’ salaries have been 
increased on a different basis to reflect individual circumstances 
such as promotions), as shown in the following table. 
Executive Director

increase
Christopher Miller 435 448 3%
David Roper 435 448 3%
Simon Peckham 435 448 3%
Geoffrey Martin 348 358 3%
The overall framework for the executive Directors’ annual bonus 
arrangements for 2015 will remain the same as in 2014, with a 
maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of salary based on financial 
performance metrics as regards 80% of the opportunity and 
strategic performance metrics as regards the balance. The 
Remuneration Committee considers that the strategic performance 
measures are commercially sensitive but will disclose the nature of 
those measures on a retrospective basis on a similar basis to the 
disclosure on page 84 in respect of the annual bonus for the year 
ending 31 December 2014. As noted on page 80, annual bonus 
awards for 2015 (as well as payments in respect of the 2014 annual 
bonus) will be subject to a clawback arrangement giving the 
Remuneration Committee the ability to require repayment of some or 
all of any bonus earned in the event of: (1) material misstatement of 
financial results; (2) miscalculation of any performance measure on 
which the bonus earned was calculated; and (3) serious misconduct 
by the relevant participant. The Remuneration Committee will have 
discretion to apply clawback to any bonus earned for 2015 at any 
time up until the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
Non-executive Directors’ basic fees have been increased by 3% 
with effect from January 2015. The non-executive Director fee

The members of the Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year 
were Perry Crosthwaite (Committee Chairman from 1 January 2014 
until the close of the 2014 AGM on 13 May 2014), Justin Dowley 
(Committee Chairman with effect from 13 May 2014), John Grant 
and Liz Hewitt. Miles Templeman was a member of the 
Remuneration Committee from 1 January 2014 until his retirement 
from the Board following the conclusion of the 2014 AGM on 13 
May 2014. The Company regards all members of the Remuneration 
Committee as independent non-executive Directors; the 
composition of the Remuneration Committee is therefore in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. During  
the year, the Remuneration Committee met three times. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice  
on the remuneration reporting regulations and preparation of the 
Directors’ remuneration report from Deloitte LLP . Deloitte LLP  
was appointed by the Company Secretary on behalf of the 
Remuneration Committee. Deloitte LLP’s fees for this advice  
were £12,500, which were charged on a time/cost basis. Deloitte 
LLP is external auditor to the Company and provides certain  
other services (as described on page 74 of the Annual Report  
and financial statements). 
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by 
Deloitte LLP in relation to the remuneration reporting regulations and 
the Directors’ remuneration report is objective and independent.

The Remuneration Committee noted the strong support given by shareholders to the Directors’ remuneration report. Taking into 
account the level of votes cast against the Directors’ remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee will consider the comments 
given by shareholders in relation to the Company’s long-term incentive structure prior to the introduction of a new scheme in 2017. 
Members of the Remuneration Committee are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with investors in order to understand more fully their 
views on Melrose’s approach to executive remuneration.
Directors’ remuneration policy
This part of the report sets out the Company’s Directors’ remuneration policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual 
General Meeting and took binding effect from the conclusion of that meeting, save that: (1) the illustrations of the application of the 
remuneration policy included in the Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2013 have not been repeated in this 
year’s report because, in accordance with the reporting regulations, they illustrated the application of the remuneration policy in the first 
year to which the remuneration policy applied (2014) and we have included an alternative illustration of the potential LTIP value on pages

Normally reviewed annually and

range of factors including:
• role, experience and performance; 
• prevailing market conditions; 
• external benchmarks for similar roles 
at comparable companies; and
• salary increases awarded for other 
employees in the Group.
To avoid setting expectations of 
executive Directors and other 
employees, no maximum has been 
set under the remuneration policy. 
Increases may be made to salary 
levels in certain circumstances as 
required, for example to reflect:
• increase in scope of role or 
responsibility; and
• performance in role.
Salary increases will take into 
account the average increase 
awarded to other employees  
in the worldwide Group.

against those targets. The 
Remuneration Committee has 
discretion to vary the bonus 
pay-out (upwards or downwards) 
should any formulaic output not 
produce a fair result for either the 
individual executive Director or the 
Company, taking account of 
overall business performance.
The treatment of a “leaver’s”  
bonus participation is described 
on page 94. 
For executive Directors 
participating in the Company’s 
2012 Incentive Plan, the maximum 
annual bonus opportunity is 100% 
of base salary. 
The Remuneration Committee  
will have regard to various 
performance metrics (which will be 
determined by the Remuneration 
Committee) measured over the 
relevant financial year, when 
determining bonuses. 
At least 50% of the award will be 
based on financial measures, and 
the balance of the award will be 
determined at the discretion of  
the Remuneration Committee.
Financial metrics
The element of the bonus subject 
to a financial metric will be 
determined between 0% and 
100% for performance between 
“threshold” performance (the 
minimum level of performance that 
results in any level of pay-out) and 
“maximum” performance. 
Discretionary element
The discretionary element of  
an award will be determined to  
the extent assessed by the 
Remuneration Committee between 
0% and 100% based on the 
Remuneration Committee’s 
assessment of a range of financial 
and non-financial metrics.

2012 Incentive 
Plan
Incentivises 
executive 
Directors over 
the longer term 
and aligns their 
interests with 
those of 
shareholders by 
linking the level 
of reward to the 
value delivered 
to shareholders.
This plan was 
approved by a 
special resolution 
of shareholders 
on 11 April 2012 
and has been 
unchanged 
since. 
Options are granted over a 
separate class of shares known as 
the “2012 Incentive Shares”. The 
options have an exercise price per 
share equal to the nominal value  
of a 2012 Incentive Share. The 
rights attaching to the 2012 
Incentive Shares are set out in the 
Company’s articles of association. 
Options may be exercised at any 
time up to 31 May 2017 (the 
“trigger date”) and will be 
automatically exercised prior to  
the trigger date if not already 
exercised. In the event of a change 
of control or winding up of the 
Company, the trigger date may  
be a date before 31 May 2017. 
On the trigger date, the holders of 
the 2012 Incentive Shares shall be 
entitled to 7.5% of the increase in 
value of the Company from and 
including 22 March 2012 to the 
trigger date. This value may be 
delivered in the form of a dividend 
and/or the conversion of the  
2012 Incentive Shares into an 
appropriate number of Ordinary 
Shares or in certain other ways 
permitted under the Company’s 
articles of association.
The calculation of the growth in 
value of the Company shall be 
determined in accordance with  
the formula set out in the 
Company’s articles of association.
The treatment of an executive 
Director’s participation in the 2012 
Incentive Plan if he becomes a 
“leaver” is described on page 94. 
The value that may be delivered 
under the 2012 Incentive Plan is 
linked to the shareholder value 
created over the period from  
and including 22 March 2012 to 
crystallisation; accordingly, it is  
not possible to express the 
maximum opportunity as a  
multiple of salary. Options may  
be granted over, in aggregate, 
50,000 2012 Incentive Shares. 
The options held by the executive 
Directors over 2012 Incentive 
Shares as at 31 December 2014 
are set out on page 85.
The maximum aggregate value 
that may be realised under the 
2012 Incentive Shares shall be 
7.5% of the increase in shareholder 
value from and including 22 March 
2012 to and including the trigger 
date (as determined in accordance 
with the Company’s articles  
of association). 
The maximum number of new 
Ordinary Shares in the Company 
that may be issued is 5% of the 
aggregate number of Ordinary 
Shares in Melrose PLC in issue  
on 22 March 2012 plus 5% of any 
additional Ordinary Shares issued 
or created by Melrose PLC after 
that date and prior to 27 November 
2012 or by the Company after 27 
November 2012. 
The value that may be delivered 
under the 2012 Incentive Plan will 
be determined by reference to the 
growth in value of the Company, 
from and including 22 March 2012 
to and including the trigger date 
calculated in accordance with the

Explanation of performance metrics chosen
Performance measures are chosen which are aligned to the Company’s strategy. 
Annual Bonus
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus, to reflect the key financial and strategic objectives of the 
Company, and reward for delivery against these targets. When setting the targets, the Remuneration Committee will take into account  
a number of different reference points including its plans and strategy and the market environment.
2012 Incentive Plan
Value delivered under the 2012 Incentive Plan is determined by reference to the growth in the value of the Company, such that the 
performance metric is the level of such growth that is delivered to shareholders. This arrangement was considered appropriate by  
the Remuneration Committee which considers that the previous, and similar, Incentive Shares arrangements introduced in 2009,  
and which crystallised in 2012, have been very effective in incentivising management to deliver real value to shareholders over the 
applicable performance period.
The Company’s articles of association provide that the Remuneration Committee may make adjustments to the calculation of the 
amount to which the holders of the 2012 Incentive Shares shall be entitled in certain circumstances. These circumstances include,  
but are not limited to, the Company’s articles of association or a change in the capital structure of the Company otherwise producing  
an anomalous result. Any such adjustment shall be such as the Remuneration Committee considers fair and reasonable and as an 
investment bank shall have confirmed is fair and reasonable so far as the ordinary shareholders are concerned. 
Differences between the Company’s policy on Directors’ remuneration and its policy on remuneration for other employees
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Group are determined based on the same principle that reward should be sufficient as  
is necessary to attract and retain high calibre talent, without paying more than is necessary and should be achieved for delivery of the 
Company’s strategy.
The Company has operations in various countries and across various industries, with Group employees of differing levels of seniority. 
Accordingly, though based on the overarching principle above, reward policies vary to take account of these factors. 
On the introduction of the 2012 Incentive Plan, the Remuneration Committee considered it appropriate to recognise the required growth 
of the senior management team beyond the executive Directors necessary to further develop the business, and participation includes 
certain non-director employees.
The Company has also implemented divisional long-term incentive plans for senior managers of certain businesses within the Group  
to incentivise them to create value for the Company and its shareholders.

Recruitment remuneration policy
When agreeing a remuneration package for the appointment of a new executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will apply the 
following principles:
• the package will be sufficient to attract the calibre of Director required to deliver the Company’s strategy; 
• the Remuneration Committee will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary; and
• in the next Annual Report on Remuneration after an appointment, the Remuneration Committee will explain to shareholders the rationale 
for the arrangements implemented. 
In addition to the policy elements set out in the table on pages 88 to 91, the Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make 
appropriate remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to meet the individual circumstances of the recruitment, including 
discretion to include any other remuneration component or award. The Remuneration Committee does not intend to use this discretion 
to make a non-performance related incentive payment (for example a “golden hello”). In this regard, elements that the Remuneration 
Committee may consider for the purposes of a remuneration package for the recruitment of a new executive Director include, but are 
not limited to, the following. 
Element Approach
Incentive remuneration 
opportunity
The Remuneration Committee’s intention is that a new executive Director’s incentive remuneration opportunity will 
consist of:
• an annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of salary (i.e. as applies for existing executive Directors); and
• an award of options over 2012 Incentive Shares, with the number of such shares awarded being equal to 
the number of such shares over which an existing executive Director was granted an option in April 2012,  
as reduced to take into account the proportion of the 2012 Incentive Plan’s life that has elapsed at the time 
of the new executive Director’s appointment. 
The Remuneration Committee’s intention is that a new executive Director would only participate in the 2012 Incentive 
Plan on this basis if he/she had a similar level of experience and responsibility as the existing executive Directors. 
If a new executive Director did not participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan, the Remuneration Committee may award  
a maximum annual bonus opportunity of up to 300% of salary until such time as a new long-term incentive 
arrangement is put in place for the executive Directors in which that new executive Director could participate. 
Compensation for forfeited 
remuneration arrangements
Whilst considered unlikely the Remuneration Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buy out 
remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will 
have regard to relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to such arrangements, the form of 
those awards (e.g. cash or shares) and the timeframe of such awards. While such awards are excluded from the 
maximum level of variable remuneration referred to below, the Remuneration Committee’s intention is that the value 
awarded (as determined by the Remuneration Committee on a fair and reasonable basis) would be no higher than  
the expected value of the forfeited arrangements. Where considered appropriate, buy-out awards will be subject to 
forfeiture or clawback on early departure. 
Notice period The notice period will be the same as the Company’s ordinary policy of 12 months. 
Relocation costs Where necessary, the Company will pay appropriate relocation costs. The Remuneration Committee will seek  
to ensure that no more is paid than is necessary. 
Retirement benefits The maximum contribution of 15% of salary referred to in the policy table on page 90 will apply to any new executive 
Director. However, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to pay the contribution into any pension 
arrangement or to pay the amount as a supplement to base salary in lieu of a pension arrangement.
92
 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Governance Under the new reporting regulations, the Company is required to set out the maximum level of variable remuneration that may be 
granted when agreeing the components of a remuneration package for the appointment of Directors, excluding any remuneration 
constituting compensation for the forfeiture of any variable remuneration award with a previous employer. In order to provide sufficient 
flexibility in recruitment scenarios, and to reflect the fact that the value of participation in the 2012 Incentive Plan depends on 
shareholder value created and so cannot be expressed as a multiple of salary, the Remuneration Committee has set this level as 
maximum variable remuneration of:
• If the Director participates in the 2012 Incentive Plan:
•  one times salary; plus
• an award of options over a number of 2012 Incentive Shares equal to the number of such shares over which an existing executive 
Director was granted an option in April 2012, as reduced to take into account the proportion of the 2012 Incentive Plan’s life that  
has elapsed at the time of the new executive Director’s appointment; and
• If the Director does not participate in the 2012 Incentive Plan, three times salary.
While long-term incentive awards and “buy out” awards may be granted under the 2012 Incentive Plan, if necessary and subject,  
where relevant, to the limits referred to above, awards may be granted outside this plan as permitted under the Listing Rules which 
allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a Director. 
Where a position is filled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to 
continue according to their subsisting terms. 
The remuneration package for a newly appointed non-executive Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the policy 
table for non-executive Directors. 
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s policy is for executive Directors to be employed on the terms of service agreements which may be terminated by either 
the Director or the Company on the giving of not less than 12 months’ written notice (subject to certain exceptions). 
Each of the executive Directors had entered into a service agreement with Melrose PLC which was novated on exactly the same terms 
to the Company with effect from 27 November 2012 when the Company became the new parent company of the Group. Details of the

The principles on which the determination of payments for loss of office will be approached are summarised below:
Provision Treatment upon loss of office
Payment in lieu of notice If the Company terminates an executive Director’s employment with immediate effect, a payment in lieu of notice may 
be made. This may include base salary, pension contributions and benefits.
Annual Bonus This will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an individual basis and the decision whether or not 
to award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors including the circumstances of the 
executive Director’s departure and their contribution to the business during the bonus period in question. Typically, 
bonus amounts will be pro-rated for time in service to termination.
2012 Incentive Plan If an executive Director holding 2012 Incentive Shares ceases employment in circumstances in which he is a “good 
leaver”, the Remuneration Committee may (other than if he is a good leaver as a result of his resignation in connection 
with a change of control of the Company) require that he transfer some or all of the “unvested proportion” of his  
2012 Incentive Shares for their nominal value. An executive Director who is a good leaver will be entitled to retain  
any 2012 Incentive Shares which he is not required to transfer. For these purposes the “unvested proportion” shall  
be the proportion of his 2012 Incentive Shares equal to the unexpired proportion of the period from 11 April 2012  
to 31 May 2017 calculated on a full month basis. 
If an executive Director holding an option over 2012 Incentive Shares ceases employment in circumstances in which 
he is a “good leaver”, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee some or all of his unexercised options shall 
lapse. The number of options which shall lapse shall not exceed the number equal to the “unvested portion” of the 
executive Director’s 2012 Incentive Shares had the executive Director’s options been exercised immediately before 
the executive Director became a good leaver. The executive Director will be entitled to retain any options which do 
not lapse. 
For these purposes, an executive Director shall be a “good leaver” if he leaves because of death, permanent ill health, 
permanent disability, resignation in connection with a change of control or termination by the Company without cause. 
Other payments The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in 
good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way 
of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Director’s office or employment. 
In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of legal fees.
The overall amount of any payment made in respect of a loss of office will not exceed the aggregate of any payment 
in lieu of notice and any payment made in respect of annual bonus, as referred to above. Entitlements under the 2012 
Incentive Plan will be dealt with in accordance with the terms of that plan and were the Company to make an award 
on recruitment of an executive Director to buy out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous 
employer then the leaver provisions for that award would be determined at the time of grant. 
On a change of control or winding-up of the Company the 2012 Incentive Shares will crystallise early. In the event of a change of 
control, the date of the change of control shall be the “trigger date” for the purposes of determining the number of Ordinary Shares  
into which the 2012 Incentive Shares shall convert or the dividend amount to be paid. In the event of a winding up, the 2012 Incentive 
Shares shall be treated as if they had converted into Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the winding-up and the holders of the 2012 
Incentive Shares shall be entitled to a sum equal to the amount to which they would have been entitled on a return of capital on a 
winding-up if they had held those Ordinary Shares. 
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
Salary, benefits and performance related reward provided to employees is taken into account when setting policy for executive 
Directors’ remuneration. There is no consultation with employees on Director remuneration. 
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Company is committed to ongoing engagement and seeks the views of major shareholders in advance of amending its 
remuneration policies. The policies are set to reflect the Company’s commercial strategy and the 2012 Incentive Plan was approved  
by a special resolution of shareholders in 2012.

Governance Payments outside the policy in this report
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make any 
remuneration payments and payments for loss of office outside 
the policy in this report:
• where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy 
came into effect;
• where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when the 
relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the 
opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment was not  
in consideration of the individual becoming a Director of the 
Company; or
• to satisfy contractual commitments under legacy remuneration 
arrangements.
For these purposes, “payments” includes the satisfaction of 
awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over 
shares, the terms of the payment are “agreed” at the time the 
award is granted.

Governance Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors  
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company  
law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of  
the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss  
of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the  
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets  
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for  
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair  
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or  
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
•  the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development  
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal  
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a  
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide  
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Financials Opinion on financial statements of Melrose Industries PLC
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated and the Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity, the related notes 1 to 30 to the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 1 to 9 to the Company financial statements. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement on page 49 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is 
appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below, which are the same risks identified in the prior year, are those that had the 
greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Provisions
Legal, environmental, restructuring, property and warranty 
provisions as at 31 December 2014 totalled £177.0 million. The 
recognition and valuation of the expected outcome of these 
provisions requires the exercise of management judgement  
and the use of estimates giving rise to inherent subjectivity  
in the amounts recorded in the financial statements.
Note 3 includes this as one of the significant accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty  
and note 20 includes further details on the provisions.
We challenged the assumptions underlying the recognition and valuation of 
provisions through checking and verifying the inputs used to calculate the 
provisions, including review of the nature and timings of formal restructuring 
plans, review of third party correspondence, discussion with the Group’s 
lawyers, applicability of relevant laws and regulations and review of agreements. 
Further we assessed the level of historical warranty claims and obtained the 
specific warranty terms and conditions provided in order to ascertain whether 
the warranty provisions held were sufficient to cover all obligations in existence at 
the year-end in light of known claims and standard warranty periods provided.
Exceptional items
The presentation and consistency of costs and income within 
exceptional items is a key determinant in the assessment of the 
quality of the Group’s underlying earnings. The exceptional 
operating costs and exceptional operating income for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 are £34.3 million and £5.4 million 
respectively and are therefore significant to the statutory net  
profit for the year.
Note 2 includes the Group’s accounting policy for exceptional 
items and note 6 include further details on the exceptional items.
A sample of exceptional items (including all material items) has been agreed  
to source documentation and evaluated by the component and Group audit 
teams as to their nature in order to assess whether they are in line with the 
Group’s accounting policy and also to assess consistency of management’s 
application of the policy with previous accounting periods. In particular we 
evaluated the reversal of any items originally booked as exceptional and 
confirmed that the reversal of any fair value items recorded on acquisition  
is appropriately classified as exceptional items.
We also assessed whether the disclosures within the financial statements 
provide sufficient detail for the reader to understand the nature of these items.
Independent auditor’s report to the 
members of Melrose Industries PLC

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Financials Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Goodwill and intangibles
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets as at  
31 December 2014 is £2,405.3 million. The assumptions include 
future projected cash flows, the perpetual growth rate and the 
appropriate discount rate.
This is included in note 3 as one of the significant accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty and  
note 12 includes more details on goodwill and intangibles.
We assessed the assumptions used in the impairment model for goodwill  
and intangible assets, specifically including the cash flow projections,  
discount rates, perpetuity growth rates and the sensitivities applied.
Our procedures included reviewing forecast cash flows with reference to 
historical trading performance, consulting with our valuation specialists and 
benchmarking assumptions such as the perpetual growth rate and discount 
rate to external macro-economic and market data. Having ascertained the 
extent of change in those assumptions that either individually or collectively 
would be required for the assets to be impaired by performing sensitivity 
analysis on the key assumptions, we considered the likelihood of such a 
movement in those assumptions arising.
Recognition of deferred tax assets and  
accounting for uncertain tax positions
Recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management’s 
judgements of the availability of future taxable profits.
In addition, the value of the tax provisions recorded in respect  
of a number of uncertain tax positions requires judgements in  
respect of the likely outcome of negotiations with and enquiries 
from various tax authorities. 
Accordingly tax provisioning is included in note 3 as one of  
the significant accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty and note 21 includes details of the  
deferred tax assets recognised.
We tested the appropriateness of the assumptions and estimates in relation to 
the likelihood of generating future taxable profits to support the recognition of 
deferred tax assets. We considered those assumptions, including the expected 
timing of business disposals, and supporting forecasts and estimates as well 
as the appropriateness of the tax disclosures.
We worked with our tax audit specialists in relation to the recognition of 
deferred tax assets and to appraise the likely outcome of technical tax 
treatments, including the review of correspondence with the revenue 
authorities to assess the reasonableness of the provisions made. 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on 
page 73.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not  
to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any  
of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions  
of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £11 million (2013: £13 million), which is 5.2% (2013: 5.7%) of headline profit before tax and 
below 1% of equity. We use headline profit before tax to provide a stable basis for materiality that reflects the focus of the users of the 
financial statements. This excludes the effect of separately disclosed exceptional items, as these can be volatile, and the amortisation  
of acquired intangibles, as excluding the relatively high amortisation charge, given the acquisitive nature of the Group, provides a more 
comparable measure with similar organisations and is consistent with the profit measure most relevant to analysts and investors.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £250,000 (2013: £250,000), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Financials An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
The Group’s 66 (2013: 72) locations are organised into the 4 (2013: 5) continuing divisions described in the Business Review on pages  
28 to 35 of this Annual Report. Our Group audit scope focused primarily on audit work at 29 (2013: 25) locations. The difference to last 
year is due to changes in composition of the Group.
23 of these were subject to a full audit (2013: 18), whilst the remaining 6 (2013: 7) were subject to full scope audit procedures where the 
extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and on the materiality of the Group’s business 
operations at those locations. The 23 locations subject to full audit represent business units within each of the Group’s continuing 
reportable segments and accounted for 64% (2013: 63%) of the continuing Group’s revenue, 69% (2013: 70%) of the total operating 
segments’ continuing headline operating profit (i.e. before central costs). The 6 locations subject to full audit procedures account for 23% 
(2013: 24%) of the continuing Group’s revenue and 23% (2013: 21%) of the continuing Group’s headline operating profit (i.e. before central 
costs). Full audit or full audit procedures undertaken at the 29 locations or performed centrally by the Group audit team accounted for 94% 
(2013: 94%) of the Group’s net assets. The locations subject to full audit or specified audit procedures were selected to provide an 
appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. 
Our audit work and audit procedures at the 29 locations were performed at lower levels of materiality determined by reference to the 
relative scale of the business division concerned and no higher than £5.2 million. 
The senior statutory auditor or other senior members of the Group audit team visited 12 of the largest locations for the audit (2013: 12). The 
Group audit team met with the management teams including Managing Directors and Finance Directors of all the continuing businesses 
during the year end audit. The senior statutory auditor also held audit close meetings with all of the 4 continuing businesses, which cover 
all locations. In years when we do not visit a component within our Group audit scope; we will include the component audit team in our 
team briefing, discuss their risk assessment, and review documentation of the findings from their work.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject  
to audit or audit of specified account balances.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been 
made or the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have 
nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Financials Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual 
Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit 
and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed.  
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 
(UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. 
Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

of the registered office is given on the back cover. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and 
in the Business review sections on pages 28 to 35.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014 were authorised in accordance with a resolution 
of the Directors of Melrose Industries PLC on 4 March 2015.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Company is based. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
The comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2013 in these financial statements has been restated to include the results 
and cash flows of Bridon within discontinued operations and exclude them from continuing operations. Bridon was previously disclosed 
within the Lifting segment.

Financials 2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”).  
The consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and 
therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments which are recognised at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for assets. The principal accounting policies adopted are consistent with the prior year and are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of the parent undertaking and all of its subsidiary undertakings. The results of 
businesses acquired during the period are included from the effective date of acquisition and for those sold during the period to the 
effective date of disposal. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from 
intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. The interest of non-controlling 
shareholders is initially measured at the non-controlling interests’ proportion of the share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition 
plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling 
interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis  
of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained on page 49 of the Finance Director’s review.
Business combinations and goodwill
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is measured at the fair value of assets 
transferred, the liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange of control and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange 
for control of the acquiree. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Costs directly attributable to business combinations are recognised as an 
expense in the Income Statement as incurred. 
The acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition except those where specific 
guidance is provided by IFRSs. Non-current assets and directly attributable liabilities that are classified as held for sale in accordance with 
IFRS 5: “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations”, are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell. Also, 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12: “Income taxes”, liabilities and assets related to 
employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits” and liabilities or 
equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payments awards are measured in accordance 
with IFRS 2: “Share-based payment”. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts where appropriate. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or 
additional assets or liabilities recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum period of one year.
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the acquirer’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured  
at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in 
the acquiree, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Notes to the 
financial statements continued
108
 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Financials As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units acquired. Impairment is determined  
by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement and is not subsequently 
reversed. When there is a disposal of a cash-generating unit, goodwill relating to the operation disposed of is taken into account in 
determining the gain or loss on disposal of that operation. The amount of goodwill allocated to a partial disposal is measured on the  
basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the operation retained.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity which is not a subsidiary undertaking but the interest of the Group is that of a partner in a business over which the 
Group exercises joint control. The results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, customs duties and sales related taxes. Revenue is reduced for 
estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. The nature of agreements into which the Group enters means that:
• the contracts usually contain discrete elements, each of which transfers risks and rewards to the customer. Where such discrete 
elements are present, revenue is recognised on each element in accordance with the policy on the sale of goods. 
• the service element of the contract is usually insignificant in relation to the total contract value and is often provided on a short-term or 
one-off basis. Where this is the case, revenue is recognised when the service is complete.
• aftermarket activities generally relate to the provision of spare parts, repairs and the rebuild of equipment. Revenue on the provision of 
parts is recognised in accordance with the policy on the sale of goods and revenue for repairs and rebuild is recognised upon 
completion of the activity.
The significant majority of the Group’s revenue is recognised on a sale of goods basis. 
The specific methods used to recognise the different forms of revenue earned by the Group are as follows: 
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
• the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;
• the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over 
the goods;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Transfers of risks and rewards vary depending on the nature of the products sold and the individual terms of the contract of sale. Sales 
made under internationally accepted trade terms are recognised as revenue when the Group has completed the primary duties required  
to transfer risks as stipulated in those terms. Sales made outside such terms are generally recognised on delivery to the customer.  
No revenue is recognised where recovery of the consideration is not probable or there are significant uncertainties regarding associated 
costs or the possible return of goods.
Provision of services
As noted above, because revenue from the rendering of services is usually not significant in relation to the total contract value and is 
generally provided on a short-term or one-off basis, revenue is usually recognised when the service is complete. 
Construction contracts
As noted above, customer contracts usually contain discrete elements separately transferring risks and rewards to the customer.  
Where such discrete elements are present, revenue is recognised on each element in accordance with the policy on the sale of goods. 
Where such discrete elements are not in place, revenue from significant contracts is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion  
of the contract by reference to the specific contract terms and the costs incurred on the contract at the Balance Sheet date in comparison 
to the total forecast costs of the contract. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed  
to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
109
 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Financials
Financials 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included in revenue from construction contracts when the amount can  
be measured reliably and its receipt is considered probable. Variations are included when the customer has agreed to the variation or 
acknowledged liability for the variation in principle. Claims are included when negotiations with the customer have reached an advanced 
stage such that it is probable that the customer will accept the claim. Incentive payments are included when a contract is sufficiently 
advanced that it is probable that the performance standards triggering the incentive will be achieved.
Profit attributable to contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed. Where this is not the 
case contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recovered. When it is probable 
that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable.
Exceptional costs/income
Exceptional costs/income are those costs/income of a significant and non-recurring nature or those associated with significant 
restructuring programmes, acquisitions or disposals, which warrant separate additional disclosure in the financial statements in order  
to fully understand the underlying performance of the Group.
Headline operating profit
Headline operating profit is stated before exceptional operating costs, exceptional operating income and intangible asset amortisation. 
Headline operating profit is considered by the Directors to be the best measure of performance. 
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Issue costs of loans
The finance cost recognised in the Income Statement in respect of the issue costs of borrowings is allocated to periods over the terms  
of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, and any costs directly attributable to bring the asset into 
operation. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to 
acquire the asset. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
Freehold land nil 
Freehold buildings and long leasehold property over expected economic life not exceeding 50 years
Short leasehold property over the term of the lease
Plant and equipment 3-12 years
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are 
accounted for prospectively.
Notes to the 
financial statements continued
110
 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Financials The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists an impairment review is performed and, where the carrying values 
exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of property, 
plant and equipment is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and  
the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from 
the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds or costs and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the Income Statement in the year that the item is derecognised.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
On acquisition of businesses, separately identifiable intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Access to the use of brands and intellectual property are valued using a “relief from royalty” method which determines the net present 
value of future additional cash flows arising from the use of the intangible asset.
Customer relationships are valued on the basis of the net present value of the future additional cash flows arising from customer 
relationships with appropriate allowance for attrition of customers.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the asset as follows:
Customer relationships 20 years or less
Brands and intellectual property 20 years or less
Computer software 5 years or less
Development costs 5 years or less
Computer software is initially recorded at cost. Where these assets have been acquired through a business combination, this will be the 
fair value allocated in the acquisition accounting. Where these have been acquired other than through a business combination, the initial 
cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.
Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are measured on a similar basis to property, plant and equipment. Useful lives 
are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to clearly defined and identifiable development projects are capitalised when there is a technical degree of exploitation, 
adequacy of resources and a potential market or development possibility in the undertaking that are recognisable; and where it is the 
intention to produce, market or execute the project. A correlation must also exist between the costs incurred and future benefits and  
those costs can be measured reliably. Capitalised costs are expensed on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of five years or less. 
Costs not meeting such criteria are expensed as incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value and measured using a first in, first out basis. Cost includes all direct 
expenditure and appropriate production overhead expenditure incurred in bringing goods to their current state under normal operating 
conditions. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. 
Provisions are made for obsolescence or other expected losses where necessary.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables and other receivables are measured and carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. The carrying amount of other receivables is reduced by the impairment loss directly and a charge is recorded in the Income 
Statement. For trade receivables, the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. Subsequent recoveries  
of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account and changes in the carrying amount of the allowance  
account are recognised in the Income Statement.
111
 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Financials
Financials 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Trade receivables that are assessed not to be impaired individually are also assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective 
evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past experience of collecting receipts, an increase in the 
number of delayed receipts in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic 
conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Balance Sheet comprise cash in hand, current balances with banks and similar institutions and short-
term deposits which are readily convertible to cash which are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value.
For the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the 
amortisation process.
Leases
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised 
at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding 
liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance 
charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are charged directly against income. Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful 
life of the asset or the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental 
income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest 
method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant periods.  
The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments throughout the expected life of the financial liability,  
or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when 
the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity risks, arising 
from operating and financing activities. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Details of 
derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 24 of the financial statements.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fair value. Their fair value is recalculated at each reporting date. The 
accounting treatment for the resulting gain or loss will depend on whether the derivative meets the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses on the revaluation to fair value at the period 
end are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Where derivatives do meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting, 
recognition of any resulting gain or loss on revaluation depends on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Derivative financial instruments with maturity dates of less than one year from the period end date are classified as current in the Balance Sheet. 
Hedge accounting
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document from inception the relationship between the item being hedged 
and the hedging instrument and to show that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is performed 
at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Financials Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, 
exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in  
foreign operations.
Fair value hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of  
a recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in 
the Income Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
Cash flow hedge
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to the variability in cash flows 
that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted cash flow. 
The effective portion of any gain or loss from revaluing the derivative financial instrument is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income and accumulated in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. 
Amounts previously recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity are recycled to the Income 
Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Income Statement or when the forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-
financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement  
of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Derivative financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations. 
The effective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss from revaluing the derivative at a reporting period end is recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recognised immediately in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is disposed of  
or when the hedge is no longer expected to occur.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that  
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows at a rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to  
the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Restructurings
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by either starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main 
features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the 
restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing 
activities of the entity.
Warranties
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations under local sale of goods legislation are recognised at the date of sale of the 
relevant products, at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligation.
Onerous contracts
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered  
to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it.
 
Environmental liabilities
Liabilities for environmental costs are recognised when environmental assessments or clean-ups are probable and the associated  
costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action.  
The amount recognised is the best estimate of the expenditure required. Where the liability will not be settled for a number of years, the 
amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.

Financials 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the year in which the associated 
services are rendered by employees of the Group. The accounting policy for pensions and other retirement benefits is described below.
The Group also operates long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) for Directors and certain employees. The expected settlement costs of these 
plans are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the plans.
Pensions and other retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans, some of which require contributions to be made  
to administered funds separate from the Group.
For the defined benefit pension and retirement benefit plans, plan assets are measured at fair value and plan liabilities are measured on  
an actuarial basis and discounted at an interest rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent 
currency and term to the plan liabilities. Any assets resulting from this calculation are limited to past service cost plus the present value  
of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related 
current service cost and past service cost, are measured using the projected unit credit method.
The service cost of providing pension and other retirement benefits to employees for the period is charged to the Income Statement.
Net interest expense on net defined benefit obligations is determined by applying discount rates used to measure defined benefit 
obligations at the beginning of the year to net defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the year. Net interest expense is recognised 
within finance costs.
Remeasurement gains and losses comprise actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on  
plan assets (excluding interest). Remeasurement gains and losses, and taxation thereon, are recognised in full in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently recycled.
Actuarial gains and losses may result from differences between the actuarial assumptions underlying the plan obligations and actual 
experience during the period, or changes in the actuarial assumptions used in the valuation of the plan obligations. 
For defined contribution plans, contributions payable are charged to the Income Statement as an operating expense when employees 
have rendered services entitling them to the contributions.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which  
it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for  
the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each Balance Sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when 
the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the Income 
Statement for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the 
Income Statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and 
losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised 
directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated  
at exchange rates prevailing on the Balance Sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the 
period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are 
used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity 
(attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate). Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period 
in which the related operation is disposed of. Any exchange differences that have previously been attributed to non-controlling interests  
are derecognised but they are not reclassified to the Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the rate prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Financials Taxation
The tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the period and represents the sum of the tax paid or currently payable and deferred tax.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance Sheet date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:
• where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures 
can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses,  
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and carry-forward  
of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
• where the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination 
and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax 
assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and 
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the relevant Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis. 
Tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and  
not in the Income Statement.
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:
• where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales 
tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
• where receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
Balance Sheet.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2: “Share-based payment”. The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments  
to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value of the equity instrument excluding the effect of 
non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest  
and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the 
Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

Financials 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them 
and that the grants will be received.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit or loss over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned. 
Non-current assets and businesses held for sale
Non-current assets and businesses classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and businesses are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly probable and 
the asset or business is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should  
be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods. 
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as set out in note 2, management has made critical accounting judgements regarding the  
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition, the valuation of intangibles, the impairment of non-current assets,  
the quantification of provisions, the valuation of retirement benefit obligations and in respect of taxation. Due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes may differ from those assumptions and estimates. An analysis of the  
key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is provided below.
Fair values at acquisition
Following the acquisition of Eclipse, Inc. (“Eclipse”), management has made judgements regarding the fair value of assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed particularly in relation to provisions and intangible assets. The fair value of these assets and liabilities are shown in note 12. 
Valuation of intangibles 
In accordance with IFRS 3: “Business combinations” intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value. 
These fair values have been estimated using income based valuation methods. These valuation methods estimate the price that an asset 
could be sold for in an arm’s length transaction on the basis of the asset’s expected future income stream. These estimates are based 
upon market data in order to reconstruct the measurement process a typical market participant would implement.
The valuation of intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of future cash flows arising from customer 
relationships after estimating the attrition factor relevant to the customer relationship and other factors such as access to the workforce, 
which are appropriate to the determination of the additional cash flows. The valuation of intangible assets in respect of brands and 
intellectual property requires management to estimate future cash flows using a “relief from royalty” model.

Annual Report 2014
Financials Impairment of non-current assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be 
impaired and at least annually. Such events and circumstances include the effects of restructuring initiated by management. 
To determine whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units  
to which goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future 
cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value. Such 
calculations require judgement relating to the appropriate discount factors and long-term growth prevalent in a particular market as well as 
short and medium-term business plans. Management draw upon experience as well as external resources in making these judgements.
The carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets (not including computer software and development costs) at the Balance 
Sheet date was £2,380.7 million (31 December 2013: £2,587 .9 million). At 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group recognised no 
impairment loss in respect of these assets. 
Provisions
The quantification of certain liabilities within provisions (environmental remediation obligations and future costs and settlements in relation 
to certain legal claims) have been estimated using the best information available. However, such liabilities depend on the actions of third 
parties and on the specific circumstances pertaining to each obligation, neither of which is controlled by the Group. Although provisions 
are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted for management’s best current estimates, the judgemental nature of these items means that 
future amounts settled may be different from those provided. Further details are set out in note 20.
Retirement benefit obligations
Retirement benefits are accounted for under IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits”. For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured  
at the discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. Because of changing market and economic conditions, the 
expenses and liabilities actually arising under the plans in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis of these 
actuarial assumptions. Therefore, declining returns on equity markets and markets for fixed-income instruments could necessitate 
additional contributions to the plans in order to cover future pension obligations. Also, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter 
life of participants may have an impact on the amount of pension income or expense recorded in the future.
The discount rate used to discount retirement benefit obligations to present value is derived from the yields of senior, high-quality corporate 
bonds at the Balance Sheet date. These generally include AA-rated securities. The discount rate is based on the market yield of a portfolio 
of bonds whose weighted residual maturities approximately correspond to the duration necessary to cover the entire benefit obligation.
Pension and other retirement benefits are inherently long-term and future experience may differ from the actuarial assumptions used  
to determine the net charge for retirement benefit obligations. Note 23 to these consolidated financial statements describes the principal 
discount rate, earnings increase and pension retirement benefit obligation assumptions that have been used to determine the net charge 
for retirement benefit obligations in accordance with IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits”. The calculation of any charge relating to 
retirement benefit obligations is clearly dependent on the assumptions used, which reflects the exercise of judgement. The assumptions 
adopted are based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries.
At 31 December 2014, the Group’s retirement benefit obligation deficit was £218.5 million (31 December 2013: £219.3 million). 
Taxation
The Group is subject to income tax in most of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Management is required to exercise judgement in 
determining the Group’s provision for income taxes. Management’s judgement is required in estimating tax provisions where additional 
current tax may become payable in the future following the audit by the tax authorities of previously filed tax returns. Management’s 
judgement is also required as to whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future taxable profits.  
While the Group aims to ensure that the estimates recorded are accurate, the actual amounts could be different from those expected.

During 2014, the continuing Group incurred £30.6 million (2013: £18.8 million) of costs relating to restructuring programmes which are 
expected to deliver cost savings in the future. 
The costs in both years were weighted towards the recently acquired Elster businesses, notably towards Gas in 2014. The most significant 
proportion of restructuring within the Gas business relates to the major closure of the Essen plant in Belgium and relocation of its Integrated 
Metering Solutions business, which builds metering stations, to Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. In addition, as a consequence of the closure of 
Essen, research and development and the production of ultrasonic meters was moved to Mainz, Germany in the year. Initial restructuring 
costs following the acquisition of Eclipse were also incurred in 2014. 
The restructuring costs incurred in 2013 were proportionally weighted to the Elster Electricity and Water businesses and whilst 
restructuring costs have been incurred within these businesses in 2014 they are focused on European operations rather than the large 
restructures in the North America businesses incurred in previous years. 
The Group also incurred £3.7 million (2013: £0.5 million) of expenses on acquisition and disposal related activities during the year.

resulting in the release of £28.9 million of provisions as exceptional income.

(1) The impairment of computer software and development costs comprises £2.1 million (2013: £nil) in relation to the Gas segment. 
The most significant identified intangible asset is included within the Gas segment, is in relation to customer relationships, has a carrying 
amount as at 31 December 2014 of £582.8 million (31 December 2013: £647 .5 million) and has a remaining amortisation period of 17 years 
and 8 months.
The goodwill generated as a result of major acquisitions represents the premium paid in excess of the fair value of all net assets, including 
intangible assets, identified at the point of acquisition. The carrying value of goodwill represents the initial value that the Directors believed 
could be added to the acquired businesses through the application of their specialist turnaround experience.
The goodwill arising on bolt on acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability and cash flows arising from the businesses 
acquired, synergies as a result of the complementary nature of the business with existing Melrose businesses, the assembled workforce, 
technical expertise, knowhow, market share and geographical advantages afforded to the Group.

 Melrose Industries PLC
Annual Report 2014
Financials The future improvements applied to the acquired businesses, achieved through a combination of revised strategic direction, operational 
improvements and investment, are expected to result in improved profitability of the acquired businesses during the period of ownership 
and are also expected to result in enhanced disposal proceeds when the acquired businesses are ultimately disposed. The combined 
value achieved from these improvements is expected to be in excess of the value of goodwill acquired.
Goodwill has been allocated to the businesses, each of which comprises several cash-generating units, as follows:

calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to each group of cash-generating units (CGUs) and use the 
latest approved forecasts extrapolated to perpetuity using growth rates shown below, which do not exceed the long-term growth rate for the 
relevant market. No impairment was identified. The basis of these impairment tests and the key assumptions are set out in the table below:

(1) Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate specific to each CGU. Discount rates reflect the current market assessments of 
the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital of each CGU. In determining the cost of equity, the Capital Asset 
Pricing Model (CAPM) has been used. Under CAPM, the cost of equity is determined by adding a risk premium to the risk free rate to 
reflect the additional risk associated with investing outside of lending to a country (e.g. the purchase of UK Gilts). The premium is based  
on an industry adjustment (‘Beta’) to the expected return of the equity market above the risk free return. The relative risk adjustment  
reflects the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors and geographies on average.

(2) Assumptions applied in financial forecasts
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from financial budgets and mid-term plans approved by management. The key 
assumptions used in forecasting pre-tax cash flows relate to future budgeted revenue and operating margins likely to be achieved and  
the likely rates of long-term growth by market sector. Underlying factors in determining the values assigned to each key assumption by 
CGU are shown below:
Revenue growth and operating margins: 
Revenue growth assumptions in the forecast period are based on financial budgets and mid-term plans approved by management, taking 
into account industry growth rates and management of each division’s historical experience in the context of wider industry and economic 
conditions. Projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories. They incorporate past performance, historical 
growth rates, projections of developments in key markets, secured orders and orders likely to be achieved in the short to medium-term, 
given trends in the relevant market sector.
Operating margins have been forecast based on historical levels considering the likely impact of changing economic environments and 
competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues and the impact of management actions on costs. Projected margins reflect the impact 
of all initiated projects to improve operational efficiency and leverage scale. The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring 
projects to which the Group is not yet committed. Forecasts for other operating costs are based on inflation forecasts and supply and 
demand factors.
Energy 
Brush is a supplier of turbogenerators for the power generation, industrial, oil & gas and offshore sectors and a leading supplier  
of switchgear, transformers and other power infrastructure equipment. The key drivers for revenues and operating margins are  
i) original equipment investments in the global power market, both new capacity (mainly emerging markets) and replacement capacity 
(mainly in mature markets), ii) growth in service requirements of a growing installed base, and iii) new product introduction. Independent 
forecasts of growth in these power generation markets have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. Forecasts for other 
operating costs are based on inflation forecasts and supply and demand factors. 
Elster
Elster Gas designs and manufactures gas measurement, process heat control and gas safety control equipment. The key drivers for 
revenues and operating margins are i) global energy consumption and the growing share for natural gas ii) international legislation aimed  
at driving down emission levels and increasing efficiency which in turn stimulates demand for Smart meters and process heat applications. 
Independent forecasts of the growth in these end markets have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. Forecasts for other 
operating costs are based on inflation forecasts and supply and demand factors. 
Elster Electricity is an international metering solution provider supplying both traditional and Smart meter equipment, including applications 
for residential, commercial, industrial, transmission and distribution markets. The key drivers for revenues and operating margins are  
i) global demand for electricity metering requirements, both traditional and Smart, and ii) market developments in meter data software 
solutions. Independent forecasts of the growth in the meter hardware and related meter software end markets have been used to derive 
revenue growth assumptions as well as management’s best estimates of the impact of residential Smart meter rollouts in the EU. 
Forecasts for other operating costs are based on inflation forecasts and supply and demand factors. 
Elster Water designs and manufactures a comprehensive range of water metering solutions. The key driver for revenues and operating 
margins is the global demand for water meters, both traditional and Smart. Revenue growth assumptions have been built up with reference  
to past performance, historical growth rates and projections of developments in key markets. Forecasts for other operating costs are 
based on inflation forecasts and supply and demand factors. 
(3) Long-term growth rates
Long-term growth rates are based on long-term economic forecasts for growth in the manufacturing sector in the geography in which the 
CGU operates. Long-term growth rates are determined using a blend of publicly available historical data and a long-term growth rate forecast 
published by external analysts and further take into account the international presence and the markets in which each business operates.

Financials Sensitivity analysis
A reasonable possible change in the assumptions applied would not result in any impairment. Base case forecasts show significant 
headroom above the carrying value for each Group of CGUs. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each Group of CGUs to assess 
the impact of any reasonable possible change in key assumptions. There is no reasonable possible change that would cause the carrying 
values to exceed recoverable amounts.
Acquisition of businesses
On 31 October 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital and obtained control of Eclipse, Inc. (“Eclipse”) for cash 
consideration of £97 .6 million.
Eclipse is a long established manufacturer of low-temperature industrial gas combustion equipment, which complements Elster Gas’ 
expertise in high-temperature industrial gas combustion applications. 
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below. Fair values are 
provisional as of 31 December 2014 and are based on the information held to date.

Cash consideration 97.6
Acquisition related costs (included in exceptional operating costs) amount to £2.3 million.
The fair value of financial assets include gross trade and other receivables of £14.3 million. The best estimate at acquisition date of the 
contractual cash flows not to be collected is £0.8 million. 
Eclipse contributed £12.2 million to revenue and £1.4 million to headline operating profit for the two month period between the date of 
acquisition and the Balance Sheet date.
If the acquisition of Eclipse had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues would have been approximately 
£1,441 million and Group headline operating profit would have been approximately £249 million. 
The goodwill arising on acquisition of Eclipse is attributable to the anticipated profitability and cash flows arising from the businesses 
acquired, synergies as a result of the complementary nature of the business with Elster Gas, the assembled workforce, technical expertise, 
knowhow, market share and geographical advantages afforded to the Group. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for 
income tax purposes. 
Contingent liabilities of £4.5 million have been acquired in respect of warranty and legal claims and recognised within provisions.  
The majority of expenditure is expected to be incurred over the next five years. 
The non-controlling interests acquired are measured on the proportion of the fair value of their net assets.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers and because they are unrelated to each other.  
Credit control procedures are implemented to ensure that sales are only made to organisations that are willing and able to pay for them.  
Such procedures include the establishment and review of customer credit limits and terms. The Group does not hold any collateral or  
any other credit enhancements over any of its trade receivables nor does it have a legal right of offset against any amounts owed by the 
Group to the counterparty.

As at 1 January 2014, the Group held a five year multi-currency facility split between a £355 million term loan and a £989 million revolving 
credit facility. These facilities were due to mature on 29 June 2017 . On 11 July 2014, the existing facility was “Amended and Extended”, 
resulting in lower margins, greater flexibility and the facility being extended by two years, maturing on 11 July 2019.
As at 1 January 2014, the term loan was split into two tranches of £180 million and US $290 million. As part of the Amend and Extend 
exercise the US $290 million term loan was converted into a US Dollar denominated revolving credit facility. The Sterling denominated term 
loan is subject to mandatory repayments of 5% on July 2017 , July 2018 and January 2019, adjusted for any term loan repayments made 
prior to these dates.
As at 1 January 2014, the revolving credit facility was split between a £741.5 million Sterling denominated multi-currency facility and a  
€300 million Euro denominated facility. At 31 December 2014 the Sterling and Euro denominated facilities remain unchanged and exist 
along with the US $290 million facility which was converted from a term loan to a revolving credit facility during the year.
The £180 million term loan facility was fully drawn at 31 December 2014. The drawdowns under the revolving credit facility as of this date 
were £11 million, US $381 million and €194 million.
Throughout the year, the Group remained compliant with all covenants under the facilities disclosed above. A number of companies 
continue to be guarantors under the bank facilities. 
Drawdowns under the existing facility bear interest at interbank rates of interest plus a margin determined by reference to the Group’s 
performance under its debt cover covenant ratio and ranges between 0.75% and 1.90% (31 December 2013: range between 1.40%  
to 2.65%). The margin as at 31 December 2014 was 1.30% (31 December 2013: 2.25%).

Environmental and legal costs provisions relate to the estimated remediation costs of pollution, soil and groundwater contamination at 
certain sites and estimated future costs and settlements in relation to legal claims. Due to their nature, it is not possible to predict precisely 
when these provisions will be utilised. 
Incentive plan related provisions are in respect of long-term incentive plans for divisional senior management, expected to result in cash 
expenditure in the next three years.
The provision for warranty related costs represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligations. Warranty 
terms are, on average, between one and five years.
Other provisions relate primarily to costs that will be incurred in respect of restructuring programmes, usually resulting in cash spend within 
one year.

As at 31 December 2014, the Group had gross unused losses of £183.6 million (31 December 2013: £217 .1 million) available for offset 
against future profits. At 31 December 2014, a £10.4 million deferred tax asset (31 December 2013: £9.7 million) in respect of £40.9 million 
(31 December 2013: £42.0 million) of these gross losses was recognised in the Balance Sheet. No asset was recognised in respect of the 
remaining losses due to the divisional and geographic split of anticipated future profit streams and the effect of possible disposals in future 
years. The majority of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely subject to certain continuity of business requirements. 
A deferred tax asset of £24.7 million (31 December 2013: £25.6 million) was recognised on Group retirement benefit obligations, being the 
extent to which they are expected to generate tax deductions against foreseeable taxable profits. 
The remaining asset of £33.6 million (31 December 2013: £35.0 million) relates to other temporary differences. 
As at 31 December 2014, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries was £474 
million (31 December 2013: £364 million) on which deferred tax liabilities not recognised were £4.3 million (31 December 2013: £3.3 million). 
No liability was recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
22. Share-based payments
Melrose Incentive Plan
The Company has 50,000 options (31 December 2013: 50,000 options) in issue which enable the holder of these options to subscribe for 
2012 Incentive Shares. These options are held by Directors and senior employees. Further details of the 2012 Melrose Incentive Plan are 
provided in the Remuneration report on pages 78 to 95.
The estimated value of the 2012 Incentive Shares at 31 December 2014 was £44.7 million (31 December 2013: £73.0 million). Using a Black 
Scholes option pricing model, the estimated fair value attributable to this plan, at 31 May 2017 , is £63.4 million (31 December 2013: £101.7 million). 
The inputs into the Black Scholes model that were used to fair value the plan when it was originally established in 2012 were as follows:
Valuation 
assumptions
Weighted average share price £2.27
Weighted average exercise price £2.85
Expected volatility 30%
Expected life as at inception 5.0 years
Risk free interest 1.0%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price. 
The Group recognised an IFRS 2 charge of £4.0 million (2013: £4.0 million) in the year ended 31 December 2014 in relation to the equity-
settled 2012 Melrose Incentive Plan.

Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution plans for qualifying employees across several jurisdictions. The assets of the plans are held 
separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
The total costs charged in relation to the continuing businesses during the year of £6.9 million (2013: £6.8 million) represent contributions 
payable to these plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit plans
The Group sponsors defined benefit plans for qualifying employees of certain subsidiaries. The funded defined benefit plans are 
administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Group. The trustees of the funds are required by law to act in the interest 
of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the plans. The trustees of the pension funds are responsible for the investment policy with 
regard to the assets of the fund.
The most significant defined benefit pension plans are:
• The FKI UK Pension Plans, which comprise two separate independent plans; the FKI UK Pension Plan and the Brush Group (2013) 
Pension Plan, are defined benefit in type and are funded plans. The plans are closed to new members and the accrual of future benefits 
for existing members. At 31 December 2013 the FKI UK Pension Plans also contained the Bridon Group (2013) Pension Plan, which was 
disposed with Bridon on 12 November 2014.
• The McKechnie UK Pension Plan, which is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan (other than £5.0 million of unfunded liabilities).  
The plan is closed to new members and the accrual of future benefits for existing members.
• The FKI US Pension Plan, which is defined benefit in type and is a funded plan. The plan is closed to new members and the accrual of 
future benefits for existing members. During the year certain vested participants accepted lump sum offers resulting in an adjustment to 
past service cost of £3.5 million.
Other plans include a number of funded and unfunded defined benefit arrangements across Europe, North America and the rest of the 
world. The Group also operates unfunded retiree medical and welfare benefit plans, principally in the US. During the year the Group 
terminated certain Elster US unfunded retiree medical and welfare plans, reducing gross liabilities by £4.3 million. 
The costs of the Group’s defined benefit plans are determined in accordance with IAS 19 (revised): “Employee benefits” with the advice of 
independent professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit credit method. In line with 
normal practice, these valuations are undertaken triennially in the UK and annually in the US.
Valuations of the FKI UK Pension Plans are based on full actuarial valuations as of 31 December 2013 and updated at 31 December 2014  
by independent actuaries. The McKechnie UK Pension Plan valuation is based on a full valuation at 31 December 2011, updated at  
31 December 2014 by independent actuaries. The FKI US Pension Plan valuation is based on the US full actuarial valuation as of  
31 December 2013, updated at 31 December 2014 by independent actuaries. 
The Group contributed £26.6 million (2013: £20.0 million) to the FKI UK Pension Plans, which included £8.1 million (2013: £0.6 million) to the 
disposed Bridon Group (2013) Pension Plan, and contributed £5.2 million (2013: £5.2 million) to the McKechnie UK Pension Plan in the year 
ended 31 December 2014. In 2015 the Group expects to contribute £20.0 million to the FKI UK Pension Plans and £5.2 million to the 
McKechnie UK Pension Plan.
In total, the Group expects to contribute approximately £31.4 million to its defined benefit plans in the year ended 31 December 2015.

Mortality
FKI UK Pension Plans 
Mortality assumptions for the most significant plans in the Group, the FKI UK Plans, as at 31 December 2014 are based on the Self 
Administered Pension Scheme (“SAPS”) “S1” base tables with scaling factors of 110% and 105% for deferred members and pensioners 
respectively, which reflect the results of a mortality analysis carried out on the plan’s membership. Future improvements are in line with the 
Continuous Mortality Investigation (“CMI”) improvement model with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% p.a. for both males and females. 
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 21.9 years (31 December 2013: 21.9 years) if they 
are male and for a further 24.2 years (31 December 2013: 24.1 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2034 at age 65, the 
assumptions are that they will live for a further 23.2 years (31 December 2013: 23.3 years) after retirement if they are male and for a further 
25.7 years (31 December 2013: 25.6 years) after retirement if they are female.
The mortality assumptions are consistent with those adopted for the full valuation as at 31 December 2013.
Other plans
The mortality assumptions adopted as at 31 December 2014 have been set to reflect the Group’s best estimate view of life expectancies  
of members of each individual pension arrangement. These mortality assumptions vary by arrangement, each assumption reflecting the 
characteristics of the membership of that arrangement.

The assets are well diversified and the majority of plan assets have quoted prices in active markets. All government bonds are issued by 
reputable governments and are generally AA rated or higher. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to complement the 
role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings for liability risk management.
The trustees continually review whether the chosen investment strategy is appropriate with a view to providing the pension benefits and to 
ensure appropriate matching of risk and return profiles. The main strategic policies include maintaining an appropriate asset mix, managing 
interest rate sensitivity and maintaining an appropriate equity buffer. Investment results are regularly reviewed.
There is no self investment (other than in relevant tracker funds) either in the Group’s own financial instruments or property or other assets 
used by the Group.

Financials Risks and sensitivities 
The defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, salary risk, interest rate risk and market 
(investment) risk. The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or plan specific risks.
A sensitivity analysis on the principal assumptions used to measure the plan liabilities at the year end is as follows:

Decrease by 1 year 44.6 n/a
(1) The RPI inflation sensitivity encompasses the impact on pension increases, where applicable.
The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on reasonable possible changes to the respective assumptions, while holding  
all other assumptions constant. There has been no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from 
prior years.
The sensitivities are based on the relevant assumptions and membership profile as at 31 December 2014 and are applied to the obligations 
at the end of the reporting period. Whilst the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected, it does provide 
an approximation to the sensitivity of the assumptions shown. Extrapolation of these results beyond the sensitivity figures shown may not 
be appropriate and the sensitivity analysis presented may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it  
is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and derivative financial assets which represent the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial assets is limited because the counterparties are banks with 
strong credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. 
The amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s 
management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. Note 16 provides further details 
regarding the recovery of trade receivables.
Capital risk
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return 
to stakeholders through the optimisation of the Group’s net debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, after deducting cash and cash 
equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising Issued share capital, Reserves and Retained earnings as 
disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy for managing liquidity rate risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review.
Fair values
The Directors consider that the financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
A one percentage point rise in market interest rates for all currencies would increase/(decrease) profit before tax by the following amounts 
assuming the net debt as at the Balance Sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. At 31 December 2014 the Group had a temporary 
excess position on Sterling interest rate swaps as a result of paying down debt under the Revolving Credit Facilities from the proceeds of 
the disposal that occurred in the year. This position was reversed following the capital return in March 2015. Adjusting for the capital return, 
the sensitivity would decrease profit after tax by £0.2 million for Sterling, £1.4 million for US Dollar and £0.1 million for Euros.

Interest rate risk management
The Group’s policy for managing interest rate risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review.
Following the Return of Capital in February 2014, the Group protected 78% of its gross debt against interest rate fluctuations through fixing 
the interest expense on US $246.8 million, £336.8 million and €200.0 million of debt with the use of interest rate swaps.
As a result of the “Amend and Extend” exercise the Group completed in July 2014 and the impact of the disposal of Bridon, the Group 
closed out all Euro and Sterling interest rate swaps. In order to hedge up to 75% of interest rate exposure on the gross debt post the 
Return of Capital in March 2015, the Group took out new Euro, Sterling and additional US Dollar swaps. The fixed finance cost is 0.06% 
(31 December 2013: 0.72%) on Euro swaps, 1.05% (31 December 2013: 0.91%) on Sterling swaps and the weighted blended fixed rate  
for US Dollar swaps is 0.92% (31 December 2013: 0.70%), plus the bank margin of 1.30%. 
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and were highly effective throughout 2014. The fair value of the contracts  
at 31 December 2014 was a net liability of £0.9 million (31 December 2013: net asset of £5.6 million).
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s policy for managing foreign currency risk is set out in the Finance Director’s review on page 48.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
Currency risks are defined by IFRS 7: “Financial instruments: Disclosures” as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial 
asset or liability will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The following table details the transactional impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities  
at the Balance Sheet date, illustrating the (decrease)/increase in Group operating profit caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the  
US Dollar and Euro against Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Canadian Dollar against Sterling compared to the year end spot rate.  
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The Group operates  
in a range of different currencies, and those with a notable impact are noted here:

Financials The following table details the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities at the Balance 
Sheet date, illustrating the increase/(decrease) in Group equity caused by a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against 
Sterling and a 10% strengthening of the Canadian Dollar against Sterling. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other 
foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. 
The 2013 high sensitivity on Euro was due to a currency swap for €235 million that was put in place ahead of the 2013 year end to 
temporarily repay Euro debt with a proportion of the disposal proceeds in that year until the debt was redrawn ahead of the capital return 
on 28 February 2014. Adjusting for the currency swap, the sensitivity on Euro at 31 December 2013 was £3.0 million. The Group operates 
in a range of different currencies, and those with a notable impact are noted here:

US Dollar 2.2 1.5 
Euro 3.7 20.8 
Canadian Dollar (0.4) 0.4
In addition, the change in equity due to a 10 cent strengthening of the US Dollar and Euro against Sterling for the translation of net 
investment hedging instruments would be a decrease of £10.8 million (31 December 2013: £9.3 million) and £12.7 million (31 December 
2013: £nil) respectively. However, there would be no overall effect on equity because there would be an offset in the currency translation  
of the foreign operation.
Fair value measurements recognised in the Balance Sheet 
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates matching the maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swap contracts are measured using yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. 
The following table sets out the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured and recognised at fair value:

The fair value of these financial instruments are derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) and they are therefore categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy set out 
in IFRS 13: “Fair value measurement”. The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and out of the different fair value hierarchy levels at the 
date the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer to occur. There have been no transfers between levels in the year.

The Return of Capital took place by increasing the authorised share capital by £595.3 million through the issue of 509,123,150 ‘B’ shares 
and 757 ,503,886 ‘C’ shares of 47 .0 pence each and capitalising £595.3 million of the Merger reserve to pay up in full the ‘B’ and ‘C’ shares.
Shareholders had the option to receive the cash value inherent in the ‘B’ and ‘C’ shares by way of income or the choice of two capital 
options. As a result of the elections made by shareholders in respect of the Return of Capital:
• 493,363,270 ‘B’ shares were redeemed and subsequently cancelled with immediate effect from 17 February 2014.
• 15,759,880 ‘B’ shares were redeemed on 30 April 2014 and subsequently cancelled.
• 757 ,503,886 ‘C’ shares were paid a dividend on 28 February 2014 and these ‘C’ shares were subsequently cancelled.
In conjunction with the Return of Capital, on 7 February 2014 the number of Ordinary Shares in issue was consolidated in a ratio of 11 for 
13 in order to maintain comparability of the Company’s share price before and after the Return of Capital. On 7 February 2014 the number 
of Ordinary Shares in issue became 1,071,761,339 each with a nominal value of 13/110 pence.
Translation reserve 
The Translation reserve contains exchange differences on the translation of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than Sterling and 
exchange gains or losses on the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Hedging reserve
The Hedging reserve represents the cumulative fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which cash flow hedge 
accounting has been applied.
Merger reserve, Capital redemption reserve and Other reserves
The Merger reserve represents the excess of fair value over nominal value of shares issued in consideration for the acquisition of 
subsidiaries. The Capital redemption reserve arises upon the redemption of the Company’s own shares. Other reserves comprise 
accumulated adjustments in respect of Group reconstructions.

Share totalling £200.4 million.
‘B’ and ‘C’ shares with a total value of £200.4 million have been created resulting in a corresponding reduction in the Merger reserve. 
When the capital return payments are made on 16 March 2015, the ‘B’ and ‘C’ shares will be redeemed and £200.4 million will be 
transferred to the Capital redemption reserve.
As a result of the approval of the capital return, on 20 February 2015 the number of Ordinary Shares in issue was consolidated in a ratio  
of 13 for 14 in order to maintain comparability of the Company’s share price before and after the capital return. On 20 February 2015 the 
number of Ordinary Shares in issue became 995,206,966 each with a nominal value of 7/55 pence.
Further details of the capital return are provided on pages 64 and 65 in the Directors’ report.
30. Contingent liabilities
As a result of acquisitions made by the Group, certain contingent legal, environmental, warranty and tax liabilities were identified either  
at the time of acquisition or as part of the completion of the acquisition accounting. Whilst it is difficult to reasonably estimate the ultimate 
outcome of these claims, the Directors’ best estimate has been included in the Balance Sheet where they existed at the time of acquisition 
and hence were recognised in accordance with IFRS 3: “Business combinations”. Where a provision has been recognised, information 
regarding the different categories of such liabilities and the amount and timing of outflows is included within note 20.
The Group has contingent liabilities representing guarantees and contract bonds given in the ordinary course of business on behalf of 
trading subsidiaries. No losses are anticipated to arise on these contingent liabilities. The Group does not have any other significant 
contingent liabilities.

Balance Sheet
1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of Melrose Industries PLC (“the Company”) are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.  
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”) and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the current and prior year. 
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ statement of going concern on page 49 of the Finance 
Director’s review.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration, including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured  
at the fair value of the consideration paid. Any premium is ignored.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20: “Share-based payment”. The Company issues equity-settled share-based 
payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market 
based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments  
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest  
and adjusted for the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on  
the Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Where equity-settled share-based payments are made available to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries, these are treated as 
increases in equity over the vesting period of the award with a corresponding increase in the Company’s investment in subsidiaries.
Cash Flow Statement
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a Cash Flow Statement under the terms of FRS 1 (revised): “Cash 
flow statements” because it prepares a consolidated Cash Flow Statement which is shown on page 104 of the Group financial statements.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance Sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
Balance Sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements.
2. Profit for the period
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own Profit and Loss Account for  
the year. Melrose Industries PLC reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2014 of £10.8 million (2013: £5.1 million).

the Act) for cash pursuant to the authorities granted by resolution 
14 as if section 561 of the Act did not apply to any such allotment 
provided that this power shall be limited:

of equity securities in connection with an offer by way of 
rights issue only):

may be practicable) to their existing holdings; and
(ii) to holders of other equity securities, as required by 
the rights of those securities or, subject to such rights,

regulatory or practical problems in, or under the laws  
of any territory or any other matter; and

out in paragraph (A) of this resolution) of equity securities 
pursuant to the authority granted by paragraph (A) of resolution

such power to expire at the conclusion of the Company’s next 
Annual General Meeting after this resolution is passed or, if 
earlier, at the close of business on 30 June 2016, but so that  
the Company may make offers or agreements before the

agreement notwithstanding that the power conferred by this 
authority has expired.

business days immediately preceding the day on

and the highest current independent bid on the 
trading venue where the purchase is carried out, 
in each case, exclusive of expenses;
(D) this authority shall expire at the conclusion of the 
Company’s next Annual General Meeting after this 
resolution is passed or, if earlier, at the close of business  
on 30 June 2016;
(E) the Company may make a contract of purchase of Ordinary 
Shares under this authority which would or might be

and may make a purchase of Ordinary Shares in pursuance 
of any such contract; and
(F) any Ordinary Shares purchased pursuant to this authority 
may either be held as treasury shares or cancelled by  
the Company, depending on which course of action is 
considered by the Directors to be in the best interests  
of shareholders at the time.
17. That a general meeting other than an Annual General Meeting 
may be called on not less than 14 clear days’ notice.
Recommendation
The Board believes that each of the resolutions to be proposed  
at the Annual General Meeting is in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the 
Directors unanimously recommend that ordinary shareholders  
vote in favour of all of the resolutions proposed, as the Directors 
intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.

Shareholder information
Shareholder information Explanatory notes to the proposed resolutions
Resolutions 1 to 14 (inclusive) are proposed as ordinary  
resolutions, which means that for each of those resolutions  
to be passed, more than half the votes cast must be cast in  
favour of the resolution. Resolutions 15 to 17 (inclusive) are 
proposed as special resolutions, which means that for each  
of those resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of  
the votes cast must be cast in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 1 – Receipt of 2014 Annual Report and  
financial statements
The Directors are required to lay the Company’s financial 
statements, the strategic report and the Directors’ and auditor’s 
reports on those financial statements (collectively, the “Annual 
Report”) before shareholders each year at the Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”). 
Resolution 2 – Approval of Directors’ remuneration report 
Following changes to the Act and in line with new regulations which 
came into effect on 1 October 2013, the Directors’ remuneration 
report (the “Directors’ Remuneration Report”) is now presented in 
three sections:
• the annual statement from the Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee; 
• the annual report on remuneration; and
• the Directors’ remuneration policy
The annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, set out on pages 78 to 80 of the 2014 Annual Report, 
summarises, for the year ended 31 December 2014, the major 
decisions taken on Directors’ remuneration, any substantial 
changes relating to Directors’ remuneration made during the year 
and the context in which those changes occurred and decisions 
that have been taken.
The annual report on remuneration, set out on pages 81 to 88  
of the 2014 Annual Report, provides details of the remuneration 
paid to Directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 2014, 
including base salary, taxable benefits, short-term incentives 
(including percentage deferred), long-term incentives vested in  
the year, pension-related benefits, any other items in the nature  
of remuneration and any sum(s) recovered or withheld during the 
year in respect of amounts paid in earlier years. 
The Directors’ remuneration policy, set out on pages 88 to 95 of the 
2014 Annual Report, provides details of the Company’s policy on 
Directors’ remuneration (including the policy on payments for loss  
of office). This policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM  
on13 May 2014, the approval being valid for three years from that 
date. As the policy is unchanged, shareholder approval of the  
policy is not required at this AGM. All remuneration payments and 
payments for loss of office made by the Company to the current 
and any former Directors must be consistent with the Directors’ 
remuneration policy or, if inconsistent with the Directors’ 
remuneration policy, must have been separately approved by  
way of an ordinary resolution of the shareholders in accordance 
with the relevant provisions of the Act. Approval would also be 
sought from shareholders if, at any time in the next two years,  
the Company wished to make any changes to the policy.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report (other than the part containing 
the Directors’ remuneration policy) is subject to an annual advisory 
shareholder vote by way of an ordinary resolution; Resolution 2 is to 
approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report (other than the part 
containing the Directors’ remuneration policy).
Resolution 3 – Declaration of final dividend
The Board is recommending, and the shareholders are being asked 
to approve, the declaration of a final dividend of 5.3 pence per 
Ordinary Share for the year ended 31 December 2014. The final 
dividend will, subject to shareholder approval, be paid on 18 May 
2015 to the holders of Ordinary Shares whose names are recorded 
on the register of members of the Company at the close of 
business on 17 April 2015. 
Resolutions 4 to 11 (inclusive) – Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
“Code”) and the Company’s articles of association (the “Articles”), 
every Director will stand for re-election at the AGM. Biographical 
details of each Director can be found on pages 62 and 63 of the 
2014 Annual Report. All of the non-executive Directors standing  
for re-election are considered independent under the Code. 
Resolution 12 – Re-appointment of auditor 
The Company is required to appoint auditors at each general 
meeting at which accounts are laid before shareholders, to hold 
office until the next such meeting. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness, performance, 
independence and objectivity of the existing external auditor, 
Deloitte LLP , on behalf of the Board, and concluded that the 
external auditor was in all respects effective.
This resolution proposes the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP until 
the conclusion of the next AGM.
Resolution 13 – Authority to agree auditor’s remuneration
This resolution seeks authority for the Audit Committee to 
determine the level of the auditor’s remuneration. 
Resolution 14 – Authority to allot shares
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to grant the Directors 
the authority to allot shares in the Company, or to grant rights to 
subscribe for or convert any securities into shares in the Company 
(“Rights”) pursuant to section 551 of the Act (the “Section 551 
authority”). The authority contained in paragraph (A) of the 
resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£422,209, being approximately one-third of the Company’s issued 
Ordinary Share capital as at 2 April 2015. 
In line with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers, 
paragraph (B) of this resolution would give the Directors authority  
to allot shares in the Company or grant Rights in connection with  
a rights issue up to aggregate nominal amount of £844,418, 
representing approximately two-thirds of the Company’s issued 
Ordinary Share capital as at 2 April 2015, as reduced by the 
aggregate nominal amount of any allotments or grants under 
paragraph (A) of this resolution.
The Company does not hold any shares in treasury.

If approved, the Section 551 authority shall, unless renewed, 
revoked or varied by the Company, expire at the end of the 
Company’s next AGM after the resolution is passed or, if earlier,  
at the close of business on 30 June 2016. The exception to this  
is that the Directors may allot shares or grant Rights after the 
authority has expired in connection with an offer or agreement 
made or entered into before the authority expired. The Directors 
have no present intention to exercise the Section 551 authority.
Resolution 15 – Partial disapplication of pre-emption rights
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to grant the Directors 
the power to allot equity securities of the Company pursuant to 
sections 570 and 573 of the Act (the “Section 570 and 573 power”) 
without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to 
their existing shareholdings.
The power is limited to allotments for cash in connection with 
pre-emptive offers, subject to any arrangements that the Directors 
consider appropriate to deal with fractions and overseas 
requirements and otherwise for cash up to a maximum nominal 
value of £126,662, representing approximately 10% of the 
Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital as at 2 April 2015.
The Directors intend to adhere to the guidelines set out in the 
Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles (as updated in March 
2015) and not to allot shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis 
pursuant to the authority in Resolution 15 (B):
• in excess of an amount equal to 5% of the Company’s issued 
Ordinary Share capital; or
• in excess of an amount equal to 7 .5% of the Company’s issued 
Ordinary Share capital in a rolling three-year period,
in each case other than in connection with an acquisition  
or specified capital investment which is announced 
contemporaneously with the allotment or which has taken  
place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in  
the announcement of the allotment.
If approved, the Section 570 and 573 power shall apply until the 
end of the Company’s next AGM after the resolution is passed or,  
if earlier, until the close of business on 30 June 2016. The exception 
to this is that the Directors may allot equity securities after the 
power has expired in connection with an offer or agreement made 
or entered into before the power expired. The Directors have no 
present intention to exercise the Section 570 and 573 power.
Resolution 16 – Authority to purchase own shares
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to grant the Company 
the authority to purchase its own shares pursuant to sections 693 
and 701 of the Act. 
This authority is limited to an aggregate maximum number of 
99,520,696 Ordinary Shares, representing 10% of the Company’s 
issued Ordinary Share capital as at 2 April 2015. 
The maximum price which may be paid for an Ordinary Share will 
be an amount which is not more than the higher of (i) 5% above the 
average of the middle market quotation for an Ordinary Share as 
derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange 
for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which 
the Ordinary Share is purchased; and (ii) the higher of the price of 
the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid 
on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out (in each 
case, exclusive of expenses). 
If approved, the authority shall, unless varied, revoked or renewed, 
expire at the end of the Company’s next AGM after the resolution is 
passed or, if earlier, at the close of business on 30 June 2016. The 
Directors have no present intention of exercising all or any of the 
powers conferred by this resolution and will only exercise their 
authority if it is in the interests of shareholders generally.
Resolution 17 – Notice period for general meetings other 
than AGMs
This resolution seeks shareholder approval to allow the Company  
to continue to call general meetings (other than AGMs) on 14 clear 
days’ notice. In accordance with the Companies (Shareholders’ 
Rights) Regulations 2009, the notice period required for general 
meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders approve a 
shorter notice period (subject to a minimum period of 14 clear days). 
AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.
The approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM,  
when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.  
In accordance with the Act, the Company must make a means  
of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting  
in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear 
days’ notice.

Shareholder information
Shareholder information Explanatory notes as to the proxy, voting and attendance 
procedures at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)
1. The holders of Ordinary Shares in the Company are entitled to 
attend the AGM and are entitled to vote. A member entitled to 
attend and vote may appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of 
their rights to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting of  
the Company. Such a member may appoint more than one 
proxy, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the 
rights attached to different shares. A proxy need not be a 
member of the Company.
2. A form of proxy is enclosed with this notice. To be effective, a 
form of proxy must be completed and returned, together with 
any power of attorney or authority under which it is completed 
or a certified copy of such power or authority, so that it is 
received by the Company’s registrars at the address specified 
on the form of proxy not less than 48 hours (excluding any part 
of a day that is not a working day) before the stated time for 
holding the meeting. Returning a completed form of proxy will 
not preclude a member from attending the meeting and voting 
in person.
3. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person 
nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information 
rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement 
between him and the shareholder by whom he was nominated, 
have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else 
appointed) as a proxy for the AGM. If a Nominated Person  
has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to 
exercise it, he may, under any such agreement, have a right  
to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of 
voting rights. The statement of the rights of shareholders in 
relation to the appointment of proxies in paragraphs 1 and 2 
above does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights 
described in paragraphs 1 and 2 can only be exercised by 
ordinary shareholders of the Company.
4. To be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM (and for the 
purposes of the determination by the Company of the number 
of votes they may cast), members must be entered on the 
Company’s register of members by 6.00 pm on 12 May 2015  
(or, in the event of an adjournment, on the date which is two 
days before the time of the adjourned meeting). Changes to 
entries on the register of members after this time shall be 
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend  
or vote at the meeting.
5. As at 2 April 2015, the Company’s issued share capital consists 
of 995,206,966 Ordinary Shares of 7/55 pence each, carrying 
one vote each. 
6. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 
through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service  
may do so by using the procedures described in the CREST 
Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored 
members, and those CREST members who have appointed  
a service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or 
voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the 
appropriate action on their behalf.
7. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the 
CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message  
(a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated  
in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s 
specifications, and must contain the information required  
for such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual 
(available via www.euroclear.com). The message, regardless 
of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an 
amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed 
proxy, must in order to be valid be transmitted so as to be 
received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) by 11.00 am on  
12 May 2015. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be 
taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied 
to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which  
the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry  
to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this 
 time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through 
CREST should be communicated to the appointee through 
other means.
8. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors, or voting service providers should note that  
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available  
special procedures in CREST for any particular message. 
Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply  
in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take  
(or, if the CREST member is a CREST Personal Member,  
or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service 
provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure 
that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system 
by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members 
and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system 
providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the 
CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST 
system and timings.
9. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction  
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the 
Uncertified Securities Regulations 2001.
10. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all  
of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so  
in relation to the same shares.

11. Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold 
requirements set out in that section have the right to require  
the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out 
any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts 
(including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit)  
that are to be laid before the AGM; or (ii) any circumstance 
connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold 
office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts  
and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act. 
The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any 
such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with 
sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required 
to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, 
it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not  
later than the time when it makes the statement available on  
the website. The business which may be dealt with at the 
Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the 
Company has been required under section 527 of the Act  
to publish on a website.
12. Any member holding Ordinary Shares attending the meeting 
has the right to ask questions. The Company must answer any 
such questions relating to the business being dealt with at the 
meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would 
interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve 
the disclosure of confidential information; (b) the answer has 
already been given on a website in the form of an answer to  
a question; or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the 
Company or the good order of the meeting that the question  
be answered.
13. Voting at the AGM will be by poll. The Chairman will invite each 
shareholder, corporate representative and proxy present at  
the meeting to complete a poll card indicating how they wish  
to cast their votes in respect of each resolution. In addition,  
the Chairman will cast the votes for which he has been 
appointed as proxy. Poll cards will be collected at the end  
of the meeting. Once the results have been verified by the 
Company’s registrar, Equiniti, they will be notified to the UK 
Listing Authority, announced through a Regulatory Information 
Service and will be available to view on the Company’s website.

at www.sharevote.co.uk. In order to register your vote online,  
you will need to enter the Task ID, together with your Voting ID

Adoption of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 101 
– Reduced Disclosure Framework
Following the publication of FRS 100 Application of  
Financial Reporting Requirements by the Financial  
Reporting Council, Melrose Industries PLC is required  
to change its accounting framework for its entity financial 
statements, which is currently UK GAAP , for its financial  
year which commenced on 1 January 2015. The Board 
considers that it is in the best interests of the Group for 
Melrose Industries PLC to adopt FRS 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework. No disclosures in the current UK 
GAAP financial statements would be omitted on adoption  
of FRS 101. A shareholder or shareholders holding in 
aggregate 5% or more of the total allotted shares in  
Melrose Industries PLC may serve objections to the use  
of the disclosure exemptions on Melrose Industries PLC,  
in writing, to its registered office (11th Floor, Colmore Plaza,

Share Fraud Warning
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning 
investment matters. Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that  
turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment. For more detailed information  
on this kind of activity or to report a scam, please call the Financial Conduct Authority’s Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 or visit

Another year of substantial progress
Chairman’s statement
* Restated for IAS 19 (Revised) “Employee Beneﬁts”.
Results and strategy
I am delighted to report that 2013/14 has 
been another year of substantial progress 
in what continues to be a transformational 
period for the Group under the stewardship 
of Ian Meakins, our Group Chief Executive, 
and his Executive team. Like-for-like 
revenue grew 4.2 per cent with a strong 
trading proﬁt performance, up 8.6 per cent 
in constant currency. Headline earnings 
per share of 196.2 pence was 9.9 per 
cent ahead of last year (2012/13 restated*: 
178.5 pence). We delivered an excellent 
cash performance, which is enabling us to 
both invest in the business and appropriately 
reward shareholders. You can read about 
this year’s performance in detail in the 
Financial review on pages 36 to 41.
Over recent years our priorities have 
developed from reshaping the portfolio 
towards driving proﬁtable growth and 
developing our business models. The heavy 
lifting is now largely completed and the 
business today is on a much stronger 
footing. We are now focusing on our 
attractive businesses with strong market 
positions. Today over 81 per cent of the 
Group’s revenue is generated by businesses 
that are either number one or number two 
in their markets. The growth opportunity 
in these markets remains large and we 
will continue to invest in and expand these 
businesses in the future. 
Now that we have a strong set of 
businesses to invest in, we have reﬁned 
our strategy to accelerate proﬁtable growth. 
In addition, we are also now stepping 
up investment in new business models, 
infrastructure and technology to ensure 
we drive appropriate beneﬁts of scale. 
I am immensely proud of the progress 
we have made this year in this area and 
you can read about some of the exciting 
projects, beneﬁting both our customers 
and our businesses in Ian’s review on 
pages 12 to 13.
Good governance and 
transparent reporting
It is my role as Chairman to lead the Board 
effectively and central to this is good 
governance. So you can easily see how we 
are governed, we have provided a corporate 
governance overview on page 57 of this 
Annual Report. We also brieﬂy set out how 
our governance structure supports delivery 
of our business strategy. You can ﬁnd more 
detail in the Governance section starting on 
page 56. On page 42 we have also provided 
an overview of the principal risks that might 
prevent us from achieving the full potential of 
our strategy and the actions we are taking to 
mitigate and control those risks.
Hand in hand with good governance goes 
transparent reporting and this year we have 
made a number of changes to the Annual 
Report to promote this. Some have been 
required due to changes in UK reporting 
regulations, others through changes to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and some 
by ever-evolving reporting best practice. 
Signiﬁcant changes include this Strategic 
report, which starts by explaining our 
business model and goes on to describe 
how each element helps to deliver our 
strategic goals. 
Finally, running Wolseley on a sustainable 
basis is an integral part of achieving our 
overall strategy. As such, the Board remains 
fully committed to this important aspect of 
how we operate. Our progress and our drive 
for continuous improvement is set out in the 
Sustainability section of this report on pages 
48 to 53.
The changes we have made to the Annual 
Report are also intended to reﬂect 
our efforts to make it fair, balanced 
and understandable.

Shareholder returns
We are strongly committed to maximising 
shareholder value. This year we rebased 
our dividend with an interim dividend 
increase of 25 per cent. The Board is now 
proposing a ﬁnal dividend of 55.0 pence 
per share (2012/13: 44.0 pence per share) 
for payment on 27 November 2014 to 
shareholders on the register on 17 October 
2014. This represents an increase of 25 per 
cent and will bring the total dividend for the 
year to 82.5 pence per share (2012/13:  
66.0 pence per share).
During the year we took the decision to 
return £298 million of surplus cash to 
shareholders by way of a special dividend, 
paid on 16 December 2013. Our balance 
sheet remains very strong and the Group 
will continue to target net debt in the 
range of 1x to 2x EBITDA, consistent 
with investment grade credit metrics. 
Due to the continuing strong cash 
generation of the Group and after taking 
into account the excellent opportunities to 
invest in organic growth and acquisitions, 
the Board considers that the Group has 
surplus cash resources available. The Group 
will now commence a £250 million share 
buyback programme with the intention to 
complete this within the next 12 months.
Leadership and people
During the year there have been a number 
of changes to the Non Executive Directors 
serving on the Board. In November 
2013, Andrew Duff stepped down from 
the Board after nine years of service as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. 
Michael Clarke also stepped down in March 
2014 to take up a new executive role based 
in Australia, having served on the Board 
since March 201 1. Finally, in July 2014, we 
also announced that Michael Wareing will be 
stepping down at this year’s AGM after over 
ﬁve years’ service. I would like to thank them 
all for their dedicated service and signiﬁcant 
contributions to Wolseley and I wish them 
well for the future.
Over the past three years I, alongside my 
colleagues on the Nominations Committee, 
have sought to ensure that the right balance 
of skills and breadth of experience are 
reﬂected on the Board. In particular, we 
wanted to enhance the Board’s retail and 
international experience and ensure we had 
successors for the Chairmanship of the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees.
The retirement of former Non Executive 
Directors has afforded the opportunity to 
augment the strength of our Board and we 
conducted a thorough search to identify the 
following new members. On 1 May 2014, 
Darren Shapland joined the Board as a 
Non Executive Director, having previously 
been Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of J Sainsbury 
plc. Darren will succeed Michael Wareing 
as Chair of the Audit Committee following 
the AGM in November. On 21 May 2014, 
John Daly and Jacky Simmonds joined 
the Board as Non Executive Directors. 
John has over three decades of business 
and management experience, including the 
last 14 years with British American Tobacco 
plc in a variety of senior leadership roles 
running large international businesses. 
Jacky is a highly experienced HR 
professional in the international retail and 
leisure industry. She is currently Group HR 
Director of TUI Travel plc, one of the world’s 
leading leisure travel companies, a role she 
has held since 2010. In July 2014, Jacky 
took over from Alan Murray as Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee. 
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all of our colleagues throughout 
Wolseley for the tremendous efforts made 
by everyone to deliver the results this year, 
in what continues to be a very exciting 
period for the Group. It is their continuing 
commitment and focus to deliver great 
service to our customers which enables 
the delivery of substantial progress for the 
Group as a whole.

Growing markets
Demand for our products may be inﬂuenced by macroeconomic 
factors such as GDP , unemployment and consumer conﬁdence. 
Other key factors supporting long-term growth in the 
markets are as follows:
Population growth
Growth of 1 per cent per year is expected in the 
USA in the next decade. Population is expected to 
grow in almost all the countries we operate in. 
Source: United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
Ageing housing stock
The median age of homes in the USA is 40 years. 
There is high demand for repairs, maintenance 
and improvement in the large installed base of 
existing homes. 
Source: US Dept. Of Housing and Urban Development.
Increased comfort levels in homes
85 per cent of new homes in the USA have two or 
more bathrooms. There is a trend towards increasing 
levels of comfort in homes.

Our industry
The distribution of plumbing and 
heating and building materials 
principally to trade customers. The key 
characteristics of our industry are:
Many customers
The customer base is fragmented. Wolseley services 
approximately 1 million customers across the Group.
Customers’ needs are local
Professional contractors typically operate within about 
20 miles of a local branch and may visit it several times 
per week. In addition to visiting branches they are now 
using emerging channels such as e-commerce which 
complement their working patterns.
Large vendor base
The vendor base is large. Wolseley distributes the 
products of approximately 50,000 vendors across 
the world.
Clear need for distributors in the 
supply chain
Distributors bridge the gap between the large vendor 
base and the large and geographically dispersed 
professional customer base.
Highly fragmented industry 
with no market dominated 
by a single player
Our markets are typically highly fragmented, 
with few large players in the industry.
Beneﬁts of scale
Due to scale beneﬁts market leaders can perform 
better through the economic cycle.
We operate in attractive markets…

Our business
We hold leading positions in many of the markets in which we operate. 
Our knowledge, coverage and scale enable us to operate efﬁciently 
and provide a high level of service to our customers.
A large proportion of our businesses are 
market leaders in their local markets, 
and 81 per cent of the Group’s revenue 
is generated by businesses which are 
number one or two in their markets.
57 per cent of the Group’s revenue in 
2013/14 was derived from RMI markets.
Whilst many of our businesses are 
the number one or two players, their 
respective markets are reasonably 
fragmented. This provides signiﬁcant 
opportunities to grow our business 
through a combination of organic 
expansion and acquisitions.
Our resilient gross margins have averaged 
between 27 per cent and 28 per cent 
over the last eight years despite changes 
in the economic environment.

Performance
I am pleased to report a good overall result 
in 2013/14 against a backdrop of good 
market conditions in the USA and continued 
weak demand in Europe and Canada. 
The standout performance was the USA 
where we achieved a record 7 .7 per cent 
trading margin, strongly outperforming 
the markets in all of our major segments. 
Like-for-like revenue growth in the UK was 
lower as we continued to protect gross 
margins. We faced economic headwinds 
in Continental Europe and here we have 
taken further action to lower operating 
costs. Our strong balance sheet means 
we have continued to invest in technology 
and processes to develop more efﬁcient

Group strategy and 
business model
Our strategy is unchanged and you can 
read about our progress this year in the rest 
of this Strategic report. Over recent years we 
have embedded the process of allocating 
capital for investment to those businesses 
capable of generating the best returns for 
shareholders. For example, a signiﬁcant 
proportion of investment is now being 
allocated to our USA operations where we 
have strong, market-leading businesses 
with considerable growth opportunities in 
large, fragmented markets. We have also 
continued to develop detailed business unit 
strategies with the objective of accelerating 
proﬁtable growth in these businesses. 
This is now working well, although outside 
of the USA where market conditions have 
been much slower to recover, we have not 
made enough progress to date.
In each country our management teams 
have signiﬁcant opportunity to develop 
our businesses depending on market 
conditions. In the USA, for example, 
where the market has been growing, this 
year we have continued to drive above 
market revenue growth and gross margin 
improvements. However, in the Nordic 
region, Central Europe and France, where 
markets have been tough, we are focusing 
on holding market share and protecting 
gross margins and controlling operating 
costs tightly. We are working very hard to 
improve customer service to gain a greater 
share of our existing customers’ business. 
We are also looking at ways to improve how 
we manage our sales teams to win new 
customers and to provide a more responsive 
service to our existing customers.

Investment
This year we have stepped up capital 
investment to a total of £201 million 
(2012/13: £140 million), a signiﬁcant 
proportion of which was invested in the 
development of more efﬁcient business 
models. This has included new distribution 
centres and distribution hubs to support 
our expansion plans. We have also invested 
in the branch network, including 26 new 
branches, supporting showroom expansion 
and branch refurbishments. You can read 
more about our progress in this important 
element of our strategy on pages 18 to 25.
All of our businesses are developing 
technology, process and network 
infrastructure to help us become more 
productive. This year this included the 
successful implementation of new core 
ﬁnancial systems in the UK, a new European 
data centre, major telecoms and network 
upgrades in the UK and the USA and 
master data and middleware projects to 
support our business model development 
initiatives. In 2014/15, we expect capital 
expenditure to be in the region of 
£200 million to £220 million as we continue 
to invest in these transformational projects.

The associated incremental operating 
costs will be approximately £30 million. 
Shareholders rightly expect our investments 
to generate appropriate returns and this is 
assessed as part of a rigorous investment 
appraisal process. It is also worth bearing 
in mind that some projects are updating 
systems infrastructure, which will support 
the business for many years to come.

investment in new business models
Bolt-on acquisitions 
and disposals
As well as organic expansion we have 
many opportunities to deploy capital on 
bolt-on acquisitions. During the year, we 
acquired eight businesses with annualised 
revenue of £444 million. These were small 
bolt-ons in our existing geographies that 
will be integrated rapidly into our strong 
businesses to yield good cost synergies 
and deliver attractive returns. We would 
expect that in the coming year we will be 
able to invest £200 million to £300 million on 
acquisitions. However, we will only acquire 
businesses which are appropriately priced 
and clearly support our strategic objectives. 
At the same time, we will also maintain a 
conservative, but efﬁcient, balance sheet, 
with investment grade credit metrics. 
During the year we announced the exit of 
the Cheapy DIY business in Sweden and 
the ÖAG plumbing and heating business in 
Austria. In addition, we recently announced 
that we are reviewing exit options for the 
future of the ISB wood solutions business 
in France.
See pages 26 to 35 for more about this 
year’s acquisitions
Sustainability
We have made good progress in 
several components of the sustainability 
programme this year. A robust health and 
safety programme protects our workforce, 
whilst improving productivity and we made 
good progress reducing our lost workday 
rate by 2.8 per cent. However, the vehicle 
collision rate increased slightly by 0.2 per 
cent this year and that is disappointing. 
We have mitigating actions in place to deliver 
a better performance going forward. 
Over the last two years Wolseley has also 
succeeded in reducing carbon emissions 
by 7 .3 per cent and the tonnage of waste 
sent to landﬁll by 18.0 per cent (both per 
£ million of revenue generated). In order 
to achieve this, the businesses have 
implemented many projects, not least an 
8,000 solar panel installation on the roof of 
our largest distribution centre in the UK in 
Royal Leamington Spa, which will more than 
account for its power needs and achieve 
carbon savings of around 1,280 tonnes 
a year. 
See pages 48 to 53 for more about our 
sustainability programme
Looking ahead
The overall like-for-like revenue growth rate 
for the Group since the beginning of the new 
ﬁnancial year has been broadly in line with 
the fourth quarter of 2013/14. 
Overall we expect the Group’s like-for-like 
revenue growth rate for the ﬁrst six months 
of the new ﬁnancial year to be about 
5 per cent.
Our people
Our achievements are, of course, down to 
the people who work for Wolseley. So on 
behalf of the Executive team I would like 
to thank all of my Wolseley colleagues for 
their continued dedication and commitment 
to our customers. We have much work to 
do in the years ahead, but we continue 
to approach this with a growing sense of 
optimism and an absolute sense of purpose.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014 14
Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information
Most of our business requires local market knowledge and service 
to be successful. Therefore, in each region our strategy is executed 
at business unit level. We use our value creation model (opposite) 
to drive performance, the output from which is a set of proﬁt levers 
which we use to drive like-for-like revenue growth, improve our 
market share and grow our gross margins in conjunction with an 
efﬁcient cost base. The principal proﬁt levers are outlined below, 
although given different local conditions the focus may be shifted 
somewhat between these priorities over time. Ultimately, many small 
improvements generate good performance in our business. 
Gain market share Expand gross margins
Our goal is to deliver long-term, sustainable, 
proﬁtable growth
Accelerate proﬁtable growth – business unit strategy
Each business unit aims to grow its gross margin through a 
range of actions including consistent pricing, better sourcing, 
and increasing the mix of higher margin and own label products 
we sell. 
Key proﬁt levers
Pricing
We are adjusting our business model to ensure that we charge 
appropriately for the value we provide for our customers. 
For example, in several countries we have moved to regional 
or national job quotation centres so we can price contracted 
business consistently and accurately. 
Sales mix
Sales, customer and product mix all affect gross margins. 
For example, showrooms and over-the-counter sales achieve 
higher overall gross margins than large projects. By actively 
managing this mix we can positively impact gross margins.
Sourcing and category management
Sourcing and supplier relationships are also critical for 
managing and improving gross margins. Through embedding 
category management into our business, or moving where 
appropriate to low cost country sourcing, we drive scale 
beneﬁts. By strengthening strategic supplier partnerships 
we can better leverage our scale while also serving our 
customers’ needs.
In the USA, we continue to focus on developing our national network of 
showrooms which is the highest gross margin channel. During the year, 
revenue generated by the showroom channel grew strongly.
Each business unit aims to grow market share faster than 
the competition through gaining a greater share of its existing 
customers’ business and through attracting new customers. 
Key proﬁt levers
Customer service
In all of our business units we strive to deliver above-market 
like-for-like growth through offering the best customer service. 
Customers value superior service and are often prepared to 
pay a little more for it – there is a strong correlation in a branch 
between high customer service scores and good ﬁnancial 
performance. We measure customer service in every branch 
and focus on improving the most important factors valued by 
our customers. These include: speed of service; range and 
availability of a wide basket of products; and knowledgeable, 
well trained employees. 
Organic growth 
We aim to grow our revenue organically through targeted 
branch expansion, offering multiple order channels, and through 
expansion into adjacent business segments. 
Bolt-on acquisitions
While organic growth remains our priority, we complement our 
organic growth strategy with bolt-on acquisitions which are 
rapidly integrated into our network to deliver attractive returns.
In Finland, we recently acquired Puukeskus, a leading building 
materials business. We are now integrating it with our Starkki business. 
The acquisition enabled us to access several new metropolitan districts 
in Finland and the combined business is now one of the largest trade 
suppliers in the country.

Value creation model
Improve productivity
Each business unit aims to improve productivity through 
leveraging beneﬁts of scale and operating a more efﬁcient 
business model. 
Key proﬁt levers
E-commerce
Today our customers want more ﬂexible ways of doing business 
with us which presents both challenges and opportunities. 
For example, we now offer the majority of our customers 
e-commerce channels, which is enabling them to do business 
with us 24/7 but is also driving greater productivity in our 
business units and lowering our cost to serve. 
Beneﬁts of scale
Business units that have national scale and strong market 
positions can share resources to improve productivity. 
For example, in some regions we have introduced more ﬂexible 
work patterns, better matching labour activity to fulﬁlling the peaks 
and troughs of customer demand throughout a working day. 
Branch of the future 
Historically, we have developed our branches to be standalone 
businesses. We are now increasingly reviewing activities 
undertaken in a branch and centralising those activities where 
we can drive the greatest scale beneﬁts. For example, in the USA 
we are now pooling branch resources in a region in functions 
such as sales management, deliveries and logistical planning 
which is driving signiﬁcant improvements in productivity.
In the UK, we continue to improve our branch productivity. At our busiest 
time of the day, we have implemented a “golden trading period” where 
all branches are solely focused on serving customers. All deliveries and 
internal administrative requests are handled in quieter periods. We are 
also gradually changing our stafﬁng mix to include more part-time work 
so that we have a more ﬂexible labour model. 
Each business unit aims to generate strong cash ﬂow with 
disciplined working capital management and investment in 
our core business. 
Key proﬁt levers
Trading margins
We aim to convert incremental revenue strongly to trading proﬁt, 
leveraging the ﬁxed costs of the business. Over the long term, 
we expect our businesses to generate ﬂow-through (deﬁned 
as incremental trading proﬁt divided by incremental revenue) 
of more than 10 per cent.
Investment and return on capital
All signiﬁcant investments made by our businesses are 
assessed using a rigorous investment appraisal process and 
are supported by a business case. Each investment must offer 
an attractive return on investment above the weighted average 
cost of capital of the Company and/or should improve the 
quality and efﬁciency of the business for the future.
Working capital efﬁciency
All of our business units aim to utilise working capital efﬁciently 
and convert proﬁts strongly to cash. Each business unit has 
performance management targets for receivables, payables 
and inventory, with an overall target to reduce cash-to-cash 
days each year.
In the USA, we have invested in a new distribution centre in the Ohio 
region. This will allow us to redistribute activity from our other distribution 
centres to optimise operating efﬁciency and to increase capacity which 
will help support future growth. The running costs of the new distribution 
centre are more than offset by annualised savings in freight and labour 
costs at other distribution centres and therefore the investment offers a 
very attractive return on capital.

Major change initiatives
Current performance initiatives include 
new segmentation models to meet the 
needs of speciﬁc types of customers 
more efﬁciently and new pricing models 
to ensure we capture appropriate value at 
the point of sale. We are also investing in 
our e-commerce channels as customers 
increasingly choose to do business with 
us online. We are trialling new models to 
optimise sales management, in particular 
maximising revenue opportunities from 
our existing customer relationships as well 
as attracting new customers.
Example: segmentation
Historically, Wolseley has operated a high 
service and high cost model for the majority 
of our customers, with unrestricted access 
to all our sales order and fulﬁlment channels. 
We are now beginning to use customer 
segmentation models which better reﬂect 
customer needs and offer them ﬂexibility 
in how they want to do business with us 
while optimising our operating costs. 
How are we changing it?
Our customers vary in size and type 
and consequently have different service 
requirements. For example, large 
commercial and industrial customers 
often need a dedicated salesperson 
who understands their requirements 
well and visits their project sites regularly. 
These customers rarely need access 
to the branch network. Small plumbing 
companies, however, use the branch 
regularly and often need speciﬁc advice and 
a high level of interaction with branch staff. 
Consequently, we are introducing segmented 
models to better match sales and order 
channels to customer requirements. 
In the UK, we have 
created eight customer 
segments based on 
their size and business 
type, service needs, 
and transactional 
behaviour. 
Two of the segments are “Super 
and National Accounts” and “Small 
Plumbing and Heating Generalist” 
and they have different needs in many 
areas of service, for example:

contractor may often be tendering for 
work so may want lower pricing for 
higher volumes than a local plumber 
ﬁxing an emergency repair, who may 
value immediate product availability 
over price;

collect from our branches much 
more frequently than a large national 
contractor, who may prefer direct 
delivery to the job site; and

contractor may value a consistent 
point of contact across the country 
whereas a local plumber may 
rely on their relationship with local 
branch employees.

The majority of sourcing is carried out by 
central teams in each geography as scale 
advantages are predominantly derived 
nationally. Some sourcing is carried out 
locally in branches, particularly when 
sourcing non-standard products, which 
in some geographies can be a signiﬁcant 
proportion of revenues generated. 
Major change initiatives
Current performance initiatives include 
optimising the major categories of products 
we sell and focusing on fewer suppliers to 
consolidate spend. We are also looking at 
how we ensure suppliers pay appropriately 
for access to our large scale distribution 
network and how we optimise the 
opportunity to drive further scale beneﬁts 
from low-cost country sourcing initiatives.
Example: low-cost country 
sourcing
While sourcing is predominantly undertaken 
in each business unit or nationally, some 
international sourcing beneﬁts exist. 
For example, some categories of private 
label products are sourced from low-cost 
countries and distributed internationally 
to Wolseley businesses. We work in 
partnership with our third-party suppliers 
in low-cost countries who value our scale 
and geographical reach.
While there has been some consolidation 
in spend in low-cost country sourcing, 
many regions still source some categories 
of products independently and there is an 
opportunity to drive further beneﬁts through 
greater co-ordination of these activities.
How are we changing it?
We want to ensure we maximise the scale 
beneﬁts from all Group purchasing activities 
arising from low-cost countries. In addition, 
as these activities grow, we want to ensure 
we have stronger management of, for 
example, quality assurance and quality 
control activities to ensure a more reliable 
service to the customer.
Building long-term supplier relationships
Drive evolution of our business models 
In May 2014, we 
completed the 
acquisition of our 
Taiwan-based 
sourcing agent. 
Wolseley has had a trading relationship 
with a Taiwanese-based sourcing agent 
for over 20 years and the USA and 
Canada already source a proportion 
of imported products through them. 
Giving us access to over 200 vendors 
across Taiwan, China, Thailand, 
Indonesia and Korea, the acquisition will 
enable us to operate an efﬁcient single 
sourcing platform for all our globally 
imported products to maximise the 
beneﬁts of scale.
We will create a single platform to 
coordinate all of our global sourcing 
activities for products sourced in the 
Far East and other low-cost countries. 
We will offer a full menu of sourcing-
related services to all Wolseley’s 
business units including sourcing, 
quality assurance and quality control, 
as well as managing product defects 
or recall issues with manufacturers.

Our supply chain allows us to better serve 
customers through ﬂexible delivery options, 
broader product ranges, improved product 
availability, as well as enabling the Group 
to better manage inventory. 
Our plumbing and heating businesses, 
for example, operate through a network 
of regional distribution centres. 
Manufacturers deliver in bulk to our 
distribution centres which, through our 
large vehicle ﬂeet, supply both our branch 
network and some customers through 
direct deliveries. The scale of our supply 
chain network means that we can offer 
our customers high levels of product 
availability for up to 1 million products 
when they need them. 
Our supply chain and logistics know-how 
enables customers to choose the most 
appropriate delivery method for each order.

Major change initiatives
Current performance initiatives include 
further improvements to availability of 
the most common products required 
by customers in the branch. In addition, 
we are ensuring we can meet the needs 
of our customers for delivery in the most 
cost effective and efﬁcient way.
Example: supply chain
The Group uses a range of transport 
solutions in each of its businesses including 
its own extensive ﬂeet and third-party 
delivery services. The Group uses ﬂeet 
management systems and backhauling 
arrangements to maximise the efﬁciency 
of its transport network and minimise its 
environmental impact. Typically, each 
branch manages outbound logistics 
including customer delivery, which may 
involve operating a number of trucks 
depending on the size of the branch.
How are we changing it?
We have introduced distribution hubs into 
some parts of our network, particularly in 
areas where we have a high concentration 
of branches. Where we operate distribution 
hubs it enables us to more efﬁciently 
plan outbound logistics across an entire 
region rather than by branch. It also 
enables us to hold higher inventory in the 
hub for same day delivery than would 
be possible operating through individual 
branches. The branches are also freed 
up from managing logistics to focus on 
sales and delivering customer service 
and as centres for customer pick up or 
click and collect offerings.

In the Nordic region, 
a time and motion 
study has shown 
that our branch 
employees were 
spending approximately 
40 per cent of their 
time on customer-
facing activities.
We have targeted to increase that to 
60 per cent by removing unnecessary 
processes, sharing resources better 
between branches, implementing hubs 
where appropriate, and transferring 
some processes to centralised 
head ofﬁces.
Our aim is to limit non-sales activity 
in our branches and reinvest that time 
to give us proportionately more time 
to serve our customers’ needs.
With 2,878 branches across 
10 countries, Wolseley is 
an international group with 
local business operations.
Typically, the Group’s customers travel 
less than 20 miles to a branch and we 
rely on the strength of our operations in 
each local market and the knowledge of 
our employees in the branches to meet 
our customers’ needs. While customers 
are increasingly demanding a 24/7 multi-
channel experience, the branch remains an 
important order and fulﬁlment channel for 
our customers. Many customers visit the 
branch several times a week to pick up and 
order products and to get advice from local 
counter staff who know their business well.

Major change initiatives
Current performance initiatives include 
improving information systems to more 
efﬁciently process transactional data in 
a branch and we are also modernising 
our branch layouts, our technology and 
infrastructure to provide a faster, more 
efﬁcient service to customers which at 
the same time lowers our cost to serve.
Example: cost management 
Branches have historically been highly 
decentralised, responsible for a wide 
range of day-to-day activities such as 
sales, sourcing, logistics and deliveries, 
and pricing. Branches are then supported 
by centralised functions which perform 
functions such as ﬁnance, marketing, IT 
and human resources. In recent years we 
have been progressively moving to more of 
a managed network of branches to ensure 
we capture beneﬁts of scale but also free 
up the branch staff to focus on serving our 
customers and driving sales.
How are we changing it?
We are now reviewing which activities 
should be executed at branch level and 
identifying those that can be centralised 
or shared between branches. For example, 
in the USA, we are now pooling sales teams 
into regional hubs which has resulted in 
better customer service and calls being 
handled faster by more knowledgeable 
employees. We are also introducing sales 
planning across the network, rather than by 
branch, so that we better match customers 
with sales personnel and remove areas of 
cost duplication.
We are stepping up investment in 
transaction processing, including better 
telephony and faster internet connectivity. 
The new business model will improve 
productivity through process improvements, 
and will free up branch staff to focus on 
customer service and increase capacity 
in branches through greater efﬁciency.

Ferguson is the market leading distributor of 
plumbing supplies in the USA. The market 
positions of the main business units are 
estimated as follows:
Market position
Blended Branches 1
Waterworks 2
Industrial 3
HVAC 3
Ferguson has no direct competitor that 
operates across all its markets; each 
business unit has its own competitors. 
These range from large national 
competitors, including trade sales by 
large home improvement chains, to 
single branch operations. 
The market remains fragmented with a large 
number of small and regional distributors 
making up the majority of the market.
Ferguson has continued to gain market 
share in the year, growing sales signiﬁcantly 
ahead of the market, by outperforming the 
competition. Ferguson has achieved this 
through a relentless focus on customer 
service, achieving very high customer 
service scores.

Operating performance
In the USA, revenue was 8.2 per cent ahead 
of last year on a like-for-like basis and the 
trading margin of 7 .7 per cent (2013: 7 .3 
per cent) was a record. Price deﬂation 
was 0.7 per cent principally due to falling 
commodity prices. Acquisitions contributed 
1. 1 per cent of additional revenue growth. 
The RMI market continued to grow steadily 
while growth in the new residential market 
remained modest. The commercial segment 
was more positive. Blended Branches 
continued to grow strongly across all main 
regions of the USA beneﬁting from growing 
markets and also good market share 
gains. Waterworks grew very strongly, also 
gaining market share. The HVAC, Fire and 
Fabrication and Industrial PVF businesses all 
generated good growth. Build.com and our 
B2B e-commerce channels continued to 
grow strongly and accounted for 16 per cent 
of total revenue.
Gross margins improved across all business 
units. Operating expenses were 10 per 
cent higher than last year at constant 
exchange rates and included £15 million 
from acquisitions, £10 million of increased 
healthcare costs, and £13 million of 
additional investment in new business 
models. Exchange rate movements were 
unfavourable and reduced trading proﬁt by 
£23 million. Trading proﬁt of £542 million 
(2013: £490 million) was 16. 1 per cent ahead 
of last year at constant exchange rates.
Four bolt-on acquisitions were made during 
the year with total annualised revenue of 
£184 million. These were Karl’s Appliances 
and Factory Direct Appliance, both electrical 
appliance businesses, Waterworks 
Industries, a water meter business, and 
HP Products, a maintenance, repair and 
operations business. Since the year end we 
have also acquired Pollard Water, an online 
Waterworks business, which has annualised 
revenue of £9 million.
We added seven new branches in the 
year with an additional 24 coming from 
acquisitions. Headcount growth was 7 .4 per 
cent with more than half of all headcount 
additions from acquisitions. 
National Sales Center 
continues to grow
The National Sales Center (“NSC”) is 
a team of almost 200 employees who 
serve property management, hospitality, 
government, national accounts, master 
distribution markets and service 
warranty issues. NSC employees 
support businesses and customers 
nationwide from a call centre in 
Virginia. The NSC provides customers 
with a single point of contact where 
they receive immediate assistance 
to place an order or receive product 
and warranty information. The NSC is 
designed to serve different parts of our 
business including:
 our growing Facilities Maintenance 
business needs a central point of 
contact, a rapid response and broad 
expertise across a wide variety 
of sectors;
 providing a national service including 
companies supplying emergency 
water heaters and HVAC equipment; 
 supporting our industrial plastics 
division and tool rental programme, 
facilitating business across the 
entire USA;
 supporting many non-traditional 
national accounts that are in the retail 
sector that require a single point of 
contact. Examples include national 
restaurant chains and shopping malls; 
and
 the NSC can also take calls when 
branches are very busy giving us 
ﬂexibility in branch manning levels.
The call centre is growing and will 
relocate to a new 45,000 square-foot 
ofﬁce space later this year. There are 
plans to grow the NSC team to 350 
employees by 2015.  Wolseley plc

Operating performance
Like-for-like revenue declined 0.8 per cent 
in the year with negligible price inﬂation. 
Market conditions varied across the region, 
with continued growth in the West offsetting 
weakness in Quebec. Blended Branches 
grew modestly and the Waterworks business 
was weaker, with both business units holding 
market share in the year. The industrial 
valves business made good progress in a 
challenging market. Gross margins were 
slightly ahead of last year and operating 
expense growth was restricted to less than 
1 per cent at constant exchange rates 
including £2 million of additional investment 
in new business models. We added three 
new branches in the year and headcount of 
2,503 was 0.3 per cent lower than last year. 
Exchange rate movements reduced trading 
proﬁt by £5 million, so reported trading proﬁt 
of £44 million was £7 million behind last 
year. The trading margin was 5.6 per cent 
(2013: 5.8 per cent).  Wolseley plc

Quarterly GDP growth in the UK has 
improved throughout 2013/14 reaching 
3 per cent in the ﬁrst calendar quarter of 
2014, a level of growth not seen in the UK 
since the end of 2007 , though RMI markets 
have grown less strongly than new build 
markets. Consumer conﬁdence has been 
rising although remained negative for the 
majority of 2013/14.
Operating performance
In the UK, like-for-like revenue declined 
0. 1 per cent in the year, including 0.7 per 
cent price inﬂation. Acquisitions contributed 
5. 1 per cent of additional revenue growth. 
New residential construction, which 
represents approximately 7 per cent of UK 
revenue, continued to grow strongly but 
growth in residential RMI markets, which 
represents approximately 54 per cent of 
UK revenue, remained modest. In Plumbing 
and Heating we declined some very low 
margin sales to protect our gross margins. 
Overall like-for-like revenue was ﬂat and 
we lost some market share in the second 
half. Pipe and Climate Center revenue was 
slightly lower though our Utilities business 
continued to grow well.
Gross margins were ahead in Plumbing and 
Heating and Pipe and Climate Center as we 
focused on protecting our gross margins 
in a challenging pricing environment. 
Overall gross margins were slightly lower 
as a result of the mix impact of Burdens. 
Operating expenses were 5 per cent higher 
than last year and included £15 million 
from acquisitions, £6 million of additional 
investment in new business models, a 
£2 million bad debt incurred in the ﬁrst 
quarter and £2 million of acquisition costs. 
We received clearance from the 
Competition and Markets Authority for the 
acquisition of Fusion Provida, a supplier 
of utility infrastructure products, which 
we announced in June. The acquisition 
has annualised revenue of £55 million.
We closed seven branches in the 
year and added 10 from acquisitions. 
Headcount was well controlled and 
increased 0.4 per cent including the addition 
of 195 from acquisitions. Trading proﬁt of 
£96 million was £1 million ahead of last year.
The trading margin was 5.2 per cent

Housing starts in Denmark have remained 
at historically low levels throughout 2013/14 
and although construction industry 
conﬁdence has improved slightly during 
the year, it has remained negative. 
Operating performance
In the Nordic region, revenue was 0.4 
per cent ahead of last year on a like-for-
like basis, including 0.9 per cent price 
inﬂation. Acquisitions contributed 4. 1 
per cent of additional revenue growth. 
Market conditions improved a little in 
Denmark where we achieved modest like-
for-like growth. We generated good growth 
in Sweden as the economy continued to 
recover but like-for-like revenue declined 
in Finland where market conditions remain 
very challenging. The major business units 
maintained their market leading positions. 
Gross margins were ahead of last year 
before the dilutive impact of the Puukeskus 
acquisition. Operating expenses increased 
by 6 per cent at constant exchange rates 
and included £12 million from acquisitions, 
£3 million for non-recurring restructuring 
charges and £6 million of additional 
investment in new business models. 
Two bolt-on acquisitions were made during 
the year with total annualised revenue 
of £205 million. These were Perssons 
Byggcentrum, a two-branch building 
materials distribution business in Sweden, 
and Puukeskus, a building materials 
distribution business in Finland. 
During the year we exited “Cheapy”, a small 
retail DIY chain in Sweden. Some of the 
branches were redeployed into Beijer, our 
building materials business in Sweden, and 
the remaining branches have been sold. 
We added seven branches in the year with 
an additional 25 coming from acquisitions. 
Headcount was well controlled and 
increased 6.3 per cent including the addition 
of 501 from acquisitions. Exchange rate 
movements were unfavourable and reduced 
trading proﬁt by £2 million. Trading proﬁt for 
the ongoing business of £80 million was 
£9 million behind last year.
The trading margin for the ongoing 
businesses was 4.2 per cent 
(2013: 4.8 per cent). 
The markets in the Nordic region tend to 
be fragmented and there are opportunities 
to consolidate our market positions across

In the Central Europe and France region, 
France represents 65 per cent of revenue 
and is therefore the largest market for our 
business. Quarterly GDP growth in France 
has remained depressed at below 1 per 
cent throughout 2013/14. Switzerland is also 
an important market for our business and 
has seen GDP growth remain resilient at 
around 2 per cent throughout 2013/14.
Operating performance
In Central Europe and France, like-for-like 
revenue declined by 1.9 per cent in the 
year, including 0.7 per cent price inﬂation. 
Acquisitions contributed 1. 1 per cent of 
additional revenue growth. In Switzerland, 
the market remained weak and the strength 
of the Swiss Franc led to price deﬂation 
so like-for-like revenue was slightly lower. 
In the Netherlands, revenue was lower as 
the market remained challenging. In France, 
revenues declined due to contraction in the 
new residential construction market.
Gross margins were lower across the 
region as lower rebates were earned from 
reduced volumes. Operating expenses were 
held ﬂat and included £5 million from the 
full year impact of acquisitions made last 
year, £3 million of additional investment in 
new business models and £4 million non-
recurring restructuring charges. We closed 
three branches in the year and reduced 
headcount by 6.0 per cent. Trading proﬁt 
in the ongoing businesses was £34 million 
(2013: £46 million). 
We disposed of ÖAG in Austria during 
the year and the results of this business 
have been excluded from the results of the 
ongoing businesses.
The trading margin in the ongoing 
businesses was 2.8 per cent 
(2013: 3.7 per cent).
In May, we agreed to 
dispose of our ÖAG 
plumbing and heating 
business in Austria and, 
following competition 
clearance, the sale 
has completed. Wolseley plc

The Group’s ongoing businesses showed good like-for-like revenue growth of 4.2 per cent 
reﬂecting a great performance in the USA with like-for-like growth of 8.2 per cent offset by 
a weaker performance in Europe. Our operations in the USA improved market share in all 
of the key markets with particularly strong performances from the Blended Branches and 
Waterworks businesses. Our B2C business continued to grow and now represents 5 per 
cent of total US revenue.
We continued to focus on maintaining and improving gross margins which, at 28. 1 per cent, 
were 0.2 per cent higher than last year, driven by a strong performance in the USA and 
like-for-like improvements in UK and Canada.
The results of the Group reﬂect widely differing economic conditions across the regions and 
countries we trade in. During the year we maintained a sharp focus on operating expenses, 
particularly in countries where demand was weak. The Group’s trading margin increased 
from 5.8 per cent to 6.0 per cent with improved trading margins in the USA partially offset 
by reductions elsewhere. 
Trading proﬁt growth was 4. 1 per cent and would have been 8.6 per cent at constant currency. 
Foreign exchange rates impact
The Group reports its results in sterling though the most important trading currency is the 
US dollar which represents 55 per cent of the Group’s revenue. 1 1 per cent of revenue is 
denominated in euros and 6 per cent in Canadian dollars. The main currency exposure arises 
on the translation of overseas earnings into sterling. The Group does not hedge this exposure 
as these hedges have only temporary effect. The Group’s policy is to broadly match the 
currencies in which its debt is denominated to the currencies in which its trading proﬁts 
are generated.

Group’s accounting policies which were updated to reﬂect IAS 19 
(Revised) “Employee Beneﬁts” are set out on pages 1 10 to 1 12. 
New standards adopted for this ﬁnancial year are listed on page 1 10 
and did not have a material impact on the Group’s results in the year. 
Adoption of IAS 19 (Revised) “Employee Beneﬁts”, increased ﬁnance 
costs by £13 million in the prior year.

Revenue on a statutory basis fell slightly due to the disposal of a 
number of non-core businesses. The statutory result for 2013/14 
includes a net exceptional credit before tax of £19 million ( 2012/13: 
charge of £164 million). Excluding exceptional items, the proﬁt for the 
year increased by 1 1.4 per cent from £438 million to £488 million. 
Exceptional items in the current year are explained in more detail 
on the following page. As a result of these disposals the Directors 
decided to consolidate the results for Central Europe and France into 
one segment “Central Europe and France” given the operating proﬁt 
represents less than 10 per cent of the Group’s operating proﬁt and 
does not meet other quantitative thresholds. Additional information 
can be found in note 2 on pages 1 13 and 1 15. 
Finance costs
Net ﬁnance costs in the year amounted to £29 million compared with 
a prior year charge of £36 million, the reduction being principally due 
to lower pension interest charges. 
Earnings per share 
Total proﬁt after tax including discontinued operations was the same 
as proﬁt from continuing operations. Basic earnings per share were 
189.8 pence and diluted earnings per share were 188.8 pence, 
an increase of 76.7 per cent. Headline earnings per share based 
on trading proﬁt increased by 9.9 per cent from 178.5 pence to 
196.2 pence. 
Taxation 
The Group incurred a tax charge on proﬁt before discontinued 
operations of £194 million. Tax before non-recurring items, 
amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles, and exceptional 
items amounted to £204 million, which represents an effective rate of 
28. 1 per cent (2012/13: 28.6 per cent).
There are no signiﬁcant special tax incentives available to the Group 
that impact the tax charge such as research and development tax 
credits or patent box. Several factors are key to understanding the 
level of tax paid in each country in each year.
The Group has made substantial capital investments in assets over 
many years including in its various technology programmes, branch 
network and distribution centres. These investments are amortised 
in accordance with the laws relating to capital allowances in each 
country, including Part 2 CAA 2001 in the UK. As at 31 July 2014, 
capital allowances of £294 million are available to offset against 
future proﬁts in the UK. Wolseley plc

Financial review continued
Group companies sometimes generate losses. Where they can be 
relieved or carried forward to be relieved in future periods, the Group 
does so in accordance with the relevant law. In the UK, section 
457 CTA 2009 governs the utilisation of trading losses and as at 
31 July 2014, the UK has losses of £352 million available to offset 
against future proﬁts. Certain losses, particularly those related to 
impairments, cannot be relieved against taxable proﬁts. Over time 
this has had a substantial impact on the Group’s overall tax charge 
as a proportion of pre-tax proﬁts which has averaged 43.4 per cent 
over the last 10 years. 
The Group’s operations are international with 69 per cent of the 
Group’s trading proﬁts generated in the USA, 19 per cent in other 
overseas territories and 12 per cent generated in the UK, before 
central costs. Wolseley plc is incorporated in Jersey and is tax 
resident in Switzerland. The Group conducts its tax affairs in 
accordance with the law and arranges its tax affairs in line with its 
commercial activities. As such, it follows the terms of double taxation 
treaties and relevant OECD guidelines in dealing with issues such 
as transfer pricing and the establishment of a taxable presence, and 
the Group does not maintain an active tax presence in any country 
in which it does not trade. Other than intra-group ﬁnancing and the 
recharging of shared-service administrative costs, the Group has 
no signiﬁcant transfer pricing arrangements. The volume of trade 
between each of the Group’s businesses is not material and no 
material charges are levied for intangible assets such as intellectual 
property. As far as possible the Group simpliﬁes its legal and 
commercial structure in order to reduce risk and minimise ongoing 
costs, including fees to advisers. The simpliﬁcation of the Group’s 
corporate structure continued throughout the year with the relevant 
costs charged to trading proﬁt.
Reconciliation from the ongoing trading proﬁt

Losses from non-ongoing business
Revenue of £357 million and trading losses of £6 million arose 
from businesses which have been sold, closed or held for sale 
at 31 July 2014. A number of underperforming businesses in 
Central Europe and the Nordic region were sold during the year. 
In addition, we completed the disposal of several branches of our 
French building materials business which were held for sale last 
year. A small but proﬁtable non-core business in the USA is also 
included as held for sale at 31 July 2014. 
Amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles
At 31 July 2014, the Group had total goodwill and acquired 
intangibles of £1, 165 million and the associated amortisation charge 
for the year was £46 million (2012/13: £55 million). The Group 
reviews the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on an annual basis to determine whether any impairment should 
be recognised. This year the review included detailed value-in-use 
calculations and there was sufﬁcient headroom to demonstrate that 
goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired (2012/13: £9 million 
charge). There are three cash generating units (CGUs) in the Nordic 
region with limited headroom: Stark and Silvan in Denmark and 
Neumann in Norway. Whilst market conditions in Denmark and 
Norway remain challenging, the goodwill and intangible asset 
balances are recoverable based on current projections. If markets 
continue to deteriorate this could give rise to an impairment charge 
at a future date. The key assumptions used in the impairment 
review as well as sensitivities are disclosed in note 12 on pages 
121 and 122. Wolseley plc

Exceptional items
A net exceptional credit before tax of £19 million (2012/13: charge 
of £164 million) arose in the year. Exceptional items are presented 
within their relevant income statement category to assist in the 
understanding of the trading and ﬁnancial results of the Group. 
In addition management presents trading proﬁt, headline proﬁt and 
headline earnings per share excluding exceptional items to provide 
additional useful information on underlying trends to shareholders.

Other exceptional items 5 (43)
Total exceptional items before tax 19 (164)
Tax on exceptional items (3) 10
Exceptional items after tax 16 (154)
Acquisition and integration costs of £18 million relate to the 
acquisition of Puukeskus in Finland during the year and include 
onerous lease and redundancy costs linked to the closure 
of a number of branches as part of the integration plan. 
Gains on disposal are principally provision write-backs on deferred 
consideration received in the form of loan notes in previous years. 
In addition, we recognised accounting gains for the businesses 
sold in Central Europe and France, mainly due to the crediting 
of accumulated foreign exchange gains to the income statement 
on disposal. Other exceptional items include losses on closure 
of businesses which arose from impairment of assets on closure 
of branches in the Nordic region offset by gains on disposals of 
surplus properties in France of £1 1 million. These property sales 
were linked to the signiﬁcant restructuring programme in France last 
year. Further information can be found in note 4 on page 1 17 .

operations with cash generated from operations of £678 million

Acquisitions and capital expenditure
Acquisitions are an important part of our growth model and during 
the year we invested £194 million on eight bolt-on acquisitions in the 
USA, UK and the Nordic regions. 
Our strategy of investing in our business models is underlined 
by capital expenditure of £201 million (2012/13: £140 million) 
relating to strategic projects to support our future growth such 
as new distribution centres and distribution hubs and investment 
in technology, process and network infrastructure. 
As at 31 July 2014, the Group had total operating lease 
commitments of £788 million (2012/13: £868 million). 
Management continues to believe there is substantial capacity 
for revenue growth utilising the existing branch infrastructure and 
will remain cautious when considering new lease commitments for 
the foreseeable future. Additional information can be found in note 
34 on page 142.  Wolseley plc

Financial review continued
Dividends
Dividends, including the special dividend of £298 million 
(2012/13: £348 million), amounted to £489 million. A ﬁnal dividend 
of 55 pence per share, equivalent to £145 million is proposed. 
Share buyback programme
The Group is highly cash generative and the Board has established 
clear priorities for the utilisation of cash. In order of priority these are: 
(i)  to fund proﬁtable growth opportunities that meet the Group’s 
investment criteria;
(ii)  to fund ordinary dividends which should grow over the cycle 
consistent with the Group’s long-term growth rate;
(iii)  to fund bolt-on acquisitions where they meet the Group’s 
investment criteria; and 
(iv)  surplus cash will be returned to shareholders in the most 
appropriate way.
As at the date of this report the Board considers that it has cash 
available that is surplus to the Group’s current reinvestment 
needs and as such we propose to buy back shares worth up to 
£250 million within 12 months. 
Net debt
Net debt increased by £300 million to £71 1 million at 31 July 2014. 
The level of net debt at any point in time is affected by the working 
capital cycle and at 31 July 2014 net debt would have been 
approximately £90 million higher after taking into account short-term 
timing differences. Adjusting for these, net debt would be  
0.9 x EBITDA. 
Pensions
The UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan was closed for future 
accrual at 31 December 2013 and we have maintained our 
funding contributions in accordance with the agreed funding plan. 
The Group has adopted the revised pension accounting standard 
IAS 19 (Revised) in the year and restated the prior ﬁnancial year for 
comparability. At 31 July 2014, the Group’s net pension asset of 
£7 million (2012/13: liability of £133 million) is made up of aggregate 
gross assets of £1,384 million and gross liabilities of £1,377 million 
and the reduction is principally due to gains in the equity markets. 
IAS 19 (Revised) “Employee Beneﬁts” requires the Group to make 
assumptions including, but not limited to, rates of inﬂation, discount 
rates and current and future life expectancy. The value of the 
liabilities and assets could change materially if different assumptions 
were used. To help to understand the impact of changes in these 
assumptions we have included sensitivities as part of our pension 
disclosure in note 1 of the Group Financial Statements. Following the 
adoption of the revised accounting standard, administrative costs 
of running the UK pension scheme of £2 million are recorded in 
operating proﬁt in the current year as well as in the prior year. 
Other ﬁnancial matters
Capital structure
The Group’s sources of funding currently comprise operating cash 
ﬂow and access to substantial committed bank facilities from a 
range of banks and other ﬁnancial institutions. The Group maintains 
a capital structure appropriate for current and prospective trading 
and aims to operate with investment grade credit metrics and 
maximum net debt of 1 to 2 times EBITDA.
Liquidity 
The Group maintains sufﬁcient borrowing facilities to ﬁnance all 
investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan 
with an additional margin for contingencies. The Group aims to 
have a range of borrowings from different ﬁnancial institutions to 
ensure continuity of ﬁnancing. As at 31 July 2014, the Group had 
total committed facilities of £2, 197 million of which £1,360 million 
was undrawn. £1,509 million of the total facilities mature after more 
than two years. The Group is committed to renewing its facilities on 
a regular basis. Wolseley plc

Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information
Interest rates
The Group’s private placement bonds, with an outstanding par value 
of £393 million, have a hedged average ﬁxed rate of 2.6 per cent.
Financial risk management 
The Group is exposed to risks arising from the international nature 
of its operations and the ﬁnancial instruments which fund them. 
These instruments include cash, liquid investments and borrowings, 
and also items such as trade receivables and trade payables which 
arise directly from operations. The Group also enters into selective 
derivative transactions – principally interest rate swaps and forward 
foreign currency contracts – to reduce uncertainty about the amount 
of future committed or forecast cash ﬂows. The policies to manage 
these risks have been applied consistently throughout the year. It is 
Group policy not to undertake trading in ﬁnancial instruments or 
speculative transactions. 
Other ﬁnancial risks
The nature of the Group’s business exposes it to risks which are 
partly ﬁnancial in nature. Counterparty risk is the risk that banks 
and other ﬁnancial institutions which are contractually committed 
to make payments to the Group may fail to do so. Commodity risk 
is the risk that the Group may have purchased commodities which 
subsequently fall in value.
The Group manages counterparty risk by setting credit and 
settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties, which 
are approved by the Treasury Committee and monitored regularly. 
The Group manages convertibility risk by limiting its exposure to 
assets which, in the judgement of the Board, may become “illiquid” 
for any length of time. The management of credit and commodity 
risk is considered to be the responsibility of operational management 
and, in respect of these risks, the Group does not prescribe a 
uniform approach across the Group.
The Group’s principal risks (including strategic, operational, legal and 
other risks) are shown overleaf.
Going concern
The Group’s principal objective when managing cash and debt is to 
safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for the 
foreseeable future. The Group retains sufﬁcient resources to remain 
in compliance with the ﬁnancial covenant of its bank facilities.
The Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.

Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information
Our reshaped business portfolio, 
evolving business models and 
increasing levels of investment are 
gradually changing the Company’s 
risk proﬁle. The Board has considered 
the nature and extent of the risks it is 
willing to take in achieving the Group’s 
strategic objectives. These key risks, 
their level and trend are summarised 
in this section.
The materialisation of these risks could have an adverse effect on 
the Group’s results or ﬁnancial condition. If more than one of these 
risks occur, the combined overall effect of such events may be 
compounded. Various mitigation strategies are employed to reduce 
these inherent risks to an acceptable level – these are summarised 
on the following pages.
Some of these risks remain beyond the direct control of the 
Group and the risk management programme can only provide 
reasonable but not absolute assurance that risks are managed 
to an acceptable level.
The Group faces many other risks which, although important and 
subject to regular review, have been assessed as less signiﬁcant 
and are not listed here. These include, for example, major incidences 
of fraud, bribery or corruption or employee retention and motivation. 
Financial risks and their management are summarised between 
pages 36 and 41. Further information on Wolseley’s “People Strategy” 
can be found on page 49.

The Group’s results depend on the levels 
of activity in new construction and property 
repair and remodelling markets. Despite a 
stabilisation in macroeconomic conditions, 
construction activity and our business 
performance remain suppressed in key 
markets in Europe and in Canada and 
there remains a risk that this may continue. 
Factors inﬂuencing this risk include:
 the Company’s ability to identify and 
respond to market trends; to develop new 
business models and to manage costs, 
pricing and margins;
 the general rate of GDP growth;
 consumer conﬁdence;
 mortgage and other interest rates;
 the level of government initiatives to stimulate 
economic activity;
 inﬂation; and
 unemployment.
Some of these factors are out of the Group’s 
control and are difﬁcult to forecast.
Until markets in Europe and Canada recover, 
the Group is increasingly reliant on growth 
in the USA to drive its overall performance. 
A material issue in the USA could therefore 
affect the Group’s results more than in 
the past.
The Group cannot control market conditions but believes it 
has effective measures in place to respond to such events. 
Wolseley continues to reinforce existing measures in place, 
including:
 the development of our business models;
 cost control, pricing and gross margin management 
initiatives, including a focus on customer service and 
productivity improvement;
 planning, budgeting and forecasting processes;
 resource allocation processes;
 capital expenditure controls and procedures; and
 diversiﬁcation into other sectors which present new opportunities.
Risk management practices continue to be strengthened in 
all businesses.

Market conditions in many geographies 
remained highly competitive during the period 
under review. If not mitigated, this could lead 
to increased downward pressure on sales 
prices and proﬁt margins.
There is a risk that such competitive pressures 
will increase and could be exacerbated by 
factors such as the arrival of new competitors, 
customer or supplier consolidation, 
manufacturers shipping directly to customers, 
other changes in the route to market, and 
changes in technology.
There is a risk that the Company may not 
identify changes in market conditions and 
margins quickly enough.
The Group is accelerating the implementation of new business 
models and continues to improve its gross margin, pricing and cost 
management practices, which remain a priority for all businesses.
Sourcing and credit control measures have been strengthened. 
Management information is more detailed, timely and relevant 
as new information systems are being implemented across all of 
the Group’s key markets. For example, Wolseley UK successfully 
introduced a new core ﬁnancial system in March 2014.
We believe that high levels of customer service and product 
availability play a fundamental role in maintaining competitive 
advantage. The Group has continued with its programme of work 
to improve levels of customer service and inventory.

To respond to changing customer needs the 
Group is introducing new business models. 
This will involve the development of new 
technologies, updated ﬂexible employment 
patterns and different ways of working. 
The implementation of these models is now 
well underway in many of our key markets 
and will continue for several years.
The Group’s ability to successfully execute 
these changes, particularly in its European 
markets, will affect its ability to grow proﬁtably 
in the future.
The Group must successfully implement 
these changes without disrupting 
existing operations.
Programmes of work are deﬁned, resourced and implemented 
locally, according to customers’ needs and market conditions. 
Businesses undergoing the greatest change have dedicated 
programme and change management capability with 
associated KPIs.
The Board reviews progress during regular updates from the 
Group Chief Executive and as part of its six-monthly review of 
principal risks.
The Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer 
discuss progress with each business unit during regular 
performance reviews.
Each business unit has a clear strategy for continuously developing 
its business model and a deﬁned programme of work to execute 
the strategy.

The international nature of Wolseley’s 
operations exposes it to the potential for 
litigation from third parties, and such exposure 
is considered to be greater in the USA than 
in Europe.
Wolseley’s strengths include its employees, 
its products and the terms it negotiates with 
its suppliers. It is in these areas where the 
potential risk of litigation may be greatest.
Acquisitions and disposals and the 
restructuring of underperforming businesses 
may also give rise to litigation.
During the year, there has been no material 
change in the level of litigation to which 
the Group is exposed. For more information 
on speciﬁc litigation affecting the Group, 
see pages 1 1 1, 1 12, 131 and 142.
Levels of litigation are monitored by individual operating companies. 
A monthly report of potential exposures and current litigation is 
submitted by all businesses and reviewed by the Group Company 
Secretary and General Counsel.
The Company has assessed the level of product-related risk in 
all business units. Wolseley conducts due diligence on “high risk” 
products and suppliers and it is implementing improvements 
in contract terms. Insurance arrangements for product liability 
exposures have been reviewed and enhanced.
Internal audits of selected supplier contracts in the USA and France 
were completed during the year. The ﬁndings are being addressed.
In the case of claims related to exposure to asbestos, Wolseley 
continues to employ independent professional advisers to 
actuarially determine its potential gross liability. Wolseley has 
insurance which exceeds the current estimated liability relating 
to asbestos claims.

The security of important digital and physical 
assets, including data, technology systems, 
people and infrastructure is threatened by 
natural and man-made perils. For example:
 a greater proportion of the Group’s revenue 
is derived from e-commerce channels;
 the level and sophistication of IT security 
threats are increasing;
 some of the Group’s physical assets 
are located in areas exposed to natural 
catastrophe risks, including California and 
Florida in the USA;
 we remain reliant on a number of different 
technology systems across the Group, 
some of which have been operating for 
many years; and
 to optimise costs and supply chain 
efﬁciency, some companies within the 
Wolseley Group have also centralised their 
distribution network and are therefore 
reliant on a smaller number of larger 
distribution centres.
Core IT systems and data centres for the Group’s material 
businesses, including the Group’s principal e-commerce 
businesses, have documented disaster recovery plans which 
are tested annually.
During the year the Company introduced a pair of new European 
Data Centres, which incorporate high levels of protection 
and resilience.
The Group operates an IT governance framework including a full set 
of dedicated IT policies aligned to known security and operational 
risks. Speciﬁc operational controls for IT security include intrusion 
prevention and detection, penetration testing, remediation of 
wireless access issues, log and conﬁguration management and 
in-ﬂight projects to reduce the likelihood of an incident. The Group’s 
Chief Information Security Ofﬁcer has again undertaken a review 
of information security capabilities across the Group and identiﬁed 
additional mitigating actions to be implemented.
The loss of a physical site is naturally hedged by the diversiﬁed 
nature of our locations, customers and suppliers.
The Group has formally documented and tested plans for 
distribution centres, head ofﬁce buildings and data centres where 
the risk is considered to be greatest. For example, the Company’s 
wood solutions business in France comprehensively reviewed 
and improved its disaster recovery plans during 2013/14.
A comprehensive insurance programme is purchased, including 
coverage for “cyber” risks.
European Data Centres “go live”
Responding to increasing demands for high-performing and 
secure technology systems, Wolseley has introduced a pair of new 
European Data Centres (EDCs). Established risk management 
methodologies, including detailed risk assessments, roll-back 
plans, controls testing and external audits, were applied throughout 
the project to ensure its successful “go live”, as scheduled, on 
29 November 2013. 
A primary (co-located) data centre is backed up by a purpose-
built, Wolseley-owned secondary facility. Both the primary and 
secondary data centres are equipped with advanced digital 
and physical security, including the latest ﬁre suppression and 
biometric (facial recognition/ﬁngerprinting) access control systems. 
Comprehensive system fail-over and full disaster recovery 
plans have been put in place, and the Centres are designed 
for future expansion. 
The secondary EDC has a number of important environmental 
features. It is primarily powered by a solar panel array, which, 
along with automated lighting and monitoring of cooling systems, 
signiﬁcantly reduce Wolseley’s carbon impact and costs (see case 
study on page 52). Wolseley plc

The Group does not operate in a high-
risk industry with regard to health and 
safety. The nature of Wolseley’s operations 
can nevertheless expose its employees, 
contractors, customers, suppliers and other 
individuals to health and safety risks.
This risk has been included in the list of 
principal risks as a result of revised internal 
risk assessment criteria. The overall level 
of exposure has not increased.

The Group’s operations are affected by 
various statutes, regulations and laws in the 
countries and markets in which it operates. 
The amount of such regulation and the 
penalties can change.
While the Group is not engaged in a highly 
regulated industry, it is subject to the laws 
governing businesses generally, including laws 
relating to competition, product safety, data 
protection, labour and employment practices 
(including pensions), tax, international trade, 
fraud, bribery and corruption, land usage, the 
environment, health and safety, transportation, 
payment terms and other matters.
Building codes or particular tax treatments 
may affect the products Wolseley’s customers 
are allowed to use and, consequently, 
changes in these may affect the saleability 
of some Wolseley products.
The Group monitors regulations across its markets to ensure that 
the effects of changes are minimised and that we comply with all 
applicable regulation. For example:
 the Group is reviewing its data protection practices in 
anticipation of the forthcoming European Union General Data 
Protection Regulation;
 the Group continues to monitor and improve its anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption practices;
 face-to-face training on anti-competition law has taken place 
with higher risk employee groups; and
 in November 2013, the Group undertook a comprehensive 
review of its health and safety practices and a new minimum 
standard is being implemented.
Information on our ethics programme and legal compliance can 
be seen on page 50.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014 47
Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information
The Group’s system of risk management and internal control is built 
around the “lines of defence” concept. The Company reviews each 
principal risk against four levels of mitigation:
 1st level: line management implement corporate policies, 
procedures and controls in “front line” operations such as 
branches and distribution centres, sales and sourcing functions. 
Act in accordance with the Code of Conduct;
 2nd level: corporate functions design and monitor risks and 
controls, policies and procedures;
 3rd level: independent assurance functions (e.g. internal and 
external audit) undertake detailed testing of corporate functions 
and front-line operations; and
 4th level: the Board and its Committees receive risk and control 
data from all levels above.
The interaction of these levels is shown above.
Improvements in the system of risk management 
and internal control
During the year, the system described above has been 
strengthened through:
 continuous improvement in the quality of operating company 
risk reports, particularly risk assessment and action planning;
 introduction of improved policies and procedures in the areas 
of health and safety, product integrity and ﬁnancial control;
 more branch operational audits to improve the oversight of 
front-line operations;
 enhanced accuracy and frequency of risk data and other 
management information from front line operations; and
 closer coordination and planning between internal audit 
and corporate functions.

Sustainability
Governance 
Accountability: The overall programme 
is agreed by the Board and reviewed 
annually to ensure its ongoing relevance to 
business strategy, stakeholder expectations 
and international sustainability agendas. 
The Group’s Company Secretary and General 
Counsel is responsible to the Board for the 
overall sustainability programme. 
Implementation: With direction from the 
Board, the businesses deﬁne and execute 
local action plans according to their own 
particular level of development and the greatest 
opportunities for progress in line with strategy. 
The Group Risk, Compliance and Sustainability 
team oversees implementation. 
Managing performance: Objectives and, 
where appropriate, quantiﬁed targets are set 
for all sustainability programme components. 
For some focus areas, Group-wide KPIs have 
been deﬁned. KPIs have not been set for all 
elements of the programme as it is not always 
practical to bring distinct local methods under 
one uniﬁed metric. Improved performance is 
the primary goal. 
Monitoring performance: Specialist teams 
in each business monitor performance for 
their speciﬁc area of responsibility. The Group 
Risk, Compliance and Sustainability team 
monitor performance across all areas of the 
sustainability programme, with the exception 
of “Our people” (which is overseen by the 
Group HR function). Wolseley’s Internal 
Audit teams periodically test compliance 
with policy and adherence to procedures. 
Individual programme components receive 
frequent review and input by the Board and the 
Executive Committee.
Risk management: Non-ﬁnancial as well 
as ﬁnancial risks are assessed as part of the 
Group’s comprehensive risk management 
process. These include fraud, corruption, 
product quality, employee, health and safety 
and environmental risks. For further information 
on the Group’s risk management programme, 
see pages 42 to 47 .

Better business, sustainable growth
The Group’s sustainability programme 
shapes the way that we do business. 
It addresses Wolseley’s material 
sustainability concerns, mitigating the 
associated risks and offering business 
opportunities. The programme supports 
proﬁtable growth and underpins the 
business strategy. 
We deﬁned our seven material 
sustainability programme components in 
2012 following a comprehensive review 
with each business and with the Board. 
During 2013/14, the Board reconﬁrmed 
its commitment to these programme 
components and we have continued 
to make progress in these areas.

Progress against our objectives in 2013/14
Three key objectives for 2013/14 were to measure diversity and 
inclusion across the Group, to increase the movement of high-
potential employees across our business and to relaunch the 
executive leadership programme.
Mobility
The movement of high-potential employees across the business 
is a key component of our talent management programme, 
supporting the delivery of our strategy and accelerating the sharing 
of best practices across the Group. During 2013/14, both short 
and long-term international assignments of high-performing people 
have taken place with successful repatriation following completion 
of the assignments. This programme also supports diversity of 
thought as each placement brings together different cultures and 
business approaches.
Executive leadership programme
The top 100 leaders from across the Group completed a newly 
tailored Wolseley executive leadership programme hosted by the 
International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland. 
The programme is designed to enhance leadership capability 
and agility and provides valuable insight on how individual and 
collective styles and capabilities will impact Wolseley’s performance 
and success.
Diversity and inclusion
Over the last 12 months, good progress has been made on the 
diversity and inclusion agenda. Each business has strengthened 
the processes that it has in place to support improved diversity and 
inclusion. For example, cultural diversity has been improved at the 
Nordic region’s head ofﬁce through targeted recruitment and internal 
international assignments. A number of diversity measures are 
regularly tracked and gender diversity statistics are presented below. 
Our diversity and inclusion policy statement can be seen on page 76.

Human Rights
Both the United Nations Global Compact and Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights have been considered in determining the human rights 
issues that are material to Wolseley. These topics include employee 
policies (covering topics such as anti-discrimination and a right to 
collective bargaining), health and safety, ethics and conduct. All of these 
issues are managed through policies and programmes of work and are 
regularly monitored for compliance. Other human rights issues are not 
listed here as they are not material to Wolseley. Business partners and 
suppliers are expected to conform to Wolseley’s Code of Conduct.
UK employees double training hours
Wolseley UK employees have completed twice the number of 
online training courses compared to last year. 95 per cent of 
Wolseley UK’s employees improved their customer service skills 
by passing a bespoke customer service course. Health and 
safety awareness was also high on the training agenda with 
95 per cent of employees passing a new and updated Manual 
Handling module, to improve safety for themselves and their 
customers. Wolseley UK continues to work towards 100 per 
cent completion on these two compulsory courses.

Sustainability continued
Health and safety
Maximising opportunities
A robust health and safety 
programme protects 
our workforce, improves 
productivity by reducing the 
number of days lost to injury 
and enhances proﬁtability by 
reducing our liabilities.
Managing risks
The principal risks relate to 
manual handling, working at 
height, the use of motorised 
equipment and vehicle 
collisions. The Group 
has introduced improved 
standards to mitigate 
these risks.
Progress against our objectives in 2013/14
Our primary objectives for the year were to reduce our injury, lost 
workday and collision rates by 2 per cent and to introduce and 
implement a new Group minimum standard for health and safety.
Mixed performance against targets
The injury rate has been reduced by 8 per cent and the lost workday 
rate by 2.8 per cent during 2013/14. We regret to report that the 
Group collision rate has increased slightly (0.2 per cent). Actions are 
being taken to mitigate this increase, including enhanced policies 
and procedures for drivers of company vehicles and improved driver 
safety training programmes. 
Group minimum standard
A new Group minimum standard applicable to all Wolseley 
businesses was introduced in 2013/14. Full implementation will 
be complete by December 2014. The standard sets 43 minimum 
requirements. Some locations have gone further than the Group 
minimum standard and are already compliant with OHSAS 18001. 
All businesses were assessed against the OHSAS 18001 standard 
during the year to identify improvement opportunities beyond the 
Group minimum standard for the next two to three years.
Ethics and compliance
Maximising opportunities
Compliance with the letter 
and the spirit of the law 
and a commitment to high 
ethical standards strengthens 
our reputation with 
customers, suppliers and 
other stakeholders.
Managing risks
The business is exposed to 
risks of bribery and fraud. 
Non-compliance with 
governmental regulations 
is one of our principal risks. 
For more detail, see page 46.
Progress against our objectives in 2013/14
Our focus for 2013/14 was to continue to ensure that our compliance 
programmes in relation to fraud, bribery and corruption and antitrust 
laws are fully embedded in business practice. 
Face-to-face antitrust training
A refresher course on antitrust, delivered face-to-face by external 
experts, has been introduced in parts of the Group for employees 
with the highest potential exposure to antitrust risks. This training 
programme will continue throughout 2014/15.
Compliance training programmes
Employees joining the business since the major roll-out of the 
Group’s Code of Conduct, anti-bribery and corruption and antitrust 
training programmes were trained during 2013/14. All businesses 
continue to refresh these training programmes.
Whistleblowing
We continue to encourage our employees to report any incidents 
of non-compliance through our Group-wide conﬁdential reporting 
system, “Speak Up!”. Employees can disclose information in any 
language, conﬁdentially and anonymously via an international hotline, 
voicemail or web message. 
Injury, lost workday and collision rates

Environmental performance
Maximising opportunities
The reduced consumption 
of energy, fuel and water 
and production of less waste 
reduces costs, improves 
operational efﬁciencies and 
improves proﬁt margins. 
Managing risks
Rising energy prices and 
increasing “green” taxes 
can reduce Wolseley’s proﬁt 
margins. All business units 
have reduction targets in 
place to minimise these 
rising costs.
Progress against our objectives in 2013/14
Our objectives for 2013/14 were to continue to reduce carbon 
emissions and waste to landﬁll in order to achieve our two-year 
targets of −7 .5 per cent tCO
2e (carbon) and −23 per cent waste by 
31 July 2014 (both per £ million of revenue*). We also aimed to further 
reduce estimation levels in our carbon and waste reporting.
Strong performance in carbon and waste reduction – stretch 
targets almost achieved
Over the last two years we reduced carbon emissions by 7 .3 per 
cent and tonnage of waste sent to landﬁll by 18 per cent (both per 
£ million of revenue*). The waste target was increased from −15 
per cent to −23 per cent after one year of the two-year programme 
as the initial target had already been met. Examples of how the 
businesses have improved their environmental performance are 
detailed on the Wolseley plc website www.wolseley.com.
Carbon and waste data are more accurately measured and 
externally assured
PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) were engaged to test the Group’s 
carbon and waste data and have provided a limited assurance 
statement for 2013/14 data. Data accuracy continues to improve with 
only 16 per cent of carbon data (46 per cent in 201 1/12) being based 
on estimated numbers in 2013/14. 
Carbon emissions and waste
Wolseley’s reported data includes all major businesses and head 
ofﬁce locations (with 25 employees or more), representing over 99 per 
cent of Wolseley Group’s total employee numbers. All scope 1 and 2 
emissions and selected scope 3 emissions are reported. Further detail

Protocol (“GHG Protocol”). Emissions are calculated using DEFRA carbon factors and are reported 
as tonnes of CO2 equivalent (abbreviated as tCO2e), based on the Global Warming Potential (“GWP”) 
of each of the “basket of six” greenhouse gases, as deﬁned by the Kyoto Protocol. 
Inaccuracies identiﬁed during preparation for assurance resulted in adjustments to the 2011/12 and 
2012/13 carbon and waste data. 
Due to rounding of the ﬁgures in the bar charts and table there is not a precise correlation with the 
accurate totals and percentage performance ﬁgures.
Carbon emissions and waste
7.3% improvement
Carbon (36.7 tCO2e per £m revenue)
18% improvement
Landﬁlled waste (3.6 tonnes per £m revenue)
Reductions over two years to 
July 2014.

*Total revenue is used as the relative measure for carbon and waste performance, rather than 
revenue for the ongoing business.  Wolseley plc

USA lab receives ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation
The Metrology and Materials 
Services Group at Ferguson, 
USA, which tests product 
conformance and performance, 
has achieved accreditation, 
demonstrating the quality and 
reliability of its testing procedures.
Product integrity
Maximising opportunities
Sourcing and supplying safe, 
quality products improves our 
margins, enhances customer 
satisfaction and conﬁdence 
and enables branch staff to 
devote more time to sales 
and customer service.
Managing risks
Product-related litigation 
is recognised as one 
of our signiﬁcant risks. 
For more detail on how 
we are managing the risk, 
please see page 44.
Progress against our objectives in 2013/14
The focus for the year under review was to keep all businesses on 
track to meeting their targets under the product integrity programme 
and to share best practice across the Group.
Working towards higher standards
A set of minimum requirements were deﬁned during 2013/14 to 
promote a consistent level of product and supplier due diligence. 
Each business has been implementing its plan to comply with these 
requirements. A standard set of KPIs are reported against every six 
months and progress is monitored by the Board. The businesses 
share best practice through regular calls and a team web portal. 
Sourcing timber responsibly
Wolseley has assessed its timber products for a number of years 
and, where appropriate, works with specialist business partners 
to ensure that the systems we have in place meet the requirements 
of the regulations and our sourcing policies. Timber suppliers 
to Wolseley are required to conﬁrm their compliance with 
legal standards and to give access on request to relevant 
compliance documentation and allow reasonable access to all 
information, property and/or materials relevant to the performance 
of the agreement. 
Driving product quality through 
supplier qualiﬁcation
Ferguson in the USA has partnered with a leading risk 
management technology company to collect information 
from its suppliers, including statements of ﬁnancial health, 
certiﬁcates of insurance and indemnity agreements. 
Ferguson requests that all suppliers enrol in and complete 
a vendor qualiﬁcation process.
Wolseley UK sets shining example 
on green energy
Eight thousand solar panels have been installed on the 
roof of Wolseley UK’s National Distribution Centre (NDC). 
The installation, carried out over a six-month period, is set to 
produce two megawatts of electricity per year*. At full capacity 
output the system will completely power Wolseley UK’s NDC 
and is expected to generate up to £6.5 million of revenue over 
20 years. The payback period of the installation is 6.8 years, 
which means the NDC will receive “free” energy after seven 
years. Wolseley UK will also achieve carbon savings of around 
1,280 tonnes per year. Wolseley UK continues to lead the way 
by investing in the technology that it advocates. 
*Equivalent to powering 450 homes based on UK government typical electricity usage ﬁgures.

Sustainable construction
Maximising opportunities
Where the market 
opportunity exists, we 
can gain market share 
by stocking sustainable 
construction products and by 
offering training and advice to 
our customers.
Managing risks
Suppressed market 
conditions and pressure 
on margins are two of the 
Group’s most signiﬁcant 
risks (see page 43). 
Sustainable construction 
products open up new 
market opportunities.
Progress against our objectives in 2013/14
The objective remains for our businesses to continue to provide 
access to sustainable products and training, in line with local 
market opportunity.
Facilitating the growth of renewable energy products
We continue to engage our customers in sustainable construction. 
We publish sustainable product guides to assist customers in 
product selection and provide training on both the products 
themselves and on how to participate in relevant government 
incentive programmes. 
Joining the debate on sustainable construction
Wolseley actively engages with policy makers and trade associations 
to accelerate the uptake of sustainable construction products. 
For example, during 2013/14, Wolseley UK participated in various 
campaigns alongside the Association for the Conservation of 
Energy including the retention of the reduced VAT rate on energy 
efﬁcient products and amendments to the Energy Company 
Obligation. Wolseley’s businesses in Denmark and Finland are also 
represented at trade associations seeking to develop energy and 
resource efﬁciency.
Community engagement
Maximising opportunities
Engagement with the 
communities in which we 
operate promotes our 
business, attracts high 
quality recruits, teaches us 
about our customers and 
enhances employee skills 
and engagement.
Managing risks
Wolseley operates in a highly 
competitive marketplace, 
with many locally-
established competitors. 
Community engagement can 
enhance our local reputation 
and allow us to compete 
more effectively.
Progress against our objectives in 2013/14
Our businesses seek to be contributing members to the communities 
in which they operate. The Group also supports a number of 
charitable organisations both at a Group and a business unit level. 
Charitable support
During 2013/14, Wolseley’s businesses contributed to a great number 
of charities, including support for neglected and vulnerable children 
and provision of care for sufferers of cancer and other illnesses.
Employee involvement
Our employees engaged in a great number of community and 
charity events. Visit the Wolseley plc website www.wolseley.com 
for examples of the events and schemes our employees and 
businesses have supported over the last year. 
Wolseley Canada sponsor Special 
Olympics Canada
In 2014, Wolseley Canada renewed its national sponsorship of 
Special Olympics Canada for another two years. Since 2004, 
Wolseley Canada employees have supported the Special 
Olympics (SO) movement, raising CAD$2.5 million (including 
sponsorship fees) and volunteering to organise and participate 
in events. Read more about the Special Olympics at

Independent Limited Assurance Report to the Directors of Wolseley plc
Our conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed and 
the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come 
to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
Selected Information for the year ended 31 July 
2014 has not been prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
This conclusion is to be read in the context of what 
we say in the remainder of our report.
Selected Information
The scope of our work was limited to 
assurance over the information marked with 
the symbol  in Wolseley’s Annual Report 
(the “Selected Information”).
The Selected Information and the Reporting Criteria 
against which it was assessed are summarised 
in the list below. Our assurance does not extend 
to information in respect of earlier periods or 
to any other information included in the Annual 
Report or presented online on Wolseley’s 
Sustainability website.
Absolute greenhouse gas emissions:
 Electricity use
 Fuel consumption from operations
 Vehicle fuel – transport of goods  
(owned/leased vehicles)
 Vehicle fuel – transport of goods (outsourced)
 Vehicle fuel – transport of people  
(owned/leased vehicles)
 Vehicle fuel – transport of people  
(private/hired vehicles)
 Business travel (air and rail)
 Refrigerant leakage
Emissions per £m of revenue
Waste

Hazardous waste
 Incinerated

 Recycled
Waste per £m of revenue
Reporting criteria against which the above 
information is assessed can be found in 
the Environmental Performance section of 
www.wolseley.com/sustainability
Professional standards applied  
and level of assurance
We performed a limited assurance engagement 
in accordance with International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements 3000 “Assurance 
Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information” and, in respect of 
the greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
3410 “Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas 
statements”, issued by the International Auditing and 
Assurance Standards Board. A limited assurance 
engagement is substantially less in scope than a 
reasonable assurance engagement in relation to 
both the risk assessment procedures, including an 
understanding of internal control, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed risks.
Our independence and quality control
We apply the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 
England and Wales (ICAEW) Code of Ethics, which 
includes independence and other requirements 
founded on fundamental principles of integrity, 
objectivity, professional competence and due care, 
conﬁdentiality and professional behaviour. 
We apply International Standard on Quality 
Control (UK & Ireland) 1 and accordingly maintain 
a comprehensive system of quality control, 
including documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, 
professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements
Our work was carried out by an independent 
team with experience in sustainability reporting 
and assurance.
Understanding reporting and measurement 
methodologies
The Selected Information needs to be read and 
understood together with the Reporting Criteria, 
which Wolseley is solely responsible for selecting 
and applying. The absence of a signiﬁcant body of 
established practice on which to draw to evaluate 
and measure non-ﬁnancial information allows for 
different, but acceptable, measurement techniques 
and can affect comparability between entities 
and over time. The Reporting Criteria used for 
the reporting of the Selected Information are as 
at 31 July 2014.
Work done
We are required to plan and perform our work in 
order to consider the risk of material misstatement 
of the Selected Information. In doing so, we:
 made enquiries of Wolseley’s management, 
including the Sustainability team and those 
with responsibility for Sustainability management 
and Group Sustainability reporting;
 evaluated the design of the key structures, 
systems, processes and controls for managing, 
recording and reporting the Selected Information. 
This included analysing and visiting ﬁve brands 
during the year, selected on the basis of their 
inherent risk and materiality to the Group, to 
understand the key processes and controls for 
reporting site performance data to the Group 
Sustainability team;
 performed limited substantive testing on a selective 
basis of the Selected Information at corporate head 
ofﬁce and in relation to ﬁve brands to check that 
data had been appropriately measured, recorded, 
collated and reported; and
 considered the disclosure and presentation of the 
Selected Information.
Wolseley’s responsibilities
The Directors of Wolseley are responsible for:
 designing, implementing and maintaining internal 
controls over information relevant to the preparation 
of the Selected Information to ensure that it is free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error; 
 establishing objective Reporting Criteria for 
preparing the Selected Information;
 measuring and reporting the Selected Information 
based on the Reporting Criteria; and
 the content of the Annual Report 2014 and the 
information presented online on Wolseley’s 
Sustainability website.
Our responsibilities
We are responsible for:
 planning and performing the engagement to obtain 
limited assurance about whether the Selected 
Information is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error;
 forming an independent conclusion, based on 
the procedures we have performed and the 
evidence we have obtained; and
 reporting our conclusion to the Directors 
of Wolseley.
This report, including our conclusions, has been 
prepared solely for the Board of Directors of Wolseley 
in accordance with the agreement between us, to 
assist the Directors in reporting Wolseley’s annual 
performance and activities. We permit this report to 
be disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 
31 July 2014, to assist the Directors in responding 
to their governance responsibilities by obtaining an 
independent assurance report in connection with the 
Selected Information. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Board of Directors and 
Wolseley for our work or this report except where 
terms are expressly agreed between us in writing.

The maintenance and integrity of Wolseley’s website

Dear Shareholder
This section of our report outlines how the Board ensures 
that high standards of corporate governance are maintained. 
At Wolseley, we are committed to fostering an effective 
governance framework that supports the Company’s core 
values and which underpins our ability to set the overall 
strategic direction of the Wolseley Group.
Your Board
It is important that your Board has the right balance of skills and 
experience in order to provide strong leadership to the Company 
and effective support to Ian Meakins and his Executive team. 
As highlighted on page 9, during the year there have been a number 
of changes to the Non Executive Directors serving on the Board. 
As we drive towards achieving our strategic goals, it is important 
that we have the right balance of skills, breadth of experience 
and diversity on the Board and the Nominations Committee has 
continued to review the composition of the Board to ensure that this 
is the case. Biographical details for all Board members can be found 
on pages 58 and 59.
In May 2014, we announced that Jacky Simmonds would replace 
Alan Murray as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in July 
2014. There has been a successful handover of responsibilities, and 
Alan and Jacky will be available to answer questions at the AGM. 
The Remuneration Committee report can be found on pages 83 to 
104. In July 2014, we announced that Michael Wareing would be 
stepping down from Board at this year’s AGM and that he would 
be succeeded as Chairman of the Audit Committee by Darren 
Shapland. Michael and Darren are working together closely and 
the handover of responsibilities will be completed by the AGM, 
where they will both be available to answer any questions. The Audit 
Committee report can be found on pages 70 to 74.
The Non Executive Directors continue to be independent and 
objective, and to play an essential role in the composition of the 
Board due to the skills and expertise they bring.
Board effectiveness
Our annual Board effectiveness review assists us in highlighting 
areas in which improvements can be made. The review is conducted 
externally every three years and the next external review is due to 
take place in 2015. This year, the review was conducted internally 
and the outcome of this review and our progress against the areas 
identiﬁed for improvement in last year’s review are provided on 
page 66.
Good governance
Last year, the Board took the opportunity, earlier than required, to 
adopt certain changes introduced following the publication of the 
new edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) in 
September 2012. Although the Company is not required to do so 
as a Jersey company, it meets the requirements of the regulations 
published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills 
concerning narrative and directors’ remuneration reporting which 
came into force for companies with ﬁnancial years ending on or 
after 30 September 2013. We have now met all of these disclosure 
requirements and we continue to monitor developments and best 
practice in corporate governance. In the following pages we describe 
how we have applied the Code’s main principles.
Next year
The Board’s priorities for 2014/15 remain consistent with last year’s 
priorities. We will continue to monitor progress against our strategy 
to ensure that we continue to drive growth and improve returns. 
We are committed to investing in and supporting our people so that 
the Group maintains an appropriate balance of management skills 
and capabilities as it grows and develops.

Chairman’s letter
Compliance with the Code
We conﬁrm that, throughout the ﬁnancial year, the Company applied all of the principles set out in 
sections A to E of the UK Corporate Governance Code and has complied with the detailed provisions 
set out therein. See page 71 for our explanation in relation to external audit tendering. The Company’s 
auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , are required to review whether the above statement reﬂects 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code speciﬁed 
for their review by the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and to report if it does not reﬂect such 
compliance. No such report has been made. A copy of the Code can be found on the Financial 
Reporting Council website www.frc.org.uk

Directors in ofﬁce as at 31 July 2014 are shown on pages 58 and 59.
The Non Executive Directors and the Chairman are each

independent judgement.

The Board met regularly during the year, with Board and Committee 
meetings scheduled over two or three day periods. There were six 
scheduled meetings and details of attendance are shown in the

1   In addition to the scheduled meetings, one unscheduled meeting was convened at short 
notice to deal with matters that needed to be considered before the next scheduled meeting. 
All Directors were given notice of the meeting and some of them were unable to attend due to 
prior commitments which could not be rearranged. The meeting was attended by Ms López and 
Messrs Davis, Meakins, Murray and Roach.
2  Due to illness, Alan Murray was unable to attend one Board meeting.
3  Michael Wareing will step down as a Non Executive Director with effect from 25 November 2014.
4  Darren Shapland was appointed as a Non Executive Director on 1 May 2014. John Daly and 
Jacky Simmonds were appointed as Non Executive Directors on 21 May 2014.
5  Andrew Duff stepped down as a Non Executive Director on 26 November 2013. Michael Clarke 
stepped down as a Non Executive Director on 21 March 2014.
The Company is registered in Jersey and is tax resident in 
Switzerland. During the year all meetings of the Board, Committees 
of the Board and all other meetings requiring decisions of a strategic 
or substantive nature were held outside the United Kingdom.
In order to provide the Board with greater visibility of the Group’s 
operations and to provide further opportunities to meet senior 
management, the Board intends to visit at least one of the Group’s 
business unit locations each year. Such visits allow the Board to 
gain a deeper understanding of local market dynamics and assess 
management performance and potential. In addition, members of 
the Board periodically visit business units and meet management 
around the Group.
Board visit to the USA
Members of the Board visit the Group’s geographic operations 
on an ongoing basis and, in May 2014, the Board and Committee 
meetings were held in Houston, Texas. This provided an 
opportunity for executives from our businesses in the United 
States to meet the Board and discuss the business strategy and 
operational performance of those businesses in the United States 
in more detail. Board members visited several operational sites 
in the Houston metropolitan area to get a broader and deeper 
understanding of the business. The sites visited included:
 Wolseley Industrial Group’s new warehouse facility in La Porte, 
Houston. 
 Ferguson’s new showroom in Woodlands, Houston. 
 Ferguson’s plumbing and heating branch at Spring, Houston. 
Each Director is required to attend all meetings of the Board 
and Committees of which they are a member. In addition, senior 
management from across the Group, and advisers, attend some of 
the meetings for the discussion of speciﬁc items in greater depth. 
It is important to the Board that it meets members of senior 
management from around the Group’s businesses, as it 
further enhances the Board’s understanding of operations, the 
implementation of strategy and the changing dynamics of the 
markets in which the business units operate. Wolseley plc

Leadership continued
Board decision-making
The Board provides strong leadership to the Company and 
continues to have effective and constructive relationships with 
both the management team and shareholders. The Non Executive 
Directors play an essential role in the composition of the Board 
due to the range of skills and expertise they bring. The new Non 
Executive Directors who joined the Board this year have settled 
in well and the Board continues to have a strong culture of open 
debate where all Directors are actively encouraged to challenge 
existing assumptions and to raise difﬁcult questions.
Certain strategic decision-making powers and authorities of the 
Company are reserved as matters for the Board. The formal 
schedule of matters reserved for its decision was updated during the 
year to incorporate provisions relating to strategy and management, 
ﬁnancial reporting, communication and policies, and to implement 
the regulations relating to directors’ remuneration.
The principal matters reserved for the Board are set out on page 63. 
Day-to-day operational decisions are managed by members of the 
Executive Committee.
Where appropriate, matters are delegated to a Committee which will 
consider them in accordance with its terms of reference. Details of 
the Wolseley plc Board and Committee governance structure are 
set out on page 57 . The formal terms of reference for each of the 
Committees of the Board, which have been approved by the Board 
and comply with the Code, are available from the Group Company 
Secretary and General Counsel and can also be found on the 
Wolseley plc website www.wolseley.com.

Leadership continued
Having identiﬁed the areas which the Board focused on during the 
year, set out below are some highlights of its activities which provide 
an indication of the nature of the Board’s work.
Strategy
The development of the Company’s strategy and evolution 
of its business models was considered through the year. 
In addition, the Board attended a dedicated Strategy Day in 
May 2014 and completed its review of strategy at its meeting in 
July 2014. Whilst the Group’s strategy remains unchanged, the 
Board regularly reviews plans and initiatives which support the 
implementation of its strategy. 
The Group’s strategy is explained in the Strategic report  
starting on page 6 and includes an in-depth focus on:
3 Accelerate proﬁtable growth on pages 14 to 17
4 Drive evolution of business models on pages 18 to 24
Operations
The Board regularly reviews the operational performance of 
the Group’s businesses, including ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial 
performance measures. The Group Chief Executive reported to 
the Board on best practice developed and shared amongst the 
businesses during the year. A centrally maintained portal ensures 
that best practice is shared with senior managers across the Group. 
See Regional performance on pages 26 to 35
People
There was continued focus on the composition of the Board. 
Three new Non Executive Directors were appointed during 
the year and Jacky Simmonds took over as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, allowing the Company to beneﬁt from 
her experience in the area of executive remuneration. In November 
2013, the Board conducted a review of the progress made 
against Wolseley’s People Strategy and in March 2014, as part 
of its regular talent and succession review process and with 
the assistance of the Group HR Director, the Board conducted 
a detailed review of members of the Group’s senior leadership 
team and their successors. The Board believes the talent and 
succession planning processes to be of a high standard. 
See Our people on page 49
Finance
The Board regularly monitored the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. 
A monthly performance pack was provided to the Board by the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer which included an overview of the Group 
and business unit performance, market trends, competitor activity 
and shareholder matters. This was discussed at every Board 
meeting. All ﬁnancial statements to be released to the market were 
discussed and reviewed. The 2014/15 budget was reviewed and 
approved at the July 2014 meeting.
See Strategic report on pages 6 to 54

The Board’s priorities for the year will focus on ensuring effective 
execution of existing strategic plans.

variety of industries and advisory roles, which fully complement each 
other and have been strengthened through further appointments in 
May 2014. 
In accordance with Provision B.7 . 1. of the Code, with the exception 
of Michael Wareing, all Directors will stand for election or re-election 
at the 2014 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). Full biographies for

Effectiveness
Maintaining an effective Board
Board relationships
The effective working of the Board is crucial to the long-term 
prospects and strategic aims of the Company. This is achieved 
through strong and open working relationships between the 
Directors and, in particular, the Chairman, Group Chief Executive 
and Senior Independent Director, whose roles are agreed and 
set out in writing. A short summary of their roles and division of 
responsibilities is set out below.
Roles and division of responsibilities
Chairman
 Responsible for overall leadership and governance of the Board 
(including induction, development and performance evaluation)
 Ensures that the Directors have an understanding of the views of 
the Company’s major shareholders
 Ensures a healthy culture of challenge and debate at Board and 
Committee meetings
Group Chief Executive
 Responsible for the effective leadership of the Company
 Strong and focused management and development of the 
Group’s operations
 Implementation of the Company’s objectives and strategy 
agreed by the Board
 Maintaining good relationships and communications 
with investors
 Working closely with the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer to ensure 
prudent ﬁnancial controls
 Developing and implementing policies integral to improving 
the business, including in relation to Health and Safety and 
Corporate Responsibility
Senior Independent Director
 Available for approach by or representations from investors and 
shareholders, where communications through the Chairman or 
Executive Directors may not seem appropriate
 A sounding board for the Chairman and an intermediary for the 
other Directors when necessary
 Available to chair the Board in the absence of the Chairman
 Conducts consultations with shareholders on 
remuneration matters
The Chairman regularly discusses the way the Board functions and 
broad governance matters with the Senior Independent Director and 
the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel. The Senior 
Independent Director separately held informal discussions with 
the Non Executive Directors, with and without the presence of 
the Chairman. In his capacity as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee he has also led consultations with shareholders on 
remuneration matters.
There was detailed planning throughout the year, with the assistance 
of the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel, to consider 
and review the Board’s 12-month rolling agenda programme. 
This ensured that all matters reserved for the Board and other 
strategic issues were discussed at the appropriate time.
Board support
The Board and its Committees are provided with sufﬁcient resources 
to undertake their duties. The Group Company Secretary and 
General Counsel, Richard Shoylekov, was Secretary to the Board 
and its Committees during the year. Prior to each set of meetings 
he ensured that the papers and other information were delivered 
sufﬁciently in advance of the meeting date so that all Directors were 
provided with necessary time and resources to fulﬁl their duties. 
This information is published in advance via a secure web portal, 
allowing remote access by Directors using an iPad, and meeting 
support is provided by the Company Secretariat department. 
All Directors have access to a “reading room” through the web portal 
which provides access to a library of relevant information about the 
Company, the Group and Board procedures.
The Board has an established procedure for Directors, if necessary, 
to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense 
in furtherance of their duties. This is in addition to the direct access 
that every Director has to the Group Company Secretary and 
General Counsel for his advice and services.
Composition and development of the Board
As highlighted on page 9, John Daly, Darren Shapland and Jacky 
Simmonds were appointed as Non Executive Directors during 
the year. All new Directors follow a comprehensive induction 
programme, details of which are summarised on page 66. As part 
of this programme, the Company Secretariat department and other 
Group functions provided new Directors with induction brieﬁngs. 
New Directors also visited a variety of businesses in order to 
familiarise themselves with the Group’s operations. 
All Directors are provided opportunities for further development and 
training following their induction and, during the year, the Chairman 
discusses a development plan with each Director. In addition to 
regular updates on governance, legal and regulatory matters, the 
Board also receives detailed brieﬁngs from advisers on a variety 
of topics that are relevant to the Group and its strategy. The annual 
formal review of governance provides the Directors with an 
opportunity to assess their effectiveness and that of the Board 
as a whole. Wolseley plc

Effectiveness continued
Our Induction programme
The Company’s induction programme for new Directors is 
structured to reﬂect what is regarded as best practice. All new 
Non Executive Directors appointed to the Board are provided 
with an induction programme aimed at ensuring they develop an 
understanding and awareness of our businesses, people and 
processes. The programme includes:
 Provision of relevant current and historical information about the 
Company and the Group along with speciﬁc details about the 
duties of Directors and the Company’s rules of residence (in light 
of its registration in Jersey and tax residence in Switzerland);
 Visits to operations around the Group;
 Meetings with major shareholders and advisers; and,
 One-to-one meetings with members of the Executive 
Committee and other senior executives in the businesses and in 
corporate functions.
“The induction process has been well structured 
and gave an introduction to all parts of 
the business, from the Group and central 
functions to meetings with the business units. 
The individual business unit reviews have been 
particularly useful with a chance to review both 
the business strategy and to discuss with 
management the key issues and opportunities. 
Alongside this we have completed site and 
branch visits in the USA and the UK to see 
how their plans are implemented at the front 
line with the branch colleagues and how they 
deliver for the customer .”
Darren Shapland  
Non Executive Director
Evaluating the performance of the Board and the Directors
The Board undertakes a formal review of its performance and that of its Committees each year, with an external evaluation every three years. 
The next externally evaluated performance review is scheduled to take place in 2015. In 2014, an internal review was undertaken and during 
the year the Board reviewed its progress against the action points identiﬁed in this review. A summary of how the action points have been 
addressed is provided below:
Action point Responsibility Outcome
Continued focus on measuring the performance of 
the Company against its own targets as well as the 
performance of competitors.
Board The Board undertook in-depth reviews of the development 
of major businesses and regular updates were provided to 
the Board concerning the performance of the Company 
and competitors when this information became available.
Enhance Board oversight of the Group’s growth 
opportunities through more regular and detailed 
evaluation of projects.  
Board Reviews have been undertaken to identify and consider 
acquisition opportunities. Acquisition proposals were 
presented to and reviewed by the Board prior to approval. 
Other growth opportunities were identiﬁed and capital 
expenditure approved to support growth initiatives. 
The Board also conducts reviews of all major acquisitions 
post completion to assess the performance of the 
acquired business and progress made on integration 
and delivery of synergy beneﬁts. 
For more information on acquisitions see the Group Chief 
Executive’s review on page 13 and note 30 to the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements
When appointments are next made to the Board, 
consider further expanding the range of skills and 
experience to reﬂect the Group’s strategic objectives. 
Board and 
Nominations Committee
The Board will beneﬁt from the range and depth of 
experience of the three new Non Executive Directors 
appointed during the year. Ms Simmonds has extensive 
human resources and remuneration experience. 
Mr Shapland has signiﬁcant retail experience in addition 
to his strong ﬁnance background. Mr Daly has extensive 
international operational experience. Wolseley plc

Effectiveness review
This year, the Board effectiveness review was facilitated internally 
using sets of questions adapted to address the activities and 
concerns of the Board, the Audit Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nominations Committee. An online survey 
format was used, including questions from previous years (in 
order to be able to compare responses and monitor progress) as 
well as new questions reﬂecting current priorities and concerns. 
They encouraged comment and qualitative evaluation of the 
effectiveness of the Board and each Committee, the individual 
members and the support received from management and from 
advisers. The results of the surveys formed the basis of discussion 
of areas for further improvement by the Board and the Committees. 
The Board continues to consider each of the Directors to be effective 
and to demonstrate commitment to his or her role.
In the discussions held by the Senior Independent Director with the 
Non Executive Directors, the performance of the Chairman was 
evaluated and highly rated.
Key ﬁndings and improvement actions
The Board effectiveness review concluded that the atmosphere in 
the boardroom encouraged equal contribution, candid discussion 
and critical thinking. The agenda of the Board, timeliness of 
documentation and quality of information provided in advance 
of meetings were very highly rated. The amount of time spent 
reviewing strategy was considered to be appropriate and the 
annual strategy day was highly rated. No critical issues were 
identiﬁed but the review did identify areas for further improvement 
which are summarised below.
As at the date of this report, the Board has already begun to 
incorporate a number of these action points into its processes 
and procedures.
Action
Continued focus on market environment and performance relative 
to competitors.
Continued focus on the Group’s growth opportunities organically 
through the development of its business models and through 
acquisitions.  
Time commitment
All Directors are aware, from the time of appointment, of the 
need to allocate sufﬁcient time to the Company to discharge their 
responsibilities effectively. The Board continually monitors potential 
conﬂicts of interest, as detailed on page 79. With the exception of 
absence from meetings due to illness, no Director has been unable 
to devote sufﬁcient time to the role during the year.
External appointments
The Board believes that there are signiﬁcant beneﬁts for both the 
Board and the individual if an Executive Director holds an external 
non executive directorship on the board of a non-competitor 
company. Ian Meakins continues to hold his non executive position 
at Centrica plc; details of payments received in respect of this 
appointment are set out on page 104. None of the other Executive 
Directors hold any external appointments.
Accountability
The Board is committed to presenting a clear assessment of the 
Company’s position and prospects through the information provided 
in this report, through interim ﬁnancial statements and other reports 
as required.
The Board’s approach to risk management
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent 
of the signiﬁcant risks it is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives and for maintaining sound risk management and internal 
control systems. The effectiveness of these systems is also reviewed 
through the work of the Audit Committee described on pages 70 
to 74. There is a Group-wide standard framework in place which 
supports the Group’s risk management programme and allows the 
Board to assess and manage risk through its strategic planning and 
performance monitoring processes.
The key risks which the Board has focused on this year are set out 
in the Principal risks and their management section of this report on 
pages 42 to 47 .

Relations with shareholders
Communication with shareholders
We are fully committed to engaging with all shareholders, including 
employee shareholders, and this is reﬂected in our annual investor 
relations and communications programmes. In our interactions with 
shareholders, we ensure that we act professionally, provide accurate 
data, are timely with our disclosure of information to the market and 
are at all times accessible.
Our Group Director of Communications and Investor Relations is the 
senior executive who has day-to-day responsibility for all investor 
relations matters and for contact with shareholders (institutional and 
private), as well as with ﬁnancial analysts and the media. He reports 
to the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Group Chief Executive.
All investor communication is governed by written guidelines to 
ensure the appropriate governance of the processes for engaging 
with shareholders and ﬁnancial analysts is maintained. In addition, 
these guidelines govern the prompt disclosure of inside information 
which could affect the Company’s share price.
Our major shareholders

Engagement with shareholders
During the year, an extensive communications programme 
was followed. We maintained regular dialogue with institutional 
shareholders and ﬁnancial analysts based in Europe and North 
America. Many of these meetings and conversations closely 
involved the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. 
We released quarterly updates of the ﬁnancial performance of the 
Group incorporating revenue, proﬁtability by region, net debt and 
appropriate commentary on key business trends. Alan Murray, in his 
capacity as the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and as 
the Senior Independent Director, engaged with major shareholders 
in relation to executive remuneration and other matters.
As our shareholder base is mainly institutional, it is difﬁcult to 
engage with all of our private shareholders using the same direct 
engagement model. We hold periodic meetings with the UK 
Shareholders’ Association and respond to all communications from 
individual shareholders. In an effort to ensure that all shareholders 
have equal access to information we make all documents presented 
at investor events available on the Wolseley plc website. There is 
also a shareholder information section on the Wolseley plc website 
www.wolseley.com and at the end of this report on pages 169 
to 171.
Shareholder meetings during the year
We are keen to maintain an open dialogue with all of our 
shareholders and have a well developed investor relations 
programme. The allocation of time spent in the UK, continental 
Europe and North America reﬂects the distribution of our 
shareholders as highlighted on page 68.
During the year ended 31 July 2014, there were a total of 
264 meetings. Ian Meakins and John Martin (together with the 
Investor Relations team) attended 128 meetings, four of which were 
also attended by Steve Ashmore, the Managing Director of our UK 
business. Frank Roach attended eight meetings and the Investor 
Relations team met with institutions through a further 128 meetings, 
conferences and site visits.
The Chairman often meets with the larger institutional shareholders 
and attended the Full Year and Half Year results presentations. 
He also ensures that the Board as a whole maintains an appropriate 
dialogue with shareholders. The Non Executive Directors also attend 
presentations of the Full Year and Half Year results when possible. 
The Group Director of Communications and Investor Relations 
regularly provides the Board with details of feedback received from 
institutional shareholders and any key issues raised.
Plans for engagement in 2014/15
A similar Investor Relations programme will be run during the 
ﬁnancial year. In addition, the Investor Relations team will be meeting 
with members of the UK Shareholders’ Association prior to the AGM 
in November 2014.
2013 AGM
The 2013 AGM was held on 26 November 2013 at Parkhotel, 
Industriestrasse 14, CH 6304, Zug, Switzerland at 1.00pm Swiss 
time with an audio-visual link to the ofﬁces of Freshﬁelds Bruckhaus 
Deringer LLP . The link allowed shareholders in London to see and 
hear proceedings, and provided the opportunity to put questions 
directly to the Board about the business of the meeting and 
about the Company. The Board as a whole is committed to the 
constructive use of the AGM as a way to meet with shareholders, 
hear their views and answer their questions. All Directors attended 
and answered a wide range of questions from shareholders.
2014 AGM
The 2014 AGM will be held on 25 November 2014 at Parkhotel, 
Industriestrasse 14, CH 6304, Zug, Switzerland at 1.00pm Swiss 
time. An audio-visual link to the meeting is proposed to be available 
at the ofﬁces of Freshﬁelds Bruckhaus Deringer LLP , 26-28 Tudor 
Street, London EC4Y 0BQ and will start at 12 noon (UK time).

1  As at 31 July 2014, the Committee is made up of seven Non Executive Directors. The Board 
considers that the Chairman and other members of the Committee have relevant ﬁnancial 
experience and that each member of the Committee is independent within the deﬁnition set out 
in the Code.
2  Darren Shapland will succeed Michael Wareing as Chairman of the Audit Committee 
on 25 November 2014.
3 Due to illness, Alan Murray was unable to attend one Committee meeting.
4  Darren Shapland was appointed as a Non Executive Director on 1 May 2014. John Daly and 
Jacky Simmonds were appointed as Non Executive Directors on 21 May 2014.
5  Andrew Duff stepped down as a Non Executive Director on 26 November 2013. 
Michael Clarke stepped down as a Non Executive Director on 21 March 2014.
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for 
2013/14. As announced on 24 July 2014, at the conclusion of this 
year’s Annual General Meeting I will be stepping down as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee and from the Board and handing over 
the responsibilities of my role as Chairman of the Committee to 
Darren Shapland. 
Darren was until 2010 Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of J Sainsbury plc 
and chairs the Audit Committee of Ladbrokes plc. Darren’s wealth 
of ﬁnancial experience complements the substantial ﬁnancial 
experience already provided by existing Committee members 
Tessa Bamford, Pilar López and Alan Murray. In addition to Darren, 
I am delighted to welcome two other new Non Executive Directors 
who joined the Committee as members in May 2014: John Daly 
and Jacky Simmonds. John and Jacky bring with them substantial 
operational experience and are, like the other Committee members, 
considered to be independent in accordance with the Code 
criteria. I was International Chief Executive of KPMG until I retired 
in September 2009 and I currently chair the Audit Committee of 
two other FTSE 350 companies. This provides the Board with 
assurance that the Audit Committee meets the Code requirements 
that at least one member of the Committee has signiﬁcant, recent 
and relevant ﬁnancial experience, and that at least three members 
are independent. The key strengths and experience of each member 
of the Committee are summarised on pages 58 and 59. 
Last year we took the opportunity to implement earlier than 
necessary many of the changes to our reporting required by the 
Code and the new narrative reporting regulations. This year we have 
implemented all of the required changes to our report. 
At the 2014 AGM, both Darren and I shall be available to respond 
to any questions shareholders may raise on this report or any of the 
Committee’s activities.
Other attendees
In addition to the members of the Committee, the Chairman, the 
Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, the Group 
Financial Controller, the Head of Internal Audit and the Group 
Company Secretary and General Counsel, together with senior 
representatives of the Company’s external auditors, attended and 
received papers for each meeting. Other senior executives were also 
invited to certain meetings to present and discuss speciﬁc items. 
In particular, the Finance Directors of the Group’s major regions 
periodically attend Committee meetings to provide the Committee 
with detailed updates relating to their region. The Committee 
periodically meets separately with the Head of Internal Audit and 
the external auditors without the presence of Executive Directors 
and also separately with the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer.

What the Committee has done during the year
An overview of the Committee’s 2013/14 objectives and how the 
Committee has achieved these objectives is set out below:
2013/14 objectives Achievements
Maintain close scrutiny of the 
Company’s management of 
its principal risks and ensure 
continued improvement of the 
risk management framework.
In March and September each 
year the Audit Committee 
undertakes a review of key risks 
and controls, considers how 
they have been managed in 
practice and provides feedback to 
management. In May each year, 
the Audit Committee reviews the 
effectiveness of the overall risk 
management framework.
Prepare for and, if appropriate, 
implement the regulatory 
changes to Audit Committee 
governance, in particular in 
relation to the tendering of 
the audit.
Regulatory changes are 
considered throughout the year. 
The Committee considered 
developments in the regulation 
of audit tendering; for further 
details see page 73. In addition, 
the Committee considered the 
changes to the Code and the 
Guidance on Audit Committees 
issued by the FRC, and the new 
narrative reporting regulations. In 
September 2013, the Committee 
recommended to the Board that 
many of the new requirements 
be adopted early in the 2012/13 
Annual Report and Accounts.
Continue to monitor the 
effectiveness of the overall 
assurance provided by Internal 
Audit, internal controls and 
risk management processes 
and, in particular, review the 
effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal control systems.
Systems and controls were 
monitored throughout the year, 
with reports to the Committee 
from Internal Audit, External Audit, 
Risk Management and managers 
responsible for the implementation 
of internal controls. During the 
year, the Committee reviewed 
and increased the resources in 
Internal Audit to implement greater 
assurance over branch activities. 
In addition, the Committee 
reviewed the co-ordination of 
the assurance over ﬁnancial 
reporting and control and agreed 
that Internal Audit should take 
responsibility for the audit of 
compliance with the Group’s Base 
Financial Controls.
The annual review of the effectiveness of the Committee was 
carried out in May 2014. The review concluded that: the Committee 
meetings beneﬁted from a comprehensive agenda programme with 
key issues well covered; the information provided was of a very good 
quality and timely; the work of the internal and external auditors was 
well scrutinised; and there was good collaboration between internal 
audit and the external auditor. The report also highlighted areas for 
improvement and we have incorporated these into our priorities for 
2014/15 as set out on page 74.
Allocation of time spent during the year
Set out in the table and the narrative below is a summary of matters 
considered by the Committee during 2013/14. Key issues covered by 
the Committee are reported to the subsequent meeting of the Board 
and the Board also receives copies of the minutes of each meeting.

Audit Committee continued
Financial reporting and signiﬁcant 
ﬁnancial judgements
The Committee reviews whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether management has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements and seeks support 
from the external auditors to assess them. As part of the review 
process, the Committee receives papers and holds discussions 
with management and makes its assessment in accordance with 
accounting guidelines. The main issues reviewed during the year 
ended 31 July 2014 and how these issues were addressed are 
summarised below: 
 The Committee reviewed the analysis of goodwill and other 
intangible assets for impairments. The Committee concluded 
that no impairment had occurred and arrived at this conclusion 
by questioning management and performing a detailed review 
and analysis of the assumptions underlying the value in use 
calculations for the businesses identiﬁed as cash generating units. 
The key assumptions underlying the calculations are primarily 
the achievability of the long-term business plan, country-speciﬁc 
discount rates, anticipated revenue growth in the short-term, 
and long-term growth assumptions. 
 In addition to receiving and reviewing reports from management 
on this area, the Committee also considered detailed feedback 
received from the external auditors on this topic. The cash 
generating units that have the lowest level of headroom are 
all in the Nordic region and are disclosed in note 12 of the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
 The Committee reviewed the recognition of supplier rebate 
income, which is an area of inherent risk due to the number and 
complexity of supplier rebate arrangements. In addition, the 
majority of the supplier rebate arrangements are not coterminous 
with the Group’s accounting year-end as they generally cover a 
calendar year. This review covered the processes and controls in 
place during the year and the level of adherence to the Group’s 
accounting policies and procedures. Judgements were made to 
forecast the expected level of volumes purchased to determine 
the appropriate rate at which rebate is earned as this varies 
dependent upon the volume or value purchased. As a result of the 
review process the Committee concluded that the level of rebate 
income and rebate receivable as at 31 July 2014 was properly 
reﬂected in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
 The Committee considered the level of provisions for obsolete and 
slow moving inventory as at 31 July 2014. This is predominantly 
a system-generated calculation comparing inventory on hand 
against expected future sales using historic experience as the 
basis for provisioning, along with the results of physical stock-
counts performed by management. The Committee ensured the 
policy was consistently applied across the Group in the current 
and previous ﬁnancial periods and sought the views of the auditors 
before arriving at the conclusion that the provisions for obsolete 
and slow moving inventory were fairly stated. 
 The Committee considered the provisions held and settlements 
made in relation to litigation disputes, potential product liability 
and environmental claims. The Committee addressed this issue 
by assessing reports from management and the extent to which 
professional advice was taken on these matters. In each case 
management presented to the Committee the basis of any 
provision and the key assumptions applied when quantifying it, 
including the likelihood of successful claims to be made against 
the Group. This included a number of claims which had been 
made where management concluded that the claims were 
without merit or were not estimable or sufﬁciently probable to 
recognise a provision in accordance with accounting standards. 
The Committee agreed with the position taken by management 
in respect of those matters.
 The Committee considered the value of provisions against 
unresolved tax positions as at 31 July 2014. Management 
presented to the Committee the basis for provisioning based 
upon the latest correspondence with the relevant tax authorities 
and previous experience. The Committee also received detailed 
reporting from the external auditors before concluding the 
provisions are fairly stated in the annual accounts.
Last year, prior to the introduction of the revised Code in September 
2012, we considered whether the 2012/13 Annual Report and 
Accounts was fair, balanced and understandable and whether it 
provided the necessary information for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. At the 
request of the Board, we have undertaken the same review of the 
2013/14 Annual Report and Accounts. We were satisﬁed that, 
taken as a whole, the 2013/2014 Annual Report and Accounts is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
External audit
External audit processes
During the year, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) undertook 
external audit and certain non-audit work. The Group Audit Partner, 
Stuart Watson, together with Neil Grimes of the PwC audit team, 
attended each Audit Committee meeting as representatives of the 
external auditors. They also attended the 2013 AGM. They provided 
the Committee with information and advice, as well as relevant 
reports on the ﬁnancial statements and controls.
In November 2013, the Committee reviewed and approved the 
terms, areas of responsibility and scope of the 2013/14 audit as set 
out in the external auditors’ engagement letter. During the year, PwC 
provided audit related services such as regulatory and statutory 
reporting. PwC are expected to report to the Committee any material 
departures from Group accounting policies and procedures that they 
identify during the course of their audit work. None were found or 
reported in the ﬁnancial year.
PwC’s 2013/14 External Audit Plan was approved in March 2014 
and has been successfully completed at the date of this report. Wolseley plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 73
Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information
Auditor appointment, effectiveness and tendering
The Committee conducts an annual review of the performance of 
the external auditors. A survey of all the Group’s ﬁnance teams is 
conducted. Each team is asked to rate PwC’s performance against 
a range of measures, including relating to the adequacy of planning, 
the sufﬁciency of resource, the thoroughness of review and testing, 
the adequacy and application of knowledge of the Group, the 
usefulness of feedback and the quality of reporting. The Committee 
considered the 2013 year-end survey ﬁndings as part of its review. 
In addition during the year, the Committee also received and 
discussed the review by the Audit Quality Review of PwC’s audit 
of the Company’s ﬁnancial results for the year ended 31 July 2012. 
The Committee is satisﬁed that PwC continues to provide an 
effective audit service. The Group Audit Partner, currently Stuart 
Watson, is required to rotate after a maximum of ﬁve years, key audit 
partners after a maximum of seven years, and all other partners and 
senior team members after a maximum of 10 years. The Committee 
discusses audit partner rotation with PwC on a regular basis.
In 2010, the Company, which was newly incorporated, became the 
holding company of the Group and PwC have been its auditors 
since then. Prior to that PwC and its predecessor ﬁrms had been 
the auditors of the previous holding company of the Group (now a 
subsidiary of the Company) since before the Company ﬁrst listed 
on the London Stock Exchange in 1961. There is no record of any 
tender of the audit contract.
Last year I said that, subject to the continued satisfactory 
performance of PwC, it was the intention to tender the external 
audit during the ﬁnancial year ending 31 July 2016. The Committee 
is mindful of the requirement that the external audit is put out to 
tender every 10 years, introduced following changes to the Code in 
2012, and of the new regulatory environment which will soon place 
an obligation on listed companies to rotate their auditor periodically. 
Our intention to tender the external audit during 2015/2016 remains 
the same as last year. In view of this, and as PwC has continued to 
perform satisfactorily, the Committee did not consider it necessary 
to conduct a tender process for the appointment of the Company’s 
auditors this year. There are no contractual obligations restricting the 
Company’s choice of external auditor.
Auditor independence and objectivity
The Company has policies and procedures in place to ensure 
that the independence and objectivity of the external auditor is 
not impaired. These include restrictions on the types of services 
which the external auditor can provide, in line with the APB Ethical 
Standards on Auditing. Details of the services that the external 
auditors cannot be engaged to perform are provided on the 
Wolseley plc website www.wolseley.com.
When considering the award of non-audit work an assessment is 
made of which service provider would be best placed to undertake 
it. Appointments are made on a case-by-case basis. The prior 
consent of the Chairman of the Committee is required before PwC 
is appointed to undertake non-audit work where the proposed fee 
is in excess of a level set by the Committee. At each meeting the 
Committee reviews all PwC engagements to undertake non-audit 
work commenced in the preceding period, including those approved 
by the Chairman of the Committee. The Committee also periodically 
reviews the level of fees incurred with PwC for non-audit work. 
During the year PwC were appointed to undertake non-audit work, 
the details of which are set out below. The decision to appoint them 
was typically based on the merit of using PwC’s existing knowledge 
of both the Company and the Group and its importance in relation 
to the advice sought on each relevant transaction. This added value 
and saved fees in the process.
PwC also provides speciﬁc assurance to the Committee on 
the arrangements and safeguards it has in place to maintain its 
independence and objectivity, including an internal process to pre-
approve provision of non-audit services and the use of separate 
teams where non-audit services are being provided to the Group. 
The Committee continues to be satisﬁed with their independence 
and objectivity.
Audit and non-audit fees
The total fees paid to PwC in the year ended 31 July 2014 (together 
with a comparison to fees paid in the year ended 31 July 2013) are 
set out in the following table. Further disclosure of the non-audit fees 
paid during the year ended 31 July 2013 can be found in note 3 to 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements on page 1 16.

2  £1.8 million of the non-audit fees related to taxation work and £0.4 million of the non-audit fees 
related to other services.
The non-audit services related mainly to assistance on tax advisory 
and compliance matters and other assurance engagements, 
including corporate responsibility reporting. These services were 
provided within the constraints of the Audit Practices Board Ethical 
Standards on Auditing and were assessed on a case-by-case basis 
so that the best placed adviser was retained.
Internal audit
The scope of activity of internal audit is monitored and reviewed 
at each Committee meeting. An annual plan was agreed by the 
Committee in May 2014 which covers the activities to July 2015. 
During the year, the Head of Internal Audit attended each Committee 
meeting where his reports were reviewed and discussed in detail. 
The Committee considered the matters raised and the adequacy of 
management’s response to them, including the time taken to resolve 
any such matters.
In March 2014, the Committee conducted the annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit function, including its 
terms of reference, its audit plans, its general performance and its 
relationship with the external auditors. This review was undertaken 
using guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
in England and Wales and the Institute of Internal Auditors – UK. 
The Committee was satisﬁed with the overall effectiveness of the 
Internal Audit function.  Wolseley plc

Audit Committee continued
Risk
Risk management
Risk management reports, prepared by the Group Head of Risk 
and Compliance, were submitted to the Committee in September 
2013 and March 2014. These reports summarise submissions from 
all areas of the business which the Executive Committee and senior 
management have reviewed. They identify the signiﬁcant risks to the 
Group, the controls in place and highlight the tolerance levels that the 
Executive Committee is prepared to accept. In May 2014, the Audit 
Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the Company’s overall risk 
management framework, including the generic procedures for risk 
identiﬁcation, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting.
Internal controls
During the year the Committee monitored and reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems, accounting 
policies and practices, standards of risk management and risk 
management procedures and compliance controls, as well as the 
Company’s statements on internal controls, before they were agreed 
by the Board for this Annual Report.
The Group’s internal control systems are designed to manage 
rather than eliminate business risk. They provide reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. Such systems are necessary to safeguard shareholders’ 
investment and the Company’s assets and depend on regular 
evaluation of the extent of the risks to which the Company is 
exposed. The Committee is assured that the Company’s systems 
comply with the guidance set out in the FRC Guidance on Risk 
Management and Internal Control. The Committee can conﬁrm that 
the Company’s systems and their effectiveness have been in place 
for the full ﬁnancial year and up to the date on which the ﬁnancial 
statements were approved, and are regularly reviewed by the Board. 
The Committee is of the view that the Company has a well-designed 
system of internal control.
The Chairman of the Committee reports any matters arising from 
the Committee’s review to the Board following each meeting. 
This update covers the way in which the risk management and 
internal control processes are applied and on any breakdowns in, 
or exceptions to, these processes. There were no signiﬁcant failings 
or weaknesses identiﬁed. These processes have been in place 
throughout the year ended 31 July 2014 and have continued to the 
date of this report.
Full details of how the business implements its risk management and 
controls on a Group-wide basis are set out in the section on Principal 
risks and their management on pages 42 to 47 .
Whistleblowing and fraud
The Group’s whistleblowing policy, which supports the Group-wide 
Code of Conduct, is monitored by the Committee. A copy of the 
Group’s Code of Conduct is available on the Wolseley plc website 
www.wolseley.com. The Committee received reports at each 
Committee meeting providing details of matters reported through 
the Group’s international conﬁdential telephone reporting lines and 
secure website reporting facility, which are operated on its behalf by 
an independent third party. All matters reported are investigated by 
the relevant operating company and, where appropriate, reported to 
the Committee, together with details of any corrective action taken. 
The Committee also received reports at each Committee meeting 
providing details of fraud losses in each quarter.

Dear Shareholder 
What the Committee has done during the year 
An overview of the Committee’s 2013/14 objectives and how 
the Committee has progressed against these objectives is set 
out below:
2013/14 objectives Achievements
Continue to review the 
balance, experience and 
skills of the Board. 
During the year, the Committee assessed 
the balance of skills and experience of 
the Board. It identiﬁed that the Board 
would beneﬁt from having more members 
with retail and international business 
experience. In addition, the Committee 
considered that it would be appropriate 
for the Board to include potential 
successors for the roles of the chairs of 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
The Committee achieved this objective 
with the appointment of three new Non 
Executive Directors in May 2014.
Monitor the Company’s 
progress in developing its 
diversity policies.
A diversity policy has been adopted, 
details of which are below.
Board composition
As I explained in my Chairman’s statement on page 9, during 
this ﬁnancial year, the Committee has continued to review the 
composition and experience of the Board and its Committees to 
ensure that the Board has the appropriate balance of skills and 
breadth of experience. It identiﬁed that the Board would beneﬁt 
from having more members with retail and international business 
experience. In addition, the Committee considered that it would 
be appropriate for the Board to include potential successors for 
the roles of the chairs of the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
As a result of the review, the Committee undertook a search for 
three new Non Executive Directors.
In accordance with our procedure for selecting and recruiting 
Directors, prior to engaging external recruitment consultants to 
undertake a search for suitable candidates, the Committee identiﬁed 
the key skills and experience required for the new appointments. 
The Committee then retained external search agencies, Zygos and 
Inzito, with whom the Company has no other connection, to assist 
in the process of identifying potential candidates for nomination to 
the Board. The Company does not use open advertising to search 
for suitable candidates for Non Executive Director positions, as we 
believe that the optimal way of recruiting for these positions is to use 
targeted recruitment based on the skills and experience required.
I am pleased that, as a result of this search, we were able to appoint 
three excellent new Non Executive Directors: John Daly, Darren 
Shapland and Jacky Simmonds.

Nominations Committee continued
Over the last three years, we have remained supportive of the 
voluntary approach as an effective way to encourage companies to 
improve gender diversity in boardrooms. With Jacky’s appointment, 
I am pleased to conﬁrm that we now have three women Board 
members and have met the gender diversity recommendations 
set out in Lord Davies’ report, “Women on Boards”, ahead of the 
2015 deadline. Lord Davies recommended that women should 
account for at least 25 per cent of Board membership and 27 per 
cent of your Board are women. This has increased from 20 per cent 
in July 2013 and 12.5 per cent in July 2012. 
Diversity 
One of the core values of Wolseley is that we value our people. 
We aim to recruit, retain and develop a high quality, diverse 
workforce. To achieve our objectives we will always appoint or hire 
the best candidates available from the widest range of knowledge, 
skills and experience. The diversity of our people – whether in terms 
of gender, race and ethnicity, religious or political beliefs, marital 
status, sexual orientation, age, disability, culture, background or any 
other measure – strengthens our diversity of thought, which is vital 
to the growth and success of our business. We are committed to 
providing our employees with an inclusive work environment in which 
diversity is valued, discrimination in any form is not tolerated, and 
in which all our people feel empowered to reach their full potential. 
Details of our current gender diversity statistics are set out on 
page 49.
Effectiveness 
The annual review of the effectiveness of the Committee was carried 
out in May 2014. The review concluded that the Committee was 
pragmatic and discussion at meetings was open. The review also 
highlighted areas for improvement and we have incorporated these 
into our priorities for 2014/15 as set out below.
At the 2014 AGM, I shall be available to respond to any 
questions shareholders may raise on this report or any of the 
Committee’s activities.
Nominations Committee priorities for 2014/15
2014/15 priorities
Continue to review the balance, experience and skills of the Board.
Continue to monitor executive and senior leadership succession.

Directors’ Report – other disclosures
Amendment of the Company’s Articles 
of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by a 
special resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Appointment and removal of Directors
The Directors may from time to time appoint one or more Directors. 
The Board may appoint any person it considers appropriate to be 
a Director. Under the Articles of Association any such Director shall 
hold ofﬁce only until the next Annual General Meeting and shall then 
be eligible for election. The Articles of Association also require that 
at each AGM at least one-third of the current Directors must retire 
as Directors by rotation. All those Directors who have been in ofﬁce 
for three years or more since their last appointment shall retire at that 
AGM. In addition, any Director may at any AGM retire from ofﬁce 
and stand for re-election. However, in line with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2012, all continuing Directors will stand for annual 
election at the 2014 AGM.
Authority to allot shares
At the 2013 AGM, authority was given to the Directors to allot new 
ordinary shares up to a nominal value of £19, 122,680. The Directors 
intend to propose at the 2014 AGM to seek authority to allot and 
grant rights to subscribe for or to convert securities into shares 
up to an aggregate nominal amount representing approximately 
two-thirds of the Company’s issued share capital, calculated at the 
latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice of AGM, 
but of that amount only one-third of the Company’s issued share 
capital, calculated at the latest practicable date prior to publication 
of the Notice of AGM, may be allotted pursuant to a fully pre-emptive 
rights issue. If approved, this authority will expire at the conclusion 
of the 2015 AGM.
Subject to the terms of the authority noted above, the Directors will 
also recommend that they be empowered to allot equity securities 
for cash other than pro rata to existing shareholders, until the 
2014 AGM. This authority shall be limited to the allotment of equity 
securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of no more 
than approximately 5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital 
calculated at the latest practicable date prior to publication of the 
Notice of AGM. 
Authority to purchase shares
In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the Company 
to purchase its own ordinary shares and the Company seeks 
authority on an annual basis to renew the Directors’ limited authority 
to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares in the market pursuant 
to Article 57 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. On 30 September 
2014, the Company announced its intention to commence a 
£250 million share repurchase programme to be executed over the 
twelve month period to September 2015 (the “Programme”). It is 
intended that a special resolution will be proposed at the 2014 AGM 
to grant authority for the Company to purchase up to approximately 
10 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital, calculated at 
the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of 
AGM. The special resolution will set the minimum and maximum 
prices which may be paid. The Directors intend to use this authority 
to make share repurchases pursuant to the Programme and will 
use this authority to purchase further shares only after careful 
consideration, taking into account market conditions, other investment 
opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the overall ﬁnancial 
position of the Company. The authority will enable the Directors 
to continue to be able to respond promptly should circumstances 
arise in which they consider that such a purchase would result in an 
increase in earnings per share and would be in the best interests of 
the Company. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association the 
Company is allowed to hold shares purchased by it to be held as 
treasury shares that may be cancelled, sold for cash or used for the 
purpose of employee share schemes. As at the date of this report, 
the Company holds no shares in treasury and the Directors currently 
intend that any shares which are purchased will be held in treasury. 
The existing authority to purchase up to 26,551,830 ordinary shares 
is due to expire at the conclusion of this year’s AGM and a special 
resolution to renew the authority will be put to shareholders at the 
2014 AGM.
Change of control (signiﬁcant agreements)
The Company is not party to any signiﬁcant agreements that take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control following a 
takeover except for the €750 million multi-currency revolving credit 
facility agreement dated 18 July 201 1, the US$270 million revolving 
credit facility agreement dated 21 July 201 1, the £200 million 
revolving credit facility agreement dated 27 March 2013, the 
amended US$600 million receivables facility agreement originally 
entered into on 31 July 2013 and the £300 million revolving credit 
facility agreement dated 9 December 2013 which could become 
repayable following a relevant change of control. There are no 
agreements between the Company and any Director that would 
provide compensation for loss of ofﬁce or employment resulting from 
a change of control following a takeover bid, except that provisions 
of the Company’s share schemes may cause options and awards 
granted under such schemes to vest in those circumstances. 
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating 
to a change of control. Outstanding options and awards would 
normally vest and become exercisable for a limited period of time 
upon a change of control following a takeover, reconstruction or  Wolseley plc

winding up of the Company (not being an internal reorganisation), 
subject at that time to rules concerning the satisfaction of any 
performance conditions.
Conﬂicts of interest
Processes and procedures are in place which require Directors to 
identify and declare actual or potential conﬂicts of interest, whether 
matter-speciﬁc or situational. These notiﬁcations are made by a 
Director prior to or at a Board meeting, or in writing. All Directors 
have a continuing duty to update any changes.
The Board may authorise potential conﬂicts which can be limited in 
scope, in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. 
These authorisations are regularly reviewed. During the year, 
all conﬂict management procedures were adhered to and 
operated efﬁciently.
CREST
The Company’s ordinary shares are in CREST, the settlement 
system for stocks and shares.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Strategic report, the Directors’ report, the Directors’ remuneration 
report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. The Directors have prepared the Strategic 
report, the Directors’ report and the Directors’ remuneration report 
as if the Company were required to do so in accordance with the 
UK Companies Act 2006.
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires the Directors to prepare 
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The Directors are also 
responsible for preparing parent company ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, and 
for being satisﬁed that the consolidated and Company ﬁnancial 
statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company 
and Group for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
consolidated and Company ﬁnancial statements respectively; and
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the consolidated ﬁnancial statements comply 
with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Jersey legislation and United Kingdom 
regulation, governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial 
statements, may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors conﬁrm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt of the 
Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and
 the management report review contained in the report of 
the Directors includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces.
In addition, having taken all matters considered by the Board and 
brought to the attention of the Board during the year into account, 
the Directors consider that the Company’s 2013/14 Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, presents a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s position and 
prospects and provides information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Directors’ Report – other disclosures continued
Employees
The Group actively encourages employee involvement in driving 
our current and future success and places particular importance 
on keeping employees regularly informed on the Group’s activities 
and ﬁnancial performance and on matters affecting them individually 
and the business generally. This can be through informal bulletins, 
in-house publications and brieﬁngs, as well as via the Group’s 
intranet sites. The Group operates on a largely decentralised basis 
with a control framework exercised by a small team at the Group 
Services Ofﬁce. This ensures that consistent standards are set and 
maintained while allowing for implementation in a way that supports 
each business unit’s particular circumstances. Local management 
is responsible for maintaining high standards of health and safety 
and for ensuring that there is appropriate employee involvement in 
decision-making. 
A European Works Council (“EWC”) has been operating since 
1996 to provide a forum for informing and consulting employees in 
Europe on such matters as signiﬁcant developments in the Group’s 
operations, management’s plans and expectations, organisational 
changes within the Group and also for employee representatives to 
consult Group management about concerns over any aspect of the 
Group’s operations. At the date of this report, there were 17 EWC 
representatives, of which 1 1 were employee representatives and six 
were management representatives. Employee representatives are 
appointed from each European country in which Wolseley operates. 
All employees are offered a range of beneﬁts depending on their 
local environment. Where possible, they are also encouraged to 
build a stake in the Company through the ownership of shares 
through participation in the Company’s employee share schemes.
Employment policies
Our employment policies aim to attract the very best people and 
we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture is a key factor in being 
a successful business. The Group remains committed to equality 
of opportunity in all of its employment practices. It is the Group’s 
policy that the selection of employees for appointment, career 
development and promotion be determined solely on the skills and 
attributes which are relevant to the job and which are in accordance 
with the laws of the country concerned, and it will progressively 
promote diversity. Ongoing training of employees and the continued 
development of their skills is of prime importance. The Group also 
has policies in place relating to the continuation of employment of, 
and appropriate retraining for, employees who become disabled.
Indemnities and insurance
The Company indemniﬁes the Directors in respect of liabilities 
incurred as a result of their ofﬁce in accordance with its Articles of 
Association and to the maximum extent permitted by Jersey law. 
Qualifying third-party indemnity provisions (to the maximum extent 
permitted by English law) were granted to all Directors in ofﬁce and to 
the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel by Wolseley plc 
(now known as Wolseley Limited) and these remain in force as at the 
date of this report. When Wolseley plc (registered in Jersey) became 
the new holding company, additional third-party indemnity provisions 
were granted by the Company, and it has granted indemnities to 
all Directors appointed since November 2010 in accordance with 
Jersey law.
There is appropriate insurance coverage in respect of legal action 
against the Directors and ofﬁcers. Neither the Company’s 
indemnities nor insurance would provide any coverage to the extent 
that a Director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Independent Auditors and audit information
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) is willing to continue 
as auditors of the Company, and resolutions concerning their 
reappointment and the determination of their remuneration will be 
proposed at the next Annual General Meeting. The Directors in ofﬁce 
at the date of this report conﬁrm that, so far as they are each aware, 
in respect of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁnancial 
year ended 31 July 2014, there is no relevant audit information of 
which PwC are unaware and each Director has taken all the steps 
that ought to have been taken as a Director to be aware, in respect 
of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁnancial year ended 
31 July 2014, of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
PwC are aware of that information.
Management report
The management report for the year, as required by the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, is incorporated within the Overview section

Political donations
At each of the Annual General Meetings held since 2002, 
shareholders have passed a resolution, as a precaution, to approve 
donations to political organisations and to incur political expenditure 
(as such terms are now deﬁned in sections 362 to 379 of the 
Companies Act 2006). Each year, the Board has conﬁrmed that it 
operates a policy of not giving any cash contribution to any political 
party in the ordinary meaning of those words and that it has no 
intention of changing that policy. In previous years this resolution 
related to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Company 
has ensured that, although registered in Jersey, it will continue to 
apply the same standards and has such provisions incorporated 
into its Articles of Association. The Directors propose to seek, once 
more, authority for the Group to make political donations and/or 
incur political expenditure for amounts not exceeding £125,000 in 
aggregate, which they might otherwise be prohibited from making 
or incurring under the provisions of Article 12 of the Company’s 
Articles of Association (equivalent to sections 362 to 379 of the 
Companies Act 2006) and which would not amount to “donations” 
in the ordinary sense of the word. This authority would last until 
the Company’s next Annual General Meeting. During the year, no 
expenditure was incurred which could be regarded as political 
in nature.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the voting rights attached to the 
Company’s ordinary shares or on the transfer of securities in the 
Company. No person holds securities in the Company carrying 
special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company 
is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting 
rights. The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by 
a special resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Share capital and voting rights
On 2 December 2013, the shares of Wolseley plc were consolidated 
on a 30 for 31 basis (“Consolidation”). Details of the authorised 
and issued share capital, together with any movements in the 
issued share capital during the year, are shown in note 26 of the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. As at 31 July 2014 there were 
266,531,797 fully paid ordinary shares of 10 
53
⁄ 66 pence each in issue 
and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Subject to the provisions of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 
and without prejudice to any rights attached to any existing shares 
or class of shares, any share may be issued with such rights and 
restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution determine 
or as the Board shall determine. Copies of the Company’s Articles 
of Association can be obtained from Companies Registry, Jersey, or 
by writing to the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel.
The Company also has a Level 1 American Depositary Receipt 
(“ADR”) programme in the USA for which Deutsche Bank Trust 
Company Americas acts as Depositary. The American Depositary 
Shares (“ADS”) which are evidenced by ADRs are traded on the USA 
over-the-counter market, where each ADS represents one-tenth of 
a Wolseley plc ordinary share.
Share options
At the time of the share Consolidation in December 2013, the 
Board determined that since the effect of a share Consolidation, 
when combined with the payment of a special dividend, was 
intended to be neutral in relation to outstanding share awards and 
options, no adjustment to such share awards and options, or any 
performance criteria in relation to them, was required. During the 
ﬁnancial year ended 31 July 2014, options were exercised pursuant 
to the Company’s share option schemes resulting in the allotment 
of 193,435 ordinary 10 
5
/ 11 pence shares prior to the Consolidation 
and 833,737 ordinary 10 
53
⁄ 66 pence shares after the Consolidation. 
A further 21,588 ordinary 10 
53
⁄ 66 pence shares have been allotted 
under these schemes since the end of the ﬁnancial year to the date 
of this report. Details of shares issued during the year are set out in 
note 26 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
UK pension schemes
Wolseley currently has two pension schemes in respect of 
employees in the United Kingdom:
(1)  Deﬁned Beneﬁt Scheme – the Wolseley Group Retirement 
Beneﬁts Plan (“Plan”) is a trust-based deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. 
It consists of two sections: the Wolseley Section and the William 
Wilson Section. Both sections have been closed to new entrants 
since 31 May 2009. Following detailed and comprehensive 
consultation it was agreed with the Trustees to close the Plan to 
future accrual from 31 December 2013. On and from 1 January 
2014, all remaining active members of the Wolseley Group 
Retirement Beneﬁts Plan transferred to the Wolseley Group 
Deﬁned Contribution Plan. There are three trustees consisting 
of an independent trustee, a member nominated trustee and a 
corporate trustee. The corporate trustees consists of six trustee 
directors and, save for David Illingworth (chairman of the trustees) 
and Ian Percy, CBE, all of the other trustee directors are 
employees of the Group.
(2)  Deﬁned Contribution Scheme – the Wolseley Group Deﬁned 
Contribution Plan is a trust-based deﬁned contribution pension 
scheme with four Company nominated trustees, one of whom is

Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information
Set out below is the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the ﬁnancial 
year ended 31 July 2014. 
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to make this report in the context of another year in 
which the Company has delivered a strong ﬁnancial performance, 
both in terms of like-for-like revenue and trading proﬁt growth, 
and excellent cash generation. Once again our experienced 
management team have driven signiﬁcant performance 
improvements during the year.
In the ﬁnancial year ended 31 July 2014 trading proﬁt grew despite 
signiﬁcant adverse foreign exchange movements, contributing to an 
increase in headline EPS from 141.0 pence in 2010/1 1 (as adjusted) 
to 196.2 pence this year. As a result, ESOP awards granted in 201 1 
have vested in full. We explain the adjustment to headline EPS in 
2010/1 1 under the heading “ESOP” on page 100.
In addition to proﬁtable growth, the Company also places a strong 
emphasis on generating cash and during the year the Company 
rebased the dividend by 15 per cent, reﬂecting the Group’s 
strong and sustainable cash ﬂows. The interim dividend paid to 
shareholders on 1 May 2014 was 25 per cent higher than last 
year and the 2014 proposed ﬁnal dividend of 55 pence per share 
is 25 per cent higher than last year. The strong cash and proﬁt 
performance underpinned the bonus payments to the Executive 
Directors for the year which averaged 91. 1 per cent of their maximum 
levels. In the three years to 31 July 2014, Total Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”) growth enjoyed by shareholders was 21.02 per cent. As a 
result, the Company achieved a TSR ranking of sixteenth against 
our FTSE 100 comparator group and so 88.2 per cent of the 
performance shares awarded under the LTIP in 201 1 have vested.
Key decisions
During the year the Committee continued to review its approach 
to Executive Director remuneration. The Company’s strategy 
to deliver long-term sustainable and proﬁtable growth remains 
unchanged. The remuneration policy is designed to support the 
delivery of this strategy through providing a “pay for performance” 
remuneration package to Executive Directors which reﬂects their 
contribution to the business, the performance of the Group, the size 
and complexity of the Group’s operations and the need to attract 
and retain executives.
The Company’s continued strong ﬁnancial performance, and 
consistent year-on-year incremental improvement in key ﬁnancial 
measures such as like-for-like revenue, gross margins, trading 
margin and cash generation, demonstrate the importance of 
management’s continuing focus on delivering against a clear 
Alan Murray
Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
Remuneration Report introduction
For the year ended 31 July 2014
strategy supported by a remuneration policy which provides an 
appropriate balance between ﬁxed and variable pay. The Committee 
has therefore decided that the Company’s remuneration policy will 
remain largely unchanged for 2014/15. 
However, the Committee also concluded that, as the Group’s 
business, its markets and the executive remuneration landscape 
continues to evolve, a further more detailed review of remuneration 
should be undertaken. The aims of the review include the 
simpliﬁcation of remuneration structures and ensuring that, over 
the long term, they remain appropriate to retain and attract talented 
executives in a highly competitive labour market. We recognise 
the need to continue to attract management with skills and 
experience which reﬂect current and future developments in the 
markets in which the Group’s businesses operate. We expect to 
conclude the review by the end of 2014, consult with shareholders 
regarding the outcome of the review in early 2015 and make any 
changes during 2015/16. 
In addition, the Committee made the following key decisions in 
the year:
 Executive Directors’ base salaries have been increased by 
2 per cent, which is broadly in line with the average annual 
base salary increases for all Wolseley employees. The fee paid 
to the Chairman of the Board was not increased for the fourth 
consecutive year and the Board determined that there would be 
no increase in Non Executive Directors’ fees.
 The weighting of performance criteria for the annual bonus plan 
would continue to be set at 80 per cent for ﬁnancial measures 
and 20 per cent for personal objectives. From 2014/15, we have 
introduced an additional ﬁnancial target based on gross proﬁt 
growth, which is aimed at enhancing the link between the bonus 
incentive and the Company’s strategy of delivering long-term 
sustainable and proﬁtable growth.
 In line with best practice, we have adjusted our policy so that 
the annual bonus plan for Executive Directors will from 2014/15 
include the ability to reduce or reclaim all or part of bonus awards 
in certain situations, commonly referred to as “malus” and 
“clawback” provisions.
New Remuneration Reporting Regulations
The Committee decided last year, as a matter of good governance, 
to meet the requirements of the new Remuneration Reporting 
Regulations, although the Company is not required to do so as a 
Jersey registered company. In addition to this annual statement, 
the Remuneration Report contains the Policy on remuneration 
and the annual report on remuneration. As explained above, 
the remuneration policy is largely unchanged. This year we have 
also included the policy for the recruitment of Directors and 
payments for loss of ofﬁce. 
Separate resolutions will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
to approve the Policy and the rest of the Remuneration Report. 
The new Remuneration Reporting Regulations contain provisions 
which make shareholder approval of the Policy of UK-incorporated 
companies binding. As the Company is not UK-incorporated those 
provisions have no legal effect. However, the Company has taken  Wolseley plc

Remuneration Report introduction continued
steps to limit the power of the Remuneration Committee so that, with 
effect from the date on which the Policy on remuneration is approved 
by shareholders, the Committee can only authorise remuneration 
payments or payments for loss of ofﬁce in respect of the Chairman 
and the Executive Directors that it honestly and reasonably believes 
are consistent with the Policy as approved by shareholders. 
In that way the Company considers the vote of shareholders on 
the Policy to be binding in its application to the Chairman and 
Executive Directors.
Looking ahead
I am delighted that the Board have appointed three new Non 
Executive Directors during the year. Details of their remuneration are 
set out on page 95.
I handed over the responsibilities of my role as Chairman of the 
Committee to Jacky Simmonds at the end of July 2014. Jacky has 
extensive specialist knowledge and experience in the area of 
executive remuneration and is leading the review of remuneration 
structure. Given the continued prominence of executive 
remuneration in corporate governance, it is clear that Jacky’s 
experience in this area will be a signiﬁcant beneﬁt to the Company.
We hope to receive your support at the Annual General Meeting 
and I, together with Jacky, will be available to respond to any 
questions shareholders may have on this report or any of the 
Committee’s activities.

Base salary
 To pay Executive Directors at a level 
commensurate with their contribution 
to the Company and appropriately 
based on skill, experience and 
performance achieved.
 The level of salary paid should be set 
at a level that is considered appropriate 
to aid the recruitment, retention and 
motivation of high calibre Executive 
Directors required to ensure the 
successful formation and delivery of the 
Group’s strategy and management of its 
business in the international environment 
in which it operates.
 Base salary is normally set at or around the mid-market level of other companies comparable 
on the basis of size, internationality and complexity with the opportunity to exceed this level to 
reward sustained individual high performance. 
 Base salary is paid monthly in cash in the currency speciﬁed in the employment contract.
 Base salary may be increased each year typically in line with the general level of increase 
awarded to other employees in the Group. There is an annual review by the Committee taking 
into account individual and corporate performance, percentage increases awarded to the 
general workforce, prevailing market and economic conditions and governance practices. 
 The Committee retains the ﬂexibility to award larger increases than those awarded to the 
general workforce where it considers it appropriate and necessary (such as in exceptional 
circumstances or if an individual assumes signiﬁcantly more responsibility). If it is considered 
appropriate larger increases may be phased over more than one year.
 The Committee retains the ﬂexibility to review and decide on a case-by-case basis whether it 
is appropriate to award increases to allow a newly appointed Executive Director whose base 
salary has been set below the mid-market level to progress quickly to or around that mid-
market level once expertise and performance has been proven.
 The base salaries for the Executive Directors for the current year are set out in the Annual 
report on remuneration.
Framework to assess performance measures and for recovery of sums paid
Assessment of performance measures: the Committee considers the individual salaries of the Executive Directors at a Committee meeting 
each year taking into account the factors listed in the “Operation and opportunity” section above.
Recovery of sums paid or the withholding of any payment to be made relating to base salary: there are no provisions for the recovery of 
sums paid or the withholding of any payment relating to base salary.
Remuneration policy
1. Introduction
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Regulations. It sets out the Policy which will 
be put forward for shareholder approval at the AGM on 25 November 2014 and will apply, subject to such shareholder approval, to any 
remuneration and loss of ofﬁce payments made on or after 25 November 2014. All remuneration and loss of ofﬁce payments will only be 
made if they are consistent with the approved Policy. Details of how the Company will implement the Policy set out below from 1 August 2014 
are provided in the Annual report on remuneration section starting on page 94.
This section of the Report contains details of the Company’s remuneration policy to govern future payments that the Company will make to 
Directors. Within this section are:

 Recruitment policy
 Policy on loss of ofﬁce
 Details of discretion, ﬂexibility and judgement of the Committee
 Legacy arrangements
 Matters considered when determining the Policy
 Illustrations of the Policy
The Policy is broadly unchanged from last year. The Company’s policy as it applies to Executive Directors is to provide a package that is 
sufﬁcient to attract, retain and treat fairly Executive Directors currently in position or any new Executive Director, whether hired externally or 
promoted from within the Wolseley Group. The Committee will consider the need to attract the right talent whilst aiming to pay no more than 
is appropriate. In determining each element of pay and the package as a whole, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors 
including, but not limited to, the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for an individual of that experience, as well as the 
importance of securing the best person for the role.

sterling. The calculations are made based on the annual average 
exchange rate for the year ended 31 July 2014 of $1.6422:£1 
(for the year ended 31 July 2013 $1.5641:£1); and
(2)  any estimated share values are determined using a share price 
of 3279 pence, being the average closing mid-market quotation 
for Wolseley plc shares for the three month period ended 
31 July 2014. 
Executive Directors
Base salary
The Remuneration Committee agreed to an increase to the base 
salary levels of the Executive Directors with effect from 1 August 
2014, as set out below. Current base salary levels, and those which 
applied during the year ended 31 July 2014, are as follows:
Annualised base salary
2014/15 2013/14 % increase
I Meakins £847,129 £830,519 2%
J Martin £524,674 £514,386 2%
F Roach £650,163 1 £637 ,415 2 2%
1  The total to be received by Frank Roach in 2014/15 will be paid in US dollars as $1,067 ,698. 
2  The total received by Frank Roach in 2013/14 was paid in US dollars as $1,046,763.
Pension and beneﬁts
UK-based Executive Directors receive a salary supplement in lieu 
of membership of the Group pension scheme, being 32 per cent of 
base salary for Ian Meakins and 25 per cent of base salary for John 
Martin. USA-based Executive Director, Frank Roach, participates 
in the Ferguson deﬁned contribution pension arrangements and 
receives a Company contribution of 23 per cent of base salary.
Bonus payments are not included in the calculation of the Company 
pension contributions. Beneﬁts provided to Executive Directors are 
detailed in the Remuneration table on page 98.
Annual bonus
The threshold, target and maximum bonus opportunities for the 
Executive Directors are set out in the table below. 
Threshold Target Maximum
As % of salary
I Meakins 80% 100% 120%
J Martin 70% 90% 1 10%
F Roach 80% 1 10% 140%
Performance targets are set as 80 per cent on ﬁnancial performance 
(20 per cent is based on cash-to-cash days, 30 per cent on trading 
proﬁt and 30 per cent on gross proﬁt) and 20 per cent on personal 
strategic objectives. Speciﬁc individual objectives were set at the 
beginning of the 2014/15 ﬁnancial year.
For the 2014/15 ﬁnancial year, the threshold for bonus payments 
in relation to ongoing trading proﬁt will be set at or above the 
outturn trading proﬁt for the 2013/14 ﬁnancial year on a constant 
currency basis. 
The Board considers that the performance targets for 2014/15 are 
commercially sensitive and they are not included for this reason. 
The Committee will consider disclosing the targets and performance 
against them in the Annual report on remuneration next year, 
depending on considerations of commercial sensitivity at that time.
Long term incentives
Long term incentive awards will be made during the 2014/15 ﬁnancial 
year at the levels set out in the table below:
LTIP (award value as % of salary)
ESOP (award value as % of salary)
I Meakins 200% 250%
J Martin 150% 225%
F Roach 130% 175%
Consistent with past awards, the extent to which the LTIP and ESOP 
awards (to be granted in November 2014) will vest will be dependent 
on the comparative TSR target in respect of the LTIP , and EPS 
growth targets in respect of the ESOP .
The LTIP awards will vest as set out in the table below: 
Wolseley’s TSR position in comparator group 1 Percentage of award  which will vest

Taxable beneﬁts
 To provide a range of market competitive 
beneﬁts to encourage the recruitment 
and retention of high quality Executive 
Directors and which enable an Executive 
Director to perform his or her duties.
 A range of beneﬁts are provided by the Company to Executive Directors that, depending on 
the location of the individual, may include:
 – life assurance cover;
 – critical illness cover;
 – private medical cover for Executive Directors and their dependants;
 – car, driver, car allowance;
 – professional tax and ﬁnancial advice (including assistance in relation to tax ﬁlings); 
 – relocation assistance; 
 – tax equalisation arrangements in relation to additional international tax and social security 
contributions; and
 – other reasonable ancillary beneﬁts, where necessary.
 In addition, Executive Directors have the beneﬁt of Directors’ and Ofﬁcers’ Liability Insurance 
and an indemnity from the Company.
 It is expected that an Executive Director would receive reasonable levels of beneﬁts 
consistent with those typically offered in his or her country of residence.
 Beneﬁts are typically paid monthly and their value assessed at the end of each ﬁnancial year 
for tax purposes.
 Beneﬁts are monitored, controlled and reviewed on a periodic basis.
 The Committee retains the ﬂexibility to offer additional beneﬁts where appropriate. This would 
be reviewed on a case-by-case basis due to the position and circumstances of the 
relevant Executive Director (e.g. if an Executive Director is asked to relocate, or is recruited, 
from overseas). 
 The beneﬁts for the Executive Directors for the current year are set out in the Annual report 
on remuneration.
Framework to assess performance measures and for recovery of sums paid
Assessment of performance measures: not applicable.
Recovery of sums paid or the withholding of any payment to be made relating to beneﬁts: there are no provisions for the recovery of sums 
paid or the withholding of any payment relating to beneﬁts.
Pension
 To provide a market-competitive 
beneﬁt for retirement which rewards 
sustained contribution and to encourage 
the recruitment and retention of high 
performing Executive Directors.
 Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the relevant pension arrangements offered by 
the Group or to receive a cash salary supplement in lieu of pension entitlement.
 Pension or cash salary supplement is paid monthly.
 The entitlement is reviewed annually and may be increased each year.
 The maximum opportunity, either by way of a Company contribution to a Group pension 
arrangement or payment of a cash salary supplement, is 32 per cent of base salary.

Annual bonus
 To reward achievement of annual 
ﬁnancial and operational goals 
consistent with the strategic direction of 
the business.
 Executive Directors are eligible (subject to invitation at the discretion of the Committee in 
consultation with the Group Chief Executive, other than in relation to his own arrangements) 
to receive a bonus which is based on an assessment of ﬁnancial and personal performance 
in the relevant ﬁnancial year.
 Annual bonus shall be paid in cash annually and is not pensionable. 
 Annual bonus is reviewed annually and opportunity available may be adjusted each year up 
to the maximum. 
 The maximum opportunity is 140 per cent of base salary. The annual bonus opportunities for 
the Executive Directors for the current year are set out in the Annual report on remuneration. 
Maximum threshold performance and maximum on-target performance levels are set as a 
percentage of base salary.
 All bonus payments are determined by the Committee.
 Details of the actual vesting for maximum, threshold and target performance percentages 
for each Executive Director for the current year as well as details of performance criteria set 
for the year under review and performance against them are provided in the Annual report 
on remuneration.
Framework to assess performance measures and for recovery of sums paid
Assessment of performance measures: ﬁnancial key performance indicators are used. Performance measures, targets and weightings are 
reviewed annually. They will be set each year by the Committee with reference to the Group’s annual budget, business priorities at the time 
and also the long-term strategic business plan, as well as market expectations of the Company’s future performance. They are intended 
to align the performance of Executive Directors with the Group’s near-term objectives of delivering against its strategy, in particular: proﬁt-
related measures support the strategic objectives of driving systematic performance across the Group, the acceleration of proﬁtable growth 
and delivering Group synergies; the cash generation-related measure helps the Group to maintain a strong balance sheet; and individual 
personal objectives allow the Committee to prioritise individual initiatives which are particularly relevant in any year to support the Group’s 
strategy. At least 80 per cent of maximum bonus is weighted to ﬁnancial performance and not more than 20 per cent of maximum bonus 
is weighted to personal objectives aimed at driving the strategic objectives of the business.
Recovery of sums paid or the withholding of any payment to be made relating to annual bonus: the Committee has the right to clawback 
from Executive Directors any bonus paid for the 2014/15 ﬁnancial year and beyond at any time before the ﬁrst anniversary of the 
announcement of the results for the ﬁnancial year to which the annual bonus relates in the following circumstances: (a) the Committee 
forms the view that there has been a material misstatement of the Company’s audited ﬁnancial accounts (other than as a result of a change 
in accounting practice) and that such misstatement resulted either directly or indirectly in a higher cash bonus payment being made than 
would have been the case had that misstatement not been made; and/or (b) it is discovered that, during the ﬁnancial year in respect of 
which the bonus is paid, the relevant individual (i) committed misconduct which resulted in signiﬁcant reputational damage to the Company; 
or (ii) was guilty of negligence, fraud or gross misconduct. 
Executive Share Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) and Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) (together the “LTI plans”)
 To align the interests of Executive 
Directors and shareholders in 
developing the long-term growth of 
the Group and delivering the Group’s 
strategy through facilitating the building 
of a long-term shareholding in the 
Company and making the performance 
measures consistent with the 
achievement of strategic objectives. 
 Executive Directors are eligible to receive ESOP and LTIP grants (subject to selection by the 
Committee) each year.
ESOP
 Awards are made annually in each ﬁnancial 
year in accordance with the plan rules and 
are structured as market value share options 
using the market price at the date of grant. 
They are not pensionable.
 Awards are subject to performance 
conditions measured over at least three 
ﬁnancial years, typically starting with the 
ﬁnancial year in which the grant takes place.
LTIP
 Awards are made annually in each ﬁnancial 
year in accordance with the plan rules and 
are structured as nil cost options, restricted 
shares, conditional shares or phantom 
shares. They are not pensionable.
 Awards are subject to the Company 
meeting TSR targets measured over at 
least three ﬁnancial years, typically starting 
with the ﬁnancial year in which the grant 
takes place. Wolseley plc

 The Committee retains the discretion 
to award up to the maximum award 
that may be granted under the plan

 Dividends may accrue on the shares which are 
the subject of the award during the performance 
period (to the extent they vest) and will be paid 
as an additional cash sum or by the transfer of 
additional shares to the individual in accordance 
with the plan rules.
 The LTIP awards granted to the Executive 
Directors in the current year are set out in the 
Annual report on remuneration.
Framework to assess performance measures and for recovery of sums paid
Assessment of performance measures: for both ESOP and LTIP , metrics are assessed each year by the Committee prior to grant to ensure 
they remain appropriate. The Committee may introduce alternative or additional measures but would consult with major shareholders 
before doing so. The Committee may also vary weightings between measures and the targets from a previous year although the metrics 
will not be materially less challenging than those contained in the applicable plan rules.
ESOP
At the time of setting the Company’s ﬁrst Policy, ESOP awards 
are subject to EPS growth targets. 
The Committee sets the EPS growth range taking into account 
the Group’s strategic objectives, strategic plan, budget, market 
expectations of the Company’s ﬁnancial performance and the 
economic and trading environment in which the Group operates.
The performance measure of EPS is considered to be 
appropriate for share options as it requires substantial 
improvement in the Group’s ﬁnancial performance and 
complements the inherent requirement for share price growth 
for a market value option to have value.
The EPS performance measure supports the achievement of 
proﬁt growth, cash generation and maximising shareholder value, 
and is linked in particular to the strategic objectives of driving 
systematic performance across the Group, the acceleration 
of proﬁtable growth and delivering Group synergies, and is 
aligned to the creation of shareholder value.
LTIP
At the time of setting the Company’s ﬁrst Policy, LTIP awards are 
subject to relative TSR performance targets.
The Committee bases the relative TSR targets on a list of comparator 
companies, being the full constituent members of the FTSE 100 at the 
respective date of grant, with no additions or exclusions.
The performance measure of TSR is considered to be appropriate 
for long term incentive plan interests to ensure that the interests of the 
Executive Director are closely aligned with those of the Company’s 
shareholders over the long term and to incentivise outperformance 
of the Company relative to its peers.
The TSR performance condition supports the achievement of 
proﬁt growth, cash generation, maximising shareholder value and 
relative outperformance of its peer group, and is linked in particular 
to the strategic objectives of driving systematic performance across 
the Group, the acceleration of proﬁtable growth, delivering Group 
synergies and, through cash generation, the maintenance of a strong 
balance sheet.
Recovery of sums paid or the withholding of any payment to be made relating to 2012 LTI plans: for awards granted from December 2012 
onwards, the Committee may, in its discretion, decide that any cash payable or shares awarded be reduced or any future awards be 
reduced or future grants not be made in any of the following circumstances: (i) a material ﬁnancial misstatement of the Company’s audited 
ﬁnancial accounts (other than as a result of a change in accounting practice); (ii) the misconduct of an award participant which results 
in or is reasonably likely to result in signiﬁcant reputational damage to the Company; or (iii) the negligence, fraud or gross misconduct of 
a participant. Wolseley plc

Future policy table: Executive Directors (continued)
All-employee share plans
 To allow Directors to voluntarily invest in 
the Company.
 Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the Company’s all employee Sharesave plan 
applicable to the jurisdiction in which they are based. 
 A North America-based Executive Director may make monthly savings over a period of 
one year linked to the grant of an option over Wolseley plc shares with an option price at a 
discount of up to 15 per cent of the market value of the shares at grant. Grants are currently 
made under the ESPP . A UK or Europe-based Executive Director may make monthly savings 
over a period of three or ﬁve years linked to the grant of an option over Wolseley plc shares 
with an option price at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market value of the shares at 
grant. Grants are currently made under the ISP .
 Maximum opportunity under the rules of both plans is £500 (or local currency equivalent) 
per month. At the time of this Policy, the Board has currently set the savings limit at £250 per 
month. The limit will be reviewed by the Board and set annually at an amount up to, but not 
exceeding, the maximum opportunity.
Framework to assess performance measures and for recovery of sums paid
Assessment of performance measures: not applicable as this is an all-employee share savings plan (without performance measures) 
offered to all employees.
Recovery of sums paid or the withholding of any payment to be made relating to all-employee share plans: there are no provisions for the 
recovery of sums paid or the withholding of any payment relating to all-employee share savings plan or share grants.
Shareholding guidelines
 To encourage all Directors to build up a 
shareholding in value equivalent to a set 
multiple of base salary or fees.
 To align interests of Directors and 
shareholders in developing the 
long-term growth of the business 
and the execution and delivery of the 
Group’s strategy.
 All Directors are required to hold shares equivalent in value to a prescribed percentage 
of their base salary.
 All Directors are advised of a target, a timeline to achieve the target and requirements 
for maintaining the shareholding in line with salary or fees increases.
 For Executive Directors, share ownership may be achieved by retaining shares received 
as a result of participating in a Company share plan, after taking into account any shares 
sold to ﬁnance option exercises and/or to pay tax, social security and similar liabilities.
 Details of the actual guidelines and targets are set out in the Annual report on remuneration.
Framework to assess performance measures and for recovery of sums paid
Assessment of performance measures: not applicable as these are guidelines for holding shares and not a form of remuneration.
Recovery of sums paid or the withholding of any payment to be made relating to shareholding guidelines: there are no provisions for the 
recovery of sums paid or the withholding of any payment relating to shareholding guidelines.
Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees
The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors differs from that of other Executive Committee members only in respect of the quantum of 
the components of remuneration and that Executive Committee members who are not also Executive Directors may also participate in the 
Group’s Ordinary Share Plan (“OSP”). Currently, the Group’s other senior managers broadly receive the same components of remuneration 
as the Executive Committee members, except that no awards are made to them under the ESOP or the LTIP . Awards are made under 
the Group’s OSP to a small proportion of the Group’s employees who are nominated annually based on their performance and potential. 
The wider employee population of the Group will receive remuneration that is considered to be appropriate for their geographic location, role, 
level of responsibility and performance. Wolseley plc

Future policy table: Non Executive Directors
Fees
 To remunerate Non Executive Directors 
to reﬂect their level of responsibility. 
 The Chairman is paid a basic fee determined by the Committee. 
 Non Executive Directors are paid a basic fee. Additional fees are paid for the roles of 
Senior Independent Director, Chairman of the Audit Committee and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. 
 Fees for Non Executive Directors, other than the Chairman, are determined by the Chairman 
and the Executive Directors at a Board meeting. Additional fees for Non Executive Directors 
for duties beyond those stated above may be payable, at the discretion of the Board, from 
time to time to reﬂect the time and responsibility involved.
 The maximum aggregate of fees for all Non Executive Directors, including the Chairman, 
allowed by the Company’s Articles of Association is £1 million per annum or such higher 
amount as the Company may determine by ordinary resolution.
 The Committee, in relation to the Chairman, and the Board, in relation to the other Non 
Executive Directors, retain the ﬂexibility to increase fee levels to ensure that they continue to 
appropriately recognise the experience of the individual, time commitment of the role, increases 
to fee levels of Chairmen and Non Executive Directors generally and fee levels in comparable 
companies. Fee increases, if applicable, are normally effective from 1 August each year.

3. Recruitment Policy
Executive Directors
As noted earlier, the Committee will consider the need to attract 
the right talent whilst aiming to pay no more than is appropriate or 
necessary. In determining each element of pay and the package as 
a whole upon recruitment, the Committee will take into account all 
relevant factors including, but not limited to, the skills and experience 
of the individual, the market rate for an individual of that experience, 
as well as the importance of securing the best person for the role.
Fixed pay (base salary, beneﬁts, pension)
New Executive Directors will be offered a base salary, beneﬁts 
and pension package in line with the Policy set out on pages 85 to 
86. The Committee retains the ﬂexibility to review and decide on a 
case-by-case basis whether it is appropriate to award increases to 
allow a newly appointed Executive Director whose base salary has 
been set below the mid-market level to progress quickly to or around 
that mid-market level once expertise and performance has been 
proven. This decision would take into account all relevant factors 
noted above.
Variable pay (annual bonus and long term incentive awards)
A newly appointed Executive Director will be offered an annual 
bonus and long term incentives in line with the policy set out on 
pages 87 to 89. The maximum level of variable remuneration 
(annual bonus, ESOP and LTIP awards) which may be awarded to 
new Executive Directors is limited to 640 per cent of base salary 
excluding any buy out awards, the policy for which is set out below. 
The Committee retains the ﬂexibility to vary the weighting between 
annual bonus, ESOP and LTIP plans.
Where an appointment is an internal promotion, any variable 
pay element awarded in respect of the individual’s previous role 
would continue on the original grant terms. In addition, any other 
ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to the appointment 
would continue.
One-off “buy out” cash or share award
Where an Executive Director is appointed from outside the Group, 
the Committee may make a one-off award to the new Executive 
Director to “buy out” incentives and other remuneration opportunities 
forfeited on leaving his or her previous employer. The Committee 
retains the ﬂexibility to make such additional payments in the form 
of cash and/or shares. 
When making such an award, the Committee will, as far as 
practicable, replicate the arrangements being forfeited and in 
doing so will take into account relevant factors including the 
delivery mechanism, time horizons, attributed expected value and 
performance conditions of the forfeited award. The Committee will 
endeavour not to pay more than the value of the forfeited award.
Non Executive Directors
For the appointment of a Chairman or Non Executive Director, 
fee arrangements will be made in line with the policy set out on 
page 90.
4. Policy on loss of ofﬁce
All Directors
In the event of termination of a service contract or letter of 
appointment of a Director, contractual obligations will be honoured 
in accordance with the service contract or letter of appointment. 
The Committee will take into consideration the circumstances and 
reasons for departure, health, length of service, performance and 
the duty (where applicable) for Directors to mitigate their own loss. 
Under this Policy the Committee may make any statutory payments 
it is required to make. In addition, the Committee may agree to 
payment of outplacement counselling costs and disbursements 
(such as legal costs) if considered to be appropriate and dependent 
on the circumstances of departure.
There are no pre-determined contractual provisions for Directors 
regarding compensation in the event of loss of ofﬁce except those 
listed in the table below:
Details of 
provision Executive Directors
Chairman and Non 
Executive Directors
Notice 
period
 12 months’ notice from 
the Company.
 Six months’ notice from 
the Executive.
Six months’ 
notice by either 
party.
Termination 
payment
 The Company may terminate 
an Executive Director’s service 
contract by making a payment 
in lieu of notice equal to:
 – 12 months’ base salary and 
beneﬁts; and
 – 12 months’ cash 
pension supplement.
 The Company would seek to 
ensure that any termination 
payment is mitigated in the 
event that the Executive starts 
alternative employment within 
the notice period.
 In the case of the UK-based 
Executive Directors the Company 
may pay a six-month lump sum 
and the remaining six months in 
monthly instalments subject to the 
Executive commencing alternative 
employment with a base salary/fee 
of at least £20,000.
 No payment will be made to 
Executive Directors in the event 
of gross misconduct.
Fees and 
expenses 
accrued up to 
the termination 
date only.
Post-
termination 
covenants
 Non-compete and non-solicitation 
covenants apply for a period 
of 12 months after the 
termination date. 
Not applicable. Wolseley plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 92
Overview | Strategic report | Governance | Financials | Shareholder information
Remuneration policy continued
Executive Directors
There is no automatic entitlement to a bonus. Executive Directors 
may receive a bonus in respect of the year of cessation based on, 
and subject to, performance conditions and pro-rated to reﬂect the 
actual period of service in the year of cessation. The Committee will 
take into account the reason for the Executive Director’s departure 
and any other relevant factors when considering a bonus payment 
of a departing Executive Director.
The treatment of leavers under the LTIP and ESOP plans would be 
determined by the relevant leaver provisions in accordance with 
the plan rules. Under the 2012 and 2010 LTIP and ESOP plans, any 
unvested awards will lapse at cessation unless the individual has 
“good leaver” status (namely redundancy, injury, disability, ill health, 
employing business or company sold out of the Group and any 
other reason at the discretion of the Committee). The Committee 
retains the discretion to determine when the awards should vest 
and performance conditions be tested, for example, at the date of 
cessation or at the usual vesting date. In the event of a change of 
control or takeover all long term incentive awards will vest subject 
to performance conditions being met. In relation to the LTI plans, 
awards would generally be pro-rated to reﬂect the period of service 
of the Executive Director although, if the Committee considers it 
appropriate, the Committee has the discretion set out in the plan 
rules not to pro-rate.
5. Discretion, ﬂexibility and judgement of 
the Committee 
The Committee operates the annual bonus and LTI plans, according 
to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC rules where 
relevant. To ensure the efﬁcient administration of those plans, the 
Committee may apply certain operational discretions. These include 
the following:
 selecting the participants in the plans on an annual basis;
 determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payment;
 determining the quantum of awards and/or payments (within the 
limits set out in the Policy table above);
 determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment 
of performance;
 making the appropriate adjustments required in certain 
circumstances (e.g. change of control, changes to accounting rules, 
rights issues, corporate restructuring events, and special dividends); 
 determining “good leaver” status for the purposes of the LTI plans 
and applying the appropriate treatment; and
 undertaking the annual review of performance measures and 
weighting between them (within the limits set out in the Policy 
table), and setting targets for the annual bonus plan and LTI plans 
from year to year.
If an event occurs which results in the performance conditions and/
or targets of the annual bonus plan or LTI plans being deemed no 
longer appropriate (e.g. a material acquisition or divestment), the 
Committee will have the ability to adjust appropriately the measures 
and/or targets and alter weightings, provided that the revised 
conditions or targets are not materially less difﬁcult to satisfy.
The use of the discretions referred to in the future policy table and 
above will be explained as appropriate in the Annual report on 
remuneration and may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultation 
with major shareholders. 
6. Legacy arrangements
In approving this Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour 
commitments paid, promised to be paid or awarded to (i) current 
or former Directors prior to the date of this Policy being approved 
or (ii) to an individual (who subsequently is appointed as a Director 
of the Company) at a time when the relevant individual was not a 
Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, was 
not in consideration of that individual becoming a Director of the 
Company, even where such commitments are inconsistent with 
the provisions of the Policy. Outstanding share awards that remain 
unvested or unexercised at the date of this report which were 
granted prior to 27 June 2012, as detailed on page 103 of the Annual 
report on remuneration, remain eligible for vesting or exercise based 
on their original award terms.
7 . Matters considered when determining the Policy
Shareholder views 
The Committee’s aim is to have an ongoing and open dialogue with 
major shareholders. The Chairman of the Committee will usually 
meet at least annually with major shareholders and shareholder 
representative bodies to discuss the business and executive 
remuneration more widely. When any material changes are proposed 
to remuneration policy, the Chairman of the Committee will inform 
major shareholders in advance, and offer a meeting to discuss the 
proposed changes. This shareholder engagement highlights the fact 
that the Committee recognises the importance of understanding 
shareholders’ views and ensuring that they are considered when 
making decisions regarding Policy. The Committee also considers 
shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year. 
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group 
and other matters determining policy
Our policy for both Executive Directors and employees across the 
Group is to provide remuneration at mid-market levels. On promotion 
or appointment, senior executives may be initially remunerated 
below market levels and then increased to mid-market levels over 
time, once performance has been established. The emphasis on the 
various elements of pay within the Policy varies depending on the role 
of the individual within the Group. Where possible, employees are 
encouraged to hold shares in Wolseley, thereby providing alignment 
with shareholders and beneﬁting from any growth in value of the 
Group but through different delivery mechanisms. For the Executive 
Directors, a greater emphasis is placed on performance-related pay.
The Committee does not consult with employees when determining 
the Policy. The Committee considers the basic salary increase, 
remuneration arrangements and employment conditions for the broader 
employee population when determining the remuneration policy for 
the Executive Directors. It also takes account of market developments, 
the wider economic environment, good corporate governance 
practices, remuneration data and its responsibilities to its shareholders. 
This information is taken into account by providing context and informing 
the Committee of the market in which they are making decisions. Group Chief Executive: Ian Meakins

8. Illustrations of the Remuneration Policy 
(2014/15)
The charts give an indication of the level of remuneration that would 
be received by each Executive Director in accordance with the 
Policy in respect of minimum (ﬁxed pay), on-target and maximum 
performance and based on assumptions set out on this page. 
The assumptions do not incorporate any share price appreciation or 
payment of dividend equivalents.
Scenario assumptions
In arriving at the scenarios, the following assumptions have been 
made in relation to the ﬁxed elements of remuneration:
 Base salary for 2014/15.
 Beneﬁts received for 2013/14 (as set out in the Remuneration table 
on page 98).
 Pension using the current policy (as set out in the Implementation 
of Policy for the year ending 31 July 2015 on page 94 and applied 
to 2014/15 base salary).
For the non-ﬁxed elements of remuneration:
 In relation to the annual bonus, the scenarios are based on 
bonus opportunity in accordance with implementation of the 
remuneration policy for 2014/15.
 In relation to LTIP and ESOP awards, the scenarios are based on 
the awards to be made in accordance with implementation of the 
remuneration policy for 2014/15.
In each case the assumptions for on-target and maximum 
performance are applied as in the table below.

to apply as, at the time of exercise, an individual pays the option price of the shares determined at 
the time of grant.

Executive Directors are set out in the table below. 
Threshold Target Maximum
As % of salary
I Meakins 80% 100% 120%
J Martin 70% 90% 1 10%
F Roach 80% 1 10% 140%
Performance targets are set as 80 per cent on ﬁnancial performance 
(20 per cent is based on cash-to-cash days, 30 per cent on trading 
proﬁt and 30 per cent on gross proﬁt) and 20 per cent on personal 
strategic objectives. Speciﬁc individual objectives were set at the 
beginning of the 2014/15 ﬁnancial year.
For the 2014/15 ﬁnancial year, the threshold for bonus payments 
in relation to ongoing trading proﬁt will be set at or above the 
outturn trading proﬁt for the 2013/14 ﬁnancial year on a constant 
currency basis. 
The Board considers that the performance targets for 2014/15 are 
commercially sensitive and they are not included for this reason. 
The Committee will consider disclosing the targets and performance 
against them in the Annual report on remuneration next year, 
depending on considerations of commercial sensitivity at that time.
Long term incentives
Long term incentive awards will be made during the 2014/15 ﬁnancial 
year at the levels set out in the table below:
LTIP
(award value as
% of salary)
ESOP
(award value as
% of salary)
I Meakins 200% 250%
J Martin 150% 225%
F Roach 130% 175%
Consistent with past awards, the extent to which the LTIP and ESOP 
awards (to be granted in November 2014) will vest will be dependent 
on the comparative TSR target in respect of the LTIP , and EPS 
growth targets in respect of the ESOP .
The LTIP awards will vest as set out in the table below:

Advisers to the Committee
During the year, the Committee received advice and/or services 
from various parties. Details of such advice and/or services, the 
remuneration paid for their services to the Committee and other 
services they provided to the Company are set out below.
New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited and part 
of Aon plc) (“NBS”) is the Committee’s independent remuneration 
consultant. The Committee has established arrangements to 
ensure that the advice received from NBS is independent of 
the advice provided to the Company. NBS meets and speaks 
with the Remuneration Committee Chairman periodically through 
the year to discuss remuneration matters which are of particular 
relevance to the Company, and how best it can work with the 
Company to meet the Committee’s needs. NBS is a signatory 
to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct and has 
conﬁrmed to the Committee that it adheres to the Code. NBS also 
provided remuneration consultancy services to the Company during 
the year. The Committee reviewed the performance of NBS in 
November 2013. The Committee was satisﬁed with its performance 
and that advice received from NBS was independent and objective, 
and reappointed NBS as its remuneration adviser. Fees are charged 
predominantly on a “time spent” basis and the total fees paid 
to NBS for the advice provided to the Committee during the year 
was £192,500.
Alithos Limited (“Alithos”) provided information to the Committee for 
the testing of the TSR performance conditions for the LTIP awards 
and also provided the TSR performance graphs for the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. They received total ﬁxed fees of £23,250. 
Fees were charged as a ﬁxed annual rate. Alithos was appointed 
by the Company for both services as it was considered to have the 
relevant expertise and experience. Alithos did not provide any other 
advice or services during the year and so the Committee considers 
Alithos to be objective and independent.
Freshﬁelds Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (“Freshﬁelds”) provided legal 
advice to the Committee during the year in relation to amendments 
to the rules of the OSP . Fees are charged predominantly on a 
“time spent” basis and the total fees paid to Freshﬁelds for the 
advice provided to the Committee during the year was £10,485. 
Freshﬁelds was appointed by the Company and provided other 
services to the Company during the year. The Committee is satisﬁed 
that the services provided to it by Freshﬁelds are of a technical nature 
and did not create any conﬂict of interest and therefore the advice 
received from them was objective and independent. If a conﬂict of 
interest were to arise, the Committee would appoint separate legal 
advisers from those used by the Company.
In addition, by invitation the Group HR Director and the Group Chief 
Executive attended the meetings during the year, together with 
other senior Group employees who attended from time to time. 
They provided relevant advice to the Committee when requested. 
The Group HR Director and the Group Chief Executive did 
not participate in discussions concerning the details of their 
own remuneration. Wolseley plc

car, driver), tax and ﬁnancial advice and tax equalisation arrangements.
2  The LTIP and ESOP grants made in November 2011 will vest at 88.2 per cent for the LTIP award 
and at 100 per cent for the ESOP awards in November 2014. 
3  The ﬁgure for total remuneration includes share price appreciation for the value of LTI vesting. 
As the LTIP and ESOP grants made in November 2011 will not vest until November 2014, the 
values of long term incentive awards vesting in the graph opposite include share price appreciation 
determined using the share price noted on page 94 under the heading “Information”. 
4  The ﬁgures in the columns headed value of LTI vesting and total remuneration for 2012/13 shown 
in the 2012/13 Report used an estimated share price for the LTI awards as they had not vested at 
that time. The ﬁgures shown above for 2012/13 have now been recalculated using the actual share 
price at the date of vesting.
5  The values in the illustrations of policy charts on page 93 show target and maximum indicative 
levels of remuneration for 2014/15, and do not take into account share price appreciation. 
The ﬁgures for the value of LTI awards shown in the table above relate to awards made in 2011/12 
and vesting in 2014/15. Therefore the ﬁgures above should not be directly compared with those 
on page 93. The chart opposite shows the value of LTI awards disclosed in the single ﬁgure table 
above with share price appreciation included. The number of shares which vest is determined in 
accordance with the relevant performance targets. The value of vested LTIP shares is based on 
the original grant value together with the increase in share price from grant to vesting. The value of 
vested ESOP shares is based on the increase in share price above the exercise price of that award.

When considering the objectives for the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration Committee 
takes into account whether speciﬁc attention should be given to environmental, social and governance matters. Directors take such matters 
into account when considering any investment proposal or operational matter and management is expected to meet performance targets 
which include compliance with any environmental, social or governance-related standards that have been set. The overall performance of 
the businesses and of management is reviewed at the end of the year when considering the award of bonuses and whether operational and 
personal objectives have been met. Wolseley plc

Long term incentives
Long term incentives awarded to Executive Directors under the 
ESOP and LTIP in November 201 1 will vest in November 2014. 
The vesting of both awards is subject to the performance conditions 
shown in the tables below.
ESOP
The Company’s adoption of IAS 19 (Revised) in the year (as set 
out in note 1 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements) has affected 
how EPS is calculated for the purposes of the performance targets 
that apply to awards under the ESOP . In order to ensure the 
Company’s EPS at the beginning and end of each performance 
period is calculated on a “like-for like” basis, and is therefore a fair 
representation of the underlying performance of the Company over 
the period, the base EPS numbers for each of the 201 1, 2012 and 
2013 ESOP awards have been recalculated for the purpose of the 
awards as if IAS 19 (Revised) applied for the relevant years.
Vested awards
Targets set were based on headline EPS growth over three years. 
Actual headline EPS was 196.2 pence in 2013/14. Restated headline 
EPS in 2010/1 1 was 141.0 pence (142.9 pence prior to restatement), 
this represents growth of 39. 1 per cent. Over the same three-year 
period RPI growth was 9. 1 per cent. The growth above RPI in the 
period was therefore 30.0 per cent and accordingly all performance 
targets have been achieved, as set out below:

inﬂation after three years(RPI)

1  Value determined using the share price noted on page 94 under the heading “Information” less 
exercise price of 1879 pence.
Unvested awards
Vestings of awards under ESOP are subject to performance targets 
based on growth in the Company’s EPS above UK RPI over a three-
year period. The ESOP plan rules set out the EPS performance 
conditions that apply to awards and are shown in the tables 
opposite. The Committee has discretion to set more challenging 
EPS targets than those contained in the ESOP plan rules.

The table below shows the percentage year-on-year change in base

1  Although the Group Chief Executive has a global role and responsibilities, UK based employees 
were chosen as a suitable comparator group as he is based in the UK (except to attend Board 
and Committee meetings in Switzerland or other worldwide locations outside of the UK). 
Also pay structures and changes to pay vary widely across the Group, depending on the local 
market conditions. 
2  The Group Chief Executive’s bonus is determined by both his performance and the performance 
of the whole of the Wolseley Group, whereas employees’ bonuses are based on their performance 
and the performance of the businesses in the countries in which they work. The percentage 
change in annual bonus for UK based employees is based on the best available estimates at time 
of publication.

1  All Directors have met their shareholding guideline targets, except John Daly and Jacky Simmonds who as new Directors have until 2019 to meet their guidelines, and Gareth Davis whose shareholding 
dropped below his requirement as a result of the special dividend and share consolidation which took effect in December 2013 and has until 31 July 2015 to meet his guideline.
2  Shareholding guideline targets are ﬁrst set by reference to the salary or fees of a Director as at 1 August in the ﬁnancial year following appointment to the Board and calculated using the average share price 
for the two months ended 31 July of the ﬁnancial year in which the appointment was made. Once met, the target is only increased annually in line with base salary or fee increases, if any.
3  There were no vested (unexercised) awards under the LTIP or Sharesave.
4 Details of share awards exercised in the year are detailed in the table on page 103.
5 LTIP and ESOP awards are subject to performance conditions but Sharesave awards are not. Further details of the LTIP and ESOP awards are set out on page 100.
Scheme interests awarded during the ﬁnancial year (Audited)
Awards under the LTIP and ESOP were made on 7 November 2013. Awards are based on a percentage of salary determined by the 
Committee. The Committee considers annually the size of each grant, determined by individual performance, the ability of each individual to 
contribute to the achievement of the performance conditions, and market levels of remuneration. The maximum vesting is 100 per cent of the 
award granted. Details of performance conditions for awards which were granted during the year are set out on pages 94 and 95

1  The share price used to calculate the face value of the ESOP share option awards granted on 7 November 2013 was 3315p which was the share price at the date of grant. The exercise price for the ESOP 
share options was also 3315p. 
2  The share price used to calculate the face value of the LTIP share awards granted on 7 November 2013 was 3275.5p which was the average share price over a 20 dealing day period immediately preceding 
the date of grant. The LTIP awards made to Ian Meakins and John Martin were in the form of nil cost options. At vesting, the exercise price per share will be nil. The LTIP award made to Frank Roach was a 
conditional share award and there is no exercise price.
3  Each Executive’s awards during the ﬁnancial year were based on a percentage of salary as follows: Ian Meakins ( 250 per cent ESOP and 200 per cent LTIP); John Martin (225 per cent ESOP and 150 per 
cent LTIP); and Frank Roach (175 per cent ESOP and 130 per cent LTIP).
4  Face value is calculated as required by the Regulations as the maximum number of shares at full vesting multiplied by either the share price at date of grant or the average share price used to determine the 
number of shares awarded. Wolseley plc

Detail of Employee Beneﬁt Trusts
The Wolseley plc 201 1 Employee Beneﬁt Trust (“ Jersey Trust”) 
and Wolseley plc US Trust (“US Trust”) were established in 
connection with the obligation to satisfy historic and future share 
awards under the ESOP , LTIP and OSP and any other employee 
incentive schemes.
The trustees of each of the Trusts have waived their rights to receive 
dividends on any shares held by them. As at 31 July 2014, the 
Jersey Trust held 1,313,989 ordinary shares of 10
53
/66 pence and 
£137 ,959 in cash; and the US Trust held 1,647 ,405 ordinary shares 
of 10
53
/66 pence.
Detail of all-employee Sharesave plans
The Company operates two all-employee Sharesave plans which 
Executive Directors can participate in. In the USA and Canada, the 
ESPP operates as a one-year savings contract plan. In all other 
business units, employees may participate in the ISP saving for a 
period of three or ﬁve years.
Dilution
In accordance with the recommendations of the Association of 
British Insurers, the number of new shares that may be issued to 
satisfy options granted under all of the Company’s employee share 
schemes is restricted to 10 per cent of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company over any rolling 10-year period. Further, 
the number of new shares that may be issued to satisfy executive 
options granted under the Company’s discretionary share schemes 
is restricted to 5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company over any rolling 10-year period.
As at 31 July 2014, the headroom under the Company’s 10 per 
cent and 5 per cent limits was 4.88 per cent and 2. 19 per cent 
respectively. Options may be satisﬁed by either the issue of new 
shares or by shares purchased in the market. Awards under the 
OSP cannot be satisﬁed by new issue shares and therefore do not 
count towards the dilution limits.
External Directorships
Executive Directors are permitted to take on an external Non 
Executive Directorship. In order to avoid any conﬂicts of interest, all 
such appointments are subject to the approval of the Nominations 
Committee. The Nominations Committee believes that taking up an 
external non executive appointment helps bring a wider perspective 
to the Company and also assists in the development of business 
skills and experience.
Ian Meakins is a Non Executive Director of Centrica plc and receives 
a fee of £65,000 per annum for his services (2012/13: £65,000). 
The Company allowed Ian Meakins to retain this fee.
This report has been approved by the Board and is signed on its 
behalf by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
1. Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements
Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
as adopted by the European Union, including interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and 
its committees. 
The Company is incorporated in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and is headquartered in Switzerland.
Accounting developments and changes
IAS 19 (as revised in June 201 1) “Employee Beneﬁts” has been adopted by the Group in the current ﬁnancial year and has been applied 
retrospectively. The interest cost and expected return on deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 
are replaced with a “net interest” amount, which is calculated by applying a single discount rate to the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability or asset. 
Furthermore, IAS 19 (Revised) also introduces more extensive disclosures in the presentation of the deﬁned beneﬁt cost, including the 
clariﬁcation on treatment of the schemes’ administrative expenses. To aid comparison, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and affected 
notes for the year ended 31 July 2013 have been restated, with the following effects on the previous year’s consolidated ﬁnancial statement:
Other costs
2013 
£m
Net pension ﬁnance (cost) (13) 
Proﬁt before tax reduced by (13) 
Taxation 4 
Proﬁt after tax reduced by (9) 
Other comprehensive income 9
The effect on basic and diluted earnings per share on continuing and discontinued operations was a reduction of 3.3 pence and 
3.2 pence respectively.
In addition to IAS 19 (Revised), the following new standards and interpretations have been adopted by the Group in the current ﬁnancial year:
 IFRS 1 1 “ Joint Arrangements”
 IAS 32 (amended) “Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” 
 IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement”
 IFRS 7 (amended) “Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” 
 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets (Amendments to IAS 36)
The effect of the above standards has been assessed by the Group and is not material.
A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements is set out in 
note 37 on pages 143 to 156.
The following standard has been published, but not yet applied in the current ﬁnancial year:
 IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of this Standard in future periods will have no material impact on the ﬁnancial statements of the 
Group. No other issued standard or interpretation would have a material impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Choices permitted by IFRS
The Group has elected to apply hedge accounting to some of its ﬁnancial instruments.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Many of the Group’s accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. 
The following areas are most sensitive to the accuracy of such estimates.
Year ended 31 July 2014 Wolseley plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 111

1. Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements continued
Impairment of assets
The Group reviews assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life at least annually to assess whether their recoverable amount exceeds their carrying 
value. The recoverable amount is deﬁned as the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, which in turn is the present value of 
the future cash ﬂows expected to be derived from the asset.
The recoverable amount of goodwill and acquired intangible assets is assessed on the basis of the value in use of the cash generating unit 
or where appropriate aggregation of cash generating units (“CGU”) to which they are attributed. The estimate of value in use, and hence the 
outcome of the impairment test, is sensitive to the assumptions made about revenue growth, long-term growth rate of their market and the 
discount rate considered appropriate to reﬂect the time value of money and any risks speciﬁc to the CGU that are not reﬂected in the cash 
ﬂows. Sensitivity analyses have been performed on all these assumptions and, further details concerning the sensitivity of key judgements 
made by the Directors have been presented on pages 121 and 122.
There has been no impairment charge in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets at 31 July 2014 (2013: £10 million). 
Rebates receivable from vendors
The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors that provide rebates from the cost of inventory purchased. Many of these 
agreements apply to purchases in a calendar year rather than a ﬁnancial year, and under certain agreements the rebate rises as a proportion 
of purchases as higher quantities or values of purchases are made. The Group adjusts the cost of inventory purchased to reﬂect estimated 
rebates receivable, which can depend on the projected volume, value and mix of purchases from a vendor through to the end of the qualifying 
period. Actual rebates receivable from vendors may differ materially from the estimates on which the cost of inventory is based.
Valuation of inventories
Inventory comprises ﬁnished goods. Provisions are made against slow-moving, obsolete and damaged inventories for which the net 
realisable value is estimated to be less than the cost. Inventories which are damaged or obsolete are written down as identiﬁed. The risk of 
obsolescence of slow-moving inventory is assessed by comparing the level of inventory held to future sales projected on the basis of historical 
experience. The actual realisable value of inventory may differ materially from the estimated value on which the provision is based. 
The Group held provisions in respect of inventory balances at 31 July 2014 amounting to £1 13 million (2013: £127 million).
Provisions
Provisions for self-insured risks, legal claims, environmental restoration and onerous leases are recognised when the Group has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Such provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate 
of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the present value 
reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions for self-insured risks
The Group retains layers of certain of its insurable risks, principally US casualty and global property damage, which are managed by a captive 
insurance company, Wolseley Insurance Limited. Certain of the retained risks are subject to an annual actuarial assessment. The provision 
for self-insured risks represents an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims and claims 
incurred but not reported. The actual cost of settling these liabilities may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provision 
is based. At 31 July 2014, the provision for claims arising from this insurance was £41 million (2013: £51 million).
Provisions for legal, environmental and related exposures and contingent liabilities
The Group makes provisions for known and potential legal claims and environmental and other matters, including asbestos related litigation 
and product liability claims, where an outﬂow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate may be made of the likely outcome 
of the dispute or matter. In establishing such provisions the Group takes into account the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter 
and considers the advice of its legal and other professional advisers. The ultimate liability for potential legal claims and other matters may 
be dependent upon the discovery of facts that are currently uncertain, the outcome of litigation proceedings and possible settlement 
negotiations, and the actual cost of settlement may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provisions are based. 
At 31 July 2014, legal, environmental and other provisions amounted to £151 million (2013: £147 million). Where the Group has insurance cover 
that it is virtually certain will settle a provision then it recognises an equivalent asset in trade and other receivables. 
The Group may also become involved in legal proceedings or commercial disputes in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable 
estimate of the ﬁnancial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings or disputes. In these cases, where material, 
appropriate disclosure would be included in the ﬁnancial statements but no provision would be made and no contingent liability can 
be quantiﬁed. Wolseley plc

1. Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements continued
Provisions continued
Provisions for onerous leases
When the present value of the future cash ﬂows receivable from the operation of leased assets is less than the present value of the rental 
payments to which the Group is committed, the Group applies the shortfall ﬁrstly against the carrying amount of the assets (in the case of 
ﬁnance leases) and then provides for any further onerous element of the contract (for all leases). Determining the amount of such a provision 
requires estimating the future net cash ﬂows receivable in respect of these assets, and in the particular case where the leased properties 
are vacant this requires assessing the likely period for which the property will remain vacant, the cost of any works required to enhance its 
marketability and the rental income receivable when the property is sublet. Actual cash ﬂows paid and received may differ materially from the 
estimated amounts on which the provisions are based. At 31 July 2014, the provision for onerous leases was £42 million (2013: £39 million).
Taxation
Accruals for current tax are based on management’s interpretation of country-speciﬁc tax law, and require judgements about the likelihood 
that tax positions taken will be sustained. Where management considers it probable that the tax position will be sustained, each material tax 
beneﬁt is reviewed to assess whether it should be recognised in full, or whether provision should be made for a potential settlement through 
negotiation. All such provisions are included in current liabilities. Any estimated exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the 
tax charge.
Pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁts
The Group operates deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes in the United Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations that are accounted 
for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the ﬁnancial statements. These actuarial 
assumptions include discount rates, salary increases and mortality rates, and are disclosed in note 25. The deﬁned pension beneﬁt obligation 
is calculated annually for each scheme by using the projected unit credit method with actuarial valuations. The Group’s liability or surplus 
recognised on the balance sheet is the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the plan 
assets. The discount rate used is the yield at the valuation date on high-quality corporate bonds that have a maturity approximating to the 
terms of the pension obligations. The Group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions 
which include life expectancy of members, expected salary and pension increases, and inﬂation. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income. The net 
interest amount is calculated by applying the discounted rate used to measure the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation at the beginning of the period 
to the deﬁned beneﬁt net asset/liability. The pension scheme net interest is presented as ﬁnance income or expense.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any signiﬁcant changes to those used would affect the balance 
sheet and income statement. The Group considers that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount rate, inﬂation and life expectancy. 
The table below shows the impact of the sensitivities on the net asset/liability.

An increase in life expectancy of one year would increase the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation by £41 million in the UK and by £6 million in 
non-UK plans.
These risks are actively managed by the Joint Working Group which comprises the Trustees of the Wolseley Group Retirement Beneﬁt Plan 
and company employees. More detail can be found in note 25. Wolseley plc

2. Segmental analysis
The Group’s reportable segments are the operating businesses overseen by distinct divisional management teams responsible for their 
performance. All reportable segments derive their revenue from a single business activity, the distribution of plumbing and heating products 
and building materials.
The Group’s business is not highly seasonal. The Group’s customer base is highly diversiﬁed, with no individually signiﬁcant customer.
At 31 July 2014, management reviewed the Group’s operating segments under IFRS 8 and concluded to report Central Europe and France as 
one reporting segment, “Central Europe and France,” given that they represent less than 10 per cent of the Group’s operating proﬁt and does 
not meet other quantitative thresholds. All comparatives were restated for the purposes of consistency and comparability.

4. Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those which are considered signiﬁcant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, and are presented separately in the 
income statement to enable a full understanding of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. If provisions have been made for exceptional items in 
previous years, then any reversal of those provisions is shown as exceptional. 
Exceptional items included in operating proﬁt from continuing operations are analysed by purpose as follows:
2014 
£m
2013 
£m
Signiﬁcant restructuring programmes including staff redundancy costs – (142)
Acquisition and integration costs (18) –
Gain on disposal of businesses 32 21
Loss on closure of businesses and revaluations of held for sale disposal groups (11) (32)
Other exceptional items 15 (11)
Total included in operating proﬁt 18 (164)
Acquisition and integration costs relate to the acquisition in Finland and include transaction costs, onerous leases and redundancy costs 
linked to the closure of a number of branches as part of the integration plan. Gains on disposal are principally write-backs on consideration 
received in the ﬁnancial year in the form of loan notes which relate to disposals in previous years. In addition, we recognised small gains for 
the businesses sold in Central Europe and France mainly due to the recycling of a cumulative foreign exchange gain. Loss on closure of 
businesses includes the impairment of assets on closure of branches in the Nordic region. £8 million of the loss is shown as an exceptional 
item in cost of sales. Other exceptional items include £1 1 million of gains on property disposals in France of which £4 million were reported 
as part of trading proﬁt in the ﬁrst half of the year. The 2013 exceptional restructuring and redundancy charge of £142 million arose from 
reorganisation of our businesses in Central Europe and France and the Nordic region. £38 million of this related to redundancies and the 
remainder arose from asset write-downs, onerous leases, other provisions and other costs.
Exceptional items relating to discontinued operations are detailed in note 7 .

An exceptional tax charge of £3 million was recorded in relation to exceptional gains in 2014 (2013: credit of £10 million). The overall prior year 
tax credit on continuing operations taking into account prior year movements in deferred tax is £2 million (2013: £18 million). The deferred tax 
charge of £5 million (2013: charge £7 million) includes a credit of £5 million (2013: charge of £14 million) resulting from changes in tax rates.

After the reporting date, the Directors proposed a ﬁnal ordinary dividend of £145 million (55 pence per share). The dividend is subject to 
approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and therefore, in accordance with accounting standards, it has been excluded from 
these ﬁnancial statements. 
9. Non-GAAP performance measures
Trading proﬁt is deﬁned as operating proﬁt before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles. It is a 
non-GAAP measure. As explained on page 154, the Group considers that trading proﬁt, and other performance measures based on it, 
including EBITDA before exceptional items, present valuable additional information to users of the ﬁnancial statements.

The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by Employee Beneﬁt Trusts, was 265.6 million 
(2013: 275.6 million). The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average 
number of shares in issue to 267 .0 million (2013: 278.2 million). 
On 2 December 2013, the shares of Wolseley plc were consolidated on a 30 for 31 basis. The impact of the share consolidation on the 
weighted average number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share is 9 million. Further details in respect of the share 
consolidation are given in note 26.

Goodwill and intangible assets acquired during the year have been allocated to the individual cash generating units or aggregated cash 
generating units (together “CGUs”) which are deemed to be the smallest identiﬁable group of assets generating independent cash inﬂows. 
CGUs have been aggregated in the disclosure above at a regional level; however, impairment reviews were performed for each individual 
CGU during the year ended 31 July 2014.
The relevant inputs to the value-in-use calculations of each CGU were:
 Cash ﬂow forecasts for years one to three are derived from the most recent Board approved strategic plan; the forecast for year ﬁve 
represents an estimate of “mid-cycle” trading performance for the CGU based on historic analysis. Year four is calculated as the average 
of the ﬁnal year of the strategic plan and year ﬁve’s mid-cycle estimate.
 A risk-adjusted, pre-tax discount rate, calculated by reference to the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) of each country which 
ranges from 9. 1 per cent to 15. 1 per cent.
 The 30-year long-term growth rate by country, as published by the IMF in July 2014 has been used for all CGUs except for the Nordic 
region where a lower long-term growth rate was applied consistent with the previous year. 
The strategic plan is developed based on analyses of sales, markets and costs at a regional level. Consideration is given to past events, 
knowledge of future contracts and the wider economy. It takes into account both current business and future initiatives.
Management performed a sensitivity analysis for each key assumption (revenue growth, discount rate and long-term growth rate), keeping all 
other assumptions constant. There are three CGUs all within the Nordic region with limited headroom at 31 July 2014: Stark, Neumann and 
Silvan. In addition, Starkki showed limited headroom at 31 January 2014 which increased in the second half following an acquisition in March 
2014 (see note 30). We have disclosed the sensitivity analysis for the CGUs with limited headroom at the end of the ﬁnancial year. The results 
presented in the table below show the amounts by which the related assumptions can vary such that the carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangible assets equals their recoverable amounts.  Wolseley plc

The sensitivity disclosed above is the amount by which the related assumption would need to vary before an impairment is indicated. 
Whilst management believes the assumptions are realistic, it is possible that an impairment would be identiﬁed if the above key assumptions 
changed signiﬁcantly.

The standard rate of UK corporation tax in the year changed from 23 per cent to 21 per cent with effect from 1 April 2014 and will change to 
20 per cent from 1 April 2015. UK deferred tax is therefore recognised at the reduced rate of 20 per cent.
Deferred tax assets in the UK have been recognised on the basis that the UK is forecast to have sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts in the future 
to enable these to be utilised.
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling £46 million (2013: £1 15 million) that have not been recognised 
on the basis that their future economic beneﬁt is uncertain. The losses are in the UK and France. The UK losses relate to capital transactions 
and are not recognised on the basis that there are no transactions resulting in capital gains against which they can be offset. The French 
losses relate to asset impairments that have not been recognised on the basis that France is not forecasting to have sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts in 
the future to utilise them. None of these losses has an expiry date.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries. However, tax 
may arise on £207 million (2013: £386 million) of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and 
it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Wolseley plc

30 November 201 1, when the loan notes were hedged by a series of interest rate swaps. From 30 November 201 1 the hedge relationship 
was de-designated, and the fair value adjustment is being released to the income statement on an amortised cost basis over the period to 
maturity of the notes. Wolseley plc

22. Financial instruments and ﬁnancial risk management
There have been no signiﬁcant changes during the year to the Group’s policies on accounting for, valuing and managing the risk of ﬁnancial 
instruments. These policies are summarised on pages 148 to 154.
Capital structure
To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure to current and forecast trading, the Group’s principal measure of ﬁnancial gearing is the 
ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items. The Group aims to operate with investment grade credit metrics and ensure this ratio 
does not exceed 1 to 2 times. The Group’s main borrowing facilities contain a ﬁnancial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before 
exceptional items to 3.5:1. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares 
or sell assets to reduce debt. 
Liquidity
During the year ended 31 July 2014, the Group entered into a £300 million revolving facility which matures in August 2015. In addition 
the Group added a further £59 million ($100 million) to the existing £296 million ($500 million) securitisation of US trade receivables facility 
(maturing in October 2016).
As at 31 July 2014, £250 million was drawn under the £300 million facility mentioned above. 
As at 31 July the Group had undrawn facilities as follows:

Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims and 
claims incurred but not reported on certain risks retained by the Group (principally USA casualty and global property damage). 
The environmental and legal provision includes £49 million (31 July 2013: £51 million) for the estimated liability for asbestos litigation on a 
discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 2.6 per cent (2013: 3.3 per cent). This amount has been actuarially determined as at 
31 July 2014 based on advice from independent professional advisers. The Group has insurance that it currently believes is sufﬁcient cover for 
the estimated liability and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables. Based on current estimates, 
the amount of performing insurance cover signiﬁcantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material proﬁt or cash ﬂow impact 
is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs and future lease rentals on closed branches. In determining 
the provision for onerous leases, the cash ﬂows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates. 
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately four years.
Other provisions include warranty and separation costs relating to businesses disposed of and rental commitments on vacant properties and 
dilapidations on leased properties. The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately four years. Wolseley plc

(iv) Plan risks
As described on page 155, the deﬁned beneﬁt plans typically expose the Company to the following actuarial risks which are managed by a 
Joint Working Group, comprising the Trustees of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan and employees of the Company.
Investment risk
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality corporate bond 
yields; if the actual return on plan assets is below this rate, it will decrease a net surplus or increase a net pension liability. Currently the plan 
has a relatively balanced investment in equity securities, debt instruments and property. Due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, the 
trustees of the pension plan consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the plan assets should be invested in equity securities and 
property to leverage the return generated by the fund.
Interest risk
A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability, and this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plan’s 
debt investments.
Longevity risk
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of the plan participants both 
during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.

From 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2014, shares were issued to satisfy options exercised under the Group’s share schemes. Following approval 
at the Annual General Meeting held on 26 November 2013 and in connection with the special dividend approved at that meeting, a share 
consolidation under which shareholders received 30 new ordinary shares of 10 
53
⁄ 66 pence for every 31 existing ordinary shares of 10 
5
⁄ 11 pence 
each, became effective on 2 December 2013. The share consolidation resulted in the number of ordinary shares in issue decreasing by 
8,856,602 shares. 
During the year, the Company issued 1,027 , 171 (2013: 533,648) ordinary shares with a nominal value of £0. 1 million (2013: £0. 1 million) 
to participants in the long-term incentive schemes and all-employee sharesave plans for an aggregate consideration of £14 million 
(2013: £8 million). The terms of issue were ﬁxed on the respective dates of grant. The relevant dates of grants were between November 2003 
and April 2013 and the market price on those dates were between £5.30 and £32.38. This consideration was settled in cash.

During the year the Remuneration Committee passed a resolution with regard to the Ordinary Share Plan, that the Remuneration Committee 
may in the case of any eligible employee determine that the vesting date applicable to that employee’s awards shall be any date after the Date 
of Grant, which the Remuneration Committee determines is appropriate in the circumstances. There were no other signiﬁcant changes to the 
Group’s share plans.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth in 
headline earnings per share over a period of three consecutive ﬁnancial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same 
period by at least 9 per cent.

At 31 July 2014, 4,470,526 (2013: 7 ,694,774) of the shares and options outstanding had an exercise price which was below the market price. 
The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated by the binomial methodology for all schemes except 
the Long Term Incentive Scheme, for which a Monte Carlo simulation was used. The fair value of shares granted under the Ordinary Share 
Plan and Restricted Share Plan (for more information please refer to page 155) was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of 
grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were:
Executive Share Options Employee Share Options
Long T erm  
Incentive Schemes
2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013
Risk free interest rate 1.8% 1.1% 1.6% 0.4% 0.4% 0.7%

Expected volatility 43% 42% 29% 35% 29% 33%
Expected life 5.7 years 5.7 years 1-6 years 1-7 years 3 years 3 years
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term, excluding the effect of extraordinary volatility 
due to the Group’s capital reorganisation and rights issue in 2009. Expected life has been estimated on the basis of historical data on the 
exercise pattern.
The principal assumptions for the Ordinary Share Plan are an expected dividend yield of approximately 2.5 per cent and an expected life of 
three years. Wolseley plc

Further adjustments to goodwill may be necessary when additional information is available concerning some of the judgemental areas.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated proﬁtability of the new markets and product ranges to which the 
Group has gained access, and additional proﬁtability and operating efﬁciencies available in respect of existing markets. Wolseley plc

30. Acquisitions continued 
The acquisitions contributed £144 million to revenue, £5 million to trading proﬁt and £2 million to the Group’s operating proﬁt for the period 
between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. It is not practicable to disclose proﬁt before and after tax, as the Group manages 
its borrowings as a portfolio and cannot attribute an effective borrowing rate to an individual acquisition. 
If each acquisition had been completed on the ﬁrst day of the ﬁnancial year, Group revenue would have been £13,430 million and Group 
trading proﬁt would have been £769 million. It is not practicable to disclose proﬁt before tax or proﬁt attributable to equity shareholders, as 
stated above. It is not practicable to disclose operating proﬁt as the Group cannot estimate the amount of intangible assets that would have 
been acquired at a date other than the acquisition date.

Later than one year and less than ﬁve years 441 493
After ﬁve years 148 158
Total operating lease commitments 788 868
Operating lease payments mainly represent rent payable by the Group for certain of its properties. Some of these operating lease 
arrangements have renewal options and rental escalation clauses, though the effect of these is not material. No arrangements have been 
entered into for contingent rental payments.
The commitments shown above include commitments for onerous leases which have already been provided for. At 31 July 2014, provisions 
include an amount of £42 million (2013: £39 million) in respect of minimum lease payments for such onerous leases net of sublease payments 
expected to be received. The total minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 July 2014 is 
£14 million (2013: £17 million).
35. Contingent liabilities
Group companies are, from time to time, subject to certain claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business in relation to, among 
other things, the suitability of products, contract and commercial disputes and disputes with employees. Provision is made if, on the basis 
of current information and professional advice, liabilities are considered likely to arise. In the case of unfavourable outcomes the Group may 
beneﬁt from applicable insurance recoveries. Certain claims arise as a result of the unintentional supply of defective products and these claims 
are usually the responsibility of the manufacturer, though defence and other costs may also be incurred by the Group.
Warranties and guarantees in relation to business disposals
Following a review of the appropriate allocation of the Group’s resources in 2009, the Group has disposed of a number of non-core 
businesses and various Group companies have provided certain standard warranties and guarantees to acquirers and other third 
parties, including warranties regarding ﬁnancial statements and taxation. Provision is made where the Group considers that a liability 
is likely to crystallise, though it is possible that claims in respect of which no provisions has been made could be received in the future. 
Group companies have also guaranteed certain property and other obligations which could be called in an event of default. As at the 
date of this report there are no signiﬁcant outstanding claims in relation to business disposals.
Environmental
The operations of certain Group companies, particularly those engaged in processing, converting or treating building materials, are subject 
to speciﬁc environmental regulations. From time to time the Group conducts preliminary investigations through third parties to assess potential 
risks including potential soil or groundwater contamination of sites. Where an obligation to remediate contamination arises then this is provided 
for, though future liabilities could arise from sites for which no provision is made.
Outcome
The outcome of claims and litigation to which Group companies are party cannot readily be foreseen as, in some cases, the facts are 
unclear, further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case, or they are part of continuing legal proceedings. However, based on 
information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is not 
expected to have a material adverse effect on the ﬁnancial position of the Group.
36. Post balance sheet events

37. Additional information
Group accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements is set out 
below. The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding year.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation of ﬁnancial 
assets and liabilities held for trading.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those which are considered signiﬁcant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence. These items are presented as 
exceptional within their relevant income statement category to assist in the understanding of the trading and ﬁnancial results of the Group. 
In addition, management presents trading proﬁt, headline proﬁt and headline earnings per share to provide additional useful information on 
underlying trends to shareholders. 
Examples of such items that are considered by the Directors for designation as exceptional items include, but are not limited to: 
 Restructuring and other expenses relating to the integration of an acquired business
 Gains/losses on disposal of businesses
 Acquisition related costs principally relating to professional fees
 Costs arising as a result of material and non-recurring regulatory and litigation matters
Consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial information includes the results of the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 July 2014.
The trading results of businesses operations are included in proﬁt on ordinary activities from continuing operations from the date of acquisition 
or up to the date of sale.
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated 
on consolidation, with the exception of gains/losses required under relevant IFRS accounting standards.
Discontinued operations
When the Group has disposed of or intends to dispose of a business component that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations it classiﬁes such operations as discontinued. The post-tax proﬁt or loss of the discontinued operations 
is shown as a single line on the face of the income statement, separate from the other results of the Group. 
Foreign currencies
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements of each of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the subsidiary undertaking operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are 
presented in sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the parent company.
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling during the relevant 
ﬁnancial period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the period end. 
Exchange differences arising between the translation into sterling of the net assets of these subsidiary undertakings at rates ruling at the 
beginning and end of the year are recognised in the currency translation reserve (as are exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings 
to the extent that they are used to ﬁnance or provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets).
Changes in the fair value and the ﬁnal settlement value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments, entered into to hedge foreign currency net assets 
and that satisfy the hedging conditions of IAS 39, are recognised in the currency translation reserve (see the separate accounting policy on 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments).
In the event that an overseas subsidiary undertaking is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement is determined 
after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the subsidiary undertaking concerned.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the 
transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. All currency translation differences are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency net 
borrowings to the extent that they are used to ﬁnance or provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets as detailed above. Wolseley plc

37. Additional information continued
Group accounting policies continued
Business combinations
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the 
date of exchange. Identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially 
at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. Acquisition related costs are expensed.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. 
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised 
directly in the income statement.
Revenue
Revenue is the amount receivable for the provision of goods and services falling within the Group’s ordinary activities, excluding intra-group 
sales, estimated and actual sales returns, trade and early settlement discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes.
Revenue from the provision of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of goods have been transferred to the customer. 
The risks and rewards of ownership of goods are deemed to have been transferred when the goods are shipped to, or picked up by 
the customer.
Revenue from services is recognised when the service provided to the customer has been completed.
Customer loyalty credits are accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in which they are granted. A portion of the fair 
value of the consideration received is allocated to the loyalty credits and recognised in the period that loyalty credits are redeemed.
Revenue from the provision of goods and services is only recognised when the amounts to be recognised are ﬁxed or determinable and 
collectability is reasonably assured.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes purchased goods, the cost of bringing inventory to its present location and condition, and labour and overheads 
attributable to assembly and construction services.
Vendor rebates
The Group enters into arrangements with certain vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates. These purchase rebates are accrued 
as earned and are recorded initially as a reduction in inventory with a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identiﬁable assets of the 
acquired subsidiary undertaking at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings is included within intangible 
assets. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units or aggregations of cash generating units (together “CGUs”) where synergy beneﬁts 
are expected. CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated 
goodwill is monitored for management purposes. No CGU is larger than the reporting segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 
“Operating Segments”.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses 
on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was allocated to each CGU. Goodwill arising on business 
combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to beneﬁt from that business combination. 
Other intangible assets
An intangible asset, which is an identiﬁable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
the expected future economic beneﬁts attributable to the asset will ﬂow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably. The asset is 
deemed to be identiﬁable when it is separable or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. Wolseley plc

37. Additional information continued
Group accounting policies continued
Other intangible assets continued
Intangible assets, primarily brands, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised 
separately from goodwill and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is 
calculated using the reducing balance method for customer relationships and the straight-line method for other intangible assets. The cost of 
the intangible assets is amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Customer relationships 4 – 25 years
Trade names and brands 1 – 15 years
Other   1 – 4 years
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and 
is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs include software licences, consulting costs 
attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software and internal costs directly attributable to the 
development, design and implementation of the computer software. Costs in respect of training and data conversion are expensed as 
incurred. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method so as to charge the cost of the computer software to the income statement 
over its estimated useful life as follows:
Software   3 – 5 years
Software assets are generally either purchases from third parties or internally generated. 
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”)
PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, except for land and assets in the course of 
construction, which are not depreciated and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the items. In addition, subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a 
separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the item will ﬂow to the Group and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the ﬁnancial 
period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated 
useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leaseholds 20 – 50 years
Operating leasehold improvements  over the period of the lease
Plant and machinery   7 – 10 years
Computer hardware   3 – 5 years
Fixtures and ﬁttings   5 – 7 years
Motor vehicles    4 years
The residual values and useful lives of PPE are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the long-term construction or production of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Leased assets
Assets held under ﬁnance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have transferred to 
the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives. The asset is recorded 
at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease. The capital elements of future 
obligations under ﬁnance leases are included in liabilities in the balance sheet and analysed between current and non-current amounts. 
The interest elements of future obligations under ﬁnance leases are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and 
represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed as operating leases. The cost of operating 
leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases.  Wolseley plc

Assets and disposal groups held for sale 
Assets are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business. 
Where a group of assets and their directly associated liabilities are to be disposed of in a single transaction, such disposal groups are also 
classiﬁed as held for sale. For this to be the case, the asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, 
and management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset or disposal group which, when initiated, was expected 
to result in a completed sale within 12 months. Assets that are classiﬁed as held for sale are not depreciated. Assets or disposal groups that 
are classiﬁed as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation or depreciation and are tested for impairment 
annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject 
to amortisation or depreciation and assets under construction are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying 
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
The value in use is in most cases based on the discounted present value of the future cash ﬂows expected to arise from the cash generating 
unit to which the goodwill relates, or from the individual asset or asset group. 
Inventories
Inventories, which comprise all goods purchased for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using 
the ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out (“FIFO”) method or the average cost method as appropriate to the nature of the transactions in those items of inventory. 
The cost of goods purchased for resale includes import and custom duties, transport and handling costs, freight and packing costs and other 
attributable costs less trade discounts, rebates and other subsidies. It excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group 
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Examples of such evidence include signiﬁcant 
ﬁnancial difﬁculties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or ﬁnancial reorganisation and default or delinquency in 
payments. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
ﬂows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement. Trade receivables are 
written off against the provision when recoverability is assessed as being remote. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 
are credited to the income statement.
The amount relating to continuing operations charged to the income statement in 2014 in respect of impaired receivables represented 
0. 15 per cent of revenue (2013: 0. 19 per cent). The Group held a provision for impairment of receivables at 31 July 2014 amounting to 
£39 million (2013: £46 million).
Retirement beneﬁt obligations
Contributions to deﬁned contribution pension plans and other post-retirement beneﬁts are charged to the income statement as incurred.
For deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans and other retirement beneﬁts, the cost of providing beneﬁts is determined annually using the projected 
unit credit method by independent qualiﬁed actuaries. The current service cost of deﬁned beneﬁt plans is recorded within operating proﬁt. 
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. The asset/liability 
recognised in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the deﬁned 
beneﬁt obligation at the end of the reporting period. Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any 
amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.  Wolseley plc

Taxation
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable) on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into account any adjustments arising from prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt 
or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Share capital
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, 
reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable 
incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s executive share option, long-term incentive, employee share purchase 
and ordinary share plan schemes. The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of 
the awards, measured using Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at 
the date of grant (including the impact of any non-vesting conditions such as a requirement for employees to save) and is not subsequently 
remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modiﬁed. For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at 
the date of grant and is remeasured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled. Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reﬂect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to 
the failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
Dividends payable
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
shareholders of the Company or paid.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet 
to the extent that there is no right of offset and no practice of net settlement with cash balances.
Cash, which is not freely available to the Group, is disclosed as restricted cash. Wolseley plc

Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps and currency swaps, are used to manage the ﬁnancial risks arising from 
the business activities of the Group and the ﬁnancing of those activities. There is no trading activity in derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments, the Group documents the relationship between 
the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk management objective and the strategy underlying the proposed 
transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing 
basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash ﬂows of the hedged items.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. Where derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments do not fulﬁl the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39, changes in their fair values are recognised in the 
income statement. When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classiﬁed as fair value hedges, cash ﬂow hedges 
or net investment hedges. Where the hedging relationship is classiﬁed as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or 
liability is adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in 
the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. 
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective 
interest method is used is amortised to proﬁt or loss over the period to maturity. Where the hedging relationship is classiﬁed as a cash ﬂow 
hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from 
the hedged risk are recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement. When the hedged item is recognised in the ﬁnancial 
statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results 
in a non-ﬁnancial asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when 
a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is 
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value being 
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classiﬁed as current 
liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Financial instruments by measurement basis
Financial instruments in the categories “derivatives used for hedging”, “fair value through proﬁt or loss” and “available-for-sale” are all 
measured in the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value measurements can be classiﬁed in the following hierarchy:
 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);
 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (level 2);
 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).
The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 July 2014 and 31 July 2013:

The fair value of ﬁnancial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The fair value of 
ﬁnancial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. 
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows based on observable yield curves. 
The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts using market prices at the balance sheet date.
The Group’s other ﬁnancial instruments are measured on bases other than fair value. Other receivables include an amount of £48 million 
(2013: £50 million) which has been discounted at a rate of 2.6 per cent (2013: 3.3 per cent) due to the long-term nature of the receivable. 
Because other current assets and liabilities are either of short maturity or bear ﬂoating rate interest, their fair values approximate to book 
values. The book values and fair values of categories including non-current assets and liabilities can be compared as follows:

Financial instruments: risk management policies
The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations, and the ﬁnancial instruments which fund them. The main risks 
arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Group has well deﬁned policies 
for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied during 
the ﬁnancial years ended 31 July 2014 and 31 July 2013. By the nature of its business the Group also has trade credit and commodity price 
exposures, the management of which is delegated to operating businesses. There has been no change during or since the previous year-end 
in the major ﬁnancial risks faced by the Group.
Policies for managing each of these risks are regularly reviewed and are summarised below. When the Group enters into derivative 
transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts), the purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain 
interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of ﬁnance. It is, and has been throughout the period 
under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in ﬁnancial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Capital risk management
The Group’s sources of funding currently comprise cash ﬂows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders and borrowings 
from banks and other ﬁnancial institutions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may pay a special dividend, return 
capital to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.  Wolseley plc

Liquidity risk
The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufﬁcient borrowing headroom to ﬁnance all investment and capital expenditure included in its 
strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin. 
The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outﬂows (excluding interest income and income from derivatives) including interest 
payable in respect of its trade and other payables and bank borrowings on an undiscounted basis. The principal assumptions are that ﬂoating 
rate interest is calculated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date, and cash ﬂows in foreign currency are translated using 
spot rates at the balance sheet date. These cash ﬂows can be analysed by maturity as follows:

Foreign currency risk
The Group has signiﬁcant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the 
operations are located. Approximately 54 per cent of the Group’s revenue is in US dollars and 13 per cent in euros. The Group does not have 
signiﬁcant transactional foreign currency cash ﬂow exposures. However, those that do arise may be hedged with either forward contracts or 
currency options. The Group does not normally hedge proﬁt translation exposure since such hedges have only temporary effect.
The Group’s policy is to adjust the currencies in which its net debt is denominated to materially match the currencies in which its trading 
proﬁt is generated. Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in 
the translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in the ﬁve year summary on page 167 . 
The net effect of currency translation was to decrease revenue by £462 million (3.5 per cent) (2013: increase by £59 million, or 0.4 per cent) 
and to decrease trading proﬁt by £31 million (4.2 per cent) (2013: increase by £5 million or 0.6 per cent). These currency effects reﬂect a 
movement of the average sterling exchange rate against US dollars, euros and Canadian dollars as follows: Wolseley plc

The Group has ﬁnancial instruments denominated in foreign currencies which have been designated as hedges of the net investment in its 
overseas subsidiaries. The principal value of those ﬁnancial instruments designated as hedges at the balance sheet date was £1,260 million 
(2013: £1,539 million). The gain on translation of these ﬁnancial instruments into sterling of £77 million (2013: loss of £43 million) has been taken 
to the translation reserve.

Interest rate risk
To manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate ﬂuctuations, the Group’s policy is between 0 per cent and 50 per cent of projected 
borrowings required during the next two years should be at ﬁxed rates. However, this percentage is regularly reviewed by the Board and 
63 per cent of loans were at ﬁxed rates at 31 July 2014. The Group borrows in the desired currencies principally at rates determined by 
reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR. Rates which reset at least every 
12 months are regarded as ﬂoating rates, and the Group then if appropriate considers interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest 
rate proﬁle.
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at Treasury Committee and Board meetings. The Treasury Committee gives prior 
approval to any variations from ﬂoating rate arrangements.
During November 201 1, the Group entered into interest rate swap contracts comprising ﬁxed interest payable on US$664 million of notional 
principal. The contracts expire between November 2015 and November 2020 and the ﬁxed interest rates range between 1.51 per cent and 
2.94 per cent. These contracts have been held since inception at fair value through proﬁt or loss. With effect from 1 December 201 1 interest 
rate swap contracts comprising ﬁxed interest receivable on an original notional principal of US$729 million (US$664 million at 31 July 2014)

Credit risk
Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers. There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay 
outstanding balances. At 31 July 2014, the maximum exposure to credit risk was £1,919 million (2013: £1,980 million).
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables. Signiﬁcant outstanding and 
overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis. In some cases protection is 
provided through credit insurance arrangements. All of the major businesses use professional, dedicated credit teams, in some cases ﬁeld-
based. Appropriate provisions are made for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis. Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is 
limited as the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. Accordingly, management considers that there is no further credit risk provision 
required above the current provision for impairment. 
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with ﬁnancial institutions, and enters into certain contracts (such as interest rate 
swaps) which entitle the Group to receive future cash ﬂows from ﬁnancial institutions. These transactions give rise to credit risk on amounts 
due from counterparties with a maximum exposure of £282 million (2013: £401 million). This risk is managed by setting credit and settlement 
limits for a panel of approved counterparties. The limits are approved by the Treasury Committee and ratings are monitored regularly.
Market price risk
The Group monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing the effect on ﬁnancial instruments over various periods of a range of 
possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates. The Group has estimated that an increase of one percentage point in the principal 
interest rates to which it is exposed would result in a charge to the income statement of £3 million, arising from changes in the fair value of 
interest rate swaps. The Group has estimated that a weakening of sterling by 10 per cent against all the currencies in which the Group does 
business would result in a charge to equity of £74 million (2013: £57 million), arising from the translation of borrowings denominated in foreign 
currency, and a credit of £4 million to the income statement, arising from the retranslation of interest rate swaps held at fair value through proﬁt 
or loss (2013: £7 million).
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit risk or 
commodity price risk, and does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying the Group’s exposure to any of the macroeconomic 
variables that might affect the collectability of receivables or the prices of commodities.
Additonal information about non-GAAP measures and performance
Trading proﬁt is deﬁned as operating proﬁt before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles. It is a non-
GAAP measure. Exceptional items are those which are considered signiﬁcant by virtue of their nature, size or incidence, and are presented 
separately in the income statement to enable a full understanding of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. In addition, the current businesses 
within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition. The Group believes that trading proﬁt provides 
valuable additional information for users of the ﬁnancial statements in assessing the Group’s performance since it provides information on the 
performance of the business that local managers are more directly able to inﬂuence and on a basis consistent across the Group. The Group 
uses trading proﬁt and certain key performance indicators, calculated by reference to trading proﬁt, for planning, budgeting and reporting 
purposes and for its internal assessment of the operating performance of individual businesses within the Group. Wolseley plc

Additional information about pensions and other long-term employee beneﬁts
Description of plans
The principal UK deﬁned beneﬁt plan is the Wolseley Group Retirement Beneﬁts Plan which provides beneﬁts based on ﬁnal pensionable 
salaries. This plan was closed to new entrants in 2009. The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. The Group contribution 
rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary. The Group Retirement Beneﬁts Plan 
was closed to future accrual on 31 December 2013 and was replaced by a new deﬁned contribution plan. Obligations under the UK deﬁned 
contribution plan are recognised as an operating cost in the income statement as incurred.
The principal plans operated for US employees are deﬁned contribution plans, which are established in accordance with US 401k rules. 
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and proﬁt sharing plans. The Group also operates two deﬁned beneﬁt plans 
in the United States which are closed to new entrants. One of the plans is funded and the majority of assets are held in trustee administered 
funds independent of the assets of the companies. The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a deﬁned 
contribution plan. The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit (credit) Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries. 
In Canada, deﬁned beneﬁt plans and a deﬁned contribution plan are operated. Most of the Canadian deﬁned beneﬁt plans are funded. 
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit (credit) Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.
In Europe, both deﬁned contribution and deﬁned beneﬁt plans are operated. Liabilities arising under deﬁned beneﬁt plans are calculated in 
accordance with actuarial advice.
Investment policy
The Group’s investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally and, if relevant, by the trustees of the plan, and takes 
account of the relevant statutory requirements. The Group’s objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess 
of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using speciﬁc allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the 
target rate of return. Most investment strategies have signiﬁcant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost 
to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term and within acceptable boundaries of risk.
For the UK plan, the policy is to invest approximately 70 per cent of the assets in equities and 30 per cent in other asset classes, principally 
bonds. The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Company. For the overseas 
schemes the investment strategy involves the investment in deﬁned levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being 
invested in cash and bonds.
Additional information about share-based payment plans
The Group currently operates three types of discretionary plans and two types of all-employee sharesave plans.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Plans are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth in 
headline earnings per share over a period of three consecutive ﬁnancial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same 
period by at least 9 per cent and consequently vest over a period of three years. 
Awards granted under the Employee Savings Option Plans vest over periods ranging from three to seven years, except for awards granted 
under the ESPP , which vest over a one year period. 
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for senior executives. Under the LTIP , executives are awarded a variable number 
of shares depending on the level of total shareholder return over a three-year period relative to that of the FTSE 100. The vesting period is 
three years. The maximum award under the LTIS is determined at grant date and then adjusted at vesting date in accordance with the market 
performance condition. The vesting period is three years and there are no performance measures other than retained employment.
Since 201 1, the Group has operated the Wolseley Group Ordinary Share Plan 201 1 (the “Ordinary Share Plan”) which is open to all eligible 
employees except Executive Directors of the Group. Under the Ordinary Share Plan, employees can be granted a variable number of awards 
in any form or combination of options, restricted share awards, conditional share awards or phantom share awards up to a maximum 
of 100 per cent of their current salary. The vesting period can be up to three years and there are no performance measures other than 
retained employment. Wolseley plc

Additional information about employee beneﬁt trusts
Two Employee Beneﬁt Trusts have been established in connection with the Company’s discretionary share option plans and Long Term 
Incentive Plans. Bedell Trust Company Limited have been trustees of the Jersey trust since 16 March 2012, when three previous trusts 
were amalgamated. RBC Trust Company (Delaware) Ltd has been the trustee of the US trust since it was established on 24 October 2012. 
During the year the trusts purchased 793,225 shares at a cumulative cost of £26 million, and issued to employees exercising options 
1,524,470 shares at a weighted average cost of £48 million, receiving £5 million in respect of the exercise price of options. At 31 July 2014, the 
trusts held 2,961,394 shares with a market value of £92 million (2013: 3,692,639 shares with a market value of £1 16 million). Dividends due on 
shares held by the Employee Beneﬁt Trusts are waived in accordance with the provisions of the trust deeds.
Additional information about the parent company of the Group

Our audit approach
Overview
Areas of
focus
Audit scope
Materiality
 Overall Group materiality: £33 million which 
represents 5 per cent of proﬁt before tax 
adjusted for non-recurring exceptional items.
 We conducted audit work in the ten territories 
in which the Group has signiﬁcant operations. 
 Taken together, the territories where we 
performed our audit work accounted for 99 
per cent of Group revenues and 92 per cent 
of Group proﬁt before tax adjusted for non-
recurring exceptional items.
 We focused on:
 – Goodwill and other intangibles impairment 
assessment, particularly in the Nordic region.
 – Recognition of supplier rebate income.
 – The provision for slow-moving and 
obsolete inventory.
 – The provision for product liability, employee 
disputes, contract and commercial issues 
and environmental exposures.
 – The provision for uncertain tax positions.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of 
material misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements. In particular, we looked at where 
the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of signiﬁcant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the 
risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether 
there was evidence of bias by the Directors that may represent a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, 
including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identiﬁed as “areas of 
focus” in the table on the next page together with an explanation of how we 
tailored our audit to address these speciﬁc areas. This is not a complete list of all 
risks identiﬁed by our audit. 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Goodwill and other intangibles 
impairment assessment, 
particularly in the Nordic region
Refer to page 72 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 1 1 1 (Accounting policies 
and critical estimates and judgements)
The carrying value of goodwill 
and intangibles at 31 July 2014 is 
£1,198 million. Of this, £1,037 million 
relates to businesses where there 
is substantial headroom between 
the value in use calculations and 
the carrying value of the net assets. 
The risk is that the remaining balance 
of £161 million is overstated. 
We focused on the estimated values in 
use of the Stark business (£116 million 
goodwill and intangibles), the Silvan 
business (£24 million goodwill and 
intangibles) and the Neumann business 
(£21 million goodwill and intangibles), 
which make up this remaining balance 
and for which there is low headroom 
and where trading performance 
remains subdued.
We focused on this area because the 
calculation of the value in use in these 
businesses requires management to 
make subjective judgements about 
their future performance. The key 
assumptions for these businesses are 
set out in note 12.
We evaluated and challenged the 
Directors’ future cash ﬂow forecasts 
for the Stark, Silvan and Neumann 
businesses, and the process by 
which they were drawn up, including 
comparing them to the latest Board-
approved three-year plans, and testing 
the underlying value in use calculations. 
We also challenged:
 the Directors’ key assumptions for 
near-term and long-term growth rates 
in the cash ﬂow forecast by comparing 
them to historic trading performance 
and economic forecasts; and
 the discount rate by assessing the 
cost of capital for the Company and 
comparable organisations.
We performed sensitivity analyses 
around these key assumptions. 
Having ascertained the extent of 
change in those assumptions that 
either individually or collectively would 
be required for the goodwill and 
intangibles in these businesses to be 
impaired, we considered the likelihood 
of such a movement in those key 
assumptions arising and the adequacy 
of the disclosures made regarding the 
assumptions and sensitivities
Recognition of supplier 
rebate income
Refer to page 72 (Audit Committee 
report) and page 1 1 1 (Accounting 
policies and critical estimates 
and judgements)
As is normal industry practice, the 
Group has a number of rebate 
agreements in place with suppliers most 
of which are based on the calendar year 
rather than the Group’s own ﬁnancial 
year. Additionally, in some cases the 
rebate income rises as a proportion of 
purchases as higher quantities or values 
of purchases are made. 
In calculating the rebate income 
receivable, management is therefore 
required to make estimates of future 
purchases for the rebate year.
Due to the complexity and supplier 
speciﬁc nature of each arrangement, 
it is difﬁcult to fully automate the 
rebate calculation process and hence 
management is reliant on processes 
outside the ﬁnancial systems in most 
reporting units to calculate the rebate 
amounts due.
We tested the operating effectiveness of 
controls in place over recording supplier 
rebate income. We agreed rebate terms 
to supplier contracts and assessed 
whether appropriate assumptions 
were used in rebate calculations. 
We obtained supplier circularisations 
and considered historic cash receipts 
to assess the accuracy of Directors’ 
estimates. We took into account the 
patterns over several years in the 
overall rebate income for each major 
supplier and each type of agreement. 
In addition, we evaluated the impact of 
the credit-worthiness of suppliers on the 
likelihood of recoverability of signiﬁcant 
rebate balances. Wolseley plc

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
The provision for slow-moving 
and obsolete inventory
Refer to page 72 (Audit Committee 
report) and page 1 1 1 (Accounting 
policies and critical estimates 
and judgements)
The balance of gross inventories at 
31 July 2014 is £1,751 million, against 
which a provision of £113 million is 
held. The Directors estimate this 
provision by comparing the level of 
inventory held to future sales projected. 
The provision is calculated within the 
Group’s accounting systems using 
an automated process. We focused 
on the accuracy and completeness 
of the provision because of the risk of 
error in the system calculation and the 
input of underlying data, as well as the 
judgements required in estimating future 
sales projections. 
We tested the completeness of the data 
within the system used to generate the 
inventory provisioning by agreeing a 
sample of inventory in warehouses and 
branches to the data and recalculating 
subtotals. We also tested the accuracy 
of the resultant calculation by reviewing 
the calculation criteria and recalculating 
the provision for a sample of products.
We examined the appropriateness of 
the provisioning methodology based 
on historical experience and future 
sales projections. 
The provision for product liability, 
employee disputes, contract 
and commercial issues and 
environmental exposures
Refer to page 72 (Audit Committee 
report), page 1 1 1 (Accounting policies 
and critical estimates and judgements) 
and page 131 (Notes)
The Company is subject to litigation 
and claims in relation to product liability, 
employee disputes, contract and 
commercial issues and environmental 
exposure. The outcome of these 
claims can be inherently uncertain, 
as the ultimate liability for potential 
legal claims and other matters may be 
dependent upon facts that are currently 
uncertain or unknown, the outcome 
of litigation proceedings and possible 
settlement negotiations. 
We evaluated the Directors’ process to 
identify and quantify such exposures 
and obtained supporting evidence for 
the key assumptions including reports 
from specialists where appropriate. 
We also discussed these matters with 
internal legal counsel, obtained letters 
from external counsel and considered 
the appropriateness of the disclosure 
made in the Group ﬁnancial statements. 
The provision for uncertain 
tax positions 
Refer to page 72 (Audit Committee 
report) and page 1 12 (Accounting 
policies and critical estimates 
and judgements) 
The Group operates in a number 
of territories and recognises tax 
based on interpretation of local 
laws and regulations which are 
sometimes uncertain. The Group 
has established provisions against 
uncertain tax positions which requires 
Director judgement.
We involved our teams in the relevant 
jurisdictions who have knowledge of 
the local tax law to understand the 
extent of the exposure arising from 
the Group’s arrangements. 
We obtained the latest correspondence 
between the Group and the relevant tax 
authorities and considered the views of 
the Group’s external advisers on these 
matters where appropriate.
We met with senior management 
and challenged the judgements 
and evaluated the appropriateness 
of the provisions made. 
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be 
able to give an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, taking into account 
the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which the Group operates.
The Group’s accounting process is structured around a local ﬁnance function in 
the 10 territories in which the Group has signiﬁcant operations. These functions 
maintain their own accounting records and controls and report to the head ofﬁce 
ﬁnance team through an integrated consolidation system. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the 
type of work that needed to be performed in the territories by us, as the Group 
engagement team, or component auditors within PwC UK and from other PwC 
network ﬁrms operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have 
in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufﬁcient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the 
Group ﬁnancial statements as a whole.
In the current year, the Group engagement team visited the US component audit 
team; held a global partner meeting during the year which was attended by 
component team partners from the USA, UK, Canada, France, and Denmark; and 
had regular dialogue with the component teams throughout the year. 
The Group consolidation, ﬁnancial statement disclosures and a number of 
complex items were audited by the Group engagement team at the head ofﬁce. 
These included derivative ﬁnancial instruments, hedge accounting, impairment, 
litigation and share-based payments. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit is inﬂuenced by our application of materiality. We set 
certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative 
considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the 
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and on the ﬁnancial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the ﬁnancial 
statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £33 million (2013: £32 million).
How we determined it 5 per cent of proﬁt before tax, adjusted 
for non-recurring exceptional items.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that proﬁt before tax, 
adjusted for non-recurring exceptional 
items provides us with a consistent year-
on-year basis for determining materiality 
by eliminating the non-recurring impact 
of these items. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements 
identiﬁed during our audit above £1.5 million (2013: £1.5 million), as well as 
misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons. 
Going concern
The Directors have voluntarily complied with Listing Rule 9.8.6 (R)(3) of the UK 
Financial Conduct Authority and provided a statement in relation to going concern, 
set out in the Directors’ report, required for UK registered companies with a 
premium listing on the London Stock Exchange.
The Directors have requested that we review the statement on going concern as 
if the Group were a UK registered company. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is 
appropriate to prepare the ﬁnancial statements using the going concern basis 
of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate 
resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend it to do so, for 
at least one year from the date the ﬁnancial statements were signed. As part of 
our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis 
is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these 
statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. Wolseley plc

Responsibilities for the ﬁnancial statements 
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 
79, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and 
for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing
What an audit of ﬁnancial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and 
 the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, 
to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to 
draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of 
controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the Company ﬁnancial statements
Year ended 31 July 2014
1. Corporate information
Wolseley plc (the “Company”) was incorporated and registered in Jersey on 28 September 2010 under the Jersey Companies Law as a 
public company limited by shares under the name Wolseley plc with registered number 106605. The principal legislation under which the 
Company operates is the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, and regulations made thereunder. The address of its registered ofﬁce 
is 26 New Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3RA, Channel Islands. It is headquartered in Switzerland.
The principal activity of the Company is to act as the ultimate holding company of the Wolseley Group of companies.
2. Company accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company are presented in compliance with the requirements for companies whose shares are 
traded on the London Stock Exchange’s main market. They have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost 
convention, and in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(“UK GAAP”). They are presented in pounds sterling which is the functional currency of the Company.
The Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash ﬂow statement on the grounds that it is included in the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements which it has prepared. 
Note 8 (Dividends) on page 1 19, note 26 (Share capital) on page 135 and note 27 (Share-based payments) on page 136 of the Wolseley plc 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements form part of these ﬁnancial statements.
Foreign currencies
The cost of the Company’s investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings is translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date 
of investment.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the 
transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. All currency translation differences are charged/credited to the proﬁt and loss account.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are recorded at cost less provision for impairment. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether 
there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired.
Cash at bank and in-hand
Cash at bank and in-hand includes cash in-hand and deposits held with banks which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset and intention 
to net settle with cash balances.
Share capital
The Company has one class of shares, ordinary shares, which are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of 
new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Where the Company or one of the Company’s trusts purchases the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are 
cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently disposed or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Company’s executive share option, long-term incentive and share purchase 
and ordinary share plan schemes. The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value 
of the awards, measured using Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined 
at the date of grant (including the impact of non-vesting conditions such as requirement for employees to save) and is not subsequently 
remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modiﬁed. Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reﬂect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to 
the failure to satisfy service conditions or achieve non-market performance conditions. Wolseley plc

13. Contingent liabilities
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims and legal actions in progress. The Company takes legal advice as to 
the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice that the action is 
unlikely to succeed or a sufﬁciently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
In addition, the Company has given certain banks authority to transfer at any time any sum outstanding to its credit against or towards 
satisfaction of its liability to those banks of certain subsidiary undertakings. The Company has also given indemnities and warranties to the 
purchasers of businesses from the Company and certain Group companies in respect of which no material liabilities are expected to arise.

Each of the Non Executive Directors of the Company has an appointment letter with the Company, and the Executive Directors and certain 
other senior managers of the Group have assignment letters in place with the Company. Total employment costs of the Company for the 
period, including Non Executive Directors and seconded employees, were £1 million (2013: £1 million).

Report on the Company ﬁnancial statements
Our opinion
Our opinion
In our opinion Wolesley plc’s Company ﬁnancial statements (the “ﬁnancial 
statements”), deﬁned below:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 July 2014 
and of its proﬁt for the year then ended; and
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of 
this report.
What we have audited
The ﬁnancial statements comprise:
 the Company balance sheet as at 31 July 2014;
 the Company proﬁt and loss account for the year then ended; and
 the notes to the ﬁnancial statements, which include a summary of signiﬁcant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards.
What an audit of ﬁnancial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to 
give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
 the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and
 the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 (the “Annual Report”) to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Other matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations 
received
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company or proper 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
 the ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit. 
Other required reporting 
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited ﬁnancial statements; or
 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Opinion on other matter
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report 
for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion on additional disclosures
The Company voluntarily prepares a Directors’ remuneration report in accordance 
with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006. The Directors have requested 
that we audit the part of the Directors’ remuneration report speciﬁed by the UK 
Companies Act 2006. In our opinion the part of the Directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the UK Companies 
Act 2006.
Responsibilities for the ﬁnancial statements and 
the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out 
on page 79, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial 
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with terms of engagement and 
for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements of Wolseley plc for 
the year ended 31 July 2014.

Dividend payment methods
1. Direct payment to your bank: You are encouraged to receive your dividends directly to your bank or building society account. 
This is more convenient and helps reduce the risk of cheques becoming lost or delayed in the post. The associated tax voucher will 
still be sent direct to your registered address. To switch to this method of payment you can download a dividend mandate form from 
the Shareview website (www.shareview.co.uk). Alternatively, you can contact Equiniti by telephone who will also be able to assist with 
any questions you may have.
2. Overseas payment service: If you live overseas, Equiniti offers an Overseas Payment Service which is available in certain 
countries. This may make it possible to receive dividends direct into your bank account in your local currency*. Further information 
can be found on the Wolseley plc website, Shareview website or you can contact Equiniti by telephone. 
3. Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP): The Company offers a DRIP which gives shareholders the opportunity to use their 
dividend to purchase further Wolseley shares. Instead of receiving cash, shareholders receive as many whole shares as can be 
bought with their dividend, taking into account related purchase costs. Any residual cash will be carried forward and added to their 
next dividend. 
If you wish to join the DRIP , you can download copies of the DRIP terms and conditions and the DRIP mandate form from the 
Shareview website. Simply complete the DRIP mandate form and return it to Equiniti. Should you have any questions on the DRIP 
or wish for a paper mandate form to be sent to you, please contact Equiniti on 0871 384 2268**. Please note that if you wish to 
join the DRIP in time for the 2014 ﬁnal dividend, our Registrars, Equiniti, must have received the instruction by 6 November 2014. 
Instructions received by Equiniti after this date will be applied to the next dividend.
* Please note that a payment charge would be deducted from each individual payment before conversion into your local currency.
** Calls to this number are charged at 8 pence per minute plus network extras. Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday, excluding UK public holidays. Wolseley plc

Forward-looking statements
Certain information included in this Annual Report and Accounts is 
forward-looking and involves risks, assumptions and uncertainties 
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Forward-
looking statements cover all matters which are not historical facts 
and include, without limitation, projections relating to results of 
operations and ﬁnancial conditions and the Company’s plans 
and objectives for future operations, including, without limitation, 
discussions of expected future revenues, ﬁnancing plans, expected 
expenditures and divestments, risks associated with changes in 
market conditions and pressures on margins, changes in the level 
of litigation, employee motivation, the performance and resilience of 
the Company’s systems and infrastructure, the level of government 
regulation and ﬁnancial risks (such as ﬂuctuations in exchange and 
interest rates).
Forward-looking statements can be identiﬁed by the use of forward-
looking terminology, including terms such as “believes”, “estimates”, 
“anticipates”, “expects”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “plans”, “projects”, 
“goal”, “target”, “aim”, “may”, “will”, “would”, “could” or “should” 
or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable 
terminology. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of 
future performance. All forward-looking statements in this Annual 
Report and Accounts are based upon information known to 
the Company on the date of this Annual Report and Accounts. 
Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any particular 
expectation will be met and readers are cautioned not to place 
undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only 
at their respective dates.
Additionally, forward-looking statements regarding past trends or 
activities should not be taken as a representation that such trends or 
activities will continue in the future. Other than in accordance with its 
legal or regulatory obligations (including under the UK Listing Rules, 
the Prospectus Rules, the Disclosure Rules and the Transparency 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority), the Company undertakes 
no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking 
statement, whether as a result of new information, future events 
or otherwise. Nothing in this Annual Report and Accounts shall 
exclude any liability under applicable laws that cannot be excluded 
in accordance with such laws.

Paper
This report is printed on Amadeus 50 Silk paper and cover 
board, with Amadeus 100 offset used in the ﬁnancial section. 
Amadeus 50 Silk is made from 25 per cent de-inked post-
consumer waste, 25 per cent unprinted pre-consumer

Amadeus 100 offset is made from 100 per cent de-inked 
post consumer waste. Both products are fully biodegradable 
and recyclable and produced in mills which hold IS0 9001 
and ISO 14001 accreditation.
Printing
Printed by Pureprint Group. The printing inks are made with non-hazardous vegetable 
oil from renewable sources. Over 90 per cent of solvents and developers are recycled

The greenhouse gas emissions from the production and distribution of this Annual 
Report and Accounts have been neutralised through The Gold Standard Basa Magogo 
offsetting project in South Africa. 
The ﬁrst Gold Standard project of its kind in the world, this innovative behaviour-change 
programme teaches local communities in South Africa to burn coal differently in order 
to be more fuel efﬁcient, thereby reducing carbon emissions. The technique, called 
Basa Magogo, means “Light it up! Grandmother” in Zulu. In addition to the emission 
reductions, the Basa Magogo technique also improves visibility and reduces health 
risks by producing less smoke. Wolseley plc

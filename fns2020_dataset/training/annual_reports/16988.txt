Market overview 
Capital expenditure in the mining sector 
increased as miners broke ground on a 
number of greenfield developments and 
brownfield expansions. Activity levels 
increased strongly in South America, 
Australia and Asia-Pacific, while promising 
progress was seen in North America, 
Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 
Activity levels in Western Europe remained 
low due to macro economic concerns in 
the region.
Sustained high oil prices supported 
increased investment and activity levels  
in the North American oil sands market.
Weir Minerals is the global leader in the 
provision of slurry handling equipment and 
associated spare parts for abrasive high 
wear applications. Mining and minerals 
constitutes the division’s largest sector  
but it has aligned product sales into niche 
markets, including oil sands. Products 
include pumps, hydrocyclones, valves, 
dewatering equipment, wear resistant 
linings, rubber products and  
screening machines. 
The division has a presence in the world’s 
key mining markets including South 
America, Australia, Asia-Pacific,  
Africa and North America.

Market overview 
The North American upstream market 
experienced a second year of rapid growth, 
underpinned by increased horizontal drilling 
of oil and liquids rich shale formations. 
Average US horizontal rig count, a leading 
indicator of upstream pressure pumping 
demand, increased 22% on 2010, while 
greater operating efficiency resulted in  
an estimated 32% increase in horizontal 
wells drilled. 
Middle East services markets benefited 
from oilfield development in Iraq and Saudi 
Arabia while downstream markets continue 
to be challenging.
Weir Oil & Gas designs and manufactures 
pumps and ancillary equipment and 
provides aftermarket service and support 
activities principally for the upstream oil and 
gas markets. The acquisitions of Seaboard 
and Novatech expand the division’s 
conventional and unconventional upstream 
equipment product portfolio to include 
high-pressure wellhead equipment and a 
broadened range of aftermarket pressure-
pump expendable components.
The downstream business occupies 
a niche position in the design and 
manufacture of centrifugal pumps for 
the refining industry. The division’s main 
operations are in North America, Europe 
and the Middle East with an expanding 
footprint in Asia-Pacific and South America.

Market overview 
The global nuclear market, active in the  
early part of the year, slowed following the 
Fukushima reactor incident. Demand for 
original equipment and spares across 
European and US thermal power markets 
remained subdued although growth 
continued in emerging markets, particularly 
India. Activity picked up in the oil and gas 
markets with good project activity in the 
Middle East and Asia-Pacific. The North 
American hydro power market saw good 
levels of activity. While renewables markets 
remained challenging in Europe, a number  
of opportunities have emerged across South 
America and Africa. General industrial and 
municipal markets remained subdued while 
unrest in Libya led to the cessation of all 
project activity in February 2011.
Weir Power & Industrial designs and 
manufactures valves, pumps and turbines  
as well as providing specialist and support 
services to the global power generation, 
industrial and oil and gas sectors.  
The division has locations in Europe,  
the Middle East, North America, India,  
China, Asia-Pacific and South Africa. 
The division’s capability in emerging  
markets was strengthened in 2011 with the 
acquisition of a majority stake in HIM Tech,

The Weir Group is well established in all three of our chosen 
markets: minerals, oil and gas and power. Throughout 2011, 
our strong manufacturing platform, operational excellence 
and flexible business model combined to enable the  
effective execution and acceleration of our growth  
plans in rapidly growing markets. 
Our priority of extending our positions in the high growth, long cycle minerals,  
oil and gas and power sectors through customer focus and operational 
excellence has been underpinned by our drivers of growth, Innovation, 
Collaboration and Global Capability. 02 The Weir Group PLC
Underpinning this were three main factors: the ability of our operations to execute 
effectively against our growth plans; positive conditions in the main markets that 
we serve; and our focus on consolidating and extending our positions in the 
world’s fastest growing economies. Whilst this is a business that always guards 
against complacency, the Group demonstrated during 2011 the strength of its 
business model and its ability, through the balance of its chosen end markets 
and operating geographies, to create shareholder value.
Revenues were up 40% and we are able to report an increase in Group pre-
tax profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles 
amortisation of 34% to a record £396m with cashflow from operations of £303m. 
We are proposing a final payment to shareholders of 25.8p per share, making 
33p for the full year, an increase of 22%. This reflects the Board’s confidence in 
the ability of the Group’s strategy, management and employees to continue to 
deliver sustainable growth.
An important theme of 2011 has been the progress made by the business 
in developing new products and enhancing underlying technologies. Whilst 
there has been strong momentum across the Group behind the other strategic 
priorities of collaboration and global capability, innovation has been a particular 
focus. Weir produces and supports technologically advanced products that 
are relied upon to function in many of the world’s harshest and most remote 
operating environments. Our passion for continuously improving these products 
and developing new technology to meet changing market challenges has 
resulted in a number of important new products and research developments 
during 2011. Innovation creates sustainable competitive advantage for Weir,  
high barriers to entry and is a key enabler of our continued aim to grow faster 
than our end markets. 
In addition to important organic growth initiatives, the acquisition in December 
2011 of Seaboard Holdings extends our leading position in the production 
and servicing of a wide range of surface equipment targeted at unconventional 
upstream oil and gas markets, with strong opportunities to take Seaboard 
products into new markets through Weir’s global networks. The acquisition in 
February 2012 of Novatech expands Weir’s offering in the fast-growing hydraulic 
fracturing pump consumables markets.
In a year of slowing  
global economic  
growth and considerable 
uncertainty in the 
eurozone, I am pleased 
to report that 2011 was 
a successful year for the 
Weir Group, delivering 
another record financial 
performance.
Structured  
for growth
Overview by Chairman 
Lord Smith of Kelvin
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Directors report  03
Doing business the right way means behaving with integrity, respecting the 
environment and the communities where we operate and providing safe working 
conditions for our employees and contractors. We have continued to focus on 
these commitments. The Group’s Code of Conduct and programme of training 
for Weir employees supporting the Code creates an ethical framework that is  
well understood and acted upon by Weir employees, wherever they operate.  
The Group’s sustainability initiatives have also progressed, with actions underway 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our businesses. A number of initiatives 
are in place to improve safety performance and bolster the safety culture across 
the Group. Our sustainability report on pages 54 to 68 provides more detail.
During 2011, the Board visited our operations in South America to develop a 
better understanding of one of our key markets. The visit reinforced yet again 
the major contribution made to the success of the Weir Group by our people, 
wherever they operate. The substantial investment this year in a new management 
and leadership development framework across the Group is a positive illustration 
of how we are developing talent across the organisation. A key element in 
sustaining the success of the Group lies in ensuring that the right people are in  
the right roles and that sufficient leadership potential is being nurtured throughout 
the organisation to enable effective succession planning. This framework will  
play an important role in developing and supporting these aims.
Central to the effective management of the business and maintaining the 
confidence of investors are high standards of corporate governance. As 
Chairman, I seek to ensure that the Board is as effective as possible and I believe 
strongly that this is the case. This year the issue of diversity was focused upon, 
considering how this applies both at Board level and throughout the wider 
organisation. The Board composition today includes experts in our principal  
end markets alongside City and relevant financial experience. Of our ten directors, 
one is female and one a foreign national. We will continue to consider the benefits 
of greater diversity, in balance with ensuring the best person is appointed to  
the relevant role. 
I would like to thank my fellow directors for their hard work and support 
throughout the year, including two new non-executive directors, Melanie Gee 
and Alan Ferguson, who added their skills and experience to the Board during 
2011. I would also like to thank three members of the Board who stand down 
at our annual general meeting in May. Michael Dearden, our senior independent 
director and Remuneration Committee chairman, leaves the Board after nine 
years and Stephen King, Audit Committee chairman, leaves after six years.  
Alan Mitchelson, Legal and Commercial Director, also stands down after 12 
years with the Group, 11 of those as an executive director. On behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank them for their excellent contributions to the Group. 
Lord Robertson will become senior independent director, Alan Ferguson Audit 
Committee chairman and Melanie Gee Remuneration Committee chairman.  
At the same time, Keith Ruddock, who is currently General Counsel for Upstream 
International, Royal Dutch Shell plc, will take over as General Counsel and 
Company Secretary.
As we seek to grow ahead of our end markets, concerns over the health of  
many of the world’s major economies continue. It is difficult to predict how  
strong these economic headwinds could become, but we approach 2012  
with the confidence that our clear strategy and flexible business model will  
enable continued progress.

Driving growth  
The Weir Way
Overview by Chief Executive 
Keith Cochrane
New product introductions, further benefits from cross-divisional collaboration 
and an expansion of our global sales and service footprint contributed to these 
results. We also benefited from accelerating our upstream capacity expansion 
plans announced in March last year and our focus on growing sales of the 
broader product portfolio. Successful delivery of our growth plans is due to  
the efforts of the more than 14,000 people who work for Weir and I want to  
thank each of them for their contribution. 
Against an uncertain macro-economic environment, conditions in our two 
principal markets remained positive. In mining, continued growth in emerging 
market demand alongside forecast shortages of key commodities triggered a 
significant pick-up in capital spending with a number of greenfield projects now 
underway across South America, Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. In oil and 
gas, North American upstream markets experienced further rapid growth from 
onshore drilling in oil and liquids rich shale formations with US domestic oil 
production at its highest level for nearly a decade and over US$80 billion of 
investment by exploration and production majors in this sector. In power 
markets, following the Fukushima incident, safety assessments delayed new 
nuclear developments and low levels of conventional generation new build  
and general industrial activity continued in North America and Europe.
2011 performance 
Overall order input, in constant currency, was up 30% with original equipment 
input up 36% as expansion of the North American frac fleet continued and 
procurement for greenfield mining projects commenced. Aftermarket input was 
up 25% as we benefited from increased activity levels across our main markets 
and market share gains across the broader minerals product portfolio.
Group revenues were up 40% on a constant currency basis, while the proportion 
of revenues from original equipment sales increased to 48% from 42% last year. 
Our upstream oil and gas operations more than doubled their revenues for the 
second year in succession. Together these contributed to a record profits 
performance. While operating margins were impacted by the swing to lower 
margin original equipment, this investment will provide an increasing installed 
base to drive future higher margin aftermarket opportunities. 
The Group has 
successfully advanced 
its strategy in 2011, 
extending its positions 
in the mining, oil and 
gas and power markets 
and adding business 
capability. Combined 
with effective execution 
in rapidly growing 
markets, this has 
resulted in a strong 
performance, achieving 
in two years our 
ambition set out in June 
2010 to double 2009 
profits in five years.  05
Across our divisions a number of notable successes contributed to the financial 
performance. In Minerals, significant contract awards were achieved in all mining 
markets, with South America particularly strong. The division benefited from 
growing sales of our enlarged mine dewatering portfolio and a broader range  
of ancillary products and services. In upstream oil and gas, rapid market 
acceptance of the new Destiny™ pump, combined with capacity and supply 
chain expansion, helped to gain market share in the fast growing North American 
market. Power & Industrial achieved a landmark contract win for nuclear control 
valves in South Korea and the 2010 acquisitions have contributed positively to 
divisional performance.
During 2011, we continued to invest in growth plans with around 2,000 new 
employees joining the Group. Investment in research and development increased 
by 24% to £18m, whilst capital expenditure of £95m supported growth plans 
including capacity expansion at Weir SPM with a further US$75m investment  
in capacity now underway for that operation. 
We generated free cashflow from continuing operations of £29m after significant 
investment in working capital and fixed assets to support business growth. 
Despite this investment, our return on capital employed increased by over  
2% as we leveraged our global operating platform in delivering this growth.  
Following the year end, the balance sheet has been strengthened by the issue  
of attractively priced long term debt to refinance short term bank debt taken on  
to fund the Seaboard acquisition and provide additional financial resources.  
We retain financial flexibility to pursue both organic growth initiatives and  
further acquisition opportunities in line with our strategy.
Group strategy and business model 
The Group will continue to extend its position in the minerals, oil and gas and 
power sectors and aims to deliver growth ahead of these end markets. These  
are high growth, long cycle markets with positive fundamentals. This strategy  
is delivered through sustainable organic growth supplemented by targeted 
acquisitions consistent with our disciplined financial criteria. We invest in people, 
technology and infrastructure to develop and maintain the strong and lean 
operating platform from which we grow market share and create competitive 
advantage. Our strategy is underpinned by our three pillars - Innovation, 
Collaboration and Global Capability. 
During 2011 we continued to make good 
progress against our key priorities:
•  Took new major products such as the 
Destiny™ and Warman
®
 WBH
®
 pumps 
successfully to market. 
•  Established the Weir Advanced Research 
Centre to provide technological competitive 
advantage.
•  Captured market share with strong growth in 
sales of the dewatering portfolio and ancillary 
products and services in minerals markets and 
in upstream oil and gas markets through new 
products and operational responsiveness.
•  Accelerated growth with strategically aligned 
and value-enhancing acquisitions in South 
Korea and the North American upstream  
oil and gas sector. 
•  Extended the Group’s presence in fast 
growing economies through the growth  
of the Indian and Chinese operations. 
•  Invested over £95m in capital expenditure 
to improve operating efficiency, customer 
focus and extend manufacturing and service 
capability including: 
• Investment in manufacturing and service  
 capacity in North American upstream   
 operations to address demand for pressure  
 pumping and related flow control equipment

Weir provides mission critical engineering solutions that can operate in highly 
abrasive environments and require specialised service and support, often in 
remote locations. Engineering expertise, supply chain quality and global support 
capability provide the operating context for our business model. This focuses  
on supplying innovative and highly engineered original equipment to grow an 
installed base which in turn provides future aftermarket opportunities, enabling 
exposure to customers capital and operating budgets and providing resilience  
in cyclical markets. 
Driving growth 
The Group has made good progress against its strategic priorities throughout  
the year. Each division introduced new products during the period, including  
the launch of enhanced core products for the Oil & Gas and Minerals Divisions. 
We have invested in engineering resources across our divisions, recruiting more 
engineers and developing Group-wide engineering initiatives. The Weir Advanced 
Research Centre, aimed at developing breakthrough technologies in the form of 
new products and enhancements to existing products for our key markets was 
established during the year and a number of projects are underway. All three 
divisions have worked together to ensure that the full capability of the Group  
can be brought to bear on the markets that we serve with the upstream oil and 
gas sector an area of particular focus through the work of the Oil & Gas Forum,  
which brings together cross-divisional technical and market expertise to  
target growth opportunities. 
In December 2011, we extended our presence in the fast growing upstream oil 
and gas markets with the acquisition of Seaboard, a leading US manufacturer of 
wellhead solutions and in February 2012 completed the acquisition of Novatech, 
a US supplier of pressure pump expendables. Seaboard broadens our product 
portfolio and service footprint in attractive conventional and unconventional 
markets and acquisition integration is now well underway. The acquisition of  
a majority stake in HIM Tech, now Weir International, a South Korean valves 
manufacturer, expands our control valve expertise and provides access to the 
domestic market and Korea’s successful international engineering contractors. 
Our priority of driving growth in our Indian and Chinese businesses has 
progressed, with a 65% increase in like-for-like revenues and a growing 
contribution to the best-cost sourcing activities of the Group. 
This progress has been supported by an ongoing focus on operational 
excellence and functional initiatives. A number of procurement activities were 
introduced during 2011 which will increase the efficiency of the supply chain in 
2012 and enable the Group to better leverage its purchasing power. Improving 
metrics for the Weir Commercial System, Weir Production System and Net 
Promoter Score demonstrate our continued focus on customer service and  
the application of a lean philosophy across our operating platform. 
People 
Keeping our people safe remains our number one priority. Following a strong 
performance in 2010, our safety record during 2011 was disappointing. The 
imperative to improve led to a reinvigorated focus on safety across the Group 
and an improved performance in the second half of the year. An Environment, 
Health and Safety (EHS) excellence committee has been established under the 
leadership of the director of operations support and development. The committee 
has introduced a number of important initiatives to ensure adherence to high  
and globally consistent standards in health and safety practices across  
our operations.

Strong progress was made during 2011 on the priority of developing the 
capability of our people as the Group continues to grow in size, complexity and 
geographical reach. Key senior management appointments were made focused 
on operational support and talent development. A consistent management and 
leadership development framework aligned to the Weir strategy was also 
established during the year, creating a talent pipeline to support the present  
and future capability needs of our global operations. 
Finally, I am proud of the professional and responsive way in which our people 
acted to evacuate safely colleagues and contractors from Libya at the onset of 
unrest in February 2011.
Outlook 
The Group remains well positioned to benefit from the medium term growth 
prospects of our end markets despite the uncertain global economic environment:
•  Demand for minerals, oil and gas and power is underpinned by the continuing 
population growth and industrialisation of major developing economies such  
as China and India.
•  The development of the world’s growing unconventional oil and gas resources 
will provide greater energy security for many countries.
•  Industrialisation, environmental concerns and ageing power plants will 
accelerate the need for new and refurbished power infrastructure in both  
the developed and developing world.
We will maintain our focus on our three strategic pillars and continue to drive 
operational excellence throughout the Group. In 2012, we aim to grow ahead  
of our end markets by:
•  Successfully integrating Seaboard and Novatech to leverage products,  
skills and geographic reach.
•  Delivering on our Weir SPM multi-site expansion plans and adding capacity  
in the Minerals Division.
•  Building on the new products momentum with a specific focus on Oil & Gas 
Forum initiatives. 
•  Enhancing supply chain performance to drive operational efficiency and 
increase customer responsiveness.
•  Improving operational and safety performance through ongoing investment  
and the work of the EHS excellence committee.
The Group enters 2012 with a strong orderbook and with our clear strategy  
and flexible business model we expect a year of further good progress  
consistent with current consensus expectations.

Innovation is central to Weir’s growth plans. The development 
of new products and technologies provides the Group and our 
customers with competitive advantage. Innovation also applies to 
the operational improvements that we make and how we extend 
our existing product ranges into new markets. During 2011, we 
introduced new products in each of our key markets, focusing on 
enabling our customers to operate for longer, with less frequent 
maintenance requirements. We invested in the infrastructure to 
support innovation, establishing the Weir Advanced Research 
Centre with Strathclyde University, providing a platform for creating 
breakthrough technologies in areas such as materials development 
and flow control. We also continued to invest heavily in engineering 
resources across the Group.
Significant new product introductions during 2011 included the market 
leading Destiny™ pump for the onshore upstream oil and gas sector. 
The pump offers higher output and pressure loads, responding to 
customer demand for equipment to meet the challenges of harsher shale 
environments. The new Warman
®
 WBH
®
 centrifugal slurry pump was also 
launched across our global minerals networks, featuring more than 20 design 
enhancements compared to existing technology and good progress was 
made on the development of new technology for nuclear markets.
One of the key differentiators of Weir products is the superiority of our 
materials and wear life. This year we have committed to developing our 
underlying technologies with a cross-divisional team of Weir engineers and 
leading engineering academics from the Weir Advanced Research Centre 
examining how our products can benefit from the use of specialist coatings 
used in applications in other industries. This project is an early example of  
the potential commercial application this new research framework provides 
the Group. 
Enhanced engineering processes were developed throughout the year 
with the establishment of best practice audits and cross-divisional groups 
to ensure new approaches in technology can be leveraged across all our 
businesses. We also invested in state-of-the-art software to enhance failure 
and performance analysis to ensure our engineering capability remains at  
the leading edge of the industry. 
Innovation also applies to extending our product offering to new and existing 
markets. Strong growth this year in sales of ancillary products and services, 
such as Linatex rubber products in the minerals and oil and gas sectors, 
demonstrates how products from our recently acquired businesses are 
enabling the Group to build out its position in important markets. After 
engineers and service experts worked with customers around the world,  
this year, for the first time, Minerals took a full mine dewatering product 
portfolio to global mining markets.

The end markets served by Weir share similar technical challenges 
and production characteristics, allowing us to apply expertise 
and engineering skills in abrasive and critical applications from 
all our divisions to one particular sector. To make the most of this 
Group-wide capability, we work together across our businesses, 
divisions and regions to share expertise, solve problems and help 
our customers. Weir people worked in partnership with each other, 
our customers and other partners throughout 2011 to optimise our 
performance across our key markets.
The Oil & Gas Forum, a cross-divisional initiative, uses the expertise and 
resources across the Group to focus on a wider customer and market base 
within the oil and gas sector. The Forum has 13 projects underway, with 
successful trials being held, several millions of dollars in revenue generated 
and new products taken to market. One example is the development of 
STAMPEDE™, a new line of downhole packing equipment applying Minerals 
leading elastomer expertise to upstream oil and gas applications.
A broadened shared engineering services capability in India, offering 
design, value engineering and automation solutions has provided additional 
engineering resources to all divisions in 2011, eliminating bottlenecks in 
product development and reducing product time to market.
In Africa and Australia, a new approach to sales and customer targeting has 
led to the Power & Industrial Division joining forces with Minerals colleagues 
to leverage the strength of Minerals infrastructure and operations in order to 
increase market share. 
The alliance between Minerals and KHD Humboldt on High Pressure Grinding 
Rollers (HPGR) made good progress this year with a number of new projects 
secured and increasing aftermarket support for HPGR as acceptance of the 
benefits of this technology by the mill circuit industry grows. As capital costs 
associated with traditional SAG mills have increased with the growth of large 
scale minerals processing plants, the HPGR alternative offers lower initial 
start up costs, which is further enhanced by reduced operating costs owing 
to its more efficient grinding action. 
Closer collaboration with customers has also been made possible by the 
opening this year of new onsite service centres at some of the largest mining 
operations in the Asia-Pacific region, enabling Weir to provide rapid support.

Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Directors report
Weir is one of the few engineering solutions providers with global 
capability. Around one third of our revenues during 2011 came 
from the fast growing economies of Asia-Pacific, South America, 
the Middle East and Africa as global demand for resources 
continues. We are committed to be where our customers are, 
from upstream oil and gas production in North America to nuclear 
power generation in South Korea and copper mining in Chile. 
This commitment to global capability enables Weir to best serve 
our customers and provide our products and services to new 
international markets.
In 2011, good progress was made in developing Weir’s presence in fast  
growing markets. 
The acquisitions of Seaboard and Novatech accelerate Weir’s growth 
momentum in North American unconventional oil and gas markets, whilst 
also strengthening Weir’s product offering for emergent international shale 
opportunities and further expanding the service footprint. The addition to  
the Group of the South Korean valves business, Weir International, provides 
access to a developing domestic market as well as to the increasing 
international success of Korean engineering, procurement and  
construction contractors. 
Prompted by the growth and increasing geographical spread of US and 
Canadian shale drilling operations, our upstream operations have expanded 
manufacturing and service capacity, utilising other Group facilities in North 
America to support growth. The development of North American multi-
site manufacturing is at an advanced stage, with key aftermarket products 
now produced from three sites, ensuring customer equipment is supplied, 
repaired and put back in the field as quickly as possible. 
Growth ambitions in China were supported by the opening by Weir Minerals 
Netherlands of an assembly facility for its GEHO
®
 pumps in Taicang, 
enhancing customer relationships by ensuring rapid original equipment  
and parts supply for the large installed base of GEHO
®
 pumps in China.  
Weir Shengli Highland, the joint venture established in 2010 to serve the 
emergent onshore oil and gas drilling sector in China, assembled and  
tested its first pumps during the year.
Expansion of the Minerals service centre network during 2011 supported 
sales of a broadening product portfolio in all key mining markets. Fifteen  
new centres were opened across Europe, Africa, the US, Australia and  
Asia-Pacific.

Weir Minerals is the global leader in abrasive high wear 
applications of slurry handling and dewatering solutions, providing 
comprehensive ‘through life’ service and aftermarket support. 
Mining is the division’s largest sector with aligned product sales 
into other markets, particularly the North American oil sands.  
The division continues to extend successfully its market reach 
through adjacent product areas including wear resistant linings, 
rubber products and screening machines. Collaboration with 
KHD Humboldt has ensured a growing presence in high pressure 
grinding rollers, a new and more efficient milling technology that 
lowers capital and operating costs on large mining projects. 
The division’s leadership position is underpinned by specialist 
engineering expertise and ongoing investment in wear resistant 
materials technology and engineered hydraulics. This focus  
delivers high performance equipment in a range of applications  
that are critical to customer operations. 
The division has a growing manufacturing, service and support 
footprint in all key mining markets, including South America, 
Australia, Asia-Pacific, Africa and North America.
Market review 
Capital expenditure in the mining sector increased by over 20%  
in 2011, as miners broke ground on a number of greenfield 
developments and brownfield expansions. Activity levels increased 
strongly in South America, Australia and Asia-Pacific in particular, 
driven by copper and iron ore projects, while promising progress was 
seen in North America, Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 
In contrast, activity levels in Western Europe remained low due to 
macro-economic concerns in the region. Although the timing of 
orders for large projects is unpredictable, quotation activity continued 
at elevated levels throughout the year, despite falling industrial metal 
prices in the second half. Copper prices fell by around 20% in the 
year but, similar to most industrial metals, remained above the 
incentive level required for new investment. Gold prices gained  
11% in the year and continue to attract investment.
Global ore production increased by an estimated 5% in 2011,  
again driven by increasing demand from China and other emerging 
markets, particularly for copper, iron ore and coal. Average ore 
yields continued to fall as lower grade ores were developed, 
necessitating increased rock processing to obtain similar  
volumes of refined commodities. 16 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Directors report

Sustained high oil prices supported increased investment and 
activity levels in the North American oil sands market, with new 
project developments and increased production across the market. 
Demand for flue gas desulphurisation projects remained low, with 
customers in the US postponing investment pending clarity on the 
impact of new environmental legislation.

Operational performance 
The division delivered a record financial performance in positive 
conditions in mining and oil sands markets and through the 
successful execution of its strategic growth plans. Delivery of 
the division’s strategic priorities of product innovation, extending 
service coverage and growing complementary product sales 
enabled it to capitalise on high levels of investment and increased 
production volumes in its end markets. Global sales of a full 
dewatering portfolio nearly doubled and included the successful 
delivery of a dewatering ‘mega barge’ to a North American oil 
sands project, an engineering first for the Group. In its first full year 
within the Group, Linatex has been an important driver of growth 
in ancillary products and services, a key strategic focus as the 
division broadens its offering of mill circuit solutions. In addition, 
annualised synergies of more than US$15m were achieved from 
the Linatex integration against initial expectations of between 
US$5m and US$10m. The opening of new service centres in 
major mining markets increased local support for customers  
and enhanced the division’s opportunities to drive sales of  
the broader portfolio.

Order input increased by 27% to £1,263m (2010: £996m).  
On a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of the September 
2010 acquisition of Linatex, which contributed £108m (2010: 
£27m), order input increased 19%. Original equipment orders 
grew 24% (23% on a like-for-like basis). Aftermarket orders grew 
29% and 16% on a like-for-like basis, benefiting from the strategic 
focus on the sale of ancillary products and services with organic 
growth of 26%. Original equipment orders represented 42% of 
total input (2010: 43%) and 45% (2010: 43%) excluding the 
impact of Linatex. 
The division secured orders from every major greenfield and 
brownfield project in South America, with greenfield projects 
driving strong demand for slurry and dewatering pumps. Orders 
were received for GEHO
®
 positive displacement pumps for iron  
ore and copper pipeline transportation projects totalling £40m. 
Elsewhere, notable orders included a £6m contract to supply  
a range of pumps and hoses for a Canadian oil sands project. 
Strong growth in ancillary products and services included the 
supply of cyclones and mill liners to a Polish copper mine, valves, 
cyclones and hoses for a large Russian gold mining project and  
a £2m order for Linatex screens for a North American iron ore 
project. Emerging markets accounted for 48% of input (2010: 
51%), with order growth from North American and European 
markets rising by 35% and 57% respectively. 
Revenue increased by 33% to £1,216m (2010: £911m). Like-for-
like revenues increased 26%, reflecting high activity levels across 
all main mining markets throughout the year, excluding Western 
Europe. Original equipment sales accounted for 42% of revenues 
(2010: 39%) or 45% (2010: 39%) on a like-for-like basis.
Operating profit increased by 22% to £214m (2010: £176m) as 
the division benefited from strong revenue growth and a full year 
profit contribution from Linatex of £14m, including synergies 
realised in the year. 
Operating margin declined to 17.6% (2010: 19.3%), reflecting  
a shift in mix towards original equipment deliveries, investment  
to support strategic growth initiatives and an increased proportion 
of lower margin ancillary products and service revenues.

Sibelco Australia and New Zealand processes 
and supplies raw materials for the Asia-Pacific 
region. It is part of the Sibelco Group, one  
of the largest industrial minerals companies  
in the world, with more than 225 sites in  
41 countries. 
Brief
Sibelco constantly seeks to use innovative 
methods and sophisticated equipment in its 
work of processing and supplying raw materials 
for the Australian, New Zealand and Asian 
markets. Its Tallawang mine in central western 
New South Wales was chosen as the site for  
the world’s first trial of Weir Minerals new 
Warman
®
 WBH
®
 centrifugal slurry pump.
Solution
Weir staff were onsite to oversee and assist  
with the pump installation. It was a trouble-free 
process, even with the need to make up a base 
plate for the WBH
®
 to bring it to the same height 
as its predecessor, a Warman
®
 8/6 AH. The 
changeover was completed in half the timescale 
estimated by Sibelco and the pump functioned 
effectively straight away. 
Result
The pump uses less power, runs cooler and can 
be adjusted during production, something that 
could not be achieved with previous pumps, 
extending the production cycle at the Tallawang 
site. When pump maintenance was required, 
Weir Minerals staff performed a complete rebuild 
onsite in one day, serving the additional purpose 
of training mine staff to perform the task in the 
future. “We had no hesitation in purchasing  
the pump at the end of the trial,” said Matt 
Cosgrove, Sibelco maintenance supervisor. 
Since the Sibelco trial, a further 39 WBH
®
 units 
are being trialled across global mining markets.

Investment 
The division has invested throughout 2011 in people, research and facilities in order to 
align capacity to strategic growth plans. Capital expenditure was £49m (2010: £30m) 
while research and development spend increased by 28% to £10m as the division took  
a range of new products to market and continued to develop its technology position  
for minerals markets and Oil & Gas Forum applications.
Expansion of an existing facility in Johannesburg enabled the consolidation of Linatex 
activities in South Africa with investment in heavy duty rubber presses, supporting  
strong sales growth of Linatex elastomer products. 
During 2011, Weir Minerals Netherlands opened an assembly facility for its GEHO
®
 
pumps brand in Taicang, China. This facility is a key element in delivering GEHO
®
’s 
objective to enhance customer relationships by ensuring rapid original equipment and 
spare parts supply and excellent services for the installed base of some 200 industrial 
GEHO
®
 pumps in China. 
Fifteen new service centres were added to the Minerals service footprint during 2011,  
in South Africa, Indonesia, Malaysia, Europe, the US and Australia, enhancing  
customer focus and extending opportunities to provide ancillary products and services. 
The acquisition in January 2012 of Swedish service business Gema expands Weir’s 
presence in one of Europe’s biggest centres for iron ore and copper mining.
Foundry upgrades in Chile led to production increases of 30% with operational  
efficiency gains and improved customer delivery performance. 
Weir Minerals has also added around 900 employees during the year to support  
the division’s growth. The Mill Circuit University was expanded with employees from 
around the globe attending an extensive programme in which they learn about the  
entire minerals processing circuit, enhancing the professionalism with which the  
division provides total solutions for customers. 
Outlook
Market fundamentals remain strong, driven by continued urbanisation and 
industrialisation in emerging markets and their increasing demand for raw materials.  
This increased demand, coupled with declining ore grades, supports the continued high 
level of investment planned by miners over the coming years, although industry-wide 
resource and skill shortages are likely to smooth and extend the current capital cycle. 
Forecasts show global mining capital expenditure remaining above 2011 levels through 
to 2015. Global ore production is expected to grow by around 5% per annum over the 
same period, supporting aftermarket products and services growth.
In 2012, our expectations are that mining activity levels will remain robust and we expect 
moderate growth in original equipment input, albeit the timing of orders for large projects 
is hard to predict. Market forecasts of ore production volume growth and a continuing 
focus on ancillary products and services mean that we anticipate good progress in 
shorter cycle aftermarket orders. Together with delivery of its strong opening orderbook, 
this is expected to result in higher 2012 revenues and operating profits compared to 
2011, while operating margins will stabilise at a broadly similar level.

Weir Oil & Gas designs and manufactures pumps and ancillary 
equipment and provides aftermarket service and support activities 
principally for the upstream oil and gas markets. The acquisitions  
of Seaboard and Novatech expand the division’s unconventional  
and conventional upstream equipment product portfolio to  
include high-pressure wellhead equipment and a broadened  
range of aftermarket pressure-pump expendable components.  
The downstream business occupies a niche position in the design 
and manufacture of centrifugal pumps for the refining industry.  
The division’s main operations are in North America, Europe and 
the Middle East with an expanding footprint in Asia-Pacific and 
South America.
Market review 
The North American upstream market experienced a second 
year of rapid growth, underpinned by increased horizontal drilling 
of oil and liquids rich shale formations, reflecting the attractive 
economics flowing from an average price for WTI crude of around 
US$90 a barrel and ending the year at over US$100. Average 
US horizontal rig count, a leading indicator of upstream pressure 
pumping demand, increased 22% on 2010, with the rate of growth 
moderating in the final quarter of the year, while greater operating 
efficiency resulted in an estimated 32% increase in horizontal wells 
drilled. Oil and liquids rich shale drilling now accounts for over half 
of all activity in North America and US domestic oil production 
rose to its highest level for nearly a decade. Conversely, falling US 
natural gas prices, driven by excess supply from the abundance of 
unconventional sources, led to an 11% reduction in the number of 
North American rigs targeting gas formations.
Merger and acquisition interest in US and Canadian oil shale 
assets increased materially in 2011, with national oil and major 
exploration and production companies purchasing acreage and 
service companies to increase their exposure to this fast-developing 
market. Investment began in infrastructure aligned to shale markets 
with pipeline construction and petrochemical plant expansion. 
Responsible shale development was identified by President Obama 
as a key part of the US energy future and a US Energy Secretary-
appointed committee recommended ways to ensure the adoption  
of best practice across the rapidly growing industry.
Outside of North America, China, Poland, Argentina and Australia 
started to develop their own significant shale resources with 
exploratory drilling underway while elsewhere there is growing 
international interest.

Middle East services markets benefited from investment in Iraqi and 
Saudi Arabian oilfield developments to increase production levels 
while downstream markets continue to be challenging. 
Achievements & contract wins
•  Accelerated upstream capacity expansion to meet growing market demand with  
a further US$75m investment now underway.
•  Rapid market acceptance of the new Destiny™ pump.
•  Completed development and commenced testing of ‘Mousetrap’, a more durable 
pump fluid end, due to launch in 2012, providing technological leadership in onshore 
completion operations.
•  Expanded service centre network in North America and Australia, increasing market 
share and providing improved levels of customer service. 
•  Established a service operation in Iraq and achieved input of more than US$20 million 
for Iraqi oilfield service contracts. 
•  Executed effectively ongoing restructuring plans in downstream operations.
Operational performance 
The division has again delivered a record financial performance, 
ahead of expectations, benefiting from rapid growth in the 
upstream shale markets and an ability to respond quickly to these 
trends. During 2011, upstream operations added manufacturing 
and support capacity, introduced new products and extended 
the service centre footprint as it seeks to meet growing customer 
demands. Good progress was also made by the Middle East 
Service operations, while downstream performance was impacted 
by competitive market conditions. No contribution has been 
recognised for the two week post-acquisition period of  
Seaboard given the close proximity to the year end.
Order input increased by 42% to £865m (2010: £609m). 
Upstream operations achieved input growth of 58% to a record 
£723m (US$1,160m), benefiting from strong market conditions, 
higher operating intensities and market share gains. This reflects a 
strengthening in orders through the second half with growth of 18% 
against the first half of the year with a new input record established 
in the fourth quarter as we saw significant forward ordering for delivery 
in the first half of 2012. Demand for original equipment continued to 
be driven by increased utilisation, fleet expansion and a replacement 
cycle accelerated by longer duration, higher pressure applications 
while aftermarket demand is benefiting from a growing installed 
base. Input across downstream and service operations fell by  
5% with growth in the Middle East service markets benefiting from 
growing activity in Iraq, offset by a challenging downstream market.

Weir Seaboard, Houston, Texas
Revenue increased by 65% to £743m (2010: £451m). Upstream 
revenues more than doubled to £613m (US$982m), benefiting 
from the strong opening orderbook, positive original equipment 
and aftermarket trends and market share increases over the year. 
This was achieved by the acceleration of capacity expansion 
plans, additional third party outsourcing and greater use of the 
Group’s North American existing capacity alongside the opening  
of four new service centres. 
Operating profit including joint ventures increased by 61% 
to £183m (2010: £114m) driven by the substantial increase in 
upstream activity and growing profits from the Middle East Service 
operations offset by a substantially reduced contribution from  
the downstream operations. In addition, one-off restructuring  
and transaction costs of £11m have been expensed, including 
those for the Seaboard acquisition.
Operating margin was 24.7% in 2011 (2010: 25.2%), with a 
positive mix effect from the upstream business and improving 
margins at the Middle East Service operations being offset by 
lower downstream margins reflecting reduced activity and  
one-off costs. Excluding one-off costs, margins were 26.1%. 
Investment 
Weir Oil & Gas continued to invest in its growth plans with capital expenditure of £32m 
(2010: £17m). During the year, Weir SPM expanded capacity at the Fort Worth facility 
completing the US$40m initial expansion plans, while a state-of-the-art plunger facility 
was installed at Weir Mesa and further investment was made in the Edmonton and 
Houston operations. A further US$75m investment was announced in the upstream 
business encompassing both additional machining capacity and office accommodation 
at the Fort Worth facility, further investment in Edmonton and the transfer of the Washington, 
North Carolina facility from the Power & Industrial Division. These projects will be 
completed by the end of 2012. 
Operating facilities are now established for the joint venture formed in 2010 with Shengli 
Oilfield Highland Petroleum Equipment Co. Ltd to provide high-pressure well service 
pumps and related flow control equipment to the developing shale gas industry in China, 
with the first pumps manufactured locally towards the end of 2011.
In December 2011, Seaboard Holdings was acquired for US$671m (£432m) and  
the acquisition of Novatech for an equivalent enterprise value of US$176m (£112m)  
was completed in February 2012. Seaboard is a respected manufacturer of wellhead 
equipment with extensive North American service operations and strong product 
adjacency to Weir’s existing upstream equipment portfolio. The acquisition increases  
the division’s contribution from high-growth markets, broadens activities beyond  
pressure pumping and increases Weir’s profile with service companies and end-user  
E&P companies. As well as driving the international growth of Seaboard’s products 
through the Weir network, the combination of Weir’s products and Seaboard’s field 
service capabilities will open up new adjacent markets. Novatech, a market leading  
valve and valve seat manufacturer, provides a platform to significantly increase 
aftermarket revenues in expendable components across the pressure pumping market. 
The division has a number  
of key priorities in 2012:
•  Delivering on capacity expansion.
•  Acquisition integration and capturing effectively 
synergy opportunities.
•  New product development.
•  Completion of downstream restructuring. 22 The Weir Group PLC
Overall spending on research and development increased by 13% to £5m. In addition 
to the development of ‘Mousetrap’, a quintuplex version of the Destiny™ pump will be 
launched in the first half of 2012, a product specifically designed for the longer duty 
cycles increasingly required in fracturing operations. 
A review of downstream operations was completed in the year to identify actions to 
improve product positioning and cost competitiveness in challenging market conditions. 
Restructuring of Italian operations is underway while a new assembly operation will open 
in Poland in early 2012. At the same time, investment in broadening routes to market 
and developing a range of more cost competitive products, positions the business to 
compete more effectively in 2012. Begemann, a range of process pumps focused on  
the downstream markets, was transferred to Oil & Gas from the Minerals Division, 
extending the division’s existing product portfolio.
Reflecting strong growth, over 500 employees joined the division this year, with effective 
assimilation and training programmes a key priority. Business capability was also 
expanded in the year to ensure the division has the appropriate skills, expertise and 
capacity to support higher activity levels and to embed a talent pipeline to support future 
growth and market needs. Management training and development initiatives continue 
across each operation in support of Group-wide plans while senior management 
resources were added to the upstream operations to support future growth potential.
Outlook
Weir Oil & Gas remains well positioned to deliver further growth. Current forecasts  
for 2012 indicate overall modest growth in average horizontal rig count in North America 
with a reduction in gas drilling offset by the continued shift towards oil and liquids  
rich drilling. 
We expect 2012 original equipment input for SPM and Mesa to be lower than 2011  
as pressure pumping market supply and demand move into balance, lead times reduce 
and the effects of forward ordering in 2011 unwind. This will be partly offset by good 
aftermarket input growth, driven by the larger installed base, continuing high activity 
levels and our recent and planned capacity additions. As a result, with a record opening 
orderbook providing good visibility over the first half, we now expect 2012 full year 
revenues from these operations to slightly exceed US$1 billion, somewhat ahead of  
our previous expectations.
The outlook for Seaboard and Novatech is in line with our expectations at the time 
of acquisition. Further growth is expected in the Middle East in 2012, underpinned 
by increased activity in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. A modest improvement in the 2012 
performance of downstream operations is anticipated. 
The medium term outlook for upstream remains positive with continued investment 
and associated infrastructure development anticipated in the North American onshore 
oil and gas sector. Responsible shale development was identified in 2012 by President 
Obama as a key part of the US energy future. Outside North America, international shale 
development is expected to grow, with exploration already underway in the large shale 
formations of Argentina, China and Australia.

With the world’s largest identified shale gas 
reserves, the nascent Chinese onshore oil  
and gas industry is an attractive future market 
for shale developments, with the Chinese 
Government identifying natural gas development 
as a key economic development goal. In late 
2010, Weir Oil & Gas entered into a joint venture 
with Shengli Oilfield Highland Petroleum 
Equipment Company and began building a  
well service pump manufacturing facility in 
Dongying, China.
Brief
This new well service pump manufacturing 
facility would manufacture SPM
®
 pumps in 
China for the Chinese market using the 
technology and expertise of the Weir SPM 
business in Fort Worth, Texas. The goal was  
to begin manufacturing SPM
®
 cement and  
frac pumps by the end of 2011.
Solution
In late 2010 work commenced to locate and 
build the facility that would manufacture, 
assemble and test the SPM
®
 pumps. Almost 
£1m of capital was invested in the building, 
machine tools and testing equipment. A new 
Chinese supply chain was developed to source 
most of the components locally with support 
from Weir SPM in Fort Worth.
Result
Within a year of signing the joint venture 
agreement the local business in Dongying was 
operational, with the first pumps assembled  
and tested. Weir Shengli Highland is now well 
positioned to capitalise on the growing 
unconventional shale gas opportunities in China.

Weir Power & Industrial designs and manufactures valves, pumps 
and turbines as well as providing specialist support services to  
the global power generation, industrial and oil and gas sectors.  
The division has locations in Europe, the Middle East, North 
America, India, China, Asia-Pacific and South Africa. 
The valve portfolio was extended in 2011 with the acquisition of 
Weir International in South Korea, strengthening the division’s 
emerging market focus. 
Market review 
The global nuclear market, active in the early part of the year, 
slowed following the Fukushima reactor incident. New build 
projects and non-essential maintenance and repair work were 
delayed with operators and developers awaiting clarification on  
the expected changes to safety requirements as a result of this 
incident. Demand for original equipment and spares across 
European and US thermal power markets remained subdued while 
growth continued in emerging markets, particularly India. The oil 
and gas markets saw good project activity in the Middle East and 
Asia-Pacific. The North American hydro power market saw good 
levels of activity with a number of significant projects started in the 
year. The European renewables market remained challenging while 
opportunities across South America and Africa emerged during 
the year. General industrial and municipal markets remained 
subdued with unrest in Libya leading to the cessation of all  
project activity in February 2011.
Achievements & contract wins
•  Awarded breakthrough Shin Ulchin reactor contract for nuclear service control valves 
with KHNP in South Korea. 
•  First full year revenues from Indian valves business Weir BDK more than 50% higher 
than the prior year period with increasing sales to the oil and gas and minerals sectors.
•  Developed product localisation strategy in China and India through Weir BDK and our 
Chinese control valves joint venture.
•  Secured large order to supply specialist sub-sea gate valves to major oil and gas 
customer. 
•  Weir American Hydro secured several multimillion dollar orders from major North 
American power companies for rehabilitation and turbine runner replacement and 
related field service work.
•  Developed renewables presence in South America with a contract to erect 44 wind 
turbines in Brasil.  24 The Weir Group PLC
Operational performance 
During the year, the division has focused on extending its product 
offering and routes to market, leveraging its low cost supply chain 
and integrating its 2010 and 2011 acquisitions. Good progress 
has been made against these strategic objectives, with a growing 
emerging market presence. The division has retained its focus on 
global power markets, particularly nuclear and hydro and at the same 
time is targeting the growing opportunities in the oil and gas sector for 
many of the division’s products and fully participating in the Oil & Gas 
Forum. The sub-sea rotary gate valve has been one example of this, 
with sales of the product to a broader range of oil and gas customers.
Order input increased by 18% to £312m (2010: £264m) with 
a £63m (2010: £17m) contribution from the 2010 and 2011 
acquisitions and like-for-like growth of 1%. Despite the South 
Korean contract success, nuclear input at £72m (2010: £82m) 
reflected the broader global slowdown in new projects and 
maintenance activity following the Fukushima reactor incident. 
Control and safety valve orders were up 34% benefiting from 
strategic investment in 2010. Strong domestic markets supported 
positive input trends at Weir BDK with the ability to now package a 
broader range of valve types already achieving good results while 
Weir American Hydro saw increased project activity levels. The 
proportion of orders from the power sector was 57% (2010: 61%). 
Revenue increased by 26% to £307m (2010: £244m) with 
a positive contribution from the 2010 and 2011 acquisitions. 
Underlying like-for-like revenues were up 1% and impacted by 
reduced power-focused maintenance activity and the cessation 
of work in Libya. Revenues from emerging markets increased by 
17% as the division benefits from its increased presence.
Operating profit increased by £1m to £27m (2010: £26m). There 
was a £6.4m contribution from current and prior year acquisitions 
compared to £1.0m last year, although this was offset by acquisition 
related costs of £2.9m (2010: £2.6m). A provision of £2.0m was 
recorded in the year for Libyan working capital exposures while 
further incremental investment was made in building business 
capability in support of the division’s strategic growth plans. 
Operating margin fell to 8.7% from 10.7% in 2010. While margins 
benefited from a positive contribution from the acquisitions, they 
were impacted by one-off costs, the Libya trading and provision 
impact and further investment in our strategic growth plans. 
Excluding acquisition related and other one-off costs, margins 
were 10.6% (2010: 11.7%).

Investment 
Weir Power & Industrial continued to pursue its growth plans with capital expenditure of 
£13m and investment of £2m in research and development as new product initiatives 
gained further momentum.
A new facility in Marseille for the French nuclear business was opened in December 
2011 and will consolidate previous facilities on a single site, while the construction 
of a new service centre in Montreal is well underway. This will add capacity to hydro 
power operations, supporting the important Canadian market and providing additional 
service and backup manufacturing capability to Weir American Hydro’s main facility 
in Pennsylvania. The manufacture of control valves through the Chinese joint venture 
commenced towards the end of the year, providing a cost competitive product for this 
important market.
The division has also announced plans to consolidate its US valve production at the 
Ipswich, Massachusetts facility in 2012 with the Washington, North Carolina facility 
transferring to Weir Oil & Gas providing additional manufacturing capacity to support  
their growth plans.
The division added to its valve portfolio through the acquisition of a majority stake in  
July 2011 of Weir International, a South Korean valve manufacturer. The business adds 
local content in Korea, expands engineering capabilities and provides strong links to 
important Korean contractors who supply both the home and international markets. 
Growth plans have been supported with the external appointments of key people to the 
divisional management team. Driving product innovation is the remit for the division’s first 
engineering director and a divisional sales director will ensure the division capitalises on 
its broader product portfolio and greater routes to market and grows opportunities for 
Power & Industrial products in aligned sectors.
The division has a number  
of key priorities in 2012:
•  Improving cost competitiveness through 
increased product localisation in India, South 
Korea and China.
•  Capitalising on a broader product range and 
increased routes to market through a fully 
integrated sales structure.
•  Expanding presence in oil and gas end markets.
•  Developing competitive advantage through 
product innovation.
Outlook
Current market conditions remain mixed with global economic concerns and ongoing 
delays in both new power plant build programmes and maintenance activities offset by 
continuing good opportunities to drive growth through our strategic initiatives and recent 
acquisitions. The oil and gas sector will continue to offer good opportunities in 2012 
and we are hopeful of a pick up in nuclear activity as safety recommendations following 
the Fukushima incident are reflected in new build designs and generate increased 
service and aftermarket demand from the installed base. The global power market 
outlook across the medium term remains positive given a structural shortage of power 
in emerging markets extending over a number of years while growing environmental 
requirements and ageing plant drives growth in developed markets.
An improved financial performance is expected in 2012 as the division benefits from 
a strong opening orderbook, a reduction in one-off costs and an increased focus on 
opportunities in oil and gas markets.

when it was completed in 1913. Recently, the 
owner of the plant, Ameren Missouri of St Louis, 
sought to increase efficiency by upgrading and 
refurbishing turbine units at the facility.
Brief
Weir American Hydro, based in york, 
Pennsylvania had previously worked on 
upgrading and refurbishing nine of the plant’s 15 
units. The business was awarded a contract to 
design, manufacture and install two advanced 
technology runners at the power station. 
Solution
Scheduled to be completed in mid-2012, the 
project has involved two years of engineering 
design, hydraulics research and testing and 
manufacturing. The massive runners are more than 
five metres in diameter, weighing over 60 tons.
Result
The site crew arrived in October 2011 to begin the 
disassembly of the first unit. The new design has 
higher turbine efficiencies with a maximum power 
more than 35% above the current turbines.

Building on 
success
Review by Jon Stanton 
Finance Director
2011 saw the Group build very successfully on what was the 
record financial performance of 2010 with continued strength 
across our key end markets and another increase in operating 
profit of more than £100m. Our organic growth was 
complemented by strong performances from our 2010 
acquisitions where integration was completed swiftly delivering 
results above expectations. In July, we completed the acquisition 
of Weir International in South Korea and the acquisition of 
Seaboard was completed in December. Due to the completion of 
this deal taking place so near the year end there is no contribution 
from Seaboard included in the results for the year. Since the year 
end, we have re-financed the Seaboard acquisition facilities  
raising US$1 billion in the US private placement market at  
very attractive maturities and coupons.
Order input at £2,467m on a constant currency basis increased 30% on 
2010 and was 24% higher on a like-for-like basis (excluding the impact of 
acquisitions). Original equipment orders were up 36% (32% like-for-like),  
driven by continued expansion of the North American pressure pumping market 
and increasing mining capital expenditure. Aftermarket orders were up 25%  
(17% like-for-like) with increased activity levels across the Group’s main markets 
and market share gains across the Oil & Gas and Minerals product ranges 
and represented 52% (2010: 54%) of total input in 2011. Each of the divisions 
reported year on year order input growth with Oil & Gas delivering the largest 
increase, up 42% on 2010 to £865m (constant currency and like-for-like). 
Minerals order input for 2011 was £1,263m, an increase of 27% on 2010  
(19% like-for-like) with Power & Industrial reporting an 18% increase to £312m 
(1% up excluding the impact of Weir BDK, Weir American Hydro, Weir y ES and 
Weir International). 
Revenue grew by 40% to £2,292m on a constant currency basis, with like-
for-like revenues up 33%. Original equipment represented 48% of revenues 
with aftermarket sales accounting for 52%, a shift towards original equipment 
when compared to last year. The continued strength of our North American 
businesses resulted in our exposure to emerging markets decreasing to 35% 
(2010: 39%) although emerging markets revenues have increased by 25% in 
absolute terms. On a divisional basis, each division translated increased order 
input into increased revenues. Minerals revenues were 33% higher at £1,216m   27
Net finance costs
Net finance costs were £17.1m (2010: 
£15.0m) due to higher average net debt than 
the prior year given the timing of acquisitions 
in 2010. This charge comprises four 
components, the most significant of which  
is the interest cost of £19.4m (2010: £14.9m) 
on the Group’s net borrowings (including 
amounts in relation to derivative financial 
instruments). The balance comprises finance 
income of £4.3m (2010: £1.5m), a £1.3m 
charge (2010: £1.6m) in relation to the 
Group’s defined benefit pension plans and  
an exceptional cost of £0.7m (2010: £nil) 
being the unwinding of the discount on  
the contingent consideration for the Weir 
International acquisition in the second half  
of the year. This last component has been 
disclosed as exceptional due to its nature. 
Net finance costs (excluding retirement  
benefit related amounts and exceptional 
items) were covered 27.3 times by operating 
profit from continuing operations (before 
exceptional items and intangibles 
amortisation) (2010: 23.1 times). 
Profit before tax from continuing operations 
but before exceptional items and intangibles 
amortisation increased by 34% to £396.3m 
(2010: £294.7m). Reported profit before tax 
from continuing operations increased by 42% 
to £391.5m (2010: £276.5m) after intangibles 
amortisation of £23.1m (2010: £18.2m) and 
the exceptional pension past service gain of 
£19.0m (2010: £nil).
The tax charge for the year of £114.2m  
(2010: £82.8m) on profit before tax from 
continuing operations before exceptional  
items and intangibles amortisation of £396.3m 
(2010: £294.7m) represents an underlying 
effective tax rate of 28.8% (2010: 28.1%), 
reflecting a greater proportion of US profits 
which are taxed at a higher rate. The expected 
tax rate of 32.0% (2010: 31.0%) is higher  
than the effective rate due to adjustments  
in respect of prior years, predominantly from 
the release of provisions in relation to tax 
judgements now agreed with the relevant  
tax authority and the availability of indexation 
relief to offset the exceptional gain following 
disposal of the Cathcart, Glasgow property. 
Discontinued operations
The sale of the former Weir Pumps facility  
at Cathcart, Glasgow to Clyde Union was 
completed in December 2011. Net proceeds 
on the sale were £25.0m giving rise to a gain 
on disposal of £19.9m taking account of 
asset carrying value, disposal costs and 
other costs arising from discontinued 
operations. This gain has been recorded  
as an exceptional item in the year.
Earnings per share 
Earnings per share from continuing operations 
before exceptional items and intangibles 
amortisation increased by 33% to 133.6p 
(2010: 100.4p). Reported earnings per share 
including exceptional items, intangibles 
amortisation and discontinued operations 
was 141.5p (2010: 87.9p), reflecting the net 
post-tax charge of £3.1m (2010: £12.8m) for 
exceptional items and intangibles amortisation 
from continuing operations and the 
exceptional net gain on sale of investment 
property within discontinued operations of 
£19.9m (2010: net charge of £13.6m).  
The weighted average number of shares in 
issue increased to 211.2m (2010: 210.6m).
(2010: £911m) with like-for-like revenues 26% up year on year. Oil & Gas revenues increased by 65% to £743m (constant 
currency and like-for-like). Power & Industrial revenues grew from £244m in the prior year to £307m in 2011, an increase 
of 26% (up 1% like-for-like). Together, the acquisitions made in 2010 contributed £171m of revenue against a 2010 
proforma annualised figure of £151m. Revenues from other Group companies increased by 2% to £26m. 
Operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation increased by 33% 
to £412.7m (2010: £309.7m) after a negative currency translation impact of £2.4m, with the strengthening of sterling 
relative to the average US dollar rate in the prior year largely offset by weakness against the Australian dollar. Excluding 
this impact, year on year growth in constant currency was 34%, with the increase in underlying performance being 
driven by growth in upstream oil and gas operations, strong performances across the Minerals portfolio and the impact 
of 2010 acquisitions within Power & Industrial. One-off acquisition related transaction and integration costs and other 
restructuring costs of £16.6m (2010: £11.0m) include £5.1m of costs associated with the acquisition of Seaboard. The 
2010 acquisitions contributed £21.1m to EBITA against a 2010 proforma annualised contribution of £15.5m. The profit 
contribution from other Group companies was £3.0m (2010: £3.5m) while central costs were £14.1m (2010: £12.0m). 
Operating margin (also from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation) decreased from 
18.9% (18.8% on a constant currency basis) to 18.0%, reflecting the impact of the 2010 acquisitions, the shift in revenue mix 
towards original equipment and ancillary products and services and the increase in one-off charges in the period. Excluding 
one-off costs and acquisitions, the operating margin was 19.3% (2010: 19.7%). On a constant currency basis, Minerals 
operating profits increased by 22% to £213.9m (2010: £176.0m) giving a divisional operating margin of 17.6% (2010: 19.3%) 
with the reduction driven by revenue mix and the dilution impact of Linatex margins. Oil & Gas operating profits including joint 
venture interests increased to £183.1m (2010: £113.8m) with an operating margin of 24.7% (2010: 25.2%); excluding the 
impact of acquisitions and one-off costs, the Oil & Gas divisional margin was 26.1% (2010: 25.2%). The operating profit  
from Power & Industrial for 2011 was £26.8m, an increase of £0.8m or 3% on 2010. This represents a margin of 8.7%  
(2010: 10.7% constant currency) and excluding the impact of acquisitions and one-off costs a margin of 10.6% (2010: 11.7%). 
Depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and investment property in the year was £37.7m  
(2010: £34.3m) resulting in operating profits from continuing operations before depreciation and intangibles amortisation 
(“EBITDA”) of £450.4m (2010: £344.0m).
Exceptional items and intangibles amortisation
Total Group operating profit for the year of £408.6m (2010: £291.5m) includes an exceptional credit of £19.0m  
(2010: £nil) and intangibles amortisation of £23.1m (2010: £18.2m). The exceptional credit of £19.0m is a past service 
gain recognised under IAS19 following the decision by the Trustees of the Group’s main staff and executive plans in the 
UK to provide CPI and not RPI-linked benefits to deferred members. This follows the Government’s recent changes in 
legislation to use CPI rather than RPI as the statutory measure by which to increase pensions.  28 The Weir Group PLC
Cash flows
Cash generated by operations before 
working capital movements increased by 
34% to £457.9m (2010: £342.3m). Working 
capital outflows of £155.3m (2010: £67.4m) 
were driven by receivables increases in line 
with revenue growth, the impact on inventory 
of the shift in orders towards longer cycle 
original equipment projects and the impact  
of the 2010 and 2011 acquisitions. Net cash 
generated from operations increased by  
10% from £274.9m to £302.6m representing 
an EBITDA to cash conversion ratio of  
67% (2010: 80%), a direct result of the 
investment in working capital. 
Capital expenditure increased from £50.9m  
in 2010 to £95.4m in 2011 principally in 
support of Minerals and Oil & Gas growth 
plans. The settlement of financing  
derivatives resulted in a net cash outflow of 
£10.9m (2010: £13.4m). Additional pension 
contributions of £6.6m (2010: £9.3m) were 
paid in the period in respect of agreed  
special contributions to the UK schemes. 
Free cash flow from continuing operations 
was £28.9m (2010: £79.9m) and from 
discontinued operations was £24.6m  
(2010: outflow of £18.6m). Outflows in 
respect of acquisitions were £441.4m 
including the payment to settle external  
debt of Seaboard on acquisition giving a year 
end net debt of £673.2m (2010: £283.6m). 
On a reported basis, the ratio of net debt  
to EBITDA was 1.5 times and on a proforma 
basis including the Seaboard and Weir 
International acquisitions from the beginning  
of 2011 was 1.3 times. 
Return on capital employed (“ROCE”)
The Group’s ROCE is 29.2% for 2011,  
an increase of 220 basis points on the  
return of 27.0% in 2010.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend  
of 25.8p per share which, together with the 
interim dividend of 7.2p per share paid on  
4 November 2011, makes the total dividend 
for the year 33.0p, an increase of 22%  
over last year’s total of 27.0p. This results  
in dividend cover (being the ratio of earnings 
per share from continuing operations before 
exceptional items and intangibles amortisation 
to dividend per share) of 4.0 times compared 
to 3.7 times in 2010.
Once approved, the final dividend will be  
payable on 1 June 2012 to ordinary 
shareholders whose names are on the 
Company’s register of members at close  
of business on 4 May 2012.
Acquisitions
The Group made two acquisitions during  
the year. The first of these was of 60% of the 
voting shares of a new Korean company, 
Weir International, into which the HIM Tech 
Co Ltd valves business was transferred.  
The acquisition was structured as an initial 
60% purchase including an earn out with  
the remaining 40% being subject to put and 
call options exercisable between 2014 and 
2019 and based on an EBITDA multiple  
of profits in the two years immediately 
preceding exercise of the option. The cash 
consideration paid was £9.8m and the 
estimated fair value of the contingent 
consideration recognised is £14.0m.  
The second acquisition was of 100% of 
Seaboard Holdings Inc (“Seaboard”) for a 
cash consideration of US$671m (£432.1m),  
which was completed on 14 December 
2011. In addition an amount of £9.1m has  
been recognised in respect of contingent 
consideration. The costs associated with 
these acquisitions totalled £5.6m and this 
has been charged in full to the Income 
Statement in 2011. 
The post acquisition trading by Weir 
International is included in these results 
although there is no contribution from 
Seaboard due to completion of the 
transaction just prior to the end of the year. 
There are clear plans in place to integrate the 
Seaboard business into the Group in 2012. 
Further information on these acquisitions  
can be found in note 13 to the Group  
financial statements.
Together with the acquisition of Novatech in 
February 2012, the proforma revenue and 
EBITA (excluding integration costs) from 
these three recently acquired businesses  
for 2011 is £172m and £43m respectively.
Treasury management
The Group is financed through a combination 
of bank debt, fixed rate private placement 
notes and equity. The capital structure is 
managed centrally with the objectives of 
optimising capital efficiency, diversifying the 
investor base, achieving an orderly maturity 
of funding yet maintaining a good degree of 
financial headroom.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group 
are those relating to liquidity, foreign currency 
and credit risk. The Group’s treasury policies 
and procedures, which are reviewed and 
updated on a regular basis, seek to reduce 
these financial risks. Within this framework, 
the Group uses financial assets and liabilities 
including derivatives to hedge certain foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks.
Funding and liquidity
The Group’s objective is to maintain a 
balance between continuity of funding and 
flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, 
bank loans and long term fixed rate notes.
On 16 February 2012, the Group made a 
further placing of attractively priced long term 
debt with the private placement market in the 
US. Notes to the value of US$1billion have 
been issued with a variety of maturities; 
US$210m of seven year notes, US$590m  
of ten year notes and US$200m of eleven 
year notes. The weighted average coupon  
is 4.16%. These fixed rate notes improve  
the Group’s financial flexibility by diversifying  
our sources of finance and investor base  
and lengthening the maturity profile of 
borrowings, with US$380m of the proceeds 
from the placing being used to repay the 
short-term bridging loan taken out at the  
time of the Seaboard acquisition, fund  
the acquisition of Novatech and repay  
other borrowing facilities.
With regard to the US$800m revolving credit 
facility, £163.0m was drawn down under 
these at the end of the year leaving an 
undrawn amount of £352.8m.
All covenants were met at 30 December 
2011 with significant headroom under each 
financial ratio.
The Group also held net cash balances of 
£108.6m at the end of 2011 (2010: £79.5m) 
representing operating balances held by the 
Group’s subsidiaries. Of this total, £48.5m 
was held in the UK (2010: £5.4m).
The Group has additional committed and 
uncommitted bonding facilities under which 
guarantees are issued in order to support 
commercial activities.
Credit management
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable 
to its trade receivables with risk spread over 
a large number of countries and customers. 
There is no significant concentration of  
credit risk. Credit worthiness checks are 
undertaken before entering into contracts 
with new customers and credit limits are set 
as appropriate. We will also use trade finance 
instruments such as letters of credit and 
insurance to mitigate any identified risk.  
The Group’s exposure to the credit risk  
of financial institutions is limited by the 
adherence to counterparty limits and by  
only trading with counterparties that have  
a strong credit standing based on ratings 
provided by the major agencies.
Financial review
(continued)
Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Directors report  29
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s debt is denominated in a 
combination of fixed and variable rates  
of interest. It is our policy to maintain a 
proportion of debt at fixed rates of interest 
subject to the future outlook for the level of 
interest rates. As at the end of 2011, the 
proportion of the Group’s gross debt at fixed 
rates was 20% compared to 44% as at 31 
December 2010, due to the initial funding of 
the Seaboard acquisition via floating rate 
bank borrowings. Following the issuance of 
US$1billion fixed rate notes on 16 February 
2012, the proportion of the Group’s debt at 
fixed rates has increased post year end.
Foreign exchange
The Group is exposed to movements in 
exchange rates for transactions undertaken 
in non-functional currencies of the operating 
companies concerned and the translation  
of foreign currency denominated net assets 
and profit and loss items. 
All material transactional currency exposures 
are hedged, usually by means of forward 
contracts thereby ensuring certainty over 
revenue and costs. Subject to local exchange 
controls, foreign exchange transactions are 
executed by the central treasury function.  
No speculative transactions are undertaken. 
Although hedging is carried out for all 
material economic exposures, only two 
subsidiaries apply cash flow hedge 
accounting under IAS39.
The Group manages a proportion of the 
potential currency translation exposures  
from US dollar denominated net investments 
through a combination of US dollar borrowing, 
forward foreign currency contracts and cross 
currency swaps. The strengthening of sterling 
relative to the US dollar offset by its weakening 
against the Australian dollar resulted in a net 
loss on translation of net assets of £20.3m, 
including the effect of the balance sheet 
hedging programme. The fair value of 
derivatives designated as net investment 
hedges at 30 December 2011 was a liability  
of £27.6m (2010: £38.8m) reflecting primarily 
the part settlement of floating rate cross 
currency swaps during the year.
The Group does not hedge foreign currency 
translation exposures related to profit and 
loss items.
Further information on financial risk 
management objectives and policies  
can be found in note 30 to the Group 
financial statements.
Retirement benefits
The Group has five defined benefit pension 
plans, the largest of these being the two  
UK plans.
The Group has continued to pro-actively 
manage its exposure to its pension plans. 
However, reflecting a reduction in the 
discount rate, partially offset by a reduction  
in inflation assumptions, the net deficit for the 
Group’s retirement benefit obligations at the 
end of the year was £84.7m (2010: £65.0m).
Net assets
Net assets at the end of 2011 were 
£1,118.1m, an increase of £196.4m on  
the 2010 level of £921.7m. This increase is 
driven by the total net comprehensive income 
for the year of £243.2m less dividends paid 
of £59.5m.
Litigation
The Company and certain subsidiaries are, 
from time to time, parties to legal proceedings 
and claims which arise in the normal course 
of business.
There are 585 asbestos related claims in the 
US (2010: 411) outstanding against Group 
companies. There are 24 such claims in  
the UK (2010: 22). All actions are  
robustly defended. 
There has been little progress on the claim 
against the Company relating to a civil action 
for damages arising from the UN Oil for Food 
programme which has been raised in the US. 
Weir is one of around 100 companies 
targeted in this claim and we are defending 
the action vigorously.
To the extent not already provided for, the 
Directors do not anticipate that the outcome 
of these proceedings and claims, either  
individually or in aggregate, will have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial position.
Critical accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS and the material 
accounting policies are set out on pages  
77 to 83 of this report. There have been no 
significant changes to the accounting policies 
adopted in 2010.
In the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies, management has 
applied certain judgements, assumptions and 
estimates. These estimates and assumptions 
are based on historical experience, 
information available at the time and other 
factors considered relevant. Those with the 
most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements are set 
out below. Further judgements, assumptions 
and estimates are set out in the accounts.
Intangible assets
On the acquisition of a business it is 
necessary to attribute fair values to any 
intangible assets acquired, provided they 
meet the recognition criteria. The fair values 
of these intangible assets are dependent on 
estimates of attributable future revenues, 
margins and cash flows, as well as 
appropriate discount rates. In addition,  
the allocation of useful lives to acquired 
intangible assets requires the application  
of judgement based on available information 
and management expectations at the time  
of recognition.
Impairment
IFRS requires companies to carry out 
impairment testing on any assets that show 
indications of impairment as well as annually 
for goodwill and other intangible assets  
with indefinite lives and so not subject to 
amortisation. This testing includes exercising 
management judgement about future cash 
flows and other events which are, by their 
nature, uncertain.
Retirement benefits
The assumptions underlying the valuation  
of retirement benefits assets and liabilities  
are important and based on actuarial advice. 
Changes in these assumptions could have  
a material impact on the measurement of  
the Group’s retirement benefit obligations.
Taxation
Uncertainties exist with respect to the 
interpretation of complex tax regulations  
and the amount and timing of future taxable 
income. Given the wide range of international 
business relationships and the long term 
nature and complexity of existing contractual 
arrangements, differences arising between 
the actual results and the assumptions made 
or future changes to such assumptions could 
result in future adjustments to tax income 
and expense already recorded. Provisions are 
established based on reasonable estimates 
for possible consequences of audits by the 
tax authorities of the respective countries in 
which the Group operates. Management 
judgement is used to determine the amount 
of such provisions taking into account that 
differences of interpretation may arise on a 
wide variety of issues depending on the 
conditions prevailing in the respective  
Group company’s domicile.

Managing risk The Weir Way 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
The Weir Group is committed to identifying and managing the full spectrum of risks faced across its 
global operations, many of which have the potential to adversely impact its operational, financial and 
reputational performance. 
To support this approach, the Group operates a rigorous and transparent risk management framework 
which promotes the use of quality risk information in the development of strategy and decision-making. 
The risk and control framework is described in detail in the Corporate Governance report. 
The Group has identified the following principal risks which could have a material impact on the business. 
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Environmental, health & safety
Our principal environmental, health and safety 
(EHS) risks relate to the potential for a serious 
environmental incident, serious injury and fatal 
accidents in the workplace and regulatory action 
for non-compliance with statutory requirements. 
Failure to manage these risks could result in 
a serious deterioration of the Group’s safety 
performance or an environmental regulatory 
breach which could lead to: 
•  fines and penalties; 
•  loss of key customers; 
•  exclusion from market sectors deemed 
important for future growth; and 
•  damage to reputation.
The Group is committed to a zero  
accident workplace and the highest 
environmental standards. 
During 2011, Weir has established the EHS 
excellence committee to drive improvement in 
the environmental, health and safety agenda. 
A programme of external audits of EHS 
performance has begun from which global 
standards will be developed and improvement 
plans created and implemented. In addition, 
initiatives to address the most common 
accident types have been developed and the 
implementation in 2012 of a Weir behavioural 
safety system will further reduce the risk  
of incidents. 
Technology & innovation 
The Group’s growth and success depends not 
only on its ability to innovate and ensure the 
continuous improvement of its existing product 
portfolio, but also its ability to develop and 
produce new and enhanced products in a  
cost effective and timely manner to meet 
customer demands.
Failure of the Group to drive innovation 
and continue to ensure the development of 
attractive, sustainable products and solutions 
has the potential to give rise to customer 
dissatisfaction, loss of market share and/or 
competitors developing superior Weir  
product substitutes. 
To remain competitive, the Group  
invests continuously in its research  
and development, manufacturing,  
marketing, customer service support  
and distribution networks. 
During 2011, the Group established the 
Weir Advanced Research Centre (WARC) in 
conjunction with the University of Strathclyde, 
tasked with supporting new product 
innovation and delivering enhancements  
to the Group’s existing product range.
The Group maintains the highest 
manufacturing and quality standards which 
include regular dialogue with customers to 
ensure that their requirements are met through 
the Group’s key account management 
process. It also takes appropriate action to 
ensure that its cost base remains competitive 
and margins are protected through its global 
procurement activities.   33
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Compliance & corruption 
As the business grows in size and geographical 
scope, the potential for fraudulent and 
dishonest activity by our suppliers, customers 
and employees increases. 
Potential impacts include fines, penalties, 
regulatory scrutiny, reputational damage  
and imprisonment. 
The Group has a central legal and compliance 
function which assists and monitors all Group 
businesses. The recent appointments  
of in-house counsel has strengthened  
internal resource in the Americas  
and Asia-Pacific. 
The Group’s internal audit activities have  
been expanded to incorporate regular  
review of the anti-bribery and corruption 
assurance framework.
In addition, the Group’s Code of Conduct 
provides a clear framework within which all 
employees have to operate to maintain the 
Group’s high standards of doing business. 
In 2011, online training modules on the 
Code were completed by staff, with a self-
certification process ensuring compliance. 
Face to face presentations on the Code and 
UK Bribery Act were also carried out across 
the business.
Acquisitions 
The continued pursuit of our growth plans 
through a blend of organic growth initiatives  
and acquisitions brings with it a degree of 
risk, the most significant being that a poorly 
executed acquisition fails to deliver the 
anticipated benefits. 
While the Group identifies expected synergies, 
cost savings and growth opportunities prior 
to completing any acquisitions, these benefits 
may not always be achieved or be achieved 
within the anticipated timescales. Furthermore, 
the Group could find itself liable for past acts or 
omissions of the acquired business without any 
adequate right of redress. 
The Group operates a strategic planning 
process to review its corporate strategy with 
market and competitive position assessments 
driving the acquisition agenda. In addition,  
the Group implements a rigorous due diligence 
process and ensures clear financial targets are 
in place. The Group implements an internal 
100 day plan to ensure that the integration 
process is actioned with the minimum  
of disruption. 
Key suppliers & delivery 
The Group’s ability to meet customer delivery 
schedules is dependent on a number of factors 
including sufficient manufacturing capacity, 
access to raw materials, inventory control, 
sufficient trained and equipped employees, 
engineering expertise and the appropriate 
planning and scheduling of the manufacturing 
process. Many of the contracts it enters into 
require long lead times and therefore contain 
clauses in relation to on-time delivery.
In addition, the Group is dependent on the 
continued availability and effective management 
of subcontractors and other service providers.
Failure to deliver in accordance with customer 
expectation could subject the Group to  
financial penalties, damage customer 
relationships and, as a result, impact  
on the Group’s financial performance.
In addition, failure of a supplier or availability  
of scarce raw materials could result in the  
Group incurring additional costs in sourcing  
an alternative.
Manufacturing scheduling and planning 
is subject to stringent internal assurance 
processes to optimise each business unit’s 
order book. The effect of this is to maximise 
capacity and minimise reworking costs and 
delays in delivery times. This is complemented 
by the use of the Group’s Manufacturing 
Resource Planning systems, together with  
the slotting and scheduling achieved through 
the Weir Production System. 
The Group seeks to develop long-term 
relationships with its subcontractors and the 
Group’s procurement function is responsible 
for establishing robust supplier relationships. 
In addition, the procurement function  
conducts a regular review of strategically 
important suppliers. 34 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Directors report
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Global & economic conditions
The Group is exposed to global growth trends 
and continued weakness in the global economy 
and banking sectors may trigger a subsequent 
downturn in customer demand. 
Failure to successfully anticipate any future 
market downturns and not execute our 
developed mitigation strategies effectively  
could adversely affect Group revenues, 
profitability and cash flows.
As part of our strategic planning process the 
Group utilises extensive market intelligence 
to closely monitor the stability of and 
opportunities within all our markets.  
The Group continues to maintain proactive 
downturn plans with identified trigger points, 
enabling a quick response to deteriorating 
market conditions. 
Commodity prices
The Group is exposed to volatility in  
commodity prices.
An inability to respond to input price volatility 
could have a potential impact on the Group’s 
operating results, revenue and cash flows. 
The Group closely monitors commodity  
inputs and adapts a range of mechanisms 
to protect margins including back to back 
contractual terms, indexation agreements  
with customers and hedging of certain 
commodity input prices. 
Dependency risk
The Group generates a material proportion of 
its profits from Weir SPM, its Texas based well 
service pump business. Market, operational 
and technological developments may adversely 
affect the position of Weir SPM.
Its high proportional contribution to the Group 
and changes to the demand for hydraulic 
fracturing equipment in its end markets could 
have a significant impact on the Group’s profits 
and free cashflow. 
The Group closely monitors the leading 
indicators impacting Weir SPM’s end  
markets and, together with Weir SPM’s flexible 
business model and continued investment in 
new product offerings, will ensure that Weir 
SPM can react to changes in demand. Over 
time organic and acquisitive growth of other 
operations in the Group is expected to dilute 
the dependency on Weir SPM.
Employees
The future success of the Group depends on 
the skills and efforts of its employees across all 
of its businesses and the ability to retain and 
develop these individuals. 
In addition, the success of Group acquisitions 
will depend on the ability to retain management 
personnel of acquired companies.
If it is unable to attract and retain excellent 
talent, the Group may not be able to effectively 
implement its business strategies.
The Group constantly reviews its remuneration 
packages to ensure they remain competitive 
and has also established in 2011 a 
management and leadership development 
framework to ensure present and  
future capability and facilitate effective 
succession planning.
The Group’s employee development 
programmes are explained in more detail  
on pages 60 to 62.
Managing risk The Weir Way 
Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)  35
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION
Legal
Manufacturing companies are, from time to 
time, exposed to personal injury claims and 
class actions or other litigation resulting from 
injuries sustained at work, including asbestosis 
or other health problems associated from 
working in industries that used asbestos  
in the 20th century.
The Group has insurance cover for certain 
claims but not for all potential claims. The 
number and size of the claims is dependent 
on the number of third parties that are still in 
existence and can be included in such actions. 
Both of these can change over time and as a 
result the Group’s exposure could increase.
The Group has internal policies and 
procedures for monitoring these risks, 
managing and mitigating against these 
liabilities and to ensure that there is regular 
reporting to the Board on any changes  
or developments. 
Low-cost competition 
Increasing competitive threat from low-cost 
markets which are using total “cost innovation” 
in product design, supply chain and low labour 
costs to gain a competitive advantage. 
Failure to build on our emerging market 
presence and realise growth through the  
delivery of innovative and creative product 
solutions may result in our existing customer 
base switching to low-cost suppliers,  
leading to a reduction in market share. 
The Group has an established and growing 
global footprint to ensure proximity to 
customers and consistent quality of service 
coupled with continued product innovation 
to provide technological differentiation and 
barriers to entry. 
The Group continues to drive operational 
excellence across all plants with a 
continued focus on the key areas of lean, 
on time delivery, global sourcing and other 
procurement and supply chain initiatives  
and the Weir Production System, all of 
which contribute to the delivery of enhanced 
operational efficiencies.  36 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Directors report
Corporate governance 
report
Introduction
The Board is committed to the principles of good governance 
and good corporate governance is an integral part of the Board’s 
stewardship obligations. The Group constantly aims for best 
practice in all matters and, by doing so, promotes the success  
of the business to the benefit of the shareholders. 
The Board’s review of its effectiveness, conducted during the 
period, considered its composition and skills and concluded 
that it has the right experience to address and respond to the 
challenges it faces.
Corporate governance code
The UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 (the “Code”)  
took effect from 29 June 2010, replacing the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance 2008 as the standard of good 
governance practice in the UK. The Financial Services Authority 
requires listed companies to disclose whether they have complied 
with the provisions of the Code throughout the financial year.  
The Board considers that the Company complied with the  
Code for the whole of the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011. 
In respect of Code provision B.7.1 the Board decided in early 
2011 to adopt this provision and therefore all executive and  
non-executive directors retired and offered themselves for 
re-election commencing from the 2011 annual general meeting. 
This section of the Annual Report along with the Remuneration 
report on pages 44 to 53 provide details of how the Company 
has applied the main principles of the Code during the 52 weeks 
ended 30 December 2011. Further information on the Code is 
publicly available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
www.frc.org.uk. 
The Board of directors
The Board has a schedule of matters reserved to it for its 
decision. This schedule is reviewed regularly and includes 
approval of:
• Environmental, health and safety and sustainability policies.
•  Annual and half-year financial results, interim management 
statements and trading updates.
• Dividend policy.
• Board appointments.
• Group strategy and the annual operating budget.
• Group corporate governance policy.
• Changes to the Group’s management and control structure.
• Major capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals.
• Treasury policies.
• Risk management strategy and the system of internal control.
Board meetings
In the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011, the Board met eight 
times, with one meeting in Santiago, which combined visits to the 
Weir Minerals sites in Chile and Brasil, one meeting at the Group 
conference in Perthshire, one held in London and the remainder 
held at the Company’s head office in Glasgow. There is regular 
contact outside formal meetings between the chairman, chief 
executive and the other directors. 
The following table identifies the attendance record of individual 
directors at the eight board meetings held during 2011.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Changes to the Board
Details of the current directors of the Company are set out on 
pages 30 to 31. Melanie Gee joined the Board on 4 May 2011 
and Alan Ferguson on 13 December 2011. 
Re-election of directors
In accordance with the Code, all directors submit themselves 
for annual re-election by shareholders. Each new director 
may be appointed by the Board, but is subject to election by 
shareholders at the first opportunity after their appointment.
Any non-executive director who has served on the Board for 
more than six years is subject to a particularly rigorous review.

Board information and development
On joining the Board, directors are provided with documentation 
on the Group and its activities. New directors are provided with 
an appropriate induction programme and, where appropriate, 
site visits are arranged to major business units. Ongoing training 
is provided as necessary.
All directors are provided with updates on corporate governance 
developments, legislative and regulatory changes and relevant 
industry and technical information.
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with the appropriate 
information to enable it to discharge its duties and any further 
back-up papers and information are readily available to all 
directors on request to the company secretary. The chairman 
ensures that non-executive directors are properly briefed on  
any issues arising at board meetings and non-executive  
directors have access to the chairman at any time.
Review of board effectiveness
Our 2011 review of board effectiveness was led by an 
independent third party who undertook interviews with the 
chairman, each of the directors and the external auditors,  
in addition, an assessment of the chairman’s performance was 
carried out by the senior independent director. Feedback was 
sought on the operation of the principal board committees  
and on the contributions of individual directors. 
The review considered the effectiveness of leadership, 
governance arrangements and management practices  
in a number of areas including:
•  Board constitution including the mix of skills, knowledge  
and experience.
•  Relationships between the Board, committees and  
executive directors.
•  Responsibilities, delegated authorities and reporting lines.
•  Succession planning, induction and training.
•  Communication with shareholders.
The review concluded that there was an effective Board led by  
a strong chairman. A number of detailed recommendations will 
be followed up by the chairman.
Board balance and independence
As at 30 December 2011, the Board comprises the chairman, 
chief executive, finance director, legal and commercial director 
and seven non-executive directors. Michael Dearden is the 
senior independent director. Lord Robertson will replace Michael 
Dearden as senior independent director following his retirement 
from the board after the annual general meeting in 2012.
There is an agreed procedure for directors to take independent 
professional advice, where appropriate, on any matter at the 
Company’s expense. The company secretary is responsible for 
ensuring that board procedures are followed and all directors 
have direct access to the advice and services of the company 
secretary. The company secretary is also responsible for 
facilitating the induction and professional development of  
the board members and information flows within the Board,  
its committees and between the non-executive directors  
and senior management. 
All directors bring their own independent judgement to major 
matters affecting the Group. Each of the non-executive directors 
is considered by the Company to be independent. 
None of the non-executive directors has any material business 
or other relationship with the Company or its management. 
Each member of the Board has considerable experience at a 
senior level in other companies, which allows for well informed 
and broad based debate. The board structure ensures that no 
individual or group dominates the decision-making process. 
There is a division of responsibilities between the chairman,  
who is responsible for leading and running the Board and related 
matters, and the chief executive, who has executive responsibility 
for running the Group’s business and developing the appropriate 
organisational structure for a global organisation. The chief 
executive chairs the Group Executive Committee. 
The executive directors have contracts of service with one 
year’s notice, whilst non-executive directors appointments can 
be terminated at any time with six months notice. The letters of 
appointment of the chairman and the non-executive directors, 
which are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office, set out the required commitment to the Company.  
Details of the directors service contracts, remuneration and 
interests in share awards are set out in the Remuneration report 
on pages 44 to 53.  38 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Directors report
Directors conflicts of interests
Each director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006  
(the “2006 Act”) to avoid a situation where he has, or can have, 
a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, 
with the Company’s interests. The Company has adopted a 
formal procedure for the disclosure, review, authorisation and 
management of directors conflicts of interest and potential 
conflicts of interest in accordance with these provisions. The 
procedure requires directors formally to notify the Board, via the 
company secretary, as soon as they become aware of any actual 
or potential conflict of interest with their duties to the Company 
or of any material change in existing or potential conflicts that 
may have been authorised by the Board. The Board continues 
to monitor and review potential conflicts of interest on a regular 
basis. A register is maintained of all such disclosures and the 
terms of any such authorisation.
Directors indemnities
The Company has granted indemnities to each of its directors 
in respect of all losses arising out of or in connection with the 
execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities as directors 
to the extent permitted by the 2006 Act and the Company’s 
articles of association. In addition, directors and officers of 
the Company and its subsidiaries and trustees of its pension 
schemes are covered by directors & officers liability insurance. 
Shareholders
The Company is committed to a process of continual dialogue 
with its shareholders. This dialogue is taken forward by the 
Group’s investor relations programme and includes regular 
update meetings and presentations with major shareholders and 
industry analysts. Feedback from these presentations, which is 
reported to the Board, gives investors an opportunity to comment 
on the quality of the communications they receive in their contact 
with the chief executive and finance director. Attendees at 
the results presentations include the chairman, the executive 
directors, the senior independent director and a number of 
the non-executive directors. The Company also encourages 
communication with private shareholders throughout the year 
and welcomes their participation at shareholder meetings. In 
addition to the chairman’s statement at the annual general 
meeting, a trading update to shareholders is given and details 
of the Company’s trading activities are on display. The directors 
attend the annual general meeting and the chairmen of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees are available to 
answer questions. The date of the key publications in 2012  
can be found on the Company’s website. 
Notice of the annual general meeting is sent to shareholders 
at least 20 working days before the meeting. The Company 
conducts the vote at the annual general meeting by electronic 
poll and the result of the votes (including proxies) is published 
on the Company’s website after the annual general meeting. 
Electronic proxy voting, details of which are included in the 
notice of the 2012 annual general meeting, is available. Voting 
participation at the annual general meetings in 2009, 2010 and 
2011 was 64%, 63% and 67% respectively.
Communications
The Board considers that the annual report and financial 
statements and interim statements present a balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s performance and 
prospects. The Group frequently publicises other business 
developments through the specialised trade press and its  
own internal bulletins, which have wide circulation, and through 
the news section on both the divisional and Company websites. 
During 2011, the Group produced a corporate brochure  
which is available on the Group website at www.weir.co.uk.  
The website also provides additional company information, is 
regularly updated and includes the presentations to shareholders 
given at the announcements of the full year and interim results. 
The website also contains an online version of the notice of 
the annual general meeting, the annual report and financial 
statements and the interim report.
Board committees
Where appropriate, matters are delegated to board committees, 
all of which have written terms of reference which are available 
on the Company’s website. The company secretary acts as 
secretary to all these committees.

Nomination Committee
The members of the Committee during 2011 were Lord 
Smith (chairman), Keith Cochrane, Michael Dearden and Lord 
Robertson. Alan Mitchelson acts as secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee meets at least twice a year and at other times 
when necessary and in 2011 met four times. The following table 
identifies the attendance record of individual directors at the 
Committee meetings held during 2011. 
The Committee uses external search consultants to assist it in  
its work.
The Committee primarily monitors the composition and balance 
of the Board and its committees and identifies and recommends 
to the Board the appointment of new directors. During the year, 
following discussion of the recommendations of the Lord Davies 
report on boardroom diversity, the Committee determined not 
to set a specific female Board member quota. All appointments 
to the Board will continue to be based on the diversity of 
contribution, experience and required skills, irrespective  
of gender.
The Committee’s terms of reference establish a framework 
through which it can operate to ensure the selection process 
of Board candidates is conducted in a formal, disciplined and 
objective manner. When considering candidates, the Committee 
evaluates the balance in skills, knowledge and experience of the 
Board and prepares a description of the role and capabilities 
required for the particular appointment. The Committee also 
reviews the succession planning and leadership needs of the 
organisation and ensures that, on appointment, all directors 
receive a formal contract or letter of appointment as appropriate. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website. 
Audit Committee
The chairman of the Committee is Stephen King. During 2011,

to the Committee on 13 December 2011. The secretary to the 
Committee is Alan Mitchelson. In addition, the chairman, chief 
executive, finance director, head of internal audit and external

external auditors also have access to the chairman of the 
Committee outside formal Committee meetings. 
The Board is satisfied that Stephen King has recent and relevant 
financial experience. As previously announced, Alan Ferguson 
will take over from Stephen King as chairman of the Committee. 
The Board is satisfied that Alan Ferguson has recent and relevant 
financial experience. 
The Committee has the ability to call on Group employees to 
assist in its work and also has access to independent advice. 
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for 
overseeing the financial reporting and internal risk management 
control functions and for making recommendations to the Board 
in relation to the appointment of the Group’s external auditors.
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website.
The Committee is charged with responsibility to the Board  
for satisfying itself, on behalf of the Board as a whole, that  
the financial affairs of the Group are conducted with openness, 
integrity and accountability and in accordance with such existing 
statutory and regulatory provisions and codes as are applicable

The Committee also reviews the guidance issued by bodies 
such as the Financial Reporting Council into the work of audit 
committees and incorporates any recommendations into its 
working practices.
There were four meetings in 2011, in January, March, July  
and September. The following table identifies the attendance 
record of individual directors at the Committee meetings held 
during 2011.
The Committee maintains a formal calendar of items for 
consideration at its meetings and within the annual audit cycle to 
ensure that its work is in line with the requirements of the Code. 
During the March meeting, the Committee undertook a full review 
of the audit with the Group’s auditors. 
In the course of 2011, the Committee discussed the following 
matters: 
•  The annual report and financial statements, the half year report 
and interim management statements, any significant audit 
issues, accounting policies and financial reporting issues and 
judgements identified by the finance director and the auditors. 
•  The annual report disclosures relevant to the Committee, 
including the going concern statement and the reports on  
risk management and internal control.
•  The internal audit scope and approach for 2011.
•  The Group accounting policies.
•  The findings of internal audit reviews.
•  The Group’s risk process and the results of the  
compliance scorecard. 
• The fees for Ernst & Young LLP for 2011. 
• The anti-bribery and corruption assurance framework.
•  The audit strategy for year end 2011 audit.
•  The fraud and error guidelines contained in ISA240.
During 2011, the Committee conducted an in depth review of 
the performance of the external auditors with a scope that went 
beyond the regular effectiveness review. The review considered, 
inter alia, the team, the scope of the audit and overall value for 
money provided. The review identified improvement areas which 
have been addressed by the external auditors and accordingly 
it was not considered necessary to conduct a broader tender 
process. In accordance with applicable ethical and professional 
standards the external auditors are required to periodically 
rotate partners at a Group, divisional or country level in order 
to maintain their independence and objectivity with the lead 
partner required to rotate every five years. Such changes are 
carefully planned to ensure the Company benefits from continuity 
of staffing without incurring undue risk or inefficiency. The 
Annual Report 2011 is the final signing year for the incumbent 
lead partner and during the year the Committee has reviewed 
the process to select the new lead partner culminating in the 
approval of the appointment for the next five years from 2012. 
Having carried out the review described above and having 
satisfied itself that the external auditors remain independent 
and effective, the Committee recommended to the Board that 
Ernst & Young LLP be re-appointed as the Company’s external 
auditor for 2012. There are no contractual obligations restricting 
the Group’s choice of external auditors and the Committee also 
keeps under review the value for money of the audit. 
Non-audit fee work conducted by Ernst & Young LLP over the 
past year for assurance services amounted to 14% of the total 
fees including audit fees. The Committee considers that the 
level and nature of non-audit work does not compromise the 
independence of the external auditors. 
The minutes of each meeting are circulated to the Board.  
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website.
The Committee maintains a policy on the appointment and role 
of the auditors. This includes guidelines on their appointment 
which is subject to regular review and on their ongoing work 
to ensure that the independence of the Group’s auditors is not 
threatened, particularly by the provision of non-audit services. 
Prior approval of the Committee is required where the expected 
cost of non-audit services provided by the appointed external 
auditors is in excess of £75,000. 
The day-to-day implementation of the Committee’s policies  
is delegated to the finance director who in turn monitors each  
of the Group’s subsidiaries to ensure that all engagements  
fall within the Committee’s guidelines. Fees payable to  
Ernst & Young LLP in respect of audit and assurance services  
of £1.8m (2010: £1.6m) in respect of 2011 were approved by  
the Committee.

Code of Conduct
The Weir Code of Conduct was launched on the Group’s global  
Intranet and the company’s website at the end of December 
2010. The Code of Conduct sets out the Group’s commitment 
to doing business at all times in an ethical and transparent 
manner and explains in practical terms the behaviours and  
values expected from all Group employees and how they  
can raise concerns or ask questions. 
The Code of Conduct is supported by:
•  A hotline which is available to all employees to report any 
concerns or apparent breaches of the Code of Conduct.  
This is a confidential service run by an independent provider.
•  Online training modules provide an introduction to the Code 
of Conduct and practical scenarios that may be faced by 
employees in their day to day work. 
•  A training module on anti-bribery and corruption which is 
mandatory for employees in high risk territories.
•  Further training in the form of local ‘Town Hall’ meetings for 
individual business units. 
The Board and Group Executive Committee regularly review 
performance against the Code of Conduct. More information  
can be found in the Sustainability report on pages 67 to 68. 
Internal control 
In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance on internal control,  
the Board ensures that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced  
by Group companies. This process has been in place throughout 
2011 and up until the date of this report, applying to all Group 
companies but not the Group’s joint ventures. The directors have 
overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board delegates to 
executive management the responsibility for designing, operating 
and monitoring both the system and the maintenance of effective 
internal control in each of the businesses which comprise the 
Group. In addition, each operating company is responsible for 
the operation of key internal controls and to formally assess the 
effectiveness of the internal control environment through the 
submission, twice yearly, of the Group compliance scorecard. 
An internal audit function is in place to review and challenge the 
effectiveness of key internal controls and to suggest relevant 
actions to address potential weaknesses. The internal audit 
review programme is based on a risk based approach that helps 
to prioritise resource upon the areas of perceived greatest risk to 
the Group. This process is supplemented by a number of peer 
reviews that seek to further monitor and evaluate the process  
of internal control and share best practice around the Group. 
Internal audit and peer review reports are reviewed by the Audit 
Committee which considers and determines relevant action in 
respect of any control issues raised. 
To support this approach the Group operates a rigorous and 
transparent risk management framework which promotes the 
use of quality risk information in the development of strategy  
and decision making. 
The Weir Group risk management framework provides guidance 
and focus across the organisation and facilitates the embedding 
of risk management practices and culture. The company 
managing directors are responsible for the day-to-day control  
of risk management within their individual companies. The Group 
divisional managing directors are ultimately responsible for risk 
management throughout their divisions and ensuring that they 
comply with the Group’s corporate risk appetite. The Group’s 
risk and control manager is responsible for the co-ordination for 
all risk activities within the Group. Each division will assist the  
risk and control manager in the flow of risk information and the 
active monitoring of the risk management process within their 
area of responsibility.
In the first instance, each Group operating company and 
business identifies all key risks that might reduce the ability 
of that operating company to achieve its business objectives. 
As part of this process, the operating companies prepare a 
report identifying the relative probability and severity of the risks 
identified, the process for managing and mitigating these risks 
and the means by which management might be assured that the 
processes are effective. This risk assessment process and the 
accompanying action plans are identified on a risk dashboard 
for their respective business. These are reported through the 
divisions to the Group Executive Committee on a monthly basis. 
Finally, a Group-wide risk dashboard is prepared, which identifies 
the key divisional and Group risks. The Group risk dashboard is 
considered and adopted by the Board which is responsible for 
the risk management strategy. 
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The principal risks and uncertainties identified by the Group 
risk dashboard and how they are managed or mitigated are 
summarised on pages 32 to 35.
The Board has monitored the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control during the financial year. This is refined 
as necessary to meet changes in the Group’s business and 
associated risks. 
Regular performance reports are provided to the executive 
directors, the Audit Committee and the Board, as appropriate. 
Where weaknesses are identified, plans and timetables for 
addressing them are also reported.
Corporate governance
report (continued)  43
In addition to the Group risk and control framework, other 
procedures which are fundamental to the Group’s system of 
internal control are as follows:
•  A clearly defined organisational structure within which individual 
responsibilities are identified and monitored.
•  A Group compliance scorecard which records compliance  
with policies and procedures.
•  Policies and procedures manuals which are in place and 
communicated to all Group operating companies through the 
Global Intranet. The managing directors are responsible for 
ensuring that each company observes and implements these 
policies and procedures, which are continuously reviewed  
and updated.
•  A comprehensive annual planning and financial reporting 
system incorporating consolidated management accounts, 
which compares results with forecast and the previous year 
on a monthly and cumulative basis. Management information 
systems provide directors with relevant and timely reports that 
identify significant variations from approved forecasts, and 
revised forecasts for the financial year are produced four  
times a year.
The Group’s internal control procedures described in this section 
have not been extended to cover its interests in joint ventures. 
The Group has board representation on each of its joint venture 
companies where separate systems of internal control have  
been adopted.
Directors statement of responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors 
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union and the Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are  
required to:
•  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently.
•  Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent.
•  State that the Group financial statements have complied with 
IFRS as adopted by the European Union, subject to  
any material departures being disclosed and explained. 
•  State for the Company financial statements whether the 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures being disclosed  
and explained.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
Each of the directors, as at the date of this report, confirms to 
the best of his knowledge that:
•  The financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group.
•  The directors report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the Group financial statements comply with the 2006 Act 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. In forming this view, 
the directors have reviewed the Group’s budgets, plans and 
cash flow forecasts, including market downturn sensitivities. 
In addition, the directors have considered the potential impact 
of credit risk and liquidity risk detailed in note 30 to the Group 
financial statements on pages 113 to 121. Each of these items 
has been considered in relation to the Group’s banking facilities 
described on page 101. 
Audit and auditors
So far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (as defined by section 481 of the 2006 Act) of which 
the Company’s auditors are unaware. 
Each of the directors has taken all of the steps that he ought to 
have taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors 
are aware of that information.

Remuneration 
report
Introduction
In 2011, the Group performed successfully in uncertain macro-
economic conditions. The Group delivered record financial 
results and continued to demonstrate significant year on year 
growth in revenue and profits. The Group’s full results are 
discussed in more detail in the Directors report.
Our successful performance, effective delivery of the Group’s 
strategy and strong business model have been reflected in a 
rising share price and ranking in the FTSE 100. As we continue 
to pursue further growth through organic initiatives and value 
enhancing acquisitions, the Remuneration Committee is 
committed to ensuring that the remuneration structures in  
place remain appropriate to drive our business needs.
During 2011, as a Committee we have reviewed the 
remuneration arrangements for the executive directors and 
senior managers against the established remuneration policy. 
The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration structure 
remains appropriate and that the incentive arrangements  
are aligned to business strategy.
The Committee has adjusted the chief executive’s and finance 
director’s base salaries for 2012 observing the commitment 
made to shareholders in 2010. Full details of the proposed salary 
increases are provided in this Remuneration report. In addition  
a clawback provision has been introduced under the bonus  
in order to ensure alignment with prevailing market practice.  
All other components of the executive directors remuneration 
packages remain unchanged. 
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
During 2011, the Committee was chaired by Michael Dearden. 
The other members were Lord Robertson, John Mogford until 
his retirement from the Committee on 29 July 2011, and Richard 
Menell, who was appointed a member of the Committee on 29 
July 2011. Melanie Gee will become a member of the Committee 
and Committee chairman following the annual general meeting. 
All members of the Committee are considered independent  
non-executive directors. The secretary to the Committee is  
Alan Mitchelson.
No individual plays a part in the determination of their  
own remuneration.
The Committee is responsible for formulating and implementing 
policy on remuneration for executive directors and senior 
management. The Committee also has regard to pay and 
conditions amongst the wider employee population.
The Committee’s terms of reference can be found on the 
Company’s website.
Hewitt New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Corporation) 
(“HNBS”), having been appointed by the Committee in 2003, 
provided independent external advice to the Committee until 
September 2011. HNBS provided no other services to the Group. 
The Committee undertook a selection process to appoint new 
advisors during 2011 and appointed PwC as its independent 
external advisors with effect from December 2011. PwC provides 
additional services to the Group including advice on the Group’s 
pension plans, taxation and valuation of long term incentive 
arrangements. In 2011, PwC also provided internal audit 
services, due diligence in relation to acquisitions and advice  
in relation to the Group’s carbon emissions.
Remuneration strategy and policy for executive directors
The Committee ensures that effective remuneration 
arrangements are in place that drive appropriate behaviours 
and create alignment with the Group’s strategy and business 
objectives. The Committee has adopted the following 
policy which forms the basis upon which the remuneration 
arrangements have been implemented:
•  The Group’s remuneration policy is to attract, motivate  
and retain executive directors with the necessary abilities  
to manage and develop the Group’s activities successfully  
for the benefit of shareholders.
•  For all senior executives, the Group policy is to provide a 
significant part of their potential reward through performance-
based incentive plans.
•  To ensure the interests of management remain aligned with 
those of shareholders, executive directors will be expected to 
build a meaningful shareholding in the Company of 100% of 
base salary over a five year period. This may be achieved by 
purchasing shares or retaining a proportion of share awards 
that vest. In addition, executive directors are obliged to convert 
part of their bonus into shares under the Group’s Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP).

Elements of remuneration
The following table provides a summary of the key elements of the executive directors remuneration package:
Element Objective Policy
Salary To provide a competitive base 
salary to attract and retain  
talented leaders. 
Base salaries are reviewed annually by reference to companies of a broadly similar size. 
The Committee also takes account of the economic environment and employment 
conditions throughout the Group.
In reviewing salaries for 2012 the Committee has taken account of:
•  Individual and Group performance.
•  Competitiveness against the market.
•  Expected general employee pay increases across the Group.
With the exception of Alan Mitchelson, executive directors are responsible for their own 
pension arrangements.
Annual bonus Bonus payments are intended to 
reflect the achievement of agreed 
business objectives and positive 
contribution to stretching the 
performance of the Group.
The Committee reviews the bonuses payable on an annual basis and sets the targets at 
the beginning of the financial year. 
The maximum potential bonus receivable by the chief executive is 150% of salary and 
for the other executive directors is 100% of salary. 
The bonus opportunity is based on the achievement of a normalised pre-tax profit 
performance condition and the Committee takes into account the overall performance 
of the Group during the period. 
As part of the LTIP, 30% of all executive directors bonuses are compulsorily deferred in 
the form of shares into the LTIP (“investment shares”). The chief executive has an option 
of voluntarily deferring an additional 25% of his bonus and the other executive directors 
may voluntarily defer up to an additional 20% of their bonus into investment shares.
Each investment share may attract the award of up to two matching shares, subject to 
the achievement of performance targets over a three year period. 
Long term share 
incentives
To incentivise executives to 
achieve sustained growth through 
superior long term performance 
and create alignment with 
shareholder interests.
The maximum annual award for all executive directors is 100% of salary. Vesting of 
awards is subject to the achievement of the following targets in equal proportion:
•  Growth in earnings per share.
•  Relative total shareholder return.
Performance against these targets is measured over a three year performance period. 46 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Directors report
Structure of remuneration 
The following charts show the intended elements and 
proportions of the remuneration package for the executive 
directors relating to 2012. The package is broadly structured  
so that at stretch performance between 70% and 75% of the 
overall total is delivered through variable pay.
Salary and benefits
Over the past few years, the Group has grown significantly and 
is now more complex and geographically diverse. Our strong 
performance has been reflected in the Group’s share price which 
has out-performed the market and since 2010 the Group has 
improved further its position in the FTSE 100.
As recorded in the 2010 Remuneration report, it is the Committee’s 
intention to increase the chief executive’s salary to a target salary 
of £725,000 over a three year period, subject to individual and 
company performance including, in particular, the Group’s 
financial success and the maintenance of its ranking in the  
FTSE 100.
In 2010, the Committee made the first adjustment which 
resulted in the chief executive’s salary increasing to £650,000 
from April 2011. Last year, the Committee made a commitment 
that any further significant increases would be made after prior 
consultation with the representative bodies of the Group’s 
major investors, the Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) and 
Research, Recommendations and Electronic Voting (“RREV”).  
In light of the chief executive’s performance, which has continued 
to be of a high standard and is reflected by the Group’s 
continued strong performance and enhanced FTSE position, 
after consultation with the ABI and RREV, the Committee has 
agreed to proceed with the planned adjustment in 2012 which 
will result in the chief executive’s salary increasing to £700,000. 
It remains the Committee’s intention to make the final adjustment 
to the chief executive’s salary in 2013. The Committee will 
continue to keep the chief executive’s salary level under review 
and will ensure that it remains competitive with the market and 
fully reflects the performance of the individual and that of the 
Group in making the decision.
The Committee has also decided that an adjustment be made  
to the finance director’s salary from £400,000 to £420,000,  
an increase of 5%. The Committee took account of the finance 
director’s individual performance as well as that of the Group. 
The legal & commercial director’s salary will remain unchanged 
at £350,000 as he will not be standing for re-election at the  
2012 annual general meeting. 
All salary adjustments will take effect from April 2012. The 
Committee continues to be conscious of the need to pay no 
more than is appropriate to attract and retain key individuals.  
In determining the adjustments to the executive directors 
salaries, the Committee has considered the increases to pay 
levels across the broader employee population, which range 
from 2% to 5% in the UK depending on individual performance 
and circumstances. 
Executive directors also receive other benefits which are the 
provision of a car allowance, participation in a Group health  
care scheme, travel allowance and death in service insurance.

Bonus
Under the Group’s annual performance-related bonus scheme, 
the maximum potential bonus receivable by the chief executive  
is 150% of salary and for the other executive directors is 100% 
of salary.
Annual bonus awards were based on normalised pre-tax profit 
targets and for the 2011 performance year, the range was set at 
a level significantly above that achieved by the Group in 2010, 
with entry-level bonus payable for exceeding 2010 performance 
by a considerable margin. In 2011, Group profits exceeded the 
superior performance level and as a result, the bonus award 
was paid in full. The Committee also took account of the overall 
performance of the Group during the period. 
In 2011, executive directors were required to defer 30% of 
their bonus in the form of shares into the LTIP. In addition, the 
chief executive has an option to defer voluntarily an additional 
25% of his bonus, while the finance director and the legal & 
commercial director may defer voluntarily an additional 20% of 
their bonuses in the form of shares into the LTIP. These shares 
may be matched on the achievement of a performance condition 
calculated over a three year period. 
For 2012, the bonus will continue to be based on a stretching 
pre-tax profit target. In accordance with good practice, a 
clawback provision has now been introduced into the bonus 
scheme, which will enable the Company to clawback all, 
or a proportion of, the bonus paid in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Company’s financial results for any of the 
previous three financial years. The Committee will have the 
discretion to effect the clawback by retaining all or part of the 
current bonus awards including any part of the bonus that will  
be deferred into the LTIP and any matching element. 
The Group cascades the bonus structure described above, 
including a deferred element, to key employees below  
Board level. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
During 2011, the Company continued with its annual grant policy 
under the LTIP. Details of each award are as follows:
•  Performance shares are conditional awards of shares subject 
to Group performance and continued employment until the 
third anniversary of the award. In 2011 awards were made 
up to a maximum of 100% of salary, in accordance with the 
normal grant policy.
•  Executive directors are required to compulsorily defer an 
element of any Group bonus earned in exchange for which they 
are awarded investment shares. In addition, executive directors 
are also allowed to voluntarily convert a further proportion of 
their Group bonus into Weir Group shares.
•  Matching shares are conditional awards to acquire free shares, 
subject to Group performance and continued employment until 
the third anniversary of the award. As in 2011, matching shares 
may be awarded up to a maximum of two times the pre-tax 
value of the deferred bonus “invested”, both on a compulsory 
and voluntary basis, under the LTIP. 
In addition, since 2011, the performance share awards, the 
compulsory investment share awards and the matching share 
awards have the right to receive the equivalent to the dividends 
that participants would have received as shareholders from  
the date of the LTIP award to the award’s vesting date.  
These equivalents will be made in the form of shares. 
The awards are based on the Group’s share price, using the 
average published closing price for the three dealing days 
immediately preceding the date of award.
The vesting of conditional awards of performance and matching 
shares is subject to the satisfaction of highly demanding 
performance conditions as described on page 48.
During 2011, 100% of the 2008 LTIP award vested as the 
Company’s TSR ranked first in the comparator group applicable 
for the 2008 award.
For 2012, awards will continue to be granted up to a maximum 
of 100% of salary. 48 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Directors report
Performance criteria
Performance share awards and matching share awards made in 
2011 under the LTIP were subject to the following performance 
conditions. Fifty per cent of each award is based on an earnings 
per share (“EPS”) growth target and the other fifty per cent of the 
award is based on the growth in the Group’s total shareholder 
return (“TSR”) against the TSR of a comparator group of peer 
companies. Both performance conditions are measured over  
a single three year performance period.
The Committee believes that a balance between earnings per 
share and TSR is appropriate and aligned to the Company’s  
long term strategic goals of driving sustained earnings 
performance and shareholder value creation.
The EPS targets for awards made in 2011 and in 2012 under  
the LTIP are shown below.
 % of the earnings per share portion 
Earnings per share growth  of the award which vests
 
15% per annum 100% 
7% per annum 25% 
Less than 7% per annum 0%
The EPS targets for LTIP awards made in 2010 are  
shown below.
 % of the earnings per share portion 
Earnings per share growth  of the award which vests
 
11% per annum 100% 
4% per annum 25% 
Less than 4% per annum 0%
The EPS growth measure is adjusted to exclude intangibles 
amortisation and exceptional items. 
The relative TSR performance measures for 2011, 2012 and 
earlier awards that remain outstanding were as follows:
Relative Total Shareholder Return % of the Total Shareholder Return 
growth against comparator group portion of the award which vests
 
Upper quintile 100% 
Median 25% 
Below median 0%
TSR is based on performance over three consecutive financial 
years, beginning with the year in which the award is made. 
Between upper quintile and median performance, awards vest 
on a sliding scale basis. The TSR calculation is performed by 
PwC for the Committee at the time of vesting.
The Committee considers that these are a demanding range  
of targets.
For awards made in 2011, the Committee introduced a new 
comparator group of UK and international peer companies 
for the TSR condition. The group comprises 40% UK-based 
companies, 40% US-based companies with the remainder 
based in Europe. The market capitalisations of these  
companies range from approximately £3bn below the  
Group’s market capitalisation to approximately £3.5bn  
above as at 30 December 2011.
The comparator group comprises:
During the course of the performance period the Committee 
may, in its absolute discretion, vary, add, remove or alter the 
companies making up the comparator group where events 
happen which cause the Committee to consider that such 
change is appropriate to ensure a fair measure of performance. 
The comparator group for awards made in 2012 will comprise 
the same companies as those in the comparator group for the 
2011 awards. Charter plc was acquired during 2011 and has 
been replaced by AMEC plc for both the 2011 and 2012 awards. 
For awards made under the LTIP in 2010 and earlier years, 
the comparator group comprised 16 UK companies: AGA 
Rangemaster Group, Bodycote, Cookson Group, Halma, IMI, 
Meggitt, Mitie Group, Morgan Crucible Company, Rolls-Royce, 
Rotork, Senior, Smiths Group, Spirax-Sarco Engineering, 
Tomkins, Wood Group and WS Atkins.

Pensions
Keith Cochrane and Jon Stanton are responsible for their own 
pension arrangements.
Alan Mitchelson is an active member of the Company’s 1972 
pension and life assurance plan. The plan is a contributory 
defined benefit plan with the active members contributing  
8% of salary.
The balance of the cost of the plan is met by the Company 
having taken account of the trustee’s opinion arrived at by 
considering the funding recommendations of the plan’s 
independent actuary.
The plan targets a pension of two thirds of final salary payable 
at normal retirement date, providing a member then has at least 
24 years pensionable service. Where a member has less than 24 
years pensionable service to normal retirement date their pension 
currently accrues at 1/36th of final salary per annum.
For members, salary (both for contributions and for plan benefits) 
is subject to a plan specific earnings cap. This is currently 
£129,600.
The plan provides for a surviving spouse’s pension of one half  
of the member’s pension (before any exchange for cash) and,  
in certain circumstances, for a dependent child’s pension until 
the child attains the age of 23 years.
Pension built up prior to April 2006 increases in payment by the 
annual increase in the retail prices index up to a maximum of  
5%. For pension built up after April 2006, the annual increase is 
limited to a maximum of 2.5%. Deferred pensions are revalued 
between the date of exit and normal retirement date in line  
with statute.
The plan provides a lump sum death benefit of five times salary 
for Alan Mitchelson.
Chairman and non-executive directors
The chairman and each of the non-executive directors have 
letters of appointment. The letters of appointment do not contain 
any contractual entitlement to a termination payment and the 
directors can be removed in accordance with the Company’s 
articles of association.
The details of the letters of appointment in relation to the  
non-executive directors who served during the year are:
Executive directors service contracts
All the executive directors who served during the year have 
service contracts with the Company that provide for a minimum 
period of notice of six months by the individual and twelve 
months by the Company. In the event that the Company 
terminated an executive director’s service contract other than 
in accordance with its terms, the Committee, when determining 
what compensation, if any, should properly be paid by the 
Company to the departing director, will give full consideration  
to the obligation of that director to mitigate any loss which he 
may suffer as a result of the termination of his contract.
To recruit the best executives, the Committee may in the future 
agree contractual notice periods which initially exceed twelve 
months, particularly as it is often necessary for executives to 
relocate their families.

directors who served during the year are:

report (continued)
Executive directors external appointments
The executive directors are permitted, with board agreement, 
to take up one non-executive appointment provided there is no 
conflict of interest and that the time spent would not impinge 
on their work for the Group. It is the Company’s policy that 
remuneration earned from such appointments may be kept by 
the individual executive director. No executive director received 
remuneration for external appointments during 2011.
Remuneration of the chairman and non-executive directors
The chairman’s fee is agreed by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Committee. Fees for the non-executive 
directors are determined by the Board. In determining the fee 
levels, account is taken of the time commitment, scale of roles, 
market norms and comparison with companies of equivalent size 
based on information provided by PwC. Neither the chairman 
nor any of the non-executive directors participate in any of the 
Company’s incentive plans or receive pension or other benefits, 
except that the chairman is entitled to participate in the Group 
health care scheme and an additional allowance is made 
available to non-executive directors, where appropriate, to reflect 
the additional time commitment in attending intercontinental 
board meetings and operational visits. The chairman and the 
non-executive directors are not involved in any discussions or 
decisions about their own remuneration.
The non-executive directors fees and chairman’s fees are 
reviewed annually by the Board. With effect from 1 April 2011, 
fees for the respective non-executive positions were: Chairman 
£250,000 (2010: £182,500) and non-executive directors  
£50,000 (2010: £45,000). Additional fees paid to the chairmen  
of the Audit and Remuneration Committees are £10,000  
(2010: £7,500). The fee paid to Michael Dearden in respect  
of his role as senior non-executive director is £5,000  
(2010: £2,500). There will be no increases to fees in 2012.
Total shareholder return
The graph below illustrates the performance of the Company 
against the FTSE 100 Share Index and the comparator group 
used in the LTIP awards for 2011. The Board believes that these 
measures represent an appropriate and fair comparator against 
which to measure the Group’s performance for this purpose.
This chart shows the value as at 30 December 2011 of £100 invested in Weir 
Group shares over the last five financial years compared with the value of £100

Stanton are responsible for their own pension provision. Pension entitlement and the corresponding transfer values were as follows 
during the year:
Notes
1. The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, prior to any cash commutation, based on pensionable service to the end of the year.
2.  With effect from 1 October 2008, Government legislation requires the trustees (having taken actuarial advice) to take responsibility for setting the assumptions underlying the calculation of voluntary 
transfer values to be paid from the plan. Prior to this date the scheme actuary had this responsibility. Consequently, the transfer value of the accrued pension at the year end has been calculated in 
accordance with this revised requirement.
3.  The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year is made up of the following elements: 
a. transfer value of the increase in accrued pension  
b. increase in the transfer value of accrued pension at year start due to ageing 
c. impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis – as referred to in 2. above 
d. less the director’s ordinary contributions
4.  The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Group and directors, such as stockmarket 
movements; which will be reflected within 3c above. The inflation measure for leavers during 2011 with at least one year to their normal retirement date was 2.5%. Consequently, the rate of inflation 
assumed in the above figures is 2.5%.
5. Directors have the option to pay voluntary contributions. Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
6.  The figures for Alan Mitchelson allow for the impact of the plan specific earnings cap and his restricted salary for pension accrued from April 2010. Alan Mitchelson does not have an entitlement to an 
excepted (formerly known as unapproved) pension from the Group.
7. Payment of actual transfer values (from the defined benefit scheme of which Alan Mitchelson is a member) are not currently reduced below 100% of their full value. 
8. The figures allow for the impact of inflation in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.

To reduce our energy use and 
carbon footprint
To maintain a safe and  
healthy workplace
To attract and retain the  
best employees
To invest in the communities  
in which we operate
To optimise the energy efficiency  
of our products and supply of

To conduct our business responsibly 
and ethically
The Group 
considers 
sustainability a  
key part of its 
strategy and 
recognises its 
importance 
in delivering 
shareholder value. 
Our sustainability 
approach is 
embedded in our 
business through 
six key areas.
1: Environment
2: Health & Safety
3: Employees
4: Communities
5: Products and technology
6: Ethics  55
Environment
The Weir Group is committed to achieving the 
highest environmental standards. Our businesses 
have been focused in 2011 on achieving ISO 14001 
certification with all existing businesses now fully 
accredited. Our operating companies have 
established sustainability committees to ensure 
consistent best practice in environmental 
performance and identify and implement  
carbon reduction projects. 
Health & safety
Employee health and safety is of paramount 
importance to the Weir Group. The Group is 
committed to zero accident workplaces. During 
2011, we have introduced an Environmental,  
Health and Safety (EHS) excellence committee  
to drive best practice throughout the Group,  
set global EHS standards and provide consistent 
benchmarking of health and safety performance.
Employees
One of the foundations of a sustainable business  
is the ability to recruit, develop and retain good 
quality people. During 2011, substantial investment 
was made in establishing a strong development 
framework to ensure a robust talent pipeline exists 
to serve the present and future needs of the 
business. The Weir Leadership Programme, 
Emerging Leaders Programme and the Graduate 
Development Framework provide appropriate 
development opportunities for employees at 
different stages of their careers, with the shared  
aim of supporting the needs of a growing and 
increasingly complex organisation. Support for 
technical and engineering skills also progressed  
in 2011, with the online Weir University accessible 
to employees across our operations, facilitating  
the delivery of best practice. 
Communities
Weir respects the communities in which it operates 
and during 2011 a number of new and existing 
projects worldwide recognised our ongoing 
obligation to minimise our environmental impact  
and invest in local communities. As a global 
company doing business in more than 70 countries, 
we have a consistent framework in place to guide 
our community investment activities. 
Products and technology
Many of the Group’s products and services are 
used in low carbon applications such as nuclear 
power generation, hydro power generation, wind 
power generation and flue gas desulphurisation.  
We aim to expand the range of products supplied 
to such applications over time. Our research 
activities, enhanced during 2011 by the 
establishment of the Weir Advanced Research 
Centre, are geared towards developments in 
materials technology and reducing energy usage, 
ensuring that Weir innovation activity is aligned with 
customer demands and corporate sustainability 
goals. Our Engineering Excellence Committee 
continually aims to enhance energy efficiency  
in our products both through the design and 
manufacturing process and in customer operations.
Ethics
Doing business in the right way is the only way in 
which the Weir Group operates. The Group Code of 
Conduct, anti-bribery and corruption training and an 
ethics hotline ensure that all employees understand 
how to adhere to the Group’s zero tolerance policy 
on ethical breaches. We recognise that corporate 
behaviour is a factor that is taken increasingly  
into account by investors, existing and potential 
customers and present and future employees. 
Ensuring Weir operates with the highest standards 
of ethical behaviour is a key focus for all leaders  
in our business.
How is this 
delivered?
The Board sets the 
strategy for each of 
these areas, with the 
responsibility for 
implementation resting 
with the Group Executive 
Committee. Progress 
and performance is 
managed and monitored 
through the Corporate 
Sustainability Steering 
Committee, comprising 
specialist representation 
and expertise from 
across the Group. 
During 2011, the 
Committee was led by 
the Group Legal and 
Commercial Director. 56 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Directors report
The Group aims to continuously reduce its impact 
on the environment in two main ways. First, by 
improving the environmental performance of 
our operations and secondly, through time by 
enhancing the energy efficiency of our products.
Our main environmental impacts include 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; material and 
solvent usage; and waste products. Emissions are 
identified and managed through our Environmental 
Management System (EMS) which is certified to ISO 
14001 standard. We monitor upcoming legislation 
and share best practice across our operations.
ISO 14001
All our continuing operations are ISO 14001 
accredited or, in the case of new acquisitions, 
a plan is put in place to achieve accreditation 
during the integration process. ISO 14001 is an 
internationally recognised specification for an 
environmental management system which  
helps organisations achieve environmental 
and economic goals as well as assisting in the 
implementation of environmental policy. It provides 
assurance that our environmental performance 
meets and will continue to meet legal and 
environmental policy requirements. 
Carbon footprint
The Weir Group is an energy intensive business, 
due to the requirement for electricity and gas  
for industrial manufacturing operations across a  
global footprint. However, when compared with 
sector peers against the latest available data,  
we rank above average in terms of our tonnage  
by turnover performance. 
The Group’s absolute emissions have increased 
year on year. This increase is attributable to the 
growth of the Group during 2011 and its increased 
output. On a tonnage by turnover basis, the Group 
has decreased its carbon footprint this year by  
12% compared with 2010.
The majority of the Group’s greenhouse gas 
emissions come from electricity and gas use at 
our facilities (67%, 2011). Our foundries, the most 
energy intensive area of our operations, produce 
66,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent
1
  
(CO2e), equal to 40% of the Group total. 
In 2011, sustainability committees at each of 
the Group’s operating companies have been 
challenged to identify and implement three carbon 
emission reduction projects, adding new projects as 
each is completed. Over time this will start to have 
an impact on the Group’s overall carbon footprint. 
Our carbon emissions are reported in accordance 
with the principles of the World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development and the World 
Resources Institute’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
(“GHG Protocol”). The GHG Protocol categorises 
emissions as follows:
The Weir Group reports on its Scope 1 and 
2 emissions, as defined in the GHG Protocol. 
Approximately 5% of the emissions data provided  
is derived, or partly derived, from estimates.
The Group’s total carbon footprint for 2009, 2010 
and 2011 for continuing operations is as follows:
Total CO2 tonnes (‘000)
The Group’s total carbon footprint by turnover for 
the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 is as follows:
tCO2e/£m 
1
 Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as tonnes of CO2 
equivalent (abbreviated as tCO2e), based on the Global Warming 
Potential (“GWP”) of each of the “basket of six” greenhouse gases, 
as defined by the Kyoto Protocol. The GWP of CO2 is 1 (1 tonne 
CO2 = 1 tonne CO2e). For other greenhouse gases in the “basket 
of six”, including refrigerants, the GWP is relative to CO2 over  
a 100-year time horizon (eg one tonne of the refrigerant R407C  
is equivalent to 1,526 tonnes of CO2 in terms of the potential 
climate change impact).

Foundry recycling
The Group’s five foundries recycled 20,000 tonnes 
of metal in 2011 of which 18,000 tonnes is metal 
recycled internally. This means that on average 61% 
of the metal poured at our foundries is recycled. 
The amount recycled internally has increased by 
24% on 2010. The results of the foundry recycling 
can be seen in the following graph:
Foundry recycling (‘000 tonnes) 
Carbon reduction commitment (CRC)
The carbon reduction commitment (CRC) energy 
efficiency scheme is the UK’s mandatory climate 
change and energy saving scheme. The scheme, 
targets large organisations whose emissions are 
currently not included in any European energy 
trading schemes or Climate Change Agreements. 
The Group is a participant in the CRC scheme,  
and during 2010 the UK operations started detailed 
monitoring of all electricity, gas and diesel use for 
the CRC scheme. The first phase footprint report 
and the first annual report of our emissions under 
the CRC scheme was completed in July 2011.  
The UK businesses affected by the CRC will be 
required to monitor their energy use and buy 
allowances accordingly in forthcoming years  
as the scheme rolls out. 
Environmental initiatives
Weir SPM, Fort Worth 
A recycling programme was introduced at Weir 
SPM to reduce the amount of waste going to 
landfill. To date, that has resulted in a reduction  
of 500 tonnes, including 238 tonnes of wood  
and 175 tonnes of paper and cardboard.
Weir Minerals Brasil 
At Weir Minerals Brasil, water consumption has 
been reduced from 8m³ per tonne of metal cast  
to 5m³ per tonne. In addition, the site’s biomass 
boiler uses waste wood which would otherwise  
be sent to landfill.
Weir Minerals Europe 
Reducing the environmental impact on the local 
community led to Weir Minerals Europe investing  
in silencers for all external fans and the planting 
of 50 trees on the site to reduce noise to the 
surrounding community. 
Weir Gabbioneta
Weir Gabbioneta operates two production sites 
that are three kilometres apart. Transporting people 
between the two sites was previously carried out 
by car but in 2011, was replaced by six electric 
quadricycles, with an estimated reduction in carbon 
dioxide emissions equivalent to three tonnes a year. 
Weir Minerals Peru
In March 2011, the Peruvian Environment Minister 
awarded Weir Minerals Peru with first place in the 
waste management category in national awards 
for the ‘most eco-efficient enterprise in Peru’ for 
its work in recycling glass, paper, wood and used 
electronic equipment for local charities.

2: Health & Safety
EHS Excellence Committee
During 2011, Weir established the Environment, 
Health and Safety (EHS) excellence committee 
to focus on EHS issues across the Group. The 
committee has Group Executive Committee level 
leadership through the director of operations 
support and development and involves senior 
managers from across the Group from operational, 
human resource and legal functions. 
Since it was established, the committee has led 
the development of a Weir EHS System which has 
been deployed throughout all operating companies. 
A leading global consultancy has undertaken a 
programme of external audits of EHS performance 
from which global minimum standards will be 
developed and improvement plans created and 
implemented to bring all businesses in line with  
the requirements of the Weir EHS System. 
In addition, the committee appointed divisional 
champions to monitor and drive the environmental 
and health and safety agenda, ensuring employees 
understand best practice and their EHS obligations. 
The committee has also developed the planned 
introduction in 2012 of a Weir behavioural safety 
system to reinforce the culture of zero tolerance  
to workplace accidents. 
Weir Environment, Health and Safety  
(EHS) System
The development of a Weir EHS system began 
during 2011 to set out global standards for areas 
including behavioural safety, operational control of 
risk, fire and environment. It is deployed to deliver 
the following outcomes:
•  Deliver a set of consistent minimum EHS 
standards across Weir companies.
•  Develop measurable and proactive indicators  
of EHS performance.
•  Develop methodology to identify top EHS 
performers to share best practice approaches 
across the Group.
The safety of Weir’s employees is the highest priority for every member of the 
Senior Management Group. The Group is committed to an accident-free health 
and safety environment based on the belief that all accidents are preventable. 
The core elements of our approach to safety are:
—  an EHS system designed specifically for the applications 
we operate.
—  adoption of a behavioural safety ethos which promotes 
risk assessment of all tasks, no matter how routine they 
may appear.
—  enforcement of a clear chain of command and 
responsibility in EHS issues.
—  robust improvement plans at business, divisional and 
Group level.
—  implementation of best practice by sharing effective 
initiatives across the Group.
The EHS excellence committee  59
OHSAS 18001 
The Group’s policy is that all its operations will be 
OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety 
Assessment Series) accredited. OHSAS 18001  
was developed by the British Standards Institute 
as a health and safety management framework 
allowing organisations to ensure that they 
consistently and accurately identify hazards  
and risks within their operations.
Our existing businesses have achieved accreditation 
and all new acquisitions have detailed plans to 
achieve OHSAS 18001 within an agreed timescale.
Lost Time Accidents
Weir is focused on a zero-accident culture. The 
Group’s key measure of safety performance is the 
number of lost time accidents (“LTAs”). The Group 
adopts a more stringent lost time measurement 
criterion than the industry norm of three days, 
choosing a definition of “incidents resulting in lost 
time of more than four hours”. The results for 2009, 
2010 and 2011 are as follows:
 
The reasons underlying the rise include record 
activity levels across our operations alongside  
a higher workforce headcount with around 2,000 
new employees joining the Group.
With effect from 2011, the Group has started 
to report its safety performance based on Total 
Incident Rate (TIR). This measures medical 
treatment of any kind required by employees, 
divided by 200,000 hours worked. It is a standard 
safety measurement methodology widely employed 
across industry. The 2012 annual report will publish 
the Group’s performance against this measure. 
Case studies
Hand, wrist and finger injury
Interactive workshops took place during the year 
to establish the main issues in relation to hand, 
wrist and finger injuries – a common cause of 
injury throughout the industry. Three main factors 
underpinning health and safety in this area were 
established: body mechanics/ergonomics, tooling 
selection and job safety analysis/‘Point of Work’  
risk assessment.
Safe acts audits
‘Safe Acts Audits’ focus on observing an employee 
for 15 minutes in their working environment and the 
behaviours the employee is demonstrating. Team 
leaders and supervisors of the pump assembly 
team at Weir SPM’s Fort Worth facility conduct 
these audits weekly, completing an average of 40 
audits per week. The data gathered from the audits 
is used to establish where additional behavioural 
training is required.
Weir Minerals North America
Weir Minerals in Madison, Wisconsin provides 
employee information on health issues such as 
breast cancer awareness, smoking cessation and 
diabetes. They also run safety tool box meetings 
and operate an Employee Assistance Programme 
(EAP) which provides employers and employees  
the opportunity to manage issues before they 
become serious and impair work performance.  
The EAP provides employees the opportunity 
to seek treatment for specific problems such as 
depression, anxiety and marital or family problems.
Weir BDK
Weir BDK in Hubli, India offers all employees access 
to an occupational health centre which provides 
various medical checkups, including eye test and 
colour vision, pulmonary function tests, audiometric 
tests, chest x-rays and physical fitness. The centre 
also offers the local community subsidised medicines 
and treatment and organises health and blood 
donation camps.

3: Employees
The Group recognises the importance of  
motivated and effective people to ensure the 
sustainable success of the business. We are 
committed to attracting and retaining the best 
people available for the role and developing them  
to achieve their potential.
The principles we apply are to:
•  Never deny development or promotion on the 
basis of any form of discrimination.
•  Encourage and support our employees to achieve 
their potential.
•  Identify the training and development needs of 
ourselves and our teams and find ways to fulfil 
those requirements.
•  Use the Weir Group personal development  
plan (PDP) to identify and develop high  
potential individuals.
•  Employ and retain people who share our values 
and behaviours.
•  Work to maintain a business environment where 
individuals feel valued and respected.
•  Support individuals in developing roles.
During 2011, important steps were put in place 
to establish a comprehensive management and 
leadership development framework for the Group, 
providing a talent pipeline capable of supporting  
the present and future needs of the business.
Weir Leadership Programme
The Weir Leadership Programme was launched 
at the start of 2011 to develop high performing 
leaders and strategic awareness in order to further 
leverage the delivery of Weir’s strategic agenda. 
Programme participants are drawn from the Senior 
Management Group (SMG) with around 100 senior 
managers taking part so far. The SMG is a group 
of around 300 senior employees from across the 
Weir Group who are key to the development and 
delivery of the Group’s strategy. The programme 
is designed around practical business challenges 
and peers from across the Group’s operations 
collaborate and support each other in facilitated 
learning groups. All Senior Management Group 
members will participate in the programme,  
which runs until the end of 2013. 
Emerging Leaders Programme
The Emerging Leaders Programme was launched 
in 2011 for nominated managers and employees 
who are identified as potential senior Weir leaders 
of the future. Designed in conjunction with a 
leading business school, the programme is tailored 
to delivering the Weir Way and covers critical 
management areas including leading people in 
organisations, financial management, commercial 
awareness, operations management, innovation 
and project management. Completion of the 
programme leads to a postgraduate Certificate in 
Management and the opportunity for participants  
to obtain a Masters in Business Administration 
(MBA) qualification.  61

Graduate Development Framework
During 2011, Weir recruited a total of 75 graduates 
from a variety of professional disciplines, including 
engineering, across the Group. The Graduate 
Development Framework provides a consistent 
development programme to provide graduates 
within Weir with a broad knowledge and 
understanding of the business. 
A successful pilot graduate development programme 
took place in September for 12 nominated graduates 
from the UK, Canada, India, Italy, North America,  
and South Africa, enabling participants to gain a 
wider understanding of the Weir Group and share  
in joint development activities. 
“To see how serious 
the Group is about our 
development as graduates 
really motivated me. I realised 
that graduates are not just 
young people who are at the 
bottom of the chain but they 
are regarded as the future of 
this organisation.”
Pauline Mohlala, Graduate, Weir Minerals Africa
Weir University
The Weir University was launched at the end of 
March to provide all employees with online access 
through the Weir Intranet homepage to continuous 
professional development resources. With an initial 
focus on Weir’s areas of technological competitive 
advantage and supporting engineering skills and 
resources, courses on metallurgy, failure analysis, 
corrosion and finite element analysis (FEA) were  
the first to be made available. 
In addition, a new learning management system is 
available for the majority of staff across the group, 
providing access to online learning courses, books, 
simulations and video clips. 
Weir Aspire
Weir Aspire, an HR Information system, was 
made available to all members of the Senior 
Management Group and Head Office employees. 
The introduction of this system is to help bring 
a consistent and more efficient way of capturing 
key employee information, carrying out annual 
performance and development reviews and 
supporting the succession planning process.

Succession planning
The initiatives rolled out in 2011 combine to establish 
a robust management and leadership development 
framework. This framework, in part, is designed 
to contribute to the Group’s succession planning 
process across its businesses, by identifying and 
matching at an early stage, where human capital 
is required to enhance the Group’s capability. 
Particular focus has been brought to succession 
planning across the Senior Management Group,  
the key leaders across the organisation.
Senior Management Group
During 2011 further regional meetings were held 
of the Senior Management Group in Europe, 
North America, and Malaysia. These meetings 
provided the chief executive with the platform 
to communicate face-to-face with the global 
leadership team and discuss and drive forward  
the strategic agenda.
Group conference
The theme of the 2011 Group conference was 
’Accelerating Growth’. Weir Managing Directors 
and other senior managers came together for two 
days of strategy workshops and plenary sessions 
to establish a shared vision for delivering the next 
phase in the development of the Group. 
Engineering Directors
The global Engineering Directors Conference 
in Sydney, Australia brought together senior 
engineers from across the Group to discuss how 
collaboration and innovation can be advanced in 
Weir’s engineering activities. The event provided a 
focus for sharing the 2011 work of the Engineering 
Excellence Committee and developing the 
technology agenda for 2012 and beyond. 
Case studies
Weir Minerals Africa
Graduates with Weir Minerals Africa provide 
community service to non-profit charitable 
organisations as part of their development 
programme. In 2011, the graduates collected

Sustainability report
4: Communities
Weir recognises its obligation to respect and invest 
in the communities where its operations have an 
impact. Our investment should have a sustainable 
impact on a community, should be aligned with the 
sustainability goals of our business and delivered 
together with local organisations.
Our opportunities to invest are identified through 
contact with local people and organisations. We 
work closely in delivery with local charities and 
community groups.
Our Code of Conduct sets out that the Weir Group 
companies will be ‘good citizens’ by:
•  Respecting the local environment.
•  Setting an example by behaving in a manner 
consistent with the Code at all times.
•  Supporting local communities who need help 
through charitable contributions and employees 
giving of their free time.
•  Informing and updating communities about 
ongoing projects in their areas.
•  Respecting the traditions, cultures and laws of  
the countries and the local communities where  
we operate.
•  Trying to employ local people in our businesses 
wherever possible.
•  Listening to the concerns of the local communities 
and, where possible, acting in a way that deals 
with their concerns.
Key themes for our community investment 
are education and health. These are enduring 
priorities for communities worldwide and focused 
investment, whether at early years or adult level, 
can make a profound difference to individuals and 
their communities.
Charitable donations
The total charitable donations of Group companies 
made during the financial year was £422,300  
(2010: £333,900), as shown below:
The Group’s Code of Conduct prohibits political 
contributions and therefore no political donations 
were made during the period.
Case studies
Education
The Weir Group PLC
During 2011 the Weir Group sponsored the 
purchase of eight Rapman 3D kits for use in the 
Young Engineers and Science Clubs throughout 
Scotland. The Royal Academy of Engineering, the 
Scottish Council for Development and Industry 
and the University of Strathclyde Department of 
Design, Manufacture and Engineering Management 
invited the clubs to participate in an innovative rapid 
prototyping project to build the 3D printers using 
the kits and then come up with a project to use the 
3D printers to manufacture anything from jewellery

4. Communities (continued)
Weir India
Since 2008 Weir India has supported two local 
‘transit schools’ for children rescued from child 
labour. The support is partly financial, supporting 
teacher and other staff salaries and also includes 
the time spent by volunteers amongst Weir India 
employees. The ongoing financial commitment 
benefits around 100 children studying in these  
two schools. In late 2011 Weir India alongside  
two NGOs, Paraspara Trust and Biocon  
Foundation held two free health camps in the 
communities surrounding the ‘transit schools’.  
The camps encouraged good health practices 
amongst the children and their families. 
The Group entered a partnership in 2011 with a 
local authority in India to support the infrastructure 
needs of a primary school in Gokul village, near 
the operations of Weir BDK. Weir has invested 
£35,000 in the building of a new block at the school 
and other infrastructure improvements. Weir also 
established a programme to teach English with this 
and other school activities supported by volunteers 
from Weir BDK.
Weir Minerals Chile
Ignacio Carrera Pinto is a school for underprivileged 
children, in San Bernardo, near Weir Minerals main 
facility in Santiago. It has 100 students from 5 to 
17 years old, most of whom are socially vulnerable. 
Weir provides support in several ways, including 
improving the school bathrooms and infrastructure, 
collecting and distributing used books and staff 
volunteering to paint the school.

to paint a small school 
knowing the realities of the 
children studying there  
meant I was doing good for  
the community and the 
children at risk.”

5: Products and technology
Developing new products that are more 
environmentally friendly offers a competitive 
advantage to ourselves and to our customers. 
Additionally, many of our existing products  
and services contribute to environmental  
protection in critical areas such as power  
generation and service.
The Group’s focus on the renewable energy  
sector continues and within the Power & Industrial 
Division 42% of input (40% in 2010) came from 
products and services supplied to low carbon 
industries in nuclear, hydro and biomass.
Research and development
During the financial year, the Group spent £18.4m 
(2010: £14.8m) on research and development.  
The desire of our customers for materials 
technology and innovation that will extend product 
operating life, enhance safety performance and 
reduce energy costs, ensures that Weir’s research 
activities and corporate sustainability goals are 
closely aligned. 
Weir Advanced Research Centre (WARC)
The Weir Advanced Research Centre (WARC)  
was established in March this year at the University 
of Strathclyde in Glasgow. The establishment of 
WARC marks a new approach to innovation for 
Weir and is expected to provide a pipeline of new 
product innovation and significant improvements  
in existing product performance. Several projects 
are already underway, focusing on ‘blue sky’ 
innovations in the areas of coatings and flow 
control. Weir funded the centre with an initial 
investment of £1.9m over three years. This  
funding creates four PhD studentships per year, 
underscoring Weir’s commitment to education  
and advancing engineering skills in the UK.
Engineering Excellence Committee
The Engineering Excellence Committee is 
responsible for the implementation of engineering 
best practice across the divisions.
During 2011, the Committee was involved  
in a number of projects that seek to improve 
environmental performance including using 
advanced design techniques to maximise pump 
efficiency and power use and ensuring high 
recycling potential in the materials used in  
wear resistant parts.

Case studies
RTS Alcan Lochaber 
Weir Power & Industrial Alloa played a major role 
in delivering the completion of a powerhouse 
modernisation project for RTS Alcan for their 
Lochaber aluminium production facility.
The project required the replacement of 12 twin  
jet Pelton machines, originally installed in 1929.  
The project was completed in three phases 
between 2009 and 2011 and used the Weir Power 
& Industrial designed Cooling Water System 
incorporating the use of an environmentally friendly, 
non-toxic heat transfer fluid product based on 
refined vegetable extracts instead of more toxic 
anti-freeze protection products normally selected 
for this type of application.
Sustainability engineers
During 2011 Weir appointed two sustainability 
engineers. A key focus for these individuals is to 
introduce and develop sustainability improvements 
in the Group’s operating businesses. Sustainability 
engineers work across the business to identify 
and implement changes to enhance areas such as 
energy management, waste disposal and recycling.

6: Ethics
Driving Growth the Weir Way means doing 
business at all times in an ethical and transparent 
manner. Since the launch of the Code of Conduct 
in December 2010, the chief executive has 
reinforced this message in written and face-to-
face communications with employees worldwide, 
making clear that the highest standards of integrity 
must be maintained, consistent with the Code. 
The UK Bribery Act, which came into force during 
2011, affects all employees, not only those based in 
the UK, and training has been delivered around the 
global operations to ensure employees are aware  
of the Act’s requirements.
Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct provides a clear framework on 
which to base decision making and provides details 
of what is expected from each employee to maintain 
the Group’s high standards of ethical behaviour.
The Code of Conduct covers bribery and corruption 
and other areas such as respecting communities 
and workplace integrity.
The Code of Conduct is written in easy to 
understand language with practical examples 
in each section. It has been made available in a 
number of different languages for global employees.
This group of employees have decision-making 
responsibilities in regard to customers, suppliers, 
sales agents and other third parties and accordingly 
have a higher risk of exposure to bribery and other 
corrupt practices. 
Two e-learning modules were rolled out in 2011, 
one covering the UK Bribery Act, including the 
prevention of bribery and corruption, and the 
second addressing the Code of Conduct. In total, 
over 1,600 employees have completed the two 
modules. Monitoring controls are in place to ensure 
training is completed in a timely manner and to 
ensure new employees are added to training 
participant lists as required. A Code of Conduct 
e-learning plan is in place for 2012. An online 
certification process enables these employees 
to certify on a quarterly basis that they are in 
compliance with the Code of Conduct.
The Group has also conducted a number of ‘Town 
Hall’ meetings to explain the requirements of the 
Code of Conduct to all employees. During 2011, 
these took place in Russia, China, India, Indonesia, 
Italy and South America. Further meetings will be 
undertaken in 2012. 
The main purposes of the Code of 
Conduct are to:
—  Set out clearly the behaviour 
expected from employees and 
stakeholders
—  Provide guidelines to help with 
applying Weir’s values  
at all times
—  Enable employees to raise a 
concern or ask a question  
if they are in doubt.
A mandatory e-learning training 
programme exists for the following 
employees, including:
—  The Senior Management Group 
—  All sales and marketing employees 
—  All purchasing employees. 
The Code of Conduct is also 
reinforced through an ongoing series 
of communications, for example:
—  The Group conference and all 
regional and functional conferences 
—  Induction days for new executives
—  Training courses for the SMG
—  As part of the 100 day integration 
plan for new acquisitions. 68 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Directors report
All sales agent agreements have been reviewed 
during 2011 and are being updated, subject to 
contractual restrictions, as necessary to reflect  
the Code of Conduct and anti-bribery & corruption 
requirements. Sales agents are subject to formal 
and ongoing due diligence prior to appointment 
or reappointment. They must also confirm their 
compliance with the Code of Conduct in regard to 
business conducted on behalf of the Weir Group. 
In addition, there is an ongoing programme of 
work across the Group to communicate the Code 
of Conduct to third party suppliers with expanded 
assessment criteria to ensure new suppliers comply 
with the ethical requirement of the Group’s supply 
chain policy.
Gifts & Hospitality 
During 2011, the Group’s policies were updated 
and communicated to all businesses to ensure 
that employees have clarity on the provision and 
acceptance of gifts and hospitality. In addition,  
an online gifts and hospitality approval and register 
system was implemented across the Group which 
is mandatory for all employees. 
Ethics Hotline
In support of the Code of Conduct, an independent 
and confidential helpline is available for employees 
to call with any concerns that they have concerning 
unethical behaviour. Calls to the helpline are free 
and lines are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
In total, 16 complaints were received during 2011. 
After investigation, no action was required in 12 
cases, with the remainder addressed through 
further training and communication improvements 
or disciplinary processes.
Supply chain
The Weir Group sources components, materials 
and services on a world-wide basis. Our suppliers 
are an integral part of the Group’s business and  
our relationships with them are based on achieving 
best performance, product, delivery, service and 
total cost.
We recognise that our supply chain activities have 
a broad impact and that our responsibilities extend 
beyond our own operations and into those of our 
suppliers. The Group has a Supply Chain Policy to 
ensure that suppliers to the Group comply with or 
exceed certain standards in connection with their 
workforce, legal compliance, health and safety, 
business ethics and environmental standards. Our 
key supplier partners are expected to either have 
accreditation to OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 or 
be able to demonstrate a plan to achieve it within  
a reasonable amount of time. 
During 2011, we have developed our new supplier 
assessment criteria to address compliance with  
the Group Supply Chain Policy. We audit our main 
existing suppliers annually against the requirements 
of the policy and other Group standards, particularly 
in the area of health and safety. This is a particular 
focus on ‘best cost’ countries where we increase 
our sourcing activities. We will not deal with 
suppliers who, on the basis of the information 
available to Weir, fail to adhere to these 
requirements.
We recognise that our corporate responsibility also 
reflects the way we behave towards our suppliers. 
The Group does not operate a standard policy 
in respect of payments to suppliers and each 
operating company is responsible for agreeing 
the terms and conditions under which business 
transactions are conducted, including the terms  
of payment. 
It is Group policy that payments to suppliers are 
made in accordance with the agreed terms.  
At 30 December 2011, the Group had an  
average of 70 days purchases outstanding  
in trade creditors.

Since the date of disclosure to the Company, the interest of any 
shareholder listed above may have increased or decreased. No 
requirement to notify the Company of any increase or decrease 
would have arisen unless the holding moved up or down through

or other arrangements which are essential to the business of  
the Company. 
Employment policy and involvement
The average number of employees in the Group during the 
period is given in note 4 to the Group financial statements  
on page 87.
Group companies operate within a framework of HR policies,

recruitment, training and career development promote equality  
of opportunity regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, 
marital status, disability, race, religion or other beliefs and  
ethnic or national origin. 
The aim is to encourage a culture in which all employees  
have the opportunity to develop fully according to their  
individual abilities and the needs of the Group. The Group 
remains committed to the fair treatment of people with  
disabilities regarding applications, training, promotion  
and career development.
Employee involvement and feedback is actively encouraged. 
A variety of ways are used to consult and inform employees

briefings. These are designed to facilitate dialogue while  
enabling the development of a common awareness among 
employees of what affects business performance.

additional placing of fixed rate private placement notes to the 
value of US$1bn in February 2012. As a result, the Company  
is now party to various note purchase agreements with  
a range of maturities; US$90m at an interest rate of 4.2%

or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy 
or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.

We have audited the Group financial statements of The Weir 
Group PLC for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 which 
comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 33. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”). Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our  
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors & auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors statement of responsibilities 
set out on page 43, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free  
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have  
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements  
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
30 December 2011 and of its profit for the 52 weeks then ended;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union; and 
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
the 2006 Act and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 2006 Act
In our opinion the information given in the Directors report for  
the financial year for which the Group financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the 2006 Act we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or
•  we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•  the directors’ statement, set out on page 43, in relation to  
going concern; and
•  the part of the Corporate governance report relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
•  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board  
on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Company financial statements 
of The Weir Group PLC for the 52 weeks to 30 December 2011 
and on the information in the Remuneration Report that is 
described as having been audited.

Notes to the  
Group Financial Statements
1. Authorisation of financial statements & statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, the “Group”) for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 
(“2011”) were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 29 February 2012. The comparative information is presented for the  
52 weeks ended 31 December 2010 (“2010”). For practical reasons, the Group prepares its financial statements to the week ending closest to the Company reference date 
of 31 December. The results on this basis are unlikely to be materially different from those that would be presented for a period of one year. The Weir Group PLC is a limited 
company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are presented in sterling. All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds (£m) except when otherwise indicated. 
In order to provide the users of the financial statements with a more relevant presentation of the Group’s underlying performance, profit for each financial year has been  
analysed between:
i)  profit before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation; and 
ii)  the effect of exceptional items and intangibles amortisation.
  a)   Exceptional items are items of income and expense which, because of the nature, size and / or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate 
presentation to allow a better understanding of the elements of the Group’s financial performance for the period and are presented on the face of the income statement 
to facilitate comparisons with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance. Exceptional items include the movement on contingent consideration 
which, due to its nature, is separately disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement.
  b) Intangibles amortisation, including impairment, has been shown separately to provide increased visibility over the impact of increased acquisition activity on intangible assets.
Further analysis of the items included in the column “Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation” is provided in note 5 to the financial statements. 
During the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011, the provisional fair values attributed to the 2010 acquisitions were finalised. In accordance with IFRS3, the net impact 
of the adjustments to the provisional fair values has been recognised by means of a decrease to goodwill and the adjustments to the provisional amounts have been 
recognised as if the accounting for the business combinations had been completed at the relevant acquisition dates. As such, all affected balances and amounts  
have been restated in the financial statements. To this effect, the Consolidated Balance Sheet and affected notes present restated comparative information for the  
52 weeks ended 31 December 2010. There was no material impact on the Consolidated Income Statement for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010.  
Further details of the adjustments made to the provisional fair values can be found in note 13.
The accounting policies which follow are consistent with those of the previous periods except as described below. 
The following standards and interpretations have been adopted in these financial statements and have not had a material impact on the Group’s financial statements in the 
period of initial application.
IAS24 Related Party Disclosures (Revised).
IAS32 Classification of Rights Issues (amendment to IAS32 Financial Instruments: Presentation).
Improvements to IFRS (issued 2010).

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Use of estimates & judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised  
and in any future periods affected.
Details of the significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements are described in the Financial review on page 29.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC and its subsidiaries, and the Group’s share of its joint 
ventures results. The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies. 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so 
as to obtain benefit from its activities. The results of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the Group’s results from the effective date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. The results of a subsidiary sold during the period are included in the Group’s results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of 
the Group. All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented within equity in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from the Company shareholders equity.
Joint ventures
The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures. These all take the form of agreements to share control over 
other entities (“jointly controlled entities”). The Group’s interests in the results and assets and liabilities of its jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method. 
These investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets less any impairment in value. The income 
statement reflects the share of results of operations of these investments after tax. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investee’s equity, the Group 
recognises its share of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Group’s share of the net fair value of the joint 
venture’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the joint venture and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value 
of the joint venture’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Group’s share of 
the joint venture’s profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency. The functional currency is the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which an entity operates. 
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entity’s functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences 
are recognised in the income statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Group’s net 
investment in a foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in  
profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into 
sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a 
foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve. 
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is determined after taking into account the 
cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation. As permitted by IFRS1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation 
differences to be £nil as at 27 December 2003. Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising  
before 27 December 2003. 
In the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the cash flows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow 
to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is shown net of sales taxes, discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from sales of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods, 
and can be reliably measured. Revenue from the sales of services and revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion where the 
outcome can be estimated reliably, otherwise it is recognised to the extent costs are incurred. The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the 
proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the 
contract work. The basis used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of the work is 
subject to formal customer acceptance procedures. Losses on contracts are recognised in the period when such losses become probable. 
Property, plant & equipment 
The Group elected to use previous UK GAAP revaluations of land and buildings, amounting to £10.5m, prior to 27 December 2003 as deemed cost at the date of  
the revaluation.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. Cost includes borrowing costs for qualifying assets 
for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009. Prior to this date, the Group recognised all borrowing costs as an expense immediately. 
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated. 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost  
less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, which is in the 
following ranges: 
Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings - 10 - 40 years 
Short leasehold land & buildings - duration of lease 
Plant & equipment - 3 - 20 years 
Investment property
Until December 2011, the Group owned one property which was classified as investment property on the basis that it was being held to earn rentals and for capital 
appreciation rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services. This property was sold in December 2011. Investment property was stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation was provided on a straight-line basis over 40 years. 
Goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the entity’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition. Acquisition costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.  
Goodwill in respect of an acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any  
recognised impairment losses. 
Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entity’s assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately  
as a gain in the income statement. 
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 27 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount at that date and is not amortised. The carrying amount of goodwill allocated  
to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit. Goodwill that was written-off directly to reserves under UK GAAP  
is not taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after 27 December 2003.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred is recognised at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration, which is deemed 
to be an asset or a liability, will be recognised in accordance with IAS39 in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. In respect of business combinations 
prior to 1 January 2010, subsequent adjustments to contingent consideration will be recognised as part of goodwill. 80 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost on initial recognition. An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible 
asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be 
measured reliably. An intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which in respect of an acquired intangible asset represents 
its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life. An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least 
annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line 
basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life, not exceeding eight years.
The expected useful lives of the acquired intangible assets are as follows:
Brand names - indefinite life
Customer relationships -  5 - 25 years
Purchased software - 4 - 8 years
Intellectual property & trade marks - 6 -15 years
Other  - up to 6 years
Research & development costs 
All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. 
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new product and it is incurred after 
the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benefits are probable and 
the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset. Any such capitalised development expenditure will be amortised 
on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product. 
Impairment of non-current assets 
All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired. Additionally, goodwill, intangible 
assets with an indefinite life and any capitalised development expenditure are subject to an annual impairment test. 
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs 
to sell and its value in use. An asset’s value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where it is not possible to 
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. Similarly, the recoverable amount  
of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash flows of the cash-generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount. The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items. Cost represents the expenditure incurred in 
bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads. 
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. 
Financial assets & liabilities
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and fixed rate notes, cash and short-term 
deposits. The Group also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations. 
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised 
in profit or loss.

2. Accounting policies (continued)
Trade receivables
Trade receivables, which generally are of a short dated nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is 
assessed as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three 
months or less and bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities  
to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount. 
Interest-bearing loans & borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly  
attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities  
unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably  
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the  
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate 
movements. The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries. Additionally,  
the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency 
contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps and 
cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates. Changes in their 
fair values have been recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS39 are met. Hedge accounting  
is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS39 and practical to do so. When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging 
relationships will be classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair 
value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset 
by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than in the income statement. When the hedged item is recognised in the financial 
statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results  
in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, 
any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is kept in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction 
occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to net profit or  
loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely  
related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.  82 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements
2. Accounting policies (continued)
Share-based payments
Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and as a consequence of occasional one-off 
conditional awards made to senior executives. The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards. The fair value 
is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified. The fair value at the date of 
the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect 
expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or performance conditions. 
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has applied IFRS2 “Share-based Payment” retrospectively only to equity settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 
and had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares
The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale of 
such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves. No gain or loss  
is recognised in total comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Post-employment benefits 
Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to employees throughout the world and other benefits, primarily post-retirement healthcare, provided to 
certain employees in the United States. 
For defined benefit plans, the cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating 
employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries. Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, or immediately if the benefits have vested. Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and 
the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. 
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount  
rate based on appropriate high quality corporate bonds, at the balance sheet date, minus any past service costs not yet recognised, minus the fair value of the plan assets,  
if any, at the balance sheet date. Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of 
any amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions. 
For defined contribution plans, the costs represent the Group’s contributions to the plans and these are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due. 
Leases 
Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified  
as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease 
payments and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases. Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar 
owned assets or the lease term if shorter. At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to  
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability. Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the income statement while  
the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability. 
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Taxation 
Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period. 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions:
i)     Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised;
ii)    Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future;
iii)   A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods 
in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits. Deferred tax is measured on an 
undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the  
deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.

3. Segment information        
For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Power & Industrial. These three divisions are organised and 
managed separately based on the key markets served and each is treated as an operating segment and a reportable segment under IFRS8. The operating and reportable 
segments were determined based on the reports reviewed by the Chief Executive which are used to make operational decisions.
The Minerals segment designs and manufactures pumps, hydrocyclones, valves and other complementary equipment for the mining, flue gas desulphurisation and oil sands 
markets. The Oil & Gas segment manufactures pumps and ancillary equipment and provides aftermarket support for the global upstream and downstream oil and gas 
markets. The Power & Industrial segment designs, manufactures and provides aftermarket support for rotating and flow control equipment to the global power generation 
and industrial sectors. All other segments, which are disclosed as Group companies, include the results of Liquid Gas Equipment which supplies equipment to the liquefied 
petroleum gas marine and onshore markets.
The Chief Executive assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles 
amortisation, including impairment (“segment result”). Finance income and expenditure and associated interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments are 
not allocated to segments as all treasury activity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function. The amounts provided to the Chief Executive with respect to assets 
and liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements. The assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical 
location of the asset. The liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

8. Discontinued operations
There were no disposals of businesses during the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 or the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010. 
In December 2011, the Group disposed of the former Weir Pumps site at Cathcart to SPX Clyde UK Limited for cash proceeds of £25.0m resulting in a net gain of £19.9m  
(net of tax of £nil) after taking account of disposal costs and other costs arising from discontinued operations. Since the property was used by the Weir Pumps business, 
which was sold in 2007, the net gain is shown as a profit from discontinued operations.
In December 2010, the Group pleaded guilty to two charges of breaching UN sanctions in connection with a number of Oil for Food programme contracts awarded between 
2000 and 2002. This resulted in a confiscation order of £13.9m and a fine of £3.0m. Since the business involved was sold in 2007, these costs, along with £1.7m of related 
legal and professional fees, offset by the release of £5.0m of provision and accruals, were shown as a loss from discontinued operations. 
Earnings (losses) per share from discontinued operations were as follows.
          2011 2010 
          pence pence
Basic          9.4 (6.5)
Diluted          9.3 (6.4)
These earnings (losses) per share figures were derived by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company from discontinued operations of £19.9m  
(2010: loss of £13.6m) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares for both basic and diluted amounts shown in note 9.
9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company  
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period (adjusted for the effects of dilutive share awards). 
The following reflects the profit and share data used in the calculation of earnings per share.

issue. The final dividend may differ due to increases or decreases in the number of shares in issue between the date of approval of the report and financial statements and 
the record date for the final dividend.

In December 2011, the Group disposed of the former Weir Pumps site at Cathcart, which has been treated as an investment property since the disposal of the  
Weir Pumps business in 2007, to SPX Clyde UK Limited. Up to the date of disposal, rental income was generated from Clyde Union Ltd. The rental income included  
in the income statement amounts to £2.3m (2010: £2.3m).          
The impairment charge of £0.4m relates to specific assets in one location which are unable to be transferred to that operation’s new location. In 2010 the impairment  
charge of £0.2m related to specific assets in a number of locations across the Group where associated product lines had been changed or updated to reflect changing 
market conditions. 94 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements

The increase to goodwill of £402.1m during 2011 is represented by current year acquisitions goodwill of £403.2m (note 13) offset by a £1.1m reduction to goodwill following 
settlement of the final deferred consideration payment in respect of Weir SOS. This has been treated as an adjustment to goodwill on the basis that the acquisition occurred 
before IFRS3 (Revised) was adopted by the Group.        
Brand names have been assigned an indefinite useful life and as such are not amortised. The carrying value of £140.7m (2010: £141.3m) is tested annually for impairment 
(note 14). The brand name value comprises the brands of Weir Linatex, Weir BDK, Weir American Hydro, Weir Warman, Weir SPM, Weir Gabbioneta, Weir Mesa and Weir 
Multiflo, all of which were recognised at fair value at their respective dates of acquisition. Weir Warman has a long history in the minerals and mining market and is considered 
to be a market leader. Weir SPM and Weir Gabbioneta brands both have long histories in the oil and gas markets where they are both considered to be market leaders.  
The Weir Linatex brand enjoys strong recognition within the mining and sand and aggregates markets globally.

13. Business combinations
On 1 July 2011, the Group acquired a majority interest in the South Korean valves business formerly operated by HIM Tech Co Ltd. The Group acquired 60% of the voting 
shares of a new Korean company, Weir International Co. Ltd (“Weir International”), into which the HIM Tech valves business has been transferred. Located in Ansan, near 
Seoul, the business designs and manufactures control and choke valves for severe service power generation and oil and gas applications. The acquisition was structured as 
an initial 60% purchase including an earn out based on EBITDA achieved in 2013 and 2014. The remaining 40% is subject to put and call options exercisable between 2014 
and 2019 and based upon an EBITDA multiple of profits in the two years preceding the exercise of the option. The cash consideration paid was £9.8m and the estimated 
fair value of the contingent consideration is £14.0m. This is based on an assessment of the probability of possible outcomes discounted to net present value. The range of 
possible outcomes on an undiscounted basis is between zero and £33.4m. Costs associated with the acquisition amounting to £0.5m have been charged to the income 
statement in the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011. 
On 14 December 2011, the Group finalised the acquisition of 100% of the voting shares of Seaboard Holdings Inc. (“Weir Seaboard”), an independent wellhead solutions 
provider focused on the growing North American unconventional oil and gas drilling and production markets, based in Houston, Texas, for a total cash consideration 
of £432.1m. In addition, an amount of £9.1m has been recognised in respect of contingent consideration relating to tax refunds. Costs associated with the acquisition 
amounting to £5.1m have been charged to the income statement in the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011. 
The fair values on acquisition of these business combinations are provisional due to the timing of the transactions and will be finalised during the following financial year. No 
allocation has been made in the determination of the provisional fair values from goodwill to identifiable intangible assets. External advisers are assisting with this allocation, the 
process has commenced and initial draft reports are due in April 2012. This allocation will be finalised along with all other fair values in the next financial year. There will be certain 
intangible assets included in the £403.2m of goodwill recognised that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature. These items 
include anticipated business growth, synergies and an assembled workforce. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The provisional fair value of the 
trade receivables amounts to £41.2m. The gross amount of trade receivables is £43.3m.

The contribution from Weir Seaboard and Weir International since their respective dates of acquisition to the 2011 revenue of the Group and 2011 profit for the period  
from continuing operations of the Group is deemed to be immaterial. The combined continuing operations revenue and profit for the period from continuing operations  
of the Group, assuming that Weir Seaboard and Weir International had been acquired at the start of 2011, would have been £2,425.4m and £277.5m respectively. 96 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements
13. Business combinations (continued)
During the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010, the Group acquired five businesses of which Linatex was the most significant. The other acquisitions were Petroleum 
Certification Services (PCS), the valves business of BDK Engineering Industries Limited, American Hydro Corporation and Ynfiniti Engineering Services SL (YES).
The YES acquisition was structured as an initial 76% purchase with the remaining 24% being subject to a put and call option exercisable between 2014 and 2016 and based 
upon an EBITDA multiple of profits in the two years preceding the exercise of the option. The contingent consideration recognised at the acquisition date was estimated 
at £12.0m (m14m) based on an assessment undertaken shortly after the acquisition date of the probability of the possible outcomes discounted to net present value. In 
conjunction with the finalisation of the provisional fair values, the contingent consideration payable has been reduced to £1.7m.
In the 2010 annual report and accounts, the fair values on acquisition of the above businesses were provisional, with the exception of PCS, due to the timing of the 
transactions. The fair values have been finalised in 2011 resulting in adjustments to the provisional fair values attributed. The following table summarises the adjustments 
made to the provisional fair values during the measurement period.

14. Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives
Goodwill acquired through business combinations and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination.         
The current year acquisition of Weir Seaboard has been determined to be a separate CGU and Weir International has been allocated to “Other”. The previous year 
acquisitions have been allocated to “Other” with the exception of Linatex which has been allocated to the “Warman companies” CGU. The amounts allocated as “Other”  
are not considered significant in comparison to their respective total carrying amounts.
The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives has been allocated as per the table below.

Discount rate        
The discount rates presented above reflect the pre-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in the most appropriate geographic region. The WACC is the 
weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance. In the main there has been a decrease in the WACC relative to 2010 in  
mature economies largely due to a reduction in government bond yields being only partially offset by an increase in credit spreads. The increase in credit spreads in  
emerging economies has been compounded by an increase in government bond yields on 2010 levels. The WACC in relation to Weir Gabbioneta has increased  
significantly on 2010, driven by the increase in Italian government bond yields.  
2 
Real growth        
Real growth beyond the five year forecast period of 1.2%, for all businesses except South Africa where a rate of 4.0% is used, reflects the increasingly global nature  
of these businesses and the fact that they sell a significant proportion of their products to emerging markets which have long-term stronger growth prospects than their  
home markets.
3 
EBIT margins
EBIT margins have been forecast based on historic levels taking cognisance of the likely impact of changing economic environments and competitive landscapes on  
volumes and revenues and the impact of associated management actions on costs.

Weir Seaboard         
Weir Seaboard is a wellhead solutions provider focused on the growing North American unconventional oil and gas drilling and production markets. Demand for Weir 
Seaboard’s products and services is closely related to the number of conventional and unconventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs which is in turn dependent  
upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels. Independent forecasts of North American oil and gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast oil and  
natural gas prices and storage levels, have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2011. 98 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements

Weir SPM         
Weir SPM is a supplier of oil and gas well service pumps, associated flow control equipment and services to the oil and gas production industry. A large proportion of the 
business’s revenues are generated in North America with demand being closely related to the number of conventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs in operation which is 
in turn dependent  upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels. Independent forecasts of North American oil and gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast oil 
and natural gas prices  and storage levels, have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2011.
6 
Warman companies        
The Warman companies supply pumps and associated equipment and services to all global markets. The key drivers for revenues are (i) levels of mining capital expenditure 
which drives demand for original equipment and (ii) levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service. Independent forecasts of mining capital 
expenditure and activity have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2011.
7 
Weir Gabbioneta      
Weir Gabbioneta is a supplier of heavy duty process applications to oil and gas refinery, petro-chemical and power generation industries. The key drivers for revenues 
are capital expenditure within oil refinery and petro-chemical industries. Independent forecasts of expenditure in these sectors have been used to derive revenue growth 
assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2011.
Sensitivity analysis      
Base case forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value for each of the CGUs with the exception of Weir Gabbioneta. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for 
each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonable possible changes in key assumptions. Other than in relation to Weir Gabbioneta, there is no reasonably possible change that 
would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts. With regard to Weir Gabbioneta, downside sensitivities have been assessed and, although headroom exists 
between the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and their value in use, this headroom is much reduced. As at 30 December 2011, the 
headroom is £10.2m. The main drivers for this are the increased competition in the markets the business operates in and an increase of over 300 basis points in the discount  
rate applied when compared to 2010, the latter being driven by macro-economic conditions in the Eurozone. The headroom existing in the base case would be eliminated with 
the CGU at breakeven if the discount rate were to increase by a further 150 basis points or if operating cashflows in year 1 of the forecast period were to reduce by 40%.

US$ LIBOR is the United States dollar London Inter Bank Offer Rate. BoE base rate is the Bank of England base rate. The weighted average interest rates include an 
applicable margin over and above the interest basis. The disclosures above represent the interest profile and currency profile of financial liabilities before the impact of 
derivative financial instruments. All bank loans and fixed rate notes are unsecured and rank pari passu. 
As part of the acquisition of Weir Seaboard the Group entered into two bank loans. Firstly a US$300m term loan, amortising in equal instalments semi-annually to  
22 September 2014. Secondly a US$380m bridging loan repayable at the earlier of 23 May 2013 or 7 days after a Debt Capital Markets issue. As at 30 December 2011 both 
these facilities were fully drawn. These new facilities are in addition to the Group’s existing US$800m multi-currency revolving credit facility which was entered into in 2010.  
As at 30 December 2011, £163.0m was drawn under the revolving credit facility. On 16 February 2012, the Group issued US dollar denominated fixed rate notes via a  
Private Placement to US investors totalling US$1bn. The notes were US$210m of seven year, US$590m of ten year and US$200m of eleven year notes. The average  
coupon payable is 4.16%. Following this issue, the Group repaid in full the US$380m bridging loan. 102 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements

Warranties & onerous sales contracts        
Provision has been made in respect of actual warranty and contract penalty claims on goods sold and services provided and for potential  warranty claims based on past experience 
for goods and services sold with a warranty guarantee. Provision has also been made in respect of sales contracts entered into for the sale of goods in the normal course of 
business where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contracts. Provision is 
made immediately  when it becomes apparent that expected costs will exceed the expected benefits of the contract. It is expected that all costs will have been incurred within 
five years of the balance sheet date.
Employee related      
Employee related provisions arise from legal obligations and asbestosis claims and are based on management’s best estimate of the likely costs. It is expected that  the costs 
will be incurred in the period up to 2021. 
Discontinued operations warranty & indemnity      
Provisions in respect of discontinued operations include provision for warranty and indemnity exposures under asset and share sale agreements. The provision as at 30 
December 2011 is based on management’s current best estimate of the remaining liabilities. The actual outcome may differ and, in some cases, this may be dependent on 
the outcome of legal proceedings. It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within two years of the balance sheet date with the remaining costs expected 
to be incurred within five years of the balance sheet date. 
Other 
Other provisions relate to an environmental clean up programme in the United States for a company acquired in 1992, restructuring costs and various other legal claims and 
exposures across the Group. The environmental provision is based on management’s current best estimate of the expected costs under the programme. It is expected that 
these costs will be incurred in the period up to 2019.

Untaxed reserves primarily relate to temporarily disallowed inventory / debtor provisions and accruals / provisions for liabilities where the tax allowance is deferred until the 
cash expense occurs.
Deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of £1.6m (2010: £1.9m) have not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence that these assets  
will be recoverable. These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax benefits. Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the 
UK amounting to £10.7m (2010: £11.6m) have not been recognised but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
Temporary differences associated with Group investments        
A deferred tax liability of £27.1m (2010: £21.7m) has been recognised in respect of taxes on the unremitted earnings of the South American and Canadian subsidiaries.  
As at 30 December 2011, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group does not foresee a distribution of 
unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal of deferred tax. The temporary differences associated with investments  
in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to £1,095.0m (2010: £820.9m).
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement. The Finance Act 2011 enacted legislation to reduce the UK 
corporate rate of taxation from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012. Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by the financial year 
beginning 1 April 2014. These further changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in the consolidated results for the 
52 weeks ended to 30 December 2011. We expect that these reductions will not have a material effect on the effective tax rate or on the profit for the year in future periods. 104 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements
24. Pensions & other post-employment benefit plans
The Group has five defined benefit pension plans in the UK and North America. All defined benefit plans are closed to new members. The most significant of the defined 
benefit plans are the two UK plans. Contribution salary in respect of the Group’s main UK plan is capped and will increase in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5% per annum 
and the United States plans are frozen. The Group also provides certain additional post-retirement healthcare benefits to senior employees in the United States. These 
benefits are unfunded. The assets and liabilities of the plans are as follows.

Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit method. The Group made 
contributions of £6.6m in 2011 (2010: £9.3m) in addition to the employers regular contributions. The total contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2012 are expected 
to be £9.5m. Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published 
brokers forecasts to each category of plan assets and allowing for plan expenses.

The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity. The “current” disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity (in years) 
following retirement at the balance sheet date, with “future” being that relating to an employee retiring in 2041 (in 30 years time).
The assumed investment return and discount rate have a significant effect on the reported retirement benefit obligation and the income statement expense for 2012.  
The effect of a one percentage point change in those assumptions is set out in the table below.

The defined benefit obligations comprise £8.4m (2010: £8.4m) arising from unfunded plans and £682.5m (2010: £651.4m) from plans that are wholly or partially funded. 
The past service gain of £19.0m has arisen as a result of a decision by the Trustees of The Weir Group Pension and Retirement Saving Scheme that, following the Government’s 
recent change in legislation, certain elements of pension will now increase in line with Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rather than the Retail Prices Index (RPI). This decision was 
announced to the members of the scheme in July 2011. The past service gain has been recognised as an exceptional item in the Consolidated Income Statement.

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income since 28 December 2003 is a loss of £95.0m (2010: £50.0m).
The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan deficits are attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans. 
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised on an IFRS basis in other comprehensive 
income before 27 December 2003. 108 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements

LTIP
There are three types of award which may be made under the LTIP to senior executives: performance shares, matching shares and investment shares. Details of each award 
are outlined in the Remuneration report on pages 44 to 53.    
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average share prices (WASP) of shares awarded under the LTIP.

An amount of £4.9m (2010: £3.0m) has been charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of the number of awards which are expected to be made at the 
end of the vesting period. This comprises an amount of £1.4m (2010: £1.0m) in respect of parent company employees and £3.5m (2010: £2.0m) in respect of employees 
of subsidiaries the latter including an amount of £0.1m in respect of a one-off conditional award made to a senior executive. Certain subsidiary companies made a cash 
contribution to the parent company of £2.0m (2010: £1.2m) in the period in respect of their employees LTIP awards.
The remaining contractual lives of the outstanding LTIP awards at the end of the period are as follows.

Fair value of equity settled share-based payments        
The fair value of the conditional awards under the LTIP have been estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table gives the assumptions made during 
the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 and the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010.  
      
          2011 2010

The expected life of the awards is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the   
assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. Market related performance conditions have  
been taken into account in the calculation of fair values. 112 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements

30. Financial assets & liabilities
Financial risk management objectives & policies 
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, liquidity and credit risk. Foreign currency transactional risk arises when 
operating subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. Translational risk arises on the translation of overseas earnings 
and investments into sterling for consolidated reporting purposes. Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract and 
liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due. In addition, the Group is subject to a degree of interest rate risk on its borrowings. 
The Group uses financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks as set out below.
Foreign exchange risk policy
Foreign currency transactional and translational risk could result in volatility in reported consolidated earnings and net assets.
In respect of transactional foreign currency risk, the Group maintains a policy that all operating units eliminate exposures on material committed transactions, usually by 
undertaking forward foreign currency contracts through the Group’s treasury function. In addition, it is Group policy that those companies where the most significant 
concentration of foreign exchange risk has been identified also apply hedge accounting in accordance with IAS39. Therefore, some of the Group’s forward foreign currency 
contracts form part of an effective cash flow hedge. Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the forward foreign currency contracts which form part of a cash flow hedge will 
have an impact on shareholders equity. Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the other forward foreign currency contracts will have an impact on profit or loss. It is Group 
policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind.
In respect of translational risk, the Group has a policy to partially hedge United States dollar (US$) net assets exposure. This is achieved through designating an element of 
US dollar borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps as net investment hedges against the Group’s US dollar investments. The Group does 
not hedge the translational exposure arising from profit and loss items.
Liquidity risk policy
Liquidity risk could impact negatively on the Group’s reputation, borrowing costs or ultimately its ability to continue as a going concern. Liquidity risk is managed by 
monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and ensuring that sufficient committed facilities are in place to meet possible downside scenarios. The Group’s objective is to 
maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans and fixed rate notes. Further details of the Group’s borrowing 
facilities are disclosed in note 20.
Credit risk policy
Credit risk could have a negative impact on reported earnings and cash and consequently the liquidity of the Group.
The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments. The Group’s credit risk is primarily 
attributable to its trade receivables with risk spread over a large number of countries and customers, with no significant concentration of risk. Where appropriate, the Group 
endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. Credit worthiness checks are also undertaken with external 
credit rating agencies before entering into contracts with new customers and credit limits are set as appropriate and adhered to. As shown in note 17, the trade receivables 
presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful debts. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identifiable loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. The Group’s exposure to the credit risk of financial institutions is limited by the adherence 
to counterparty limits and by only trading with counterparties that have a strong credit standing based upon ratings provided by the major agencies.
Interest rate risk policy
The Group’s borrowings are in a combination of fixed and variable rates of interest. Interest rate risk is regularly monitored to ensure that the mix of variable and fixed  
rate borrowing is appropriate for the Group in the short to medium-term. On 23 November 2011, the Group entered into a new 3 year term loan of US$300m and a new  
18 month US$380m bridging loan. This reduced the proportion of fixed rate borrowings from 44% as at 31 December 2010 to 20% as at 30 December 2011.
On 16 February 2012, the Group issued US$1bn of fixed rate notes to the US private placement market with maturities of seven years (US$210.0m), ten years (US$590.0m) 
and eleven years (US$200.0m). On receipt of these funds, the Group repaid the US$380.0m bridging loan and reduced the proportion of floating rate borrowings.  
This matured when the notes were issued. 
Net investment in foreign operations
As at 30 December 2011, US dollar fixed rate notes of US$160.0m (2010: US$160.0m) and US dollar variable rate loans of US$926.5m (2010: US$322.5m), both included  
in interest-bearing loans and borrowings, cross currency swaps of US$254.0m (2010: US$334.0m) and net forward foreign currency liability contracts of US$48.0m  
(2010: US$48.0m) have been designated as a hedge of the Group’s exposure to translational foreign exchange risk on its net investments in Weir SPM, Weir Warman  
and Weir Seaboard. Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings and the fair value of the cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are 
transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in these subsidiaries. 114 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements

The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The derivative financial 
instruments are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs including spot and forward foreign exchange rates and interest rate curves. The fair value of cross 
currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates. The fair value of forward 
foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates.  
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:  
  Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
  Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly;  
  Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. 
At 30 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, the Group held all financial instruments at level 2 fair value measurement. During the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 
and the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into and out of level 3 fair  
value measurements. 
The fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximate their carrying amount due to the short-term maturities 
of these instruments. The fair value of borrowings and obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt 
on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

intervals of less than one year. The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject  
to interest rate risk.  120 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements

30. Financial assets & liabilities (continued)
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before  
tax and equity through the impact on floating rate borrowings and cross currency swaps in respect of each currency to which the Group has a significant exposure  
to interest rate risk.

A decrease of 100 basis points would have an equal and opposite effect.
Effect of hedging & derivative financial instruments included in the income statement & equity
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge currency risk associated with expected future sales or purchases for which the Group has firm commitments. 
The terms of the forward foreign currency contracts are negotiated to match the terms of the commitments. Within the Group, two subsidiaries apply cash flow hedge 
accounting to these transactions. Any gains and losses on ineffective hedges were taken to the income statement in the period. All other forward foreign currency contracts, 
while representing commercial hedges, are not subject to cash flow hedge accounting with all fair value movements being recognised in the income statement. 
The net carrying amount, maturity dates and the amounts recognised for the period in profit or loss and equity for each derivative financial instrument are set out below.

       (38.6)   0.4 (11.5)
The £0.2m gain (2010: £0.1m) recognised in profit or loss in respect of cross currency swaps designated as net investment hedges reflects the benefit of US dollar / sterling 
interest rate differential. The Group’s forward foreign currency contracts subject to cash flow hedge accounting which were deemed to be ineffective during the period 
resulted in a net charge to the income statement of £nil (2010: £0.3m). The interest rate swaps which were used by the Group to convert borrowings from floating to fixed 
rates of interest matured during 2010. In 2010 there was no ineffectiveness in relation to the Group’s interest rate swaps. 121

Foreign exchange risk 
The Group considers the most significant foreign exchange risk relates to the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro and United States dollar. The following table 
demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in these foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity analysis shows  
the effect on profit or loss in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including payables, receivables, borrowings and forward foreign 
currency contracts but excluding all financial assets and liabilities qualified as either cash flow or net investment hedges. The sensitivity analysis also shows the effect on 
equity in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency qualified as either cash flow or net investment hedges including forward foreign currency 
contracts, borrowings and cross currency swaps. The sensitivity analysis adjusts the translation of each respective financial asset or liability at the financial year end for a  
25% strengthening of sterling against the relevant exchange rates.

31. Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains robust capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value. 
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may 
adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group monitors capital using the following indicators.
Gearing ratio 
Gearing comprises net debt divided by total equity. Net debt comprises cash and short-term deposits and interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 26).
          2011 2010

The Group’s banking arrangements also require the calculation of net debt to EBITDA and interest cover as part of the bi-annual financial covenant certifications. For the 
purposes of the covenants required by the Group’s lenders, the net debt is to be converted at the exchange rate used in the preparation of the Group’s income statement 
and cash flows, ie. average rate. In addition, profits of businesses acquired in the financial year have to be included as if the acquisitions occurred at the start of the financial 
year. The covenant calculations for the purposes of the Group’s lenders are shown below.

33. Events after the balance sheet date
On 22 February 2012, the Group completed the acquisition of Novatech LLC for an equivalent enterprise value of US$176m (£112m).
On 16 February 2012, the Group issued US$1bn of senior unsecured fixed rate notes through a private placement to US investors with maturities of 7, 10 and 11 years  
and an average interest rate of 4.16%. The proceeds were used to repay the US$380m bridging loan taken out to fund the Seaboard acquisition, to fund the acquisition  
of Novatech and repay other borrowing facilities.
No further disclosures have been provided under IFRS3 in respect of business combinations after the balance sheet date on the basis that the initial accounting is not  
yet complete.         124 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements
Independent auditors report to the members of The Weir 
Group PLC
We have audited the Company financial statements of The Weir 
Group PLC for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 which 
comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related notes  
1 to 17. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (UK GAAP).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”). Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for  
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we  
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors & auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors statement of responsibilities 
set out on page 43, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Company financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the Company financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Company financial statements:
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs  
as at 30 December 2011;
•  have been properly prepared in accordance with UK GAAP; and
•  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
2006 Act.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 2006 Act
In our opinion:
•  the part of the Remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the 2006 Act; and
•  the information given in the Directors report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the 2006 Act requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been

Notes to the  
Company Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies
The accounting policies which follow have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Basis of preparation 
The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and applicable accounting standards.
Foreign currency translation
The presentation and functional currency of the Company is sterling. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the Company’s functional currency  
at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on  
the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences are recognised in the profit and loss account except when hedge accounting is applied.
Tangible assets 
Tangible assets are stated at cost and the cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life by equal annual instalments at rates of 7.5% for office equipment and 25%  
for computer equipment.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are held at historical cost less a provision for impairment.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that 
date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the exception that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that  
the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Post-employment benefits 
The Company and other UK subsidiaries of the Group participate in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans which are set up under separate trusts. These plans are 
operated on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities and, in accordance with FRS17, the Company 
accounts for its contributions to the plans as if they are defined contribution plans.
In addition, the Company has unfunded unapproved pension promises. Contributions are made to the plans on the advice of an independent qualified actuary. Pension plan 
liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the 
liability. Any increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Company’s unfunded unapproved pension promises expected to arise from employee service in the period 
is charged against operating profit. The increase in the period in the present value of the plan’s liabilities, arising from the passage of time, is included in other finance costs. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account when they become payable.
Leases
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Share-based payments
Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The Company recognises a compensation cost in 
respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards. The fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions 
on which the award was granted are modified. The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions 
or performance conditions.
As permitted by FRS20, the Company has applied FRS20 “Share-based Payment” retrospectively only to equity-settled awards that had not vested as at 1 January 2005 
and were granted on or after 7 November 2002.
Financial assets & liabilities
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and fixed rate notes, cash and  
short-term deposits.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. 127
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.  
Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading 
purposes. Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign 
currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates. The fair value of interest rate 
swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates. 
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the profit and loss account, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by FRS26  
are met. Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under FRS26 and practical to do so. When hedge accounting is used,  
the relevant hedging relationships will be classified as a cash flow hedge. 
To the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the profit and loss account. 
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the profit and loss account 
or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, 
any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS29 and has not disclosed information required by that standard in relation to derivative financial instruments  
as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS7.
Treasury shares
The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for the sale of 
such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves. No gain or loss  
is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
2. Profit attributable to the Company
The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £11.6m (2010: £94.3m). In accordance with the concession granted under section 408 of the Companies Act 
2006, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been separately presented in these financial statements.

The proposed dividend is based on the number of shares in issue, excluding treasury shares, at the date the financial statements were approved and authorised for issue. 
The final dividend may differ due to increases or decreases in the number of shares in issue between the date of approval of the report and financial statements and the 
record date for the final dividend.        
Directors        
Details of directors remuneration, benefits and LTIP awards are included in the Remuneration report on pages 44 to 53.
Auditors remuneration        
The total fees payable by the Company to Ernst & Young LLP for work performed in respect of the audit of the Company were £13,000 (2010: £13,000). Fees paid to Ernst 
& Young LLP for non-audit services to the Company itself are not disclosed in these accounts as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is 
included, are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.         128 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements

Subsidiaries        
As at 30 December 2011, a provision of £1.3m (2010: £5.1m) has been made against the deficiency of underlying net assets in certain subsidiaries. It is expected that this 
amount will be settled within one year of the balance sheet date.        
Discontinued operations warranty & indemnity        
Provisions in respect of discontinued operations include provision for warranty and indemnity exposures under asset and share agreements. The provision as at 30 
December 2011 is based on management’s current best estimate of the remaining liabilities. The actual outcome may differ, and in some cases, this will be dependent  
on the outcome of legal proceedings. It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within two years of the balance sheet date.  130 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements

The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity. The “current” disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity (in years) 
following retirement at the balance sheet date, with “future” being that relating to an employee retiring in 2041 (in 30 years time).

In addition, the Company also participates in the defined benefit plan arrangements within The Weir Group Pension & Retirement Savings Scheme and The Weir Group  
1972 Pensions and Life Assurance Plan for Senior Executives. These defined benefits plans are funded multi-employer plans which are operated by The Weir Group PLC  
and which are run on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities. In accordance with FRS17,  
the Company accounts for its contributions to these plans as if they were defined contribution plans. While assets and liabilities in respect of these plans are not  
reflected on the Company’s balance sheet, details of these are set out below.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit method.  
The total contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2012 are expected to be £8.0m.
Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers 
forecasts to each category of plan assets and allowing for plan expenses. The actual return on plan assets in the period was a gain of £31.7m (2010: £56.5m).
The assets and liabilities of the plans and the long-term expected rates of return are as follows.

The past service gain of £19.0m has arisen as a result of a decision by the Trustees of The Weir Group Pension and Retirement Saving Scheme that, following the Government’s 
recent change in legislation, certain elements of pension will now increase in line with Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rather than the Retail Prices Index (RPI). This decision was 
announced to the members of the scheme in July 2011. The past service gain has been recognised as an exceptional item in the Consolidated Income Statement.

2011 final dividend 
The directors have recommended a final dividend of 25.8p per share, for the  
52 weeks ended 30 December 2011. Payment of this dividend is subject to 
approval at the 2012 annual general meeting. Key dates relating to this dividend  
are given below:
Ex dividend date  2 May 2012
Record date  4 May 2012
Final day for receipt of DRIP elections  11 May 2012
Annual general meeting   9 May 2012
Payment date  1 June 2012
Investor Centre
You can choose to receive your dividend in a number of ways. Dividends will 
automatically be paid to you by cheque and sent to your registered address unless 
you have chosen one of the options below:
1.  Direct payment to your bank: Cash dividends can be paid directly to a UK bank 
or building society account. This is more convenient and helps reduce the risk  
of cheques becoming lost or delayed in the post. The associated tax voucher  
will still be sent direct to your registered address. To switch to this method  
of payment you can apply online at Computershare’s secure website  
www.investorcentre.co.uk or download a dividend mandate form from  
the FAQ section of the Company’s website (www.weir.co.uk), under 
‘Shareholder Information’ in the ‘Investor’ section. Alternatively, you can  
contact Computershare on 0870 707 1402, who will also be able to assist  
with any questions you may have.
2.  Global payment service: If you live overseas, Computershare offers a  
Global Payment Service which is available in certain countries. This may 
make it possible to receive dividends direct into your bank account in your 
local currency*. This can be set up at www.investorcentre.co.uk or contact 
Computershare.
3.  Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP): The Company offers shareholders the 
opportunity to join the Computershare regulated DRIP to use their dividend to 
purchase further Weir Group shares. Instead of receiving cash, shareholders 
receive as many whole shares as can be bought with their dividend, taking into 
account related purchase costs. Any residual cash will be carried forward and 
added to their next dividend.
* Please note that a payment charge would be deducted from each individual payment before conversion into your local currency. 
Consolidated tax vouchers
Starting in June 2012, the Company will adopt the Consolidated Tax Voucher 
(CTV) process in relation to future dividend payments. This means that rather than 
shareholders receiving a separate tax voucher for each dividend payment made 
they will receive a CTV once a year, detailing all payments made throughout that 
year. The first CTV will be dispatched with the November 2012 dividend mailing to 
shareholders and contain the tax and payment information for dividends paid during 
the tax year 2011/2012.
Investor Centre
Investor Centre is a free, secure share management website provided by 
Computershare. This service allows you to view your share portfolio and see 
the latest market price of your shares, check your dividend payment and tax 
information, change your address, update payment instructions and receive your 
shareholder communications online. To take advantage of this service, please log in 
at www.investorcentre.co.uk and enter your Shareholder Reference Number (SRN) 
and Company Code WEP. This information can be found on your share certificate 
or dividend tax voucher.
Capital gains tax
For the purpose of capital gains tax, the market value of an ordinary share of  
The Weir Group PLC as at 31 March 1982 was 29.75p. This market value has  
been adjusted to take account of the sub-division of the share capital whereby each 
ordinary share of 25p was sub-divided into two ordinary shares of 12.5p each on 
28 June 1993. Rights issues of ordinary shares took place in April 1987 at 157p per 
share on the basis of one new ordinary share for every seven ordinary shares held, 
in July 1990 at 250p per share on the basis of one new ordinary share for every five 
ordinary shares held and in September 1994 at 252p per share on the basis of one 
new ordinary share for every four ordinary shares held.

Communications
Annual and interim reports
The Weir Group publishes an annual and interim report every year. The annual 
report is sent to all shareholders who have elected to receive a hard copy through 
the post as a printed document unless the shareholder has chosen to receive 
e-communications (see below). The interim report is published on the Company’s 
website and a printed copy is available from the Company Secretary on request. 
E-communications
The Company offers shareholders the opportunity to access shareholder 
documents, such as annual reports and notices of AGM, via e-communications

In order to do this, you will need your SRN which can be found on your share

address. We will then be able to notify you by email as soon as shareholder 
documents are available on the Company’s website.
Corporate website
Shareholders are encouraged to visit the Company’s corporate website  
(www.weir.co.uk), which contains a wealth of information about the Weir Group.
The website includes information about the markets in which we operate, our 
strategy and business performance, recent news from the Group and product 
information. The Investor section is a key tool for shareholders with information on 
the share price, our financial results, shareholder meetings and dividends, as well 
as a ‘Frequently asked questions’ section. You can also download current and past 
annual and interim reports.

Shareholder Alerts
Unsolicited investment advice and fraud
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received 
unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.  
These are typically from overseas ‘brokers’ who target shareholders offering  
to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares, generally  
in US or UK investments.
These callers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and their activities 
have resulted in considerable losses for some investors. It is not just the novice 
investor that has been deceived in this way; many of the victims have been 
successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very  
wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of  
free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
• Check that they are properly authorised (for example, in the UK by the FSA) 
before getting involved. You can check by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/register.
•  Any approach from such organisations should be reported to the FSA, as they 
also maintain a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are targeting, or have 
targeted, UK investors. This will assist the FSA to keep the list up to date and 
undertake other appropriate actions as considered necessary. The FSA can 
be contacted by completing an online form at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/
regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml.
• If calls persist, hang up.
Please note that if you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible  
to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

Market overview 
Capital expenditure in the mining sector 
increased as miners broke ground on a 
number of greenfield developments and 
brownfield expansions. Activity levels 
increased strongly in South America, 
Australia and Asia-Pacific, while promising 
progress was seen in North America, 
Africa, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. 
Activity levels in Western Europe remained 
low due to macro economic concerns in 
the region.
Sustained high oil prices supported 
increased investment and activity levels  
in the North American oil sands market.
Weir Minerals is the global leader in the 
provision of slurry handling equipment and 
associated spare parts for abrasive high 
wear applications. Mining and minerals 
constitutes the division’s largest sector  
but it has aligned product sales into niche 
markets, including oil sands. Products 
include pumps, hydrocyclones, valves, 
dewatering equipment, wear resistant 
linings, rubber products and  
screening machines. 
The division has a presence in the world’s 
key mining markets including South 
America, Australia, Asia-Pacific,  
Africa and North America.

Market overview 
The North American upstream market 
experienced a second year of rapid growth, 
underpinned by increased horizontal drilling 
of oil and liquids rich shale formations. 
Average US horizontal rig count, a leading 
indicator of upstream pressure pumping 
demand, increased 22% on 2010, while 
greater operating efficiency resulted in  
an estimated 32% increase in horizontal 
wells drilled. 
Middle East services markets benefited 
from oilfield development in Iraq and Saudi 
Arabia while downstream markets continue 
to be challenging.
Weir Oil & Gas designs and manufactures 
pumps and ancillary equipment and 
provides aftermarket service and support 
activities principally for the upstream oil and 
gas markets. The acquisitions of Seaboard 
and Novatech expand the division’s 
conventional and unconventional upstream 
equipment product portfolio to include 
high-pressure wellhead equipment and a 
broadened range of aftermarket pressure-
pump expendable components.
The downstream business occupies 
a niche position in the design and 
manufacture of centrifugal pumps for 
the refining industry. The division’s main 
operations are in North America, Europe 
and the Middle East with an expanding 
footprint in Asia-Pacific and South America.

Market overview 
The global nuclear market, active in the  
early part of the year, slowed following the 
Fukushima reactor incident. Demand for 
original equipment and spares across 
European and US thermal power markets 
remained subdued although growth 
continued in emerging markets, particularly 
India. Activity picked up in the oil and gas 
markets with good project activity in the 
Middle East and Asia-Pacific. The North 
American hydro power market saw good 
levels of activity. While renewables markets 
remained challenging in Europe, a number  
of opportunities have emerged across South 
America and Africa. General industrial and 
municipal markets remained subdued while 
unrest in Libya led to the cessation of all 
project activity in February 2011.
Weir Power & Industrial designs and 
manufactures valves, pumps and turbines  
as well as providing specialist and support 
services to the global power generation, 
industrial and oil and gas sectors.  
The division has locations in Europe,  
the Middle East, North America, India,  
China, Asia-Pacific and South Africa. 
The division’s capability in emerging  
markets was strengthened in 2011 with the 
acquisition of a majority stake in HIM Tech,  
a valves manufacturer in South Korea.
